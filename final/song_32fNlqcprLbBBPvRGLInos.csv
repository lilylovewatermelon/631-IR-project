i knew the minute that i picked you up
it was gonna be a wild ride
you kissed me like you couldnt get enough
barely made it out of your drive
burn a little rubber at the red light
got a little warning from the blue lights
its only going nine oclock but feels more like midnight

chorus
we aint even turned up the radio
aint been two miles down the road
the way you look at me baby i dont know
if we even gonna make it to the party
yeah we gotta whole lot of moonlight left
already having the time of my lives
and were just getting started tonight

verse 2
girl you already got the window down
and you got your seat laid back
i aint even made it halfway to town
and youre already talking about a six pack
already got your shoes off
and you talking about slipping off
no we aint even found your friends saying
you already wanna get lost
see jason aldean liveget tickets as low as 41you might also likechorus
we aint even turned up the radio
aint been two miles down the road
the way you look at me baby i dont know
if we even gonna make it to the party
yeah we gotta whole lot of moonlight left
already having the time of my lives
and were just getting started tonight

bridge
aint had a drink and im tore up
aint even had a taste of your love
but girl the crazy thing is
were just getting warmed up

chorus
we aint even turned up the radio
aint been two miles down the road
the way you look at me baby i dont know
if we even gonna make it to the party
yeah we gotta whole lot of moonlight left
already having the time of my lives
and were just getting started tonight
and were just getting started tonight3embed"
