heart beatin my mind racin up
you can hear the screams and sirens in the cut
how did the trap fold up
see a copper gotta drop him
thats why i got the 9 in my pocket for
gotta drop him fore he kickin down the door
for some christian dior we was bout to send a hunnid packs through your neighborhood
if he could trap i knew my baby would
i never knew i would have to face the music
i know they gon bum rush us
we gotta keep on movin i got introduced to slangin and i keep on choosin it
i see the helicopters movin in
i thought if you took a loss you just lose to win
crawlin on the floor tryna get the dope
flush it down the toilet fore they get me with the four
they did a whole sweep couldnt even go to sleep
a lot of my family members got got
my uncle looked the police in his eyes and he got shot
tell me how that make you feel fake or real
im about to chase a bil fuck a million
she wanna ride my dick like a stallion
she just wanna pop a x like malcolm
i got family thats addicts i got family thats drug dealers
i got family thats murderers i got family that love niggas
and family important you just gotta embrace it
like your dope could be potent it just depend what you make it with
i was watchin family guy when the police raided hmm
a trap full of juggernaut suits that shit was crazy damn
how ima have my baby if im stuck in the feds at 19 with 25 and a day
