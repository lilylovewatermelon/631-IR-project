hey im kinda glad you didnt pick up
i kinda just called to hear your voice so
your voice recording was enough
ugh i should hang up what am i doing um
so uh i feel kinda dumb but uh
i miss you ive been thinking about you
ive been thinking about our love and how much i miss your touch
i miss being around you hearing your laugh and holding your hand
i think of you every day
i hope and i wish that youre doing okay
i want us to go back to the old days
because i miss you and i just thought of you so i thought id call you
to tell you that you crossed my mind and i took that as a sign that i should call and say hi
so thats all hi
i hope you dont think ive lost my mind i hope you dont think im crazy

the idea of you listening to this the thought of you on the other side of the line
