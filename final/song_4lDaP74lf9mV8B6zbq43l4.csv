jessie says shes been here for a thousand days
a thousand days to her that just dont mean a thing
because the city makes a perfect place to sleep
and daddys coming home he said he brought her things
like jewels from every coast and songs for them to sing
but singing never got her very far
and this whole coast is full of pinup paper rock stars

chorus
she says shell run until her feet dont touch the ground
and as the waves carry me out
well keep listening shell never make a sound
so keep it coming and the details quiet
shes like a ghost that keeps you up all night
and shell be a secret you can keep keep me

verse 2
cuts on paper hearts they can be awful deep
rips from wear and tear on different city streets
they dont all need a home but just a place to sleep

chorus
so i will run until my feet dont touch the ground
and as the waves carry me out
well keep listening shell never make a sound
so keep it coming and the details quiet
shes like a ghost that keeps you up all night
and shell be a secret you can keep keep me
see mayday parade liveget tickets as low as 96you might also likebridge
and soon shell find that every time she runs she leaves behind
another piece of her on every city street
so i will run until my feet dont touch the ground
and as the waves carry me out keep listening

chorus
so i will run until my feet dont touch the ground
and as the waves carry me out
well keep listening shell never make a sound
so keep it coming and the details quiet
shes like a ghost that keeps you up all night
and shell be a secret you can keep keep me

outro
so keep it coming and the details quiet
shes like a ghost that keeps you up all night
and shell be a secret you can keep keep meembed"
