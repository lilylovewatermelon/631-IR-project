baby dont you be so mean
i try to keep my conversation clean
but youre the flyest thing ive seen
since i came up in here
youre a superstar my dear
i dont wanna waste your time
with no corny player lines
but girl if you dont mind
i will love to occupy
the space right by your side

chorus
girl can we chill
talk about leaving together sure we will
but just for now dont let my champagne spill on you
as you make your move
to the floor floor floor floor
girl can we chill
talk about leavin together sure we will
later ill do everything you want me to
making love to you
beg for more more more more

verse 2
shawty speakin honestly
i can picture you and me
bein ever so discreet
disappearing to the back of this club imagine that
baby dont get mad at me
no baby girl i was just playing
unless you really wanna go
youre in control just let me know
but right now my song is playing
lets take it to the floor

making love to you
beg for more more more more

then you decide if you want to
get to know me on a physical side

making love to you
