right now theres a redneck boy on a tractor
sweatin seven days a week
so you and me can drive five minutes in the ac
to get the groceries
and theres a compton girl in blue with a badge
took an oath to protect her fellow man
every day of her life on the line
so we can all sleep better at night

prechorus
so quick to judgement arent we
forgetting everybody

verse 2
pretend just a minute when youre on your phone
safe behind your screen
what youre typin is to yourself
and the whole world is gonna see
whats in your head what youre about to say
might be a second thought to you
but once you throw that stone
you never know what kind of damage youre about to do
