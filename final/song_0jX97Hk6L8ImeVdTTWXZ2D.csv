 wants to make contact 
it’s been 72 hours since the crash
a fiery ball come clashing from the sky
reports still show no known survivors
nobody knows what to do we’re all freaking out here
there were other lifeforms in the ship
extraterrestrials
there’s aliens i’m telling you there’s aliens

verse 1 justin bieber
you said “i come in peace” so i took you home
i gave you food and i gave you clothes
i taught you how to move your feet when the rhythms on
still you wanna leave cause you feel alone

prechorus justin bieber
you don’t know what they’re like if they know that you’re alive
they’re gonna try to take away the secrets of your planets life
i know you must be upset you lost your family in a wreck
but you gotta listen

chorus justin bieber  hayley gene penner
don’t try to find your spaceship
they might be out there waiting
stay in my backpack forever
stay in my backpack forever
you know i gotta find my spaceship
my planet’s outside there waiting
i can’t stay in your backpack forever
stay in your backpack
you might also likeverse 2 justin bieber
before you came around i was in a rut
didn’t have a friend didn’t know what it was
you taught me how to dream and how to love
you’re my best friend please listen to me

prechorus justin bieber
you don’t know what they’re like if they know that you’re alive
they’re gonna try to take away the secrets of your planets life
i know you must be upset you lost your family in a wreck
but you gotta listen

chorus justin bieber  hayley gene penner
don’t try to find your spaceship
they might be out there waiting
stay in my backpack forever
stay in my backpack forever
you know i gotta find my spaceship
my planet’s outside there waiting
i can’t stay in your backpack forever
stay in your backpack

verse 3 lil wayne
greetings i fell from the sky
i’m from a different world i use lil wayne as a disguise
and our flying saucer crashed i’m the only one that survived
i’ve only taken over this planet since i arrived
i’m in a backpack i’m ducking men in black
yeah i’m an alien my swag is outta this world
different galaxy they try to capture me
when i die they gonna name this planet after me
wayne’s world
bridge news reporters
reports from witnesses flooded into the police station
sounds like something out of a movie
after 
first of all the object is lying here
there were other lifeforms in the ship
ufo 
nobody knows what to do we’re all freaking out here
we found this but no one can identify it
there’s aliens i’m telling you there’s aliens

chorus justin bieber  hayley gene penner
don’t try to find your spaceship
they might be out there waiting
stay in my backpack forever
stay in my backpack forever
you know i gotta find my spaceship
my planet’s outside there waiting
i can’t stay in your backpack forever
stay in your backpack

outro justin bieber  nasri
in our planet we dont kill one another
we dont take love for granted
its a gift from the mother and
in your planet you are filled with greed and false belief
we came here to bring you peace81embed"
