i feel like this wont go away
no matter how hard i try to
squeeze my eyes shut so i cant see
the pain in you this pain in me in me

chorus
everything that i can say to you
wont help you
everything you need is right in front of you
just take it

verse 2
i know that im really not here
to represent what im not clear
about in my head
sometimes i feel fucked up just like you do like you do

chorus
but everything that i can say to you
wont help you
everything you need is right in front of you
just take it

postchorus
try to make it through the daily pain
that you feel
maybe tomorrow wont be so bad
i know it
see staind liveget tickets as low as 41you might also likebridge
cause i once felt that way
nothing i could say
made it go away
i lived through this i still feel this
i just live for my tomorrow

outro
just make it go away
just make it go away
shell make it go away
shell make it go awayembed"
