i felt picture perfect
on and off the shelf to a broken frame of mind
a broken frame of mind
it comes back and haunts me
a bullet undercover
it fooled me every time
fooled me every time

prechorus
but even if i lose it all
ive got so much left to give
i wont give up no no
my hearts on the frontline
im not afraid

chorus
i will love you like ive never been hurt
run through fire for you like ive never been burned
im gonna risk it all like ive never lost
gonna give it all ive got
i will love you
i will love like ive never been hurt
never been hurt

verse 2
you set fire to ashes
you fought through the darkness and brought me back to life
you brought me back to life
