and now im ready to go
im sick of hanging out and now im ready to go
i told you that our friendship couldnt handle much more
but then you went behind my back to settle the score

chorus
so goodbye
farewell
go fuck your mother
go fuck yourself

verse 2
ah
and so i walk out the door
your insults dont affect me with my favorite coat on
i know my hair looked good in the bathroom at the bar
turns out i left my wallet at the bathroom bar

chorus
thats life
thats death
your girlfriend scares me
shes got bad breath

outro
uh
take off my shirt and socks im ready to go
wash out my hair dye and im ready to go
remove my shirt and tie im ready to go
undrеss you with my eyes im ready to go
i mеasure up to you im ready to go
i smoked my cigarettes im ready to go
my eyes are dry as hell im ready to go
my back is giving out im ready to go
i need to walk my dog im ready to go
my dogs expecting me im ready to go
i hate this temperature im ready to go
this music sucks to me im ready to go oh uh yeah
these people stress me out im ready to go
im growing quite unwell im ready to go
i hate this city yes im ready to go oh no
i never liked it i belong on the road
