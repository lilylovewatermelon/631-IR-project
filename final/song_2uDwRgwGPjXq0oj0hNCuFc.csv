once upon a time
i was of the mind
to lay your burden down
and leave you where you stood
you believed i could
youd seen it done before
i could read your thoughts
and tell you what you saw
and never say a word
but now all that is gone
over with and done
never to return

chorus
and i can tell you why
people die alone
i can tell you im
a shadow on the sun

verse 2
staring at the loss
looking for the cause
and never really sure
nothing but a hole
to live without a soul
and nothing to be learned
you might also likechorus
and i can tell you why
people go insane
i can show you how
you could do the same
i can tell you why
the end will never come
i can tell you im
a shadow on the sun

verse 3
shapes of every size
move behind my eyes
doors inside my head
bolted from within
every drop of flame
lights a candle in
memory of the one
who lived inside my skin

chorus
and i can tell you why
people go insane
i can show you how
you could do the same
i can tell you why
the end will never come
i can tell you im
the shadow on the sun
outro
shadow on the sun
shadow on the sun
shadow on the sun
shadow on the sun
shadow on the sun
shadow on the sun
shadow on the sun
shadow on the sun
