and heres a few snakeass niggas to bite you
and i dont even wanna hear bout what niggas might do

since the tight jeans they aint never liked you
pinkass polos with a fuckin backpack
but everybody know you brought real rap back
nobody had swag man we the rat pack

monop in this bitch again changed the climate
hop in this bitch to give saint the garment
until the day i get struck by lightning

hurry up with my damn croissants
