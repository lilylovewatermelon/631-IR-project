bom bom bom bom bomoh

verse 1
like a honeybee beating on my screen door
i got a little buzz and my head is sore
and from my bed i can feel the sun
lord i hear the morning come

prechorus
just a creeping
creeping creeping creeping

verse 2
you shot outta hell like a bullet from a gun
a flip of a switch
a thief on the run
and since the day you left me baby
i can feel the lonely
i can hear the crazy

prechorus
just a creeping
creeping creeping creeping
see eric church liveget tickets as low as 200you might also likechorus
head for the future
run from the past
hide from the mirror
and live in a glass
what dreams forget the whiskey remembers
kinda like molasses in late december

prechorus
just a creeping
creeping creeping creeping

verse 3
album version your cocaine kiss and caffeine love
music video version your caffeine kiss and nicotine love
got under my skin and into my blood
that need you back comes over me
like ivy crawling up a hickory tree

prechorus
just a creeping
creeping creeping creeping

chorus
head to the future
run from the past
hide from the mirror
and live in a glass
what dreams forget the whiskey remembers
kinda like molasses in late december
chorus
just a creeping
creeping creeping creeping

outro
break it down down down down
just last night i saw the light
at the end of that tunnel on the other side
thought i found my way outta this pain
only to find your memory train
creeping creeping creeping creeping

outro
bom bom bom bomoh
