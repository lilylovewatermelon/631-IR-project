i watch how the moon sits in the sky in the dark night
shining with the light from the sun
the sun doesnt give light to the moon assuming
the moons gonna owe it one
it makes me think of how you act to me
you do favors then rapidly
you just turn around and start askin me about
things that you want back from me

prechorus mike shinoda
im sick of the tension sick of the hunger
sick of you actin like i owe you this
find another place to feed your greed
while i find a place to rest

chorus chester bennington  mike shinoda
i wanna be in another place
i hate when you say you dont understand
youll see its not meant to be
i wanna be in the energy not with the enemy
a place for my head

verse 2 mike shinoda
maybe someday ill be just like you and
step on people like you do and
run away all the people i thought i knew
i remember back then who you were
you used to be calm used to be strong
used to be generous but you shoulda known
that youd wear out your welcome and now you see
how quiet it is all alone
