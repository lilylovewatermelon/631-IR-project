what a skeletal wreck of man this is
translucent flesh and feeble bones
the kind of temple where the whores and villains
try to tempt the holistic tomes
running rampant with free thought to free form in the free and clear
and the matters at hand are shelled out like lint at a laundromat
to sift and focus on the bigger better now

we all have a little sin that needs venting virtues for the rending
and laws and systems and stems a rift from branches of office
do you know what your post entails
do you serve a purpose or purposely serve
wind down inside your atavistic allure
the value of a summer spent
and a winter earned

for the rest of us there is always sunday
the day of the week that reeks of rest
but all we do is catch our breath
so we can wade naked into the bloody pool
and place our hand on the big black book
to watch the knives zigzag between our aching fingers

a vacation is a countdown
tminus your life and counting
time to drag your tongue across the sugar cube and hope you get a taste
what the fuck is all this for
what the hells goin on
shut up
i could go on and on but lets move on shall we
say youre me and im you and they all watch the things we do
and like a smack of spite they threw me down the stairs
havent felt like this in years
the great magnet of malicious magnanimous refuse
let me go and plunge me into the dead spot again
thats where you go when theres no one else around
its just you and there was never anyone to begin with now was there

sanctimonious pretentious dastardly bastards
with their thumb on the pulse and a finger on the trigger
classified my ass thats a fucking secret and you know it
government is another way to say better than you
its like ice but no pick a murder charge that wont stick
its like a whole other world where you can smell the food
but you cant touch the silverware

breakdown
ha what luck
fascism you can vote for
isnt that sweet

and were all going to die someday cause thats the american way
and ive drunk too much and said too little
when youre gaffer taped in the middle say a prayer save face
get yourself together and
see whats happening
shut up
fuck you
fuck you

im sorry i could go on and on but its time to move on so
remember youre a wreck an accident
forget the freak youre just nature
keep the gun oiled and the temple clean
shit snort and blaspheme
let the heads cool and the engine run
because in the end everything we do is just everything weve done1embed"
