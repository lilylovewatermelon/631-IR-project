i got your voicemail again seemed like you were busy
so i tried to hide all the disappointment in the message i left behind
if only i could be that ignorant girl for a couple more hours or so
but i got a call soon after that you died

verse 2
what a beautiful night i wish you were here to see it
wed sit on the porch and laugh about the things that we said wrong
and i would forgive you for all the tears
and years we missed out on
as we count all the leaves of autumn as they fall

chorus
i don’t wanna cry cause it doesnt help
no it won’t bring you back to me any sooner sooner
we always think we got time
but theres no time before its over
and its over
honest honest
we always think we got time but theres no time if were honest
if im honest

verse 3
i cant imagine the pain that you felt to get here
and all of the blame that you put on yourself that no one could ever see
but i wouldn’t be who i turned out to be
without the brother you were to me
and i took a walk with mary she’ll be fine
you might also likechorus
i dont wanna cry ’cause it doesnt help
no it wont bring you back to me any sooner sooner
we always think we got time
but theres no time before it’s over
and its over
honest honest
we always think we got time
but theres no time if were honest
if im honest

bridge
i always thought wed fix things in our forties or so
i never imagined that id be the only one getting old
yeah i like to think if i hadve known there were only some hours left
before you were gone forever
i wouldve called you back sooner
