verse 1
i know what youre thinkin
we were goin down
i can feel the sinkin
but then i came around
and everyone ive loved before
flashed before my eyes
and nothin mattered anymore
i looked into the sky

prechorus
well i wanted somethin better man
i wished for somethin new
and i wanted somethin beautiful
i wish for somethin true
been lookin for a reason man
somethin to lose

chorus
when the wheels come down when the wheels come down
when the wheels touch ground when the wheels touch ground
and you feel like its all over theres another round for you
when the wheels come down when the wheels come down
see foo fighters liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likeverse 2
know your head is spinnin
broken hearts will mend
this is our beginnin
comin to an end

prechorus
well you wanted somethin better man
you wished for somethin new
well you wanted somethin beautiful
you wished for somethin true
been lookin for a reason man
somethin to lose

chorus
when the wheels come down when the wheels come down
when the wheels touch ground when the wheels touch ground
and you feel like its all over theres another round for you
when the wheels come down when the wheels come down

chorus
when the wheels come down when the wheels come down
when the wheels touch ground when the wheels touch ground

when the wheels touch ground when the wheels touch ground
and you feel like its all over theres another round for you
