levi jacket broken in just right
i left it on the bleachers that friday night
felt so cool in the stonewashed fade
theres just some things that cant be replaced
that runaround freedom summer 89
spinnin that bottle on a lot of first times
it was all summed up on a memorex mixtape
theres just some things that cant be replaced

chorus
woah it dont matter how hard you try
woah all the money in the world wont ever buy
what you miss what you want back
itd be nice but life dont work like that
you can get damn close but it wont ever be the same
theres just some things that cant be replaced
theres just some things that cant be replaced

verse 2
cinnamon hair and a heart of gold
chevy cavalier on an old backroad
a boone’s farm kiss that i still taste
theres just some things that cant be replaced

chorus
woah no matter how hard you try
woah all the money in the world wont ever buy
what you miss what you want back
itd be nice but life dont work like that
you can get damn close but it wont ever be the same
theres just some things that cant be replaced
theres just some things that cant be replaced
woah

for fifteen years right by my side
from a single man to three kids and a wife
friends come and go but when it comes to jake
theres just some things that cant be replaced

chorus
woah no matter how hard you try
woah all the money in the world wont ever buy
what you miss what you want back
itd be nice but life dont work like that
you can get damn close but it wont ever be the same
theres just some things that cant be replaced
theres just some things that cant be replaced
