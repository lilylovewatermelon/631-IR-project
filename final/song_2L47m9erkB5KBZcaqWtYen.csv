intro
stadium status
chorus
my big brother was bigs brother
used to be dame and biggs brother
who was hip hop brother who was no id friend
no id my mentor now let the story begin

verse 1
its the hard knock life tour sellout
picture us in the mall coppin iceberg and yell out jigga
yeah thats what well yell out yell out
you know the name do i gotta spell out or tell bout
jay and ye so shy
that he wont even step to his idol to say hi
standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
back of my mind he could change your life
with all these beats i did at least let him hear it
at least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig
but he got me out my momma crib
then he help me get my momma a crib

chorus
big brother was bigs brother
used to be dame and biggs brother
who was hip hop brother who was no id friend
no id my mentor now let the story begin begin
let the story begin
if you feel the way i feel why dont you wave your hands
see kanye west liveget tickets as low as 122you might also likeverse 2
fresh off the plane im off to baseline
nothing handed out im bout to take mine
round the same time of that blueprint 1
and these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
id play my little songs in that old back room
hed bob his head and say damn oh thats you
but by the black album i was blacking out
partyin sobs and we had packed a crowd
big brother got his show up at madison square
and im like yeah yeah we gon be there but
not only did i not get a chance to spit it
carline told me i could buy two tickets
i guess big brother was thinkin a little different
and kept little brother at bay at a distance
but everything that i felt was more bogus
only made me more focused only wrote more potent
only thing i wanna know is why i get looked over
i guess ill understand when i get more older
big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
now im on the top and everybody on the scrotum

chorus
my big brother was bigs brother
used to be dame and biggs brother
who was hip hop brother who was no id friend
no id my mentor now let the story begin begin
let the story begin
if you feel the way i feel why dont you wave your hands
verse 3
have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant
not only a client the presidito hola hovito
the game gettin foul so heres a free throw
i was always on the other side of the peephole
then i dropped jesus walks now im on the steeple
and we know new jack city—got to keep my brother
but to be number one ima beat my brother
on that diamonds remix i swore i spazzed
then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
sibling rivalry only i could see
it was the pride in me that was drivin me
at the grammys i said i inspired me
but my big brother who i always tried to be
when i kicked a flow it was like pickandroll
cause even if he gave me the rock its giveandgo
i guess beanies style was more of a slam dunk
and my shit was more like a finger roll
but i had them singles though
and them hoes at the show gonna mingle yo heh yall know
i told jay i did a song with coldplay
next thing i know he got a song with coldplay
back in my mind im like damn no way
translate español no way josé
then i went and told jay brown
shoulda known that was gon come back around
shoulda talked to you like a man shoulda told you first
but i told somebody else and thats what made shit worse
bridge
my big brother was bigs brother
so heres a few words from ya kid brother
if you admire somebody you should go on head tell em
people never get the flowers while they can still smell em
a idol in my eyes god of the game
heart of the city rocafella chain
never be the same never be another
number one young hov also my big brother

chorus
my big brother was bigs brother
used to be dame and biggs brother
who was hip hop brother who was no id friend
no id my mentor and thats where the story ends
outro
toomp killed this shit61embed"
