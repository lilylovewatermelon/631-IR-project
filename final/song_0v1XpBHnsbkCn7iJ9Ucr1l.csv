this aint a song for the brokenhearted woah oh woah oh oh
no silent prayer for the faithdeparted
i aint gonna be just a face in the crowd
youre gonna hear my voice when i shout it out loud

chorus

i aint gonna live forever
i just want to live while im alive
its my life my heart is like an open highway
like frankie said i did it my way
i just wanna live while im alive
its my life

this is for the ones who stood their ground
for tommy and gina who never backed down
tomorrows getting harder make no mistake
luck aint even lucky got to make your own breaks
