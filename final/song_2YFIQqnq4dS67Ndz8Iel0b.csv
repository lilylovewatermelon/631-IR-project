tminus 90 seconds and counting
sound suppression water system now being armed for release
we have three main engines ready for ignition
space shuttle now on internal power
liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen fill and draining valves are closed
saw the rocket booster flight data recorders are activated
30 seconds into the flight atlantas almost two miles in altitude
almost six miles downrange from the kennedy space center already traveling 500 miles an hour
one minute thirty seconds into the flight fifteen miles downrange traveling almost 2000 miles an hour
three good auxiliary power units three good fuel cells three good main engines
ten seconds away from summitrocket booster separation
nine eight seven six fiveâ€”three two one zero

ridin round smokin biscotti scotti
and i got ten different watches ice
which one im gon wear i got options options
my diamonds fightin they boxin heavyweight
smokin on cook in the cockpit cookie
my bitch is brown like foxy bad
