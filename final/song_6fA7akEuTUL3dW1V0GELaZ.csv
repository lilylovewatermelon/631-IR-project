and if i fall along the way
pick me up and dust me off
and if i get too tired to make it
be my breath so i can walk
and if i need some other love then
give me more than i can stand
and when my smile gets old and faded
wait around ill smile again

prechorus
shouldnt be so complicated
just hold me and then
oh just hold me again

chorus
can you help me im bent
im so scared that ill never
get put back together
keep breaking me in
and this is how we will end
with you and me bent

verse 2
and if i couldnt sleep could you sleep
could you paint me better off
and could you sympathize with my needs
