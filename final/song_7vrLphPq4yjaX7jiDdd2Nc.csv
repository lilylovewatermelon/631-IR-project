dig bury me underneath
everything that i am rearranging
dig bury me underneath
everything that i was slowly changing

i would love to beat the face

teething on concrete
gums bleeding

let me help you tie the rope around your neck
let me help to talk you the wrong way off the ledge
let me help you hold the glock against your head
let me help you tie the rope around your neck
let me help to talk you the wrong way off the ledge
let me help you hold the glock against your head
let me help to chain the weights onto your legs
get on the plank fuck
chorus

everything that i am rearranging
dig bury me underneath
everything that i was slowly changing

wish you were committing suicide
suckin on a motherfuckin tailpipe
dead man walking on a tight rope
limbless in the middle of a channel
