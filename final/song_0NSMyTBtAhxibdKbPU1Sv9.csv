it ticks just like a timex
it never lets up on you
who said life was easy
the job is never through
itll run us till were ragged
itll harden our hearts
and love could use a day of rest
before we both start falling apart

chorus
pray that its raining on sunday
storming like crazy
well hide under the covers all afternoon
baby whatever comes monday
can take care of itself
because we got better things that we could do
when its raining on sunday

verse 2
your love is like religion
a cross in mexico
and your kiss is like the innocence
of a prayer nailed to a door
oh surrender in much sweeter
when we both let it go
let the water wash our bodies clean
and love wash our souls

pray that its raining on sunday
stormin like crazy
well hide under the covers all afternoon
baby whatever comes monday
can take care of itself
because we got better things that we could do
when its raining on sunday
when its raining on sunday
when its raining on sunday
let it rain
pray that its raining on sunday
stormin like crazy
well hide under the covers all afternoon
baby whatever comes monday
can take care of itself
because we got better things that we could do
when its raining on sunday
when its raining on sunday
when its raining on sunday
let it rainembed"
