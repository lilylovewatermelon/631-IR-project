i walked alone on the beach
where we always used to go
when we couldnt hook up at home

i thought of you
and the time we jumped the fence
both sides ripped down
we dove right in
and the cops chased us again

when you were mine
you know

we had it all in front of us
you were the one
i was in love
but you always hurt
the one you lost
i couldnt get enough

you were everything
thats bad for me
make no apologies
im crushed
black and blue
but you know
id do it all again for you
you might also liketoday dressed up
in designer drugs
dedicated to the one
ill always love
the one who really messed me up

i let you take the wheel
and the drivers seat
strapped in
so you get the best of me
now whats left are the memories

when you were mine
you know

chorus

i am standing in the ocean rain
rough and ready
for your deadly game
ive got nowhere else to go

chorus

you know id do it all again for you
i swear id do it all again for youembed"
