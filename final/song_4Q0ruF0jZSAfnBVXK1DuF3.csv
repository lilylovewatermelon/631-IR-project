in my bed on my phone
locked away free to go
tv on every night
scrolling on

chorus
on and on and on and on
scrolling on and on and on
feed the algorithm some
on and on and on and on

verse 2
i saw the news watched a clip
powered down then it hit
what is real what is fake
it must be fake

chorus
on and on and on and on
scrolling on and on and on
feed the algorithm some
on and on
wait

bridge
your family is in our thoughts
our heart goes out to you
say a prayer light a digital candle and then scroll away
something is about to break
the fault line has been fractured
maybe its not too late
to learn how to love each other
whats it gonna take to change it
dont you wanna save this planet
blame it on manipulation were human after all
something is about to break
the fault line has been fractured
maybe its not too late
to learn how to love each other
whats it gonna take to change it
dont you wanna save this planet
blame it on manipulation were human after all
im sick and tired of the same old world reaction
you might also likeinterlude
its just you and me now ah

verse 3
in my phone its my world
i see the future sitting in my hand
take a break go to bed
mind is racing baby now im back
baby now im back

chorus
on and on and on and on
scrolling on and on and on quit scrolling
feed the algorithm some
on and on and on and on and it feels so good
on and on and on and on and it feels so right
scrolling on and on and on to be up at night
feed the algorithm some with you
on and on and on and on

outro
and on and on and on
and on and on and on2embed"
