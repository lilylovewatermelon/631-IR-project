down they fell like the tower
as the land relinquished her ghost

heed the sirens take shelter my lover
flee the fire that devours
but the sight held me fixed
like a bayonet against my throat

nor did raids make me cower
but his translucent skin
made me shiver deep within my bones

with a crooked smile
and i knew it was my time

it was the raging storm
of a foreign war
and a face id seen beforeyou might also like1embed"
