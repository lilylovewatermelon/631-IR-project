yeah
i hate when i hate when people say they feel me man
i hate that shit
itll be a long time before yall feel me
if ever
for real

verse 1 drake
you wont feel me til everybody say they love you but its not love
and your suit is oxblood
and the girl you fuckin hates you and your friends faded off shots of
what you ordered to forget about the game that you on top of
your famous girlfriend ass keep gettin thicker than the plot does
and when you forget her thats when she pop up
and you got a drop but you ride around with the top up
or get three suvs for niggas dressed like refugees
and deal with the questions about all your excessive needs
and you do dinners at french laundry in napa valley
scallops and glasses of dolce that shit right up your alley
yeah you see a girl and you ask about her
bitches smiling at you it must be happy hour
they put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down
its feeling like you own every place you choose to be at now
walking through airport security with your hat down
stead of gettin a patdown they just keep on sayin that they feel you nigga yeah
its been too long
been way too long

verse 2 drake
you wont feel me til you want it so bad you tell yourself youre in it
and tell the world around you that your paperwork is finished
and steal your mothers debit card so you maintain an image
and ride around in overpriced rental cars that aint tinted
you need a minute you got it
you know its real when your latest nights are your greatest nights
the sun is up when you get home thats just a way of life
apartment 1503 some couches and paintings
where you record with two others that want the same things
yeah it start to feel better than home feels
and so you up there every night you swear you gettin close
that champagne money was for gas and phone bills
but shit you bout to spend it on what matters most
you drop a couple songs in hopes that you could be the nigga
and come out every night to let the city see they nigga
tellin stories that nobody relate to
and even though they hate you
they just keep on tellin you they feel you nigga
yeah
its been too long man
chorus the weeknd  drake

verse 3 drake
i havent been inside terminal 1 and 3 in so long
im drivin right up to it now make sure you got your coat on
that runway can be cold especially after summers rolled on
and all you knew is alcohol and city lights and slow songs
for four months out the year its got you asking whats good at home
whats good at home
the same hoes are still at it i shouldve known
my young niggas poppin ms and sippin dirty jones
problem children that all be reppin octobers own
brand new girl and she still growin
brand new titties stitches still showin
yeah and she just prayin that it heals good
im bout to fuck and im just prayin that it feels good
i really dont know much but shit i know a secret
they say more money more problems my nigga dont believe it
i mean sure theres some bills and taxes im still evadin
but i blew six million on myself and i feel amazin
young moneymaker seasonticket holder
season switching over
i come through them bitches still scorchin as if i didnt notice
you niggas gettin older i see no threat in yoda
im out here messing over the lives of these niggas that couldnt fuck with my freshman floater
look at that fuckin chip on your nephews shoulder
my sophomore i was all for it they all saw it
my junior and senior will only get meaner
take care nigga
