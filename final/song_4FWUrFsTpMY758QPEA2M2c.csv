i know that i surprised you coming home
its not my usual time of year
but ive got myself a problem and i know
that i might find the answer here

verse 2
remember when i was dads pride and joy and your little man
every time that i got hurt you were there to give a hand
youd pick me up and youd kiss my hurt away
remember what youd say
boy you are getting more like him each and every day

prechorus
can we have a talk like it was yesterday
your boy is back in trouble and he needs you right away

chorus
she says shes going to leave me mama
nothing on gods green earth would make her stay
i cant live without her mama
but this time you cant kiss the hurt away
but if im so much like my dad
there must have been times you felt her way
so tell me word for word what he said
that always made you stay

she says shes gonna leave me mama
but if im so much like my dad
there must have been times you felt her way
