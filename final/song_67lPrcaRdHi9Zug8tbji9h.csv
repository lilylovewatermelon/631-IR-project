whats going on in your world
i hope that youre doing fine
i just called to say theres not a day
that you dont cross my mind
i just wanted to see if you feel like me
sorry that we said goodbye
so whats going on in your world
it sure is lonesome in mine

chorus
just tell me that youre happy
and ill hang up the phone
just tell me you dont need me anymore
and ill leave you alone
i just wondered if you had somebody new
after all of this time
so whats going on in your world
it sure is lonesome in mine

chorus
just tell me that youre happy
and ill hang up the phone
just tell me you dont need me anymore
and ill leave you alone
i just wondered if you had somebody new
after all of this time
so whats going on in your world
it sure is lonesome in mine
