1 where on direct review of his conviction a state prisoners claim of federal constitutional right has been decided adversely to him by the state supreme court and an application to this court for certiorari has been denied he has satisfied the requirement of 28 usc § 2254 that state remedies be exhausted before a federal court may grant an application for habeas corpus pp 344 u s 446450

a it is not necessary in such circumstances that he pursue in the state courts a collateral remedy based on the same evidence and issues pp 344 u s 447450

b section 2254 is not to be construed as requiring repetitious applications to state courts for relief p 344 u s 448 n 3
2 a denial of certiorari by this court with no statement of reasons therefor to review a decision of a state supreme court affirming a conviction in a criminal prosecution should be given no weight by a federal court in passing upon the same petitioners application for a writ of habeas corpus  opinion of mr justice frankfurter stating the position of a majority of the court on this point pp 344 u s 489497

3 on a state prisoners application for habeas corpus on federal constitutional grounds the federal district court may take into consideration the proceedings and adjudications in the state trial and appellate courts pp 344 u s 457458

a where the state decision was based on an adequate state ground no further examination is required unless no state remedy for the deprivation of federal constitutional rights ever existed p 344 u s 458

b where there is material conflict of fact in the transcript of evidence as to deprivation of constitutional rights the district court

page 344 u s 444

may properly depend upon the states resolution of the issue p 344 u s 458

c in other circumstances the state adjudication carries the weight that federal practice gives to the conclusion of a court of last resort of another jurisdiction on federal constitutional issues although res judicata is not applicable p 344 u s 458

4 although in each of these cases the district court erroneously gave consideration to this courts prior denial of certiorari it affirmatively appears from the record that the error could not have affected the result and such error may be and is disregarded as harmless fedrules crimproc 52 pp 344 u s 458460

5 on the application of a state prisoner to a federal district court for habeas corpus when the records of the state trial and appellate courts are before the district court it is within the discretion of the district court whether to take evidence and hear argument on the federal constitutional issues and the action of the district court in not taking evidence or hearing argument in the case here involved was not an abuse of that discretion pp 344 u s 460465

6 in 28 us c §§ 2243 and 2244 the word entertain means a federal district courts conclusion after examination of the habeas corpus application with such accompanying papers as the court deems necessary that a hearing on the merits legal or factual is proper pp 344 u s 460461

7 in no 32 petitioner a negro was not denied due process or equal protection in violation of the fourteenth amendment by the method of selecting grand and petit juries from lists limited by state statute to taxpayers though the lists had a higher proportion of white than negro citizens pp 344 u s 466474

8 in no 32 petitioner was not denied due process by the admission in evidence against him of confessions not shown to have been coerced pp 344 u s 474476

9 in no 22 petitioner a negro did not show by clear evidence that in the selection of jurors which was actually made in his case there was discrimination based solely on race and petitioners conviction cannot be set aside on that ground as violative of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment the comparatively small number of names of negroes in the jury box was insufficient in itself to establish such discrimination pp 344 u s 477482
10 in no 20 the state supreme court had refused review on the merits of petitioners conviction and death sentence challenged on federal constitutional grounds because of petitioners failure to perfect their appeal within the 60day limit applicable under state

mr justice reed delivered the opinion of the court

certiorari was granted to review judgments of the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit brown v allen 343 us 903 speller v allen 342 us 953 daniels v allen 342 us 941 these cases

page 344 u s 447

were argued last year as the records raised serious federal constitutional questions upon which the carrying out of death sentences depended and procedural issues of importance in the relations between states and the federal government upon which there was disagreement in this court we decided to set the cases for reargument 343 us 973 we have now heard the cases again

the judgments of affirmance were entered october 12 1951 on appeal from three judgments of the united states district court for the eastern district of north carolina refusing writs of habeas corpus sought by prisoners convicted in that state we conclude that all required procedure for state review of the convictions had been exhausted by petitioners in each case before they sought the writs of habeas corpus in the federal courts in each case petitions for certiorari to this court for direct review of the state judgments rendered by the highest court of the state in the face of the same federal issues now presented by habeas corpus had been denied footnote 1

it is not necessary in such circumstances for the prisoner to ask the state for collateral relief based on the same evidence and issues already decided by direct review with another petition for certiorari directed to this court footnote 2 it is to be noted that an applicant is barred unless he has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the state    by any available procedure the legislative history shows that this paragraph in haec verba was presented to the congress with the recommendation of

page 344 u s 448

the judicial conference the legislative history of § 2254 has no discussion of the considerations which moved congressional enactment other than that contained in srepno 1559 but see a similar clause § 2254 in hr 3214 80th cong 1st sess hr 3214 80th cong 2d sess srepno 1559 80th cong 2d sess p 9 report of the judicial conferences of senior circuit judges 1947 pp 1720

the second paragraph of § 2254 has been construed by several courts of appeals in ekberg v mcgee 191 f2d 625 the ninth circuit refused to consider that the statute meant to deny a federal forum where state procedures were inexhaustible the third circuit in master v baldi 198 f2d 113 116 held that the exhaustion of one of several available alternative state remedies with this courts denial of certiorari therefrom is all that is necessary in bacom v sullivan 181 f2d 177 and bacom v sullivan 194 f2d 166 the fifth circuit ruled that when a federal question had been presented to the state courts by at least one postconviction procedure certiorari on the same question having been once denied by this court there appeared a unique and extraordinary circumstance justifying federal examination under darr v burford 339 u s 200 footnote 3

page 344 u s 449

when in april 1948 judge maris presented the judicial conference draft of § 2254 to the senate judiciary subcommittee the language of the revision of 28 usc on which the hearings were being held set out three bases for exercise of federal jurisdiction over applications for habeas corpus from state prisoners under the language of the bill as it then read an application might have been entertained where it appeared 1 that the applicant had exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the state or 2 where there was no adequate remedy available in such courts or 3 where such courts had denied the applicant a fair adjudication of the legality of his detention under the constitution and laws of the united states in accepting the recommendation of the judicial conference the congress eliminated the third basis of jurisdiction srepno 1559 p 9 shows the reason for this as follows

the second purpose is to eliminate as a ground of federal jurisdiction to review by habeas corpus judgments of state courts the proposition that the state court has denied a prisoner a fair adjudication of the legality of his detention under the constitution and laws of the united states the judicial conference believes that this would be an undesirable

page 344 u s 450

ground for federal jurisdiction in addition to exhaustion of state remedies or lack of adequate remedy in the state courts because it would permit proceedings in the federal court on this ground before the petitioner had exhausted his state remedies this ground would of course always be open to a petitioner to assert in the federal court after he had exhausted his state remedies or if he had no adequate state remedy

the third purpose is to substitute detailed and specific language for the phrase no adequate remedy available that phrase is not sufficiently specific and precise and its meaning should therefore be spelled out in more detail in the section as is done by the amendment

if the substitution for adequate remedy available of the present definition was intended by the congress to eliminate the right of a state prisoner to apply for relief by habeas corpus to the lower federal courts we do not think that the report would have suggested that a remedy for denial of a fair adjudication was in the federal court the suggested elimination of district and circuit courts does not square with the other statutory habeas corpus provisions see 28 usc §§ 2241 2242 2251 2252 2253 3d paragraph we are unwilling to conclude without a definite congressional direction that so radical a change was intended

in each of these cases the district court in determining the propriety of its granting the writ considered the effect of our refusal of certiorari on the same questions upon direct review of the judgments of the highest court of the state as that question pretermitted in our ruling in darr v burford 339 u s 200 339 u s 214217 a case where no certiorari was sought here from state denial of collateral relief by habeas corpus from imprisonment had given rise to definite differences of opinion in the federal

page 344 u s 451

courts a ruling here was necessary footnote 4 there is a similar difference in this court footnote 5 as other issues command a majority that upholds the judgments of the court of appeals this opinion is that of the court although it represents the minority view on the effect of our denial

page 344 u s 452

of certiorari the position of the majority upon that point is expressed by the opinion of mr justice frankfurter daniels v allen 344 u s 443 a summary review of habeas corpus practice in the federal courts in relation to state criminal convictions will be found in hawk v olson 326 u s 271 326 u s 274 and darr v burford 339 u s 200 339 u s 203 it is hoped the conclusions reached herein will result in the improvement of the administration of justice and leave the indispensable function of the great writ unimpaired in usefulness

ii
 effect of former proceedings

the effect to be given this courts former refusal of certiorari in these cases was presented to the district court which heard the applications for federal habeas corpus upon full records of the state proceedings in the trial and appellate courts in no 32 brown v allen the district court upon examination of the application the answer and the exhibits adopted without hearing argument or testimony the findings of the sentencing judge with respect to both the composition of the grand jury and the voluntary character of the confession these were the federal constitutional issues involved in the state trial the record which the district judge had before him embraced the record of the case in the north carolina courts and this court including all the relevant portions of the transcript of proceedings in the sentencing court the district court then dismissed the petition sub nom brown v crawford 98 fsupp 866

in no 22 speller v allen the petition for habeas corpus in the district court raised again the same federal question which had been passed upon by the trial and appellate

page 344 u s 453

courts in north carolina and which had been offered to this court on petition for certiorari towit the jury commissioners had pursuant to a long and continuous practice discriminated against negroes in the selection of juries solely on account of race andor color the district court had before it the record which had been filed in the supreme court of north carolina on appeal state v brown 233 nc 202 63 se2d 99 included in this record was the same transcript of proceedings in the trial court which had been before the state supreme court in addition the district court took further evidence by way of testimony and stipulation the district court upon examination of all the evidence and the stipulations adopted the findings of the sentencing judge with respect to the composition of the trial jury it added that petitioner failed to substantiate the charge that he did not have a trial according to due process    the court then vacated the writ and held that while the petition could be dismissed solely in the light of the procedural history there was the added alternative ground of failure to substantiate the charge sub nom speller v crawford 99 fsupp 92 97

in no 20 daniels v allen petitioners at the state trial made a timely motion to quash the indictment and challenged the array alleging discrimination against negroes in the selection of both grand and petit jurors in contravention of the guarantees of the fourteenth amendment timely objection was also made to admission in evidence of what were alleged to be coerced confessions petitioners contend that the admission of these confessions violated their due process rights under the fourteenth amendment they also urge that the refusal of the supreme court of north carolina to examine the merits of the trial record in the state courts because of their failure to serve a statement of the case on appeal until one day beyond the period of limitation is a denial of equal protection under the fourteenth amendment in their

page 344 u s 454

application to the district court petitioners repeated once again those federal constitutional questions which had earlier been presented to the sentencing court and the supreme court of north carolina and which had also been repeated in their petition for certiorari filed in this court

in examining the application the district court judge studied the records of the trial and appellate courts of north carolina including a transcript of the proceedings in the sentencing court he concluded that the findings of the judge of the sentencing court on the matter of whether the jury had been properly selected were supported by all the evidence and that it was not shown that there was a purposeful and systematic exclusion of negroes solely on account of race he also found that the trial judge correctly determined that the confessions were voluntary and that the instruction concerning the confessions was adequate in addition the district judge heard all evidence offered by the prosecution or defense

the district court judge did advert to the circumstance that this court had denied a petition for certiorari on the same questions and he further observed that to his mind the procedural history of the case did not make it appear that petitioners were denied the substance of a fair trial he added that petitioners failed to substantiate the charges made 99 fsupp at 216 the writ was vacated and the application dismissed on the procedural history the district court refused to entertain the request sub nom daniels v crawford 99 fsupp 208

the records of the former proceedings thus determined the action of the united states district court the fact that further evidence was heard in two of the cases was to assure the judge that the prisoners were not held in custody in violation of the constitution in dismissing these petitions for habeas corpus the district court did not treat our denial of certiorari as conclusive

page 344 u s 455

in the brown case the last one decided judge gilliam based his decision on this finding of fact

12 the facts found by the trial judge in respect to the composition of the grand jury are supported by the evidence before him and these findings and the conclusion thereon are adopted as findings in this respect and the facts found by that court in respect to the question of admission of statements made by the defendant are also supported by the evidence and these findings and the conclusions thereon are likewise adopted

98 fsupp 866 870 the court cited from stonebreaker v smyth 163 f2d 498 499 in support of the above statement that this is the proper rule

while action of the virginia courts and the denial of certiorari by the supreme court were not binding on the principle of res judicata they were matters entitled to respectful consideration by the court below and in the absence of some most unusual situation they were sufficient reason for that court to deny a further writ of habeas corpus

98 fsupp at 868

in the speller case the pith of his conclusion is stated as follows

the court now concludes that the writ should be vacated and the petition dismissed upon the procedural history and the record in the state courts for the reason that habeas corpus proceeding is not available to the petitioner for the purpose of raising the identical question passed upon in those courts

99 fsupp 92 95 to this was added the alternative ground of agreement with the conclusions of the sentencing court see pp 345 u s 452453 supra

page 344 u s 456

in the daniels case decided the same day the district court left open the question of its power to reexamine 99 fsupp at 213 and concluded on the record that the state had afforded a fair trial

a effect of denial of certiorari  in cases such as these a minority of this court is of the opinion that there is no reason why a district court should not give consideration to the record of the prior certiorari in this court and such weight to our denial as the district court feels the record justifies this is the view of the court of appeals 192 f2d 763 768 et seq speller v allen 192 f2d 477 this is we think the teaching of ex parte hawk 321 u s 114 321 u s 118 and white v ragen 324 u s 760 324 u s 764 324 u s 765 we have frequently said that the denial of certiorari imports no expression of opinion upon the merits of a case house v mayo 324 u s 42 324 u s 48 hamilton brown shoe co v wolf bros  co 240 u s 251 240 u s 258 cf ex parte abernathy 320 u s 219 when on review of proceedings no res judicata or precedential effect follows the result would be in accord with that expression that statement is satisfied but denial of certiorari marks final action on state criminal proceedings in fields other than habeas corpus with its unique opportunity for repetitious litigation as demonstrated in dorsey v gill 80 usappdc 9 148 f2d 857 see 7 frd 313 the denial would make the issues res judicata the minority thinks that where a record distinctly presenting a substantial federal constitutional question disentangled from problems of procedure is brought here by certiorari and denied courts dealing with the petitioners future applications for habeas corpus on the same issues presented in earlier applications for writs of certiorari to this court should have the power to take the denial into consideration in determining their action we indicated as much in house v mayo supra p 324 u s 48 and ex parte hawk supra

page 344 u s 457

p 321 u s 117 when we specifically approved a district courts refusal to reexamine ordinarily the questions passed upon by our denial permitting a district court to dismiss an application for habeas corpus on the strength of the prior record should be a procedural development to reduce abuse of the right to repeated hearings such as were permitted during the period when there was no review of the refusal of a habeas corpus application salinger v loisel 265 u s 224 see 61 harvlrev 657 670 compare the protection given by statute against abuse of habeas corpus in federal criminal proceedings 28 usc § 2244 since a federal district court has power to intervene there is a guard against injustice through error darr v burford supra at 339 u s 214 it should be noted that the minority does not urge that the denial of certiorari here is res judicata of the issues presented it is true as is pointed out in the opinion of mr justice frankfurter the records of applications for certiorari to review state criminal convictions directly or collaterally through habeas corpus or otherwise are not always clear and full some records however are it seems proper for a district court to give to these refusals of certiorari on adequate records the consideration the district court may conclude these refusals merit this would be a matter of practice to keep pace with the statutory development of 1867 that expanded habeas corpus we think it inconsistent to allow a district court to dismiss an application on its appraisal of the state trial record as we understand those do who oppose our suggestion see mr justice frankfurters opinion post pp 344 u s 500501 and 344 u s 503506 but to refuse to permit the district court to consider relevant our denial of certiorari

b effect of state court adjudications  with the above statement of the position of the minority on the weight to be given our denial of certiorari we turn to another question the fact that no weight is to be given

page 344 u s 458

by the federal district court to our denial of certiorari should not be taken as an indication that similar treatment is to be accorded to the orders of the state courts so far as weight to be given the proceedings in the courts of the state is concerned a united states district court with its familiarity with state practice is in a favorable position to recognize adequate state grounds in denials of relief by state courts without opinion a fortiori where the state action was based on an adequate state ground no further examination is required unless no state remedy for the deprivation of federal constitutional rights ever existed mooney v holohan 294 u s 103 ex parte hawk 321 u s 114 furthermore where there is material conflict of fact in the transcripts of evidence as to deprivation of constitutional rights the district court may properly depend upon the states resolution of the issue malinski v new york 324 u s 401 324 u s 404 in other circumstances the state adjudication carries the weight that federal practice gives to the conclusion of a court of last resort of another jurisdiction on federal constitutional issues it is not res judicata footnote 6

furthermore in view of the consideration that was given by the district court to our denial of certiorari in these cases should we return them to that court for reexamination in the light of this courts ruling upon the effect to be given to the denial we think not from the findings of fact and the judgments of the district court we cannot see that such consideration as was given by that court to our denials of certiorari could have had any effect on its conclusions as to whether the respective defendants had been denied federal constitutional protection footnote 7

page 344 u s 459

it is true under the courts ruling today that the district court in each of the three cases erroneously gave consideration to our denial of certiorari it is also true that its rulings set out above show that without that consideration it found from its examination of the state records and new evidence presented that the conduct of the respective state proceedings was in full accord with due process such conclusions make immaterial the fact that the trial court gave consideration to our denial of certiorari

the district court and the court of appeals recognized the power of the district court to reexamine federal constitutional issues even after trial and review by a state and refusal of certiorari in this court darr v burford 339 us at 339 u s 214 the intimation to the contrary in the speller case 99 fsupp at 95 see p 344 u s 453 supra must be read as the courts opinion after the hearing

in the review of judicial proceedings the rule is settled that if the decision below is correct it must be affirmed although the lower court relied upon a wrong ground or gave a wrong reason footnote 8

certainly the consideration given by the district court to our former refusals of certiorari on the issues presented cannot affect its determinations that there was no merit in any of the applications for habeas corpus 98 fsupp 868 870 99 fsupp

page 344 u s 460

97 99 99 fsupp at 216 where it is made to appear affirmatively as here that the alleged error could not affect the result such errors may be disregarded even in the review of criminal trials footnote 9 whether we affirm or reverse in these cases therefore does not depend upon the trial courts consideration of our denial of certiorari but upon the soundness of its decisions upon the issues of alleged violation of federal procedural requirements or of petitioners constitutional rights by the north carolina proceedings we now take up those problems

iii
 right to plenary hearing

petitioner alleges a procedural error in no 32 brown v allen as we stated in the preceding subdivision the writ of habeas corpus was refused on the entire record of the respective state and federal courts 98 fsupp 866 it is petitioners contention however that the district court committed error when it took no evidence and heard no argument on the federal constitutional issues he contends he is entitled to a plenary trial of his federal constitutional issues in the district court he argues that the federal district court with jurisdiction of the particular habeas corpus must exercise its judicial power to hear again the controversy notwithstanding prior determinations of substantially identical federal issues by the highest state court either on direct review of the conviction or by postconviction remedy habeas corpus coram nobis delayed appeal or otherwise footnote 10

jurisdiction over applications for federal habeas corpus is controlled by statute footnote 11 the code directs a court entertaining

page 344 u s 461

an application to award the writ footnote 12 but an application is not entertained by a mere filing liberal as the courts are and should be as to practice in setting out claimed violations of constitutional rights the applicant must meet the statutory test of alleging facts that entitle him to relief footnote 13

the word entertain presents difficulties its meaning may vary according to its surroundings footnote 14 in § 2243 and § 2244 we think it means a federal district courts conclusion after examination of the application with such accompanying papers as the court deems necessary that a hearing on the merits legal or factual is proper see walker v johnston 312 u s 275 312 u s 283 first and second united states v baldi 344 u s 561 344 u s 568 even after deciding to entertain the application the district court may determine later from the return or otherwise that the hearing is unnecessary

it is clear by statutory enactment that a federal district court is not required to entertain an application for habeas corpus if it appears that

the legality of such detention has been determined by a judge or court of the

page 344 u s 462

united states on a prior application for a writ of habeas corpus footnote 15

the revisers notes to this section in house report no 308 80th cong 1st sess say that no material change in existing practice is intended nothing else indicates that the purpose of congress was to restrict by the adoption of the code of 1948 the discretion of the district court if it had such discretion before to entertain petitions from state prisoners which raised the same issues raised in the state courts footnote 16

furthermore in enacting 28 usc § 2254 dealing with persons in custody under state judgments congress made no reference to the power of a federal district court over federal habeas corpus for claimed wrongs previously passed upon by state courts footnote 17 see discussion at p 344 u s 447 supra a federal judge on a habeas corpus application is required to summarily hear and determine the facts and dispose of the matter as law and justice require 28 usc § 2243 this has long been the law rs § 761

page 344 u s 463

old 28 usc § 461 it was under this general rule that this court approved in salinger v loisel 265 u s 224 265 u s 231 the procedure that a federal judge might refuse a writ where application for one had been made to and refused by another federal judge and the second judge is of the opinion that in the light of the record a satisfactory conclusion has been reached footnote 18 that principle is also applicable to state prisoners darr v burford supra 339 u s 214215

applications to district courts on grounds determined adversely to the applicant by state courts should follow the same principle  a refusal of the writ without more if the court is satisfied by the record that the state process has given fair consideration to the issues and the offered evidence and has resulted in a satisfactory conclusion where the record of the application affords an adequate opportunity to weigh the sufficiency of the allegations and the evidence and no unusual circumstances calling for a hearing are presented a repetition of the trial is not required see p 344 u s 457 supra however a trial may be had in the discretion of the federal

page 344 u s 464

court or judge hearing the new application a way is left open to redress violations of the constitution see p 344 u s 447 supra moore v dempsey 261 u s 86 although they have the power it is not necessary for federal courts to hold hearings on the merits facts or law a second time when satisfied that federal constitutional rights have been protected footnote 19 it is necessary to exercise jurisdiction to the extent of determining by examination of the record whether or not a hearing would serve the ends of justice

page 344 u s 465

cf 28 usc § 2244 see note 15 supra as the state and federal courts have the same responsibilities to protect persons from violation of their constitutional rights we conclude that a federal district court may decline without a rehearing of the facts to award a writ of habeas corpus to a state prisoner where the legality of such detention has been determined on the facts presented by the highest state court with jurisdiction whether through affirmance of the judgment on appeal or denial of postconviction remedies see white v ragen 324 u s 760 324 u s 764

as will presently appear this case involves no extraordinary situation since the complete record was before the district court there was no need for rehearing or taking of further evidence treating the states response to the application as a motion to dismiss the court properly granted that motion discharge from conviction through habeas corpus is not an act of judicial clemency but a protection against illegal custody

the need for argument is a matter of judicial discretion all issues were adequately presented there was no abuse

iv
 disposition of constitutional issues

next we direct our attention to the records which were before the district court in order to review that courts conclusions that north carolina accorded petitioners a fair adjudication of their federal questions questions of discrimination and admission of coerced confessions lie in the compass of the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment have petitioners received hearings consonant with standards accepted by this nation as adequate to justify their convictions hebert v louisiana 272 u s 312 adamson v california 332 u s 46

page 344 u s 466

first we take up brown v allen no 32 a case that turns more generally than the others on the constitutional issues

petitioner a negro was indicted on september 4 1950 and tried in the north carolina courts on a charge of rape and having been found guilty he was sentenced to death on september 15 1950 in the sentencing court petitioner made a timely motion to quash the bill of indictment alleging discrimination against negroes in the selection of grand jurors in contravention of the guarantees of the fourteenth amendment to the federal constitution after the verdict but before sentencing petitioner by a motion to set aside the verdict sought to expand his constitutional attack on the selection of the grand jury to embrace the petit jury also on appeal the state supreme court treated as we do petitioners motions as adequate to challenge the selection of both juries 233 nc 202 205206 63 se2d 99 a second federal question was raised in the sentencing court when petitioner opposed admission into evidence of a confession which he alleged had been given involuntarily following sentencing petitioner took an appeal to the state supreme court and there presented for review the issues of jury discrimination and admission of a coerced confession on this appeal that court had before it both a brief on behalf of petitioner and a transcript of all those portions of the sentencing court proceedings which petitioner deemed relevant to a review of his federal questions footnote 20 dealing with the federal constitutional questions on their merits the state supreme court

a petitioners charge of discrimination against negroes in the selection of grand and petit jurors in violation of his constitutional rights attacks the operation of a method used by north carolina in selecting juries in forsyth county the statutes detailing the method of selection are cited below footnote 21 it is petitioners contention that no more than one or two negroes at a time have ever served on a forsyth county grand jury and that no more than five negroes have ever previously served on a petit jury panel in the county these contentions are the basis of the allegation that a system of discrimination is being employed against the negro residents of the county petitioner offered no evidence to support his charge of limitation against the jury service of negroes except the fact that fewer negroes than whites having regard for their proportion of the population appeared on the jury panels

the 1940 census shows the following figures in respect to the population of forsyth county

according to the unchallenged testimony of the ibm supervisor in the office of the tax supervisor of forsyth county a list of names is compiled from a tabulation of all the county property and poll taxpayers who make returns and is thereafter tendered to the county commissioners for use in jury selection all males

in june 1949 a list of approximately 40000 names compiled from all the tax lists was handed to the commissioners by the office of the tax supervisor there is uncontradicted testimony by the ibm supervisor that the list of jurors was prepared without regard to color and that it constituted a complete compilation of the names of all resident adult listed taxpayers of forsyth county both the grand and petit jury panels employed in this case were drawn from that pool all the names on that list and no others the list having been cut up into individual slips of uniform size bearing only one persons name were put into a jury box the selection from the jury box of names of persons subject to a summons to serve as grand jurors in a term of court is made by lot as is the selection of panels of persons subject to summons for duty on petit juries as the drawings were made by a small child and recorded in public there is no claim or evidence of chicanery in the drawings

grand jurors in forsyth county are selected in january and july for a six months term see c 206 1937 pub local laws as amended by c 264 1947 session laws as amended by c 577 1949 nc session laws a panel of 60 names is drawn from the jury box each december and june by a child in the presence of the county commissioners at the june 5 1950 meeting of the

page 344 u s 469

commissioners 60 names were drawn these 60 names constituted the panel of persons subject to summons for service on the grand jury which returned the indictment against petitioner after such a drawing a jury order is immediately prepared and given to the sheriff who then summons all the parties he can find to appear for drawings for grand or petit jury service as the case may be all persons whose names were drawn were summoned if they could be found although there is no evidence as to how many persons were summoned by the sheriff there is evidence to show that at least four or five negroes were summoned the final drawing for grand jury service is conducted in the court room in the presence of the superior court judge when the july 1950 grand jury was selected from the panel of 60 the drawing was again made by a child the names of all the persons summoned by the sheriff were put into a special section of the jury box and the 18man grand jury was then drawn the name of one of the four or five negroes summoned was drawn in the group of 18 and that negro served on the grand jury the remaining names are used for the petit jury panel

when they are needed petit jury panels in forsyth county are drawn from the same jury box in groups of 44 persons c 206 publiclaws supra after a drawing the names are given to a deputy sheriff who then summons those persons on the list whom he can find on the lists supplied to the deputies there are no indications as to whether the persons named are negro or white according to the statute all summoned persons must report for jury service at the selection of the petit jurors for the trial of this case 8 of the 37 persons summoned on the panel were negroes as were 3 of a special venire of 20 challenges peremptory or for cause eliminated all negroes no objections are made to the legality of these challenges uncontradicted evidence by a state witness

page 344 u s 470

shows that in the two years 1949 and 1950 the percentages of negroes drawn on grand jury panels in forsyth county varied between 7 and 10 of all persons drawn in 1950 the percentage of negroes drawn on petit jury panels varied between 9 and 17 of all persons drawn

prior to 1947 the jury list was composed of those taxpayers who had paid all the taxes assessed against them for the preceding year ncgenstat1943 § 91 cf state v davis 109 nc 780 14 se 55 state v dixon 131 nc 808 42 se 944 this requirement has now been removed as is shown by comparing the earlier statutes with the present wording of § 91 which was put into law in 1947 no change was made in the duty of all males between 21 and 50 to list their polls for assessment nor of the requirement for the county to collect an annual poll tax genstat 105307 105336 105339 and 105341 cf state v brown 233 nc 202 205 63 se2d 99 the pool of eligible jurors was thus enlarged this enlargement and the practice of selecting jurors under the new statute worked a radical change in the racial proportions of drawings of jurors in forsyth county as is shown by the record in this court of brunson v north carolina 333 us 851 tried in north carolina in october 1946 forsyth county with its large negro population at that time had a jury pool of 10622 white and 255 colored citizens at that time a sheriff then in office for 10 years testified that he had summoned only about twelve negroes for jury service in that time in 1949 the jury box was purged all those listing taxes and eligible were listed for jury service with the result in this case shown above

discriminations against a race by barring or limiting citizens of that race from participation in jury service are odious to our thought and our constitution this has long been accepted as the law brunson v north carolina 333 us 851 cassell v texas 339 u s 282 339 u s 286

page 344 u s 471

287 state v peoples 131 nc 784 42 se 814 such discrimination is forbidden by statute 18 usc § 243 and has been treated as a denial of equal protection under the fourteenth amendment to an accused of the race against which such discrimination is directed neal v delaware 103 u s 370 the discrimination forbidden is racial discrimination however directed to accomplish the result of eliminating or limiting the service of the proscribed race by statute or by practice smith v texas 311 u s 128 patton v mississippi 332 u s 463 it was explained in 1880 by this court when composed of justices familiar with the evils the amendment sought to remedy as permitting a state to

it should not condemn good faith efforts to secure competent juries merely because of varying racial proportions

the supreme court of north carolina concluded that objection to the lists based on the racial composition of the tax lists was farfetched and that it was not a racial discrimination when a list which included only taxpayers was used state v brown 233 nc 202 63 se2d 99 footnote 22

page 344 u s 473

we recognize the fact that these lists have a higher proportion of white citizens than of colored doubtless due to inequality of educational and economic opportunities while those who chose the names for the jury lists might have included names other than taxpayers such action was not mandatory under state law state v brown 233 nc 202 205 63 se2d 99 as only property and poll tax lists were used see p 344 u s 467 supra this case presents a jury selection as though limited by statute to all property owners and voters we assume only reasonable tax levies were used it is to be noted all males between 21 and 50 must list both property however modest in amount and polls see pp 344 u s 467468 supra so that in that sense there is no exclusion on racial grounds the name of every property owner and every voter is in the jury box we recognize too that we are now reviewing a constitutional objection to a state court conviction and we may not act to alter practices of a state which are short of a denial of equal protection or due process in the selection of juries footnote 23 states should decide for themselves the quality of their juries as best fits their situation so long as the classifications have relation to the efficiency of the jurors and are equally administered

page 344 u s 474

our duty to protect the federal constitutional rights of all does not mean we must or should impose on states our conception of the proper source of jury lists so long as the source reasonably reflects a crosssection of the population suitable in character and intelligence for that civic duty short of an annual census or required population registration these tax lists offer the most comprehensive source of available names we do not think a use nondiscriminatory as to race of the tax lists violates the fourteenth amendment nor can we conclude on the evidence adduced that the results of the use require a conclusion of unconstitutionality assuming that before the brunson case 333 us 851 there were unconstitutional exclusions of negroes in this north carolina county the present record does not show such exclusions in this case the evidence is to the contrary the district court correctly determined this issue as to the grand jury as both the grand and petit juries in this case were drawn from the same filling of the jury box the reasoning of the district court is applicable to the petit jury here involved

b petitioner contends further that his conviction was procured in violation of the fourteenth amendment of the federal constitution because the trial judge permitted the jury to rely on a confession claimed by petitioner to be coerced in determining his guilt at the trial petitioner registered timely objection to use by the state of his purported confessions the objection having been made the trial judge immediately excused the jury and ordered a preliminary examination to determine whether or not the statements were voluntary it was in this preliminary hearing in which the petitioner and two police officers testified that the admitted facts were first developed upon which petitioner rests this phase of his case after hearing the testimony the trial judge found that the petitioners statements were freely and voluntarily given and declared them to be competent

page 344 u s 475

upon recall of the jury the state introduced the statements in evidence objections again being noted although the petitioner chose not to take the stand in the trial of his cause his counsel while crossexamining the officers who had taken the challenged statements from the petitioner developed again for the jury all the facts upon which petitioner now relies

a conviction by a trial court which has admitted coerced confessions deprives a defendant of liberty without due process of law brown v mississippi 297 u s 278 297 u s 280 297 u s 286287 when the facts admitted by the state show coercion ashcraft v tennessee 327 u s 274 a conviction will be set aside as violative of due process chambers v florida 309 u s 227 this is true even though the evidence apart from the confessions might have been sufficient to sustain the jurys verdict malinski v new york 324 u s 401 see lyons v oklahoma 322 u s 596 322 u s 597

therefore it does not matter in this case whether or not the jury was acquainted with all the facts laid before the judge upon which petitioner now relies or whether the jury heard or did not hear the petitioner testify neither does it matter that there possibly is evidence in the record independent of the confessions which could sustain the verdict the mere admission of the confessions by the trial judge constituted a use of them by the state and if the confessions were improperly obtained such a use constitutes a denial of due process of law as guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment in determining whether a confession has been used by the state in violation of the constitutional rights of a petitioner a united states court appraises the alleged abuses by the facts as shown at the hearing or admitted on the record

petitioners contention that he had a constitutional right to have his statements excluded from the record rests upon these admitted facts he is an illiterate

page 344 u s 476

he was held after arrest for five days before being charged with the crime for which he was convicted he was not given a preliminary hearing until 18 days after his arrest no counsel was provided for him in the period of his detention the alleged confessions were taken prior to the preliminary hearing and appointment of counsel there is no record of physical coercion or of that less painful duress generated by prolonged questioning there is evidence that petitioner was told he could remain silent and that any statement he might make could be used against him he chose to speak and he made that choice without a promise of reward or immunity having been extended he was never denied the right to counsel of his choice and was never without competent counsel from the inception of judicial proceedings if the delay in the arraignment of petitioner was greater than that which might be tolerated in a federal criminal proceeding due process was not violated under the leadership of this court a rule has been adopted for federal courts that denies admission to confessions obtained before prompt arraignment notwithstanding their voluntary character mcnabb v united states 318 u s 332 upshaw v united states 335 u s 410 cf allen v united states 91 usappdc 197 202 f2d 329 this experiment has been made in an attempt to abolish the opportunities for coercion which prolonged detention without a hearing is said to enhance but the federal rule does not arise from constitutional sources the court has repeatedly refused to convert this rule of evidence for federal courts into a constitutional limitation on the states gallegos v nebraska 342 u s 55 342 u s 6365 mere detention and police examination in private of one in official state custody do not render involuntary the statements or confessions made by the person so detained petitioners constitutional rights were not infringed by the refusal of the trial court to exclude his confessions as evidence

page 344 u s 477

second we examine the constitutional issues in no 22 speller v allen

petitioner a negro was indicted and in august 1949 tried in the superior court of bertie county north carolina upon a charge of rape he has been convicted and sentenced to death on this charge three times the first two convictions having been set aside on appeal by the supreme court of north carolina on the ground of discriminatory selection of jurors state v speller 229 nc 67 47 se2d 537 230 nc 345 53 se2d 294 at this his third trial august term 1949 petitioner made a timely motion to set aside the array of special veniremen called from vance county alleging discrimination against negroes solely and wholly on account of their race andor color in the selection of the veniremen in contravention of the guarantees of the fourteenth amendment of the federal constitution transcript of record state v speller august term 1949 bertie nc superior court at 12 item 91 clerks record supreme court of the united states evidence was taken at length on this issue although some evidence deemed material by petitioner was excluded in particular the trial judge on the ground that it would be immaterial infra p 344 u s 480 refused to permit petitioner to produce evidence as to all the scrolls in the jury box for the purpose of showing the existence of dots on the scrolls bearing the names of negroes the jury box was produced in court opened and counsel for defendant permitted to examine the scrolls the trial judge made findings relating to the manner of selecting the veniremen determining that no discrimination was practiced and on these findings denied the motion to set aside the array petitioner was thereafter convicted for the third time and sentenced to death

on appeal petitioner asserted that his conviction violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth

page 344 u s 478

amendment assigning the denial of his motion to set aside the array as error and also assigning as error the trial courts ruling on his request for permission to examine into all the scrolls in the jury box the supreme court of north carolina had before it on that appeal as part of the record a mimeographed narrativestyle transcript of the entire proceedings below petitioner makes no objection to the absence of any relevant evidence on that appeal except that relating to all the scrolls which had been excluded by the trial court upholding the rulings of the trial court the supreme court of north carolina affirmed the conviction 231 nc 549 57 se2d 759

petitioner filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the federal district court for the eastern district of north carolina after we denied certiorari on direct review of the state proceedings the petition summarily recited the prior history of the litigation and raised again the same federal question which had been passed upon by both north carolina courts and which had been offered to this court on petition for certiorari racial discrimination the district court heard all additional evidence the petitioner offered this was in its discretion moore v dempsey 261 u s 86 darr v burford 339 us at 339 u s 214 cases which establish the power of federal district courts to protect the constitutional rights of state prisoners after the exhaustion of state remedies it better enabled that court to determine whether any violation of the fourteenth amendment occurred

petitioners charge of discrimination against negroes in the selection of petit jurors in violation of his constitutional rights attacks the operation of the system used by the north carolina authorities to select juries in vance county from which county a special venire was obtained to try petitioner the charge rests on petitioners contentions 1 that no negro within recent

page 344 u s 479

years had served on a jury in vance county before this case 2 that no negro had been summoned to serve on a jury before this case and 3 that the jury box in this case was so heavily loaded with names of white persons that the drawing could not fairly reflect a crosssection of those persons in the community qualified for jury service petitioner offered evidence to support each of these three contentions

the evidence establishes the correctness of contentions 1 and 2 they are inapplicable to this case however under the circumstances of the filling of this particular jury box as is pointed out in brown v allen supra at page 344 u s 470 north carolina in 1947 enlarged its pool of citizens eligible for jury service general statutes north carolina § 91 in vance county where the special venire for spellers trial was drawn the names of substantial numbers of negroes appeared thereafter in the jury box 145 negroes out of a total of 2126 names were in this jury box as this venire was the first drawing of jurors from the box after its purge in july 1949 following the new statute and brunson v north carolina 333 us 851 decided here march 15 1948 the long history of alleged discrimination against its negro citizens by vance county jury commissioners is not decisive of discrimination in the present case former errors cannot invalidate future trials our problem is whether this venire was drawn from a jury box invalidly filled as to speller because names were selected by discriminating against negroes solely on account of race andor color it is this particular box that is decisive cf cassel v texas 339 u s 282 339 u s 290 and 339 u s 295 past practice is evidence of past attitude of mind that attitude is shown to no longer control the action of officials by the present fact of colored citizens names in the jury box

page 344 u s 480

it is suggested that the record shows that the names of colored persons in the jury box were marked with a dot or period on the scroll this could be used for unlawful disposition of such scrolls when drawn such a scheme would be useless in the circumstances of this case the record shows that the defendant and his counsel were present when the venire was drawn by a child aged 5 all of the names drawn were given to the sheriff and summonses were issued as a matter of fact the special venire contained the names of seven negroes four appeared none sat as jurors therefore the assertion as to the dots even if true means no more than that some unknown person desired to interfere with the fair drawing of juries in vance county the trial court found against petitioner on this question the district court pointed out its immateriality 99 fsupp at 97

this box was filled by names selected by the clerk of the jury commissioners and corrected by the commissioners the names put in were substantially those selected by the clerk who chose them from those on the tax lists who had the most property the clerk testified no racial discrimination entered into his selection since the effect of this possible objection to the selection of jurors on an economic basis was not raised or developed at the trial on appeal to the state supreme court on the former certiorari to this court or in the petition or brief on the present certiorari to this court it is not open to consideration here footnote 24 such an important

page 344 u s 481

national asset as state autonomy in local law enforcement must not be eroded through indefinite charges of unconstitutional actions

as we have stated above in discussing the brown case at page 344 u s 473 et seq supra our conclusion that selection of prospective jurors may be made from such tax lists as those required under north carolina statutes without violation of the federal constitution this point needs no further elaboration the fact that causes further consideration in this case of the selection of prospective jurors is that the tax lists show 8233 individual taxpayers in vance county of whom 3136 or 38 are negroes in the jury box involved selected from that list there were 2126 names of that number 145 were negroes 7 this disparity between the races would not be accepted by this court solely on the evidence of the clerk of the commissioners that he selected names of citizens of good moral character and qualified to serve as jurors and who had paid their taxes footnote 25 it would not be assumed that in vance county there is not a much larger percentage of negroes with qualifications of jurymen footnote 26 the action of the commissioners clerk however in selecting those with the most property an economic basis not attacked here might well account for the few negroes appearing in the box evidence of discrimination based solely on race on the selection actually made is lacking

the trial and district courts after hearing witnesses found no racial discrimination in the selection of the prospective jurors the conviction was upheld as nondiscriminatory

page 344 u s 482

by the state supreme court which had once acted to reverse a conviction of this defendant by a jury deemed tainted with racial discrimination state v speller 229 nc 67 68 47 se2d 537 and again to reverse a conviction when adequate time for investigation of discrimination had not been given state v speller 230 nc 345 53 se2d 294 it would require a conviction by this court of violation of equal protection through racial discrimination to set aside this trial our delicate and serious responsibility of compelling state conformity to the constitution by overturning state criminal convictions should not be exercised without clear evidence of violation

disregarding as we think we should the clerks unchallenged selections based on taxable property there is no evidence of racial discrimination negroes names now appear in the jury box if the requirement of comparative wealth is eliminated and the statutory standards employed the number would increase to the equality justified by their moral and educational qualification for jury service as compared with the white race we do not think the small number by comparison of negro names in this one jury box is in itself enough to establish racial discrimination

third we have the problems presented by no 20 daniels v allen the two petitioners negroes were indicted and convicted in the north carolina courts on a charge of murder their trial in the superior court of pitt county resulted in a verdict of guilty and each petitioner was thereafter sentenced to death there is no issue over guilt under the evidence introduced in addition to the objections stated above at page 344 u s 453  discrimination in jury lists coerced confessions and refusal to hear on the merits  there is also objection here to the procedure for determination of the voluntariness of the confessions

page 344 u s 483

as the failure to serve the statement of the case on appeal seems to us decisive we do not discuss in detail the other constitutional issues tendered and only point out that they were resolved against the petitioners by the sentencing state court and the federal district court after full hearing of the evidence offered it is also to be noted that the supreme court of north carolina refused certiorari to review the alleged invasions of constitutional rights by the sentencing court and two efforts of petitioners to secure an order permitting them to apply for coram nobis footnote 27 the writ of coram nobis is available in north carolina to test constitutional rights extraneous of the record in re taylor 230 nc 566 53 se2d 857 in the first coram nobis case the court said speaking of its refusal of certiorari

counsel for petitioners were advised however that petition might be filed here for permission to apply to the superior court of pitt county where the cause was tried for a writ of error coram nobis through which if allowed there they might be heard on the main features on which they asked for relief which included matters dehors the record and that appeal would lie to the supreme court in the event of its unfavorable action s v daniels supra in re taylor 230 nc supra in re taylor 229 nc supra

the defendants now file a petition for permission to apply to the superior court for such a writ their petition does not make a prima facie showing of substance which is necessary to bring themselves within the purview of the writ footnote 28

231 nc 341 56 se2d 646 647

page 344 u s 484

after the refusal of the first coram nobis petition the supreme court of north carolina dismissed petitioners attempted appeal on the record proper on the ground that no case on appeal had been filed 231 nc 509 57 se2d 653 rule 17 4 ncgenstat app id vol 1 § 1282 such action accords with well settled practice in that state rules requiring service to be made of case on appeal    are mandatory 231 nc 17 24 56 se2d 2 7 they are applied alike to all appellants footnote 29 the first application for certiorari to this court raised federal constitutional objections to the judgments of the supreme court of north carolina on both direct and collateral attack by certiorari and coram nobis on the judgment of the trial court 339 us 954

the failure to perfect the appeal came in this way upon the coming in of the verdict on june 6 1949 the petitioners several times moved for a new trial in each motion reiterating one or the other of the aforementioned federal questions these motions were denied and the trial court pronounced its sentence petitioners excepted to the judgments and noted appeals therefrom to the state supreme court in response to petitioners notice the trial judge granted petitioners 60 days in which to make and serve a statement of the case on appeal when counsel failed to serve this statement until 61 days had expired the trial judge struck the appeal as out of

page 344 u s 485

time this action precluded an appeal as of right to the state supreme court

this situation confronts us north carolina furnished a criminal court for the trial of those charged with crime petitioners at all times had counsel chosen by themselves and recognized by north carolina as competent to conduct the defense in that court all petitioners objections and proposals whether of jury discrimination admission of confessions instructions or otherwise were heard and decided against petitioners the state furnished an adequate and easily compliedwith method of appeal this included a means to serve the statement of the case on appeal in the absence of the prosecutor from his office state v daniels 231 nc 17 24 56 se2d 2 yet petitioners appeal was not taken and the state of north carolina although the full trial record and statement on appeal were before it refused to consider the appeal on its merits footnote 30

the writ of habeas corpus in federal courts is not authorized for state prisoners at the discretion of the federal court it is only authorized when a state prisoner is in custody in violation of the constitution of the united states 28 usc § 2241 that fact is not to be tested by the use of habeas corpus in lieu of an appeal footnote 31 to allow habeas corpus in such circumstances would subvert the entire system of state criminal justice and destroy state energy in the detection and punishment of crime

of course federal habeas corpus is allowed where time has expired without appeal when the prisoner is detained without opportunity to appeal because of lack of counsel

page 344 u s 486

incapacity or some interference by officials footnote 32 also this court will review state habeas corpus proceedings even though no appeal was taken if the state treated habeas corpus as permissible footnote 33 federal habeas corpus is available following our refusal to review such state habeas corpus proceedings footnote 34 failure to appeal is much like a failure to raise a known and existing question of unconstitutional proceeding or action prior to conviction or commitment such failure of course bars subsequent objection to conviction on those grounds footnote 35

north carolina has applied its law in refusing this outoftime review footnote 36 this court applies its jurisdictional statute in the same manner preston v texas 343 us 917 cf paonessa v new york 344 us 860 certiorari denied october 20 1952 because application therefor was not made within the time provided by law we cannot say that north carolinas action in refusing review after failure to perfect the case on appeal violates the federal constitution a period of limitation accords with our conception of proper procedure

finally federal courts may not grant habeas corpus for those convicted by the state except pursuant to § 2254 � 32 and s 487� see note 17 supra see also note 2 supra we have interpreted § 2254 as not requiring repetitious applications to state courts for collateral relief p 32 and s 447447 supra but clearly the states procedure for relief must be employed in order to avoid the use of federal habeas corpus as a matter of procedural routine to review state criminal rulings a failure to use a states available remedy in the absence of some interference or incapacity such as is referred to just above at notes 32 and  32 and s 443fn3333 bars federal habeas corpus the statute requires that the applicant exhaust available state remedies to show that the time has passed for appeal is not enough to empower the federal district court to issue the writ the judgment must be affirmed

we have spoken in this opinion of the change of practice in north carolina in the selection of jurors our conclusions have been reached without regard to earlier incidents not connected with these juries or trials that suggest past discriminations since the states are the real guardians of peace and order within their boundaries it is hoped that our consideration of these records will tend to clarify the requirements of the federal constitution in the selection of juries our constitution requires that jurors be selected without inclusion or exclusion because of race there must be neither limitation nor representation for color by that practice harmony has an opportunity to maintain essential discipline without that objectionable domination which is so inconsistent with our constitutional democracy

the judgments are affirmed

mr justice jackson concurs in this result for the reasons stated in a separate opinion see post pp 344 u s 532 344 u s 548

mr justice burton and mr justice clark adhere to their position as stated in darr v burford 339 u s 200 at 339 u s 219 they believe that the nature of the proceeding

page 344 u s 488

upon a petition for certiorari is such that when the reasons for a denial of certiorari are not stated the denial should be disregarded in passing upon a subsequent application for relief except to note that this source of possible relief has been exhausted

they join in the judgment of the court in these cases and they concur in the opinion of the court except insofar as it may contain in part ii subdivision a pp 344 u s 456457 or elsewhere any indication that although the reasons for a denial of certiorari be not stated those reasons nevertheless may be inferred from the record they also recognize the propriety of the considerations to which mr justice frankfurter invites the attention of a federal court when confronted with a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under the circumstances stated

we reach this conclusion after consideration of the second paragraph of 28 usc § 2254

an applicant shall not be deemed to have exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the state within the meaning of this section if he has the right under the law of the state to raise by any available procedure the question presented

footnote 3

outside the cases it has been strongly urged that the purpose of subparagraph 2 was to eliminate the right of a federal district court to entertain an application so long as any state remedy remained available in an article by judge parker chairman of the judicial conference committee which drafted the new habeas corpus act limiting the abuse of habeas corpus 8 frd 171 176 1949 this construction of § 2254 is presented

the effect of this last provision is to eliminate for all practical purposes the right to apply to the lower federal courts for habeas corpus in all states in which successive applications may be made for habeas corpus to the state courts for in all such states the applicant has the right notwithstanding the denial of prior applications to apply again to the state courts for habeas corpus and to have action upon such later application reviewed by the supreme court of the united states on application for certiorari

we do not so construe § 2254 we do not believe congress intended to require repetitious applications to state courts § 2254 originally read as follows

an application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court or authority of a state officer shall not be granted unless it appears that the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the state or that there is no adequate remedy available in such courts or that such courts have denied him a fair adjudication of the legality of his detention under the constitution and laws of the united states

the reason for the change in procedure was stated

but it does not follow that a refusal to discharge on one application is without bearing or weight when a later application is being considered in early times when a refusal to discharge was not open to appellate review courts and judges were accustomed to exercise an independent judgment on each successive application regardless of the number but when a right to an appellate review was given the reason for that practice ceased and the practice came to be materially changed  just as when a right to a comprehensive review in criminal cases was given the scope of inquiry deemed admissible on habeas corpus came to be relatively narrowed

mr justice frankfurter

the course of litigation in these cases and their relevant facts are set out in mr justice reeds opinion this opinion is restricted to the two general questions which must be considered before the court can pass on the specific situations presented by these cases the two general problems are these

i the legal significance of a denial of certiorari in a case required to be presented here under the doctrine of darr v burford 339 u s 200 when an application for a writ of habeas corpus thereafter comes before a district court

ii the bearing that the proceedings in the state courts should have on the disposition of such an application in a district court

page 344 u s 489

i

darr v burford sheds no light on the effect a district court is to give our denial of certiorari in one of these cases that decision was expressly limited to ruling that ordinarily the certiorari jurisdiction of this court must be invoked in an attempt to secure review of a state courts refusal of relief prior to an application for habeas corpus in a district court darr v burford 339 us at 339 u s 201 339 u s 214 the fact that two members of the necessary majority in darr v burford deemed it appropriate to disavow concurrence in any indication in the courts opinion that any effect is to be given to the denial of certiorari emphasizes that no such ruling can be attributed to darr v burford it was the view of mr justice burton and mr justice clark

that the nature of the proceeding is such that when the reasons for a denial of certiorari are not stated the denial should be disregarded in passing upon a subsequent application for relief except to note that this source of possible relief has been exhausted

darr v burford supra at 339 u s 219 of course when the reasons are given the decision to deny will have the effect indicated by the reasons stated but we know best how puzzling it often would be to state why the court denied certiorari even when we are parties to the denial

in the three cases now here from the fourth circuit the court of appeals relied heavily on our denial of certiorari in ruling against applications for federal habeas corpus by state prisoners footnote 21 its opinion in no

page 344 u s 490

20 relies on and the per curiam decision in nos 22 and 32 quotes an earlier decision by that court based on an express assumption that if this court had thought that the record showed a denial of constitutional rights certiorari

page 344 u s 491

would have been granted stonebreaker v smyth 163 f2d 498 499

if we were to sanction a rule directing the district courts to give any effect to a denial of certiorari let alone the effect of res judicata which is the practical result of the position of the fourth circuit we would be ignoring actualities recognized ever since certiorari jurisdiction was conferred upon this court more than sixty years ago

from its inception certiorari jurisdiction has been treated for what it is in view of the function that it was devised to serve it was designed to permit this court to keep within manageable proportions having due regard to the conditions indispensable for the wise adjudication of those cases which must be decided here the business that is allowed to come before us by successive measures congress enlarged the discretionary jurisdiction of the court until by the judiciary act of 1925 supplemented by the courts own invention of the jurisdictional statement in relation to the narrow scope of residual appeals the court became complete master of its docket the governing consideration was authority in the court to decline to review decisions which right or wrong do not present questions of sufficient gravity whatever the source of these questions whether the common law statutes or the constitution other cases of obvious gravity are more than enough to absorb the courts time and thought cf hamiltonbrown shoe co v wolf brothers 240 u s 251 240 u s 258

it is within the experience of every member of this court that we do not have to and frequently do not reach the merits of a case to decide that it is not of sufficient importance to warrant review here thirty years ago the court rather sharply reminded the bar not to draw strength for lower court opinions from the fact that they were left unreviewed here

the denial of a writ of

page 344 u s 492

certiorari imports no expression of opinion upon the merits of the case as the bar has been told many times

united states v carver 260 u s 482 260 u s 490 we have repeatedly indicated that a denial of certiorari means only that for one reason or another which is seldom disclosed and not infrequently for conflicting reasons which may have nothing to do with the merits and certainly may have nothing to do with any view of the merits taken by a majority of the court there were not four members of the court who thought the case should be heard any departure from this fundamental rule in the type of case we are considering ought to be based on a showing that these denials of certiorari unlike all the other denials are in fact the essential equivalents of adjudication on the merits the results of the inquiry detailed in the appendix show that the contrary is the fact footnote 22 there is certainly no more assurance that these petitions have been canvassed on their merits than is true of cases within the ordinary domain of certiorari jurisdiction indeed there is less assurance that petitions by state prisoners could be considered on their merits than is the case with ordinary petitions for certiorari to treat denials of certiorari in cases in which applications for habeas corpus are subsequently made in effect as adjudications here presupposes at the least that such determinations

page 344 u s 493

are based on records of litigation in which issues are more or less carefully shaped by competent lawyers as is after all true of the ordinary flow of certiorari cases such an assumption is shown to be wholly baseless by the study of the 126 certiorari files on which this opinion is based it is also an assumption that falsifies the picture of the habeas corpus problems facing the district judge

these petitions for certiorari are rarely drawn by lawyers some are almost unintelligible and certainly do not present a clear statement of issues necessary for our understanding in view of the pressure of the courts work footnote 23 the certified records we have in the run of certiorari cases to assist understanding are almost unknown in this field footnote 24 indeed the number of cases in which most of the papers necessary to prove what happened in the state proceedings are not filed is striking whether there has been an adjudication or simply a perfunctory denial of a claim below is rarely ascertainable seldom do we have enough on which to base a solid conclusion as to the adequacy of the state adjudication even if we are told something about a trial of the claims

page 344 u s 494

the applicant asserts we almost never have a transcript of these proceedings to assist us in determining whether the trial was adequate footnote 25 equally unsatisfactory as a means for evaluating the state proceedings is the filing of opinions in less than onefourth of the cases is more than a perfunctory order of the state courts filed footnote 26 we would have to have very different records and to alter our consideration of these cases radically if a denial could fairly be deemed to be an undisclosed decision on the merits in a few cases the issues before the district court had not even been raised here footnote 27 in other cases the emphasis put on the issues here differed considerably from that put on them in the district courts alice could understand but not i how under such circumstances a district judge could assume if he is so minded that we decided the question now presented to him

just as there is no ground for holding that our denial is in effect res judicata so equally is there no basis for leaving the district judge free to decide whether we passed on the merits for there is more to the story the district judge ordinarily knows painfully little of the painfully little we knew it is a rare case indeed in which the district court has any information concerning the certiorari proceeding in over 90 of the cases studied there were neither papers filed nor allegations made indicating in any way what issue the petition for certiorari presented footnote 28 in even fewer cases was there any indication that any papers from the state proceedings had been before this court footnote 29 it may be said that the district court

page 344 u s 495

can call for the papers that were here it is seldom done footnote 210 moreover in view of the unlikelihood that such a record could reveal enough for a sound judgment such a requirement would be futile but otherwise the district judge can know only in a negligible number of cases what little we had before us to say that he is at liberty to decide whether we passed on the merits of a case invites what must in almost all cases be idle speculation we would be inviting a busy federal district judge to rest on our denial and cloak his failure to exercise a judgment in formal compliance with a statement that he can give meaning to something that almost always must to him be meaningless

it is inadmissible to act as though these cases proceeded through the courts in an orderly fashion leaving behind neat records which can be traced effectively with promise of enlightenment once traced although it seems difficult to conceive of many cases in which a district judge presented with a full record of the proceedings here could give any relevant effect to the denial of certiorari the likelihood is negligible that such a case will also be one of the very few in which he has enough materials to know what was before us to give him discretion to interpret the denial of certiorari as a determination can so rarely be rationally justified that it is either futile or mischievous to allow such denial to weigh in the district courts disposition

in darr v burford it was decided as a matter of proper administration that due regard for the relations between state and federal authority makes it undesirable in the ordinary case to permit an application to a federal district

page 344 u s 496

court on a claim which has already been presented to the state court before we have had an opportunity to review the state court action here to hold however that a denial of certiorari may be deemed to be approval of the decision of the state court would be something far beyond fashioning a rule for the administration of judicial business if district judges were authorized to deny an application for habeas corpus merely because the issues may have been considered by this court in denying a petition for certiorari the duty which has been entrusted to the federal courts since the enlargement of the scope of habeas corpus jurisdiction by the act of 1867 to deal judicially with applications for writs of habeas corpus by state convicts would be left to the unbounded because undefined discretion of the district judges throughout the land judges dealing with the writ of habeas corpus as with temporary injunctions must be left some discretion  room for assessing fact and balancing conflicting considerations of public interest  if law is not to be a procrustes bed but discretion must be judicial discretion it must be subject to rational criteria by which particular situations may be adjudged to allow applications for habeas corpus to be denied merely because it is deemed on no reasonable or at best on the most fragile foundations that the matter has already been adjudicated here is to afford no criterion but merely a shelter for district judges to respond according to the individual will

we must not invite the exercise of judicial impressionism discretion there may be but methodized by analogy disciplined by system cardozo the nature of the judicial process 139 141 1921 discretion without a criterion for its exercise is authorization of arbitrariness the nations supreme court ought to be able to do better than to tell the federal judges of the land in a field so vital as that of habeas corpus to vindicate constitutional

page 344 u s 497

rights that they may do as they please  that they are not to be bound nor to be guided by considerations capable of rational formulation

this is not to impugn the conscientiousness of federal judges if left at large in disposing of applications for a writ of habeas corpus they would necessarily be thrown back upon their individual judgments and that would be the exercise not of law but of arbitrariness

the reasons why our denial of certiorari in the ordinary run of cases can be any number of things other than a decision on the merits are only multiplied by the circumstances of this class of petitions and so we conclude that in habeas corpus cases as in others denial of certiorari cannot be interpreted as an expression of opinion on the merits sunal v large 332 u s 174 332 u s 181

ii

the issue of the significance of the denial of certiorari raises a sharp division in the court this is not so as to the bearing of the proceedings in the state courts upon the disposition of the application for a writ of habeas corpus in the federal district courts this opinion is designed to make explicit and detailed matters that are also the concern of mr justice reeds opinion the uncommon circumstances in which a district court should entertain an application ought to be defined with greater particularity as should be the criteria for determining when a hearing is proper the views of the court on these questions may thus be drawn from the two opinions jointly

i deem it appropriate to begin by making explicit some basic considerations underlying the federal habeas corpus jurisdiction experience may be summoned to support the belief that most claims in these attempts to obtain review of state convictions are without merit presumably they are adequately dealt with in the state courts

page 344 u s 498

again no one can feel more strongly than i do that a casual unrestricted opening of the doors of the federal courts to these claims not only would cast an undue burden upon those courts but would also disregard our duty to support and not weaken the sturdy enforcement of their criminal laws by the states that wholesale opening of state prison doors by federal courts is however not at all the real issue before us is best indicated by a survey recently prepared in the administrative office of the united states courts for the conference of chief justices of all federal question applications for habeas corpus some not even relating to state convictions only 67 out of 3702 applications were granted in the last seven years and only a small number of these 67 applications resulted in release from prison

a more detailed study over the last four years shows that out of 29 petitions granted there were only 5 petitioners who were released from state penitentiaries footnote 211

the meritorious claims are few but our procedures must ensure that those few claims are not stifled by undiscriminating generalities the complexities of our federalism and the workings of a scheme of government involving the interplay of two governments one of which is subject to limitations enforceable by the other are not to be escaped by simple rigid rules which by avoiding some abuses generate others

for surely it is an abuse to deal too casually and too lightly with rights guaranteed by the federal constitution even though they involve limitations upon state power and may be invoked by those morally unworthy under the guise of fashioning a procedural rule we are

page 344 u s 499

not justified in wiping out the practical efficacy of a jurisdiction conferred by congress on the district courts rules which in effect treat all these cases indiscriminately as frivolous do not fall far short of abolishing this head of jurisdiction

congress could have left the enforcement of federal constitutional rights governing the administration of criminal justice in the states exclusively to the state courts these tribunals are under the same duty as the federal courts to respect rights under the united states constitution see federalist no 82 claflin v houseman 93 u s 130 testa v katt 330 u s 386 note 60 harvlrev 966 indeed the jurisdiction given to the federal courts to issue writs of habeas corpus by the first judiciary act § 14 1 stat 81 82 extended only to prisoners in custody under authority of the united states it was not until the act of 1867 that the power to issue the writ was extended to an applicant under sentence of a state court it is not for us to determine whether this power should have been vested in the federal courts as mr justice bradley with his usual acuteness commented not long after the passage of that act

although it may appear unseemly that a prisoner after conviction in a state court should be set at liberty by a single judge on habeas corpus there seems to be no escape from the law

ex parte bridges 2 woods 428 432 his feeling has been recently echoed in a proposal of the judicial conference of senior circuit judges that these cases be heard by threejudge courts footnote 212 see

page 344 u s 500

repjudconf1943 p 23 but the wisdom of such a modification in the law is for congress to consider particularly in view of the effect of the expanding concept of due process upon enforcement by the states of their criminal laws it is for this court to give fair effect to the habeas corpus jurisdiction as enacted by congress by giving the federal courts that jurisdiction congress has imbedded into federal legislation the historic function of habeas corpus adapted to reaching an enlarged area of claims see eg mooney v holohan 294 u s 103 johnson v zerbst 304 u s 458

in exercising the power thus bestowed the district judge must take due account of the proceedings that are challenged by the application for a writ all that has gone before is not to be ignored as irrelevant but the prior state determination of a claim under the united states constitution cannot foreclose consideration of such a claim else the state court would have the final say which the congress by the act of 1867 provided it should not have cf ex parte royall 117 u s 241 117 u s 248250 a state determination may help to define the claim urged in the application for the writ and may bear on the seriousness of the claim that most claims are frivolous has an important bearing upon the procedure to be followed by a district judge the prior state determination may guide his discretion in deciding upon the appropriate course to be followed in disposing of the application before him the state record may serve to indicate the necessity of further pleadings or of a quick hearing to clear up an ambiguity or the state record may show the claim to be frivolous or not within the competence of a federal court because solely dependent on state law

it may be a matter of phrasing whether we say that the district judge summarily denies an application for a writ by accepting the ruling of the state court or by making an independent judgment though he does so on

page 344 u s 501

the basis of what the state record reveals but since phrasing mirrors thought it is important that the phrasing not obscure the true issue before a federal court our problem arises because congress has told the district judge to act on those occasions however rare when there are meritorious causes in which habeas corpus is the ultimate and only relief and designed to be such vague undefined directions permitting the district court to give consideration to a prior state determination fall short of appropriate guidance for bringing to the surface the meritorious case they may serve indiscriminately to preclude a hearing where one should have been granted and yet this basis for denial may be so woven into the texture of the result that an improper deference to a state court treatment of a constitutional issue cannot even be corrected on review if we are to give effect to the statute and at the same time avoid improper intrusion into the state criminal process by federal judges  and there is no basis for thinking there is such intrusion unless men think dramatically not quantitatively holmes collected legal papers p 293  we must direct them to probe the federal question while drawing on available records of prior proceedings to guide them in doing so

of course experience cautions that the very nature and function of the writ of habeas corpus precludes the formulation of foolproof standards which the 225 district judges can automatically apply here as elsewhere in matters of judicial administration we must attribute to them the good sense and sturdiness appropriate for men who wield the power of a federal judge certainly we will not get these qualities if we fashion rules assuming the contrary but it is important in order to preclude individualized enforcement of the constitution in different parts of the nation to lay down as specifically as the nature of the problem permits the standards or directions

page 344 u s 502

that should govern the district judges in the disposition of applications for habeas corpus by prisoners under sentence of state courts

first just as in all other litigation a prima facie case must be made out by the petitioner the application should be dismissed when it fails to state a federal question or fails to set forth facts which if accepted at face value would entitle the applicant to relief

care will naturally be taken that the frequent lack of technical competence of prisoners should not strangle consideration of a valid constitutional claim that is bunglingly presented district judges have resorted to various procedures to that end thus a lawyer may be appointed in the exercise of the inherent authority of the district court cf eg ex parte peterson 253 u s 300 either as an amicus or as counsel for the petitioner to examine the claim and to report or the judge may dismiss the petition without prejudice footnote 213

second failure to exhaust an available state remedy is an obvious ground for denying the application an attempt must have been made in the state court to present the claim now asserted in the district court in compliance with § 2254 of the judicial code section 2254 does not however require repeated attempts to invoke the same remedy nor more than one attempt where there are alternative remedies further darr v burford requires ordinarily an application for certiorari to the united states supreme court from the states denial of relief cf frisbie v collins 342 u s 519 342 u s 520522

page 344 u s 503

of course nothing we have said suggests that the federal habeas corpus jurisdiction can displace a states procedural rule requiring that certain errors be raised on appeal normally rights under the federal constitution may be waived at the trial adams v united states ex rel mccann 317 u s 269 and may likewise be waived by failure to assert such errors on appeal compare frank v mangum 237 u s 309 237 u s 343 when a state insists that a defendant be held to his choice of trial strategy and not be allowed to try a different tack on state habeas corpus he may be deemed to have waived his claim and thus have no right to assert on federal habeas corpus such considerations of orderly appellate procedure give rise to the conventional statement that habeas corpus should not do service for an appeal see adams v united states ex rel mccann supra at 317 u s 274 compare sunal v large 332 u s 174 with johnson v zerbst 304 u s 458 304 u s 465469 however this does not touch one of those extraordinary cases in which a substantial claim goes to the very foundation of a proceeding as in moore v dempsey 261 u s 86 cf 85 u s 18 wall 163 ex parte royall 117 u s 241

third if the record of the state proceedings is not filed the judge is required to decide with due regard to efficiency in judicial administration whether it is more desirable to call for the record or to hold a hearing ordinarily where the issues are complex it will be simpler to call for the record certainly in the first instance if the issues are simple or if the record is called for and is found inadequate to show how the state court decided the relevant historical facts the district court shall use appropriate procedures including a hearing if necessary to decide the issues

such flexibility in the inquiry into the facts is necessary a printed record reflecting orderly procedure through the state courts and showing clearly what has

page 344 u s 504

happened in the state courts is rarely available in these cases footnote 214 the effort and expense of calling for a record and of having a transcript of the proceedings prepared might be more burdensome than a short hearing especially where the questions of fact are simple and easily settled it seems an unnecessary deference to state proceedings to say that the district judge regardless of the relative expense of one procedure or the other must always call for everything in the state proceedings to satisfy requirements of exhaustion he will want to know enough to know whether the claim presented to him was presented in the state courts but if the claim is either frivolous or at the other extreme substantial and if the facts are undisputed to call for the state record would probably avail little if the claim is frivolous the judge should deny the application without more if the question is one on which he must exercise his legal judgment under the habeas corpus statute footnote 215 it may be sufficient to have information perhaps presented by the pleadings of the applicant or of the state as to the disposition of any disputed questions of fact it seems unduly rigid to require the district judge to call for the state record in every case

moreover the kinds of state adjudications differ in some cases the state court has held a hearing and rendered a decision based on specific findings of fact there may have been review by a higher state court which had before it the pleadings the testimony opinions and briefs on appeal it certainly would make only for burdensome and useless repetition of effort if the federal courts were to rehear the facts in such cases at the other pole is the perfunctory memorandum order denying a badly drawn petition and stating simply that the petitioner is not entitled

page 344 u s 505

to relief the district judge cannot give the same weight to this sort of adjudication as he does to the first he has no basis for exercising the judgment the statute requires him to exercise

these criteria for determining when it is proper to hold a hearing seem to me appropriate in relating the habeas corpus provisions to the realities of these cases section 2241 empowers the district courts to grant writs of habeas corpus to prisoners in custody in violation of the federal constitution section 2243 commands the judge entertaining an application to award the writ or issue an order to show cause unless it appears from the application that the applicant    is not entitled thereto it seems clear enough that the word entertain does not refer to holding a hearing and mr justice reeds suggestion that it refers to the district courts conclusion that a hearing is proper footnote 216 is unsatisfying footnote 217 the proviso that no writ or order need be issued if the application shows that the applicant is not entitled thereto certainly permits entertaining and nevertheless summarily dismissing for failure to state a claim failure to exhaust state remedies or proof from the papers themselves including the record of the state proceedings if filed that there is no claim at the same time the command that the writ or an order be issued in some cases hardly requires a hearing in every such case as in any litigation the pleadings may show either separately or taken together that there is no claim it can hardly be contended that by entertaining the application to the extent of issuing the writ or an order the

page 344 u s 506

district judge commits himself to holding a hearing if the return to the writ or the order to show cause shows unquestionably that the applicant is not entitled to discharge footnote 218

fourth when the record of the state court proceedings is before the court it may appear that the issue turns on basic facts and that the facts in the sense of a recital of external events and the credibility of their narrators have been tried and adjudicated against the applicant unless a vital flaw be found in the process of ascertaining such facts in the state court the district judge may accept their determination in the state proceeding and deny the application on the other hand state adjudication of questions of law cannot under the habeas corpus statute be accepted as binding it is precisely these questions that the federal judge is commanded to decide footnote 219

a state determination of the historical facts the external events that occurred may have been made after hearing witnesses perhaps no longer available or whose recollection later may have been affected by the passage of time or by the fact that one judicial determination has already been made to be sure these considerations argue equally against hearing the claims at all long after the facts took place but congress by making habeas corpus available has determined that other considerations prevail we are left to devise appropriate rules and the congressional determination does not preclude rules recognizing the soundness of giving great weight to testimony earlier heard just as it does not undermine the principle

page 344 u s 507

that the burden of proving facts inconsistent with judicial records in all proceedings of this kind is heavy

fifth where the ascertainment of the historical facts does not dispose of the claim but calls for interpretation of the legal significance of such facts see baumgartner v united states 322 u s 665 322 u s 670671 the district judge must exercise his own judgment on this blend of facts and their legal values thus socalled mixed questions or the application of constitutional principles to the facts as found leave the duty of adjudication with the federal judge

for instance the question whether established primary facts underlying a confession prove that the confession was coerced or voluntary cannot rest on the state decision see eg haley v ohio 332 u s 596 332 u s 601 concurring opinion and stroble v california 343 u s 181 343 u s 190 again powell v alabama 287 u s 45 represents the settled rule that due process requires a state court in capital cases to assign counsel to the accused consequently a finding in a state court of the historical fact that the accused had not had counsel could be considered binding by the district judge who would issue the writ regardless of what conclusion the state court had reached as to the law on representation by counsel in capital cases if the conviction was not for a capital offense however powell v alabama may not apply and the considerations adverted to in that opinion as to the necessity of counsel in a particular case to ensure fundamental fairness would be controlling the district judge would then look to the state proceedings for whatever light they shed on the historical facts such as the age and intelligence of the accused his familiarity with legal proceedings and the kind of issues against with he had to defend himself cf johnson v zerbst 304 u s 458 but it is for the federal judge to assess on the basis of such historical facts the fundamental fairness

page 344 u s 508

of a conviction without counsel in the circumstances although there is no need for the federal judge if he could to shut his eyes to the state consideration of such issues no binding weight is to be attached to the state determination the congressional requirement is greater the state court cannot have the last say when it though on fair consideration and what procedurally may be deemed fairness may have misconceived a federal constitutional right

sixth a federal district judge may under § 2244 take into consideration a prior denial of relief by a federal court and in that sense § 2244 is of course applicable to state prisoners section 2244 merely gave statutory form to the practice established by salinger v loisel 265 u s 224 what was there decided and what § 2244 now authorizes is that a federal judge although he may need not inquire anew into a prior denial of a habeas corpus application in a federal court if

the petition presents no new ground not theretofore presented and determined and the judge or court is satisfied that the ends of justice will not be served by such inquiry

these standards addressed as they are to the practical situation facing the district judge recognize the discretion of judges to give weight to whatever may be relevant in the state proceedings and yet preserve the full implication of the requirement of congress that the district judge decide constitutional questions presented by a state prisoner even after his claims have been carefully considered by the state courts congress has the power to distribute among the courts of the states and of the united states jurisdiction to determine federal claims it has seen fit to give this court power to review errors of federal law in state determinations and in addition to give to the lower federal courts power to inquire into federal claims

page 344 u s 509

by way of habeas corpus such power is in the spirit of our inherited law it accords with and is thoroughly regardful of the liberty of the subject from which flows the right in england to go from judge to judge any one of whose decisions to discharge the prisoner is final footnote 220 our rule is not so extreme as in england § 2244 does place some limits on repeating applications to the federal courts but it would be in disregard of what congress

page 344 u s 510

has expressly required to deny state prisoners access to the federal courts

the reliable figures of the administrative office of the united states courts supra p 344 u s 498 showing that during the last four years five state prisoners all told were discharged by federal district courts prove beyond peradventure that it is a baseless fear a bogey man to worry lest state convictions be upset by allowing district courts to entertain applications for habeas corpus on behalf of prisoners under state sentence insofar as this jurisdiction enables federal district courts to entertain claims that state supreme courts have denied rights guaranteed by the united states constitution it is not a case of a lower court sitting in judgment on a higher court it is merely one aspect of respecting the supremacy clause of the constitution whereby federal law is higher than state law it is for the congress to designate the member in the hierarchy of the federal judiciary to express the higher law the fact that congress has authorized district courts to be the organ of the higher law rather than a court of appeals or exclusively this court does not mean that it allows a lower court to overrule a higher court it merely expresses the choice of congress how the superior authority of federal law should be asserted

i yield to no member of this court in awareness of the enormity of the difficulties of dealing with crime that is the concomitant of our industrialized society and i am deeply mindful of the fact that the responsibility for this task largely rests with the states i would not for a

page 344 u s 511

moment hamper them in the effective discharge of this responsibility equally am i aware that misuse of legal procedures whereby the administration of criminal justice is too often rendered leadenfooted is one of the disturbing features about american criminal justice on the other hand it must not be lost sight of that there are also abuses by the lawenforcing agencies it does not lessen the mischief that it is due more often to lack of professional competence and want of an austere employment of the awful processes of criminal justice than to wilful misconduct in this connection it is relevant to quote the observations of one of the most esteemed of attorneys general of the united states william d mitchell

detection and punishment of crime must be effected by strictly lawful methods nothing has a greater tendency to beget lawlessness than lawless methods of law enforcement the greater the difficulties of detecting and punishing crime the greater the temptation to place a strained construction on statutes to supply what may be thought to be more efficient means of enforcing law the statutory and constitutional rights of all persons must be regarded and their violation inadvertent or otherwise is to be avoided

department of justice release for april 8 1929

unfortunately instances are not wanting in which even the highest state courts have failed to recognize violations of these precepts that offend the limitations which the constitution of the united states places upon enforcement by the states of their criminal law see eg de meerleer v michigan 329 u s 663 and marino v ragen 332 u s 561 can it really be denied that in both these cases which antedated darr v burford the

page 344 u s 512

united states district courts sitting in illinois and michigan would have been justified in granting the writ of habeas corpus had application been made for it the tag that an inferior court should not override a superior court would not have been a fit objection against the exercise of the jurisdiction with which the congress invested the district courts

the uniqueness of habeas corpus in the procedural armory of our law cannot be too often emphasized it differs from all other remedies in that it is available to bring into question the legality of a persons restraint and to require justification for such detention of course this does not mean that prison doors may readily be opened it does mean that explanation may be exacted why they should remain closed it is not the boasting of empty rhetoric that has treated the writ of habeas corpus as the basic safeguard of freedom in the angloamerican world the great writ of habeas corpus has been for centuries esteemed the best and only sufficient defense of personal freedom chief justice chase writing for the court in ex parte yerger 8 wall 85 75 u s 95 its history and function in our legal system and the unavailability of the writ in totalitarian societies are naturally enough regarded as one of the decisively differentiating factors between our democracy and totalitarian governments

the significance of the writ for the moral health of our kind of society has been amply attested by all the great commentators historians and jurists on our institutions it has appropriately been characterized by hallam as the principal bulwark of english liberty but the writ has potentialities for evil as well as for good abuse of the writ may undermine the orderly administration of justice and therefore weaken the forces of authority that are essential for civilization

the circumstances and conditions for bringing into action a legal remedy having such potentialities obviously

page 344 u s 513

cannot be defined with a particularity appropriate to legal remedies of much more limited scope to attempt rigid rules would either give spuriously concrete form to wideranging purposes or betray the purposes by strangulating rigidities equally unmindful however of the purposes of the writ  its history and its functions  would it be to advise the federal district courts as to their duty in regard to habeas corpus in terms so ambiguous as in effect to leave their individual judgment unguided this would leave them free to misuse the writ by being either too lax or too rigid in its employment the fact that we cannot formulate rules that are absolute or of a definiteness almost mechanically applicable does not discharge us from the duty of trying to be as accurate and specific as the nature of the subject permits

it is inadmissible to deny the use of the writ merely because a state court has passed on a federal constitutional issue the discretion of the lower courts must be canalized within banks of standards governing all federal judges alike so as to mean essentially the same thing to all and to leave only the margin of freedom of movement inevitably entailed by the nature of habeas corpus and the indefinable variety of circumstances which bring it into play

footnote 21

in no 20 daniels v allen after speaking of the denial of certiorari the district judge felt it difficult to believe

that any impartial person would conclude in the light of the procedural history of this case that it clearly appears that petitioners were denied the substance of a fair trial

he concluded the petitioners had had a fair trial that the writ should be vacated because not available to petitioners on the procedural history and if so the petitioners are not entitled to discharge since they did not substantiate their charges daniels v crawford 99 fsupp 208 213 216 the court of appeals stated that it was only necessary to consider the proposition that petitioners were not entitled to the writ in view of the procedural history of the case and affirmed saying that petitioners could not by habeas corpus circumvent the results of their failure to comply with the state procedural rules their allegation of peculiar hardship in only one days default in complying with state procedural rules was before the supreme court in their application for certiorari

and proper respect for that court requires that we assume that if it had thought that such enforcement of the rules of court amounted to a denial of a fair hearing to men condemned to death it would have granted certiorari either to the supreme court of the state or the trial court and would have reviewed the case the case falls squarely we think within what was said by the supreme court in ex parte hawk 321 u s 114 321 u s 118

in no 22 speller v allen the district court stated that it felt strongly disposed to deny the petition for writ of habeas corpus solely on the procedural history but decided to hear evidence on the merits after hearing evidence the court dismissed

upon the procedural history and the record in the state courts for the reason that habeas corpus proceeding is not available to the petitioner for the purpose of raising the identical question passed upon in those courts

further even if entitled to raise the same question petitioner did not substantiate his claims speller v crawford 99 fsupp 92 95 97 the court of appeals cited ex parte hawk and quoted from its opinion in stonebreaker v smyth 163 f2d 498 499 to the same effect as the language in no 20 that proper respect compels the conclusion that the supreme court would have granted certiorari had it thought petitioners constitutional rights violated speller v allen 192 f2d 477 478

in no 32 brown v allen the district court relied on stonebreaker v smyth and denied the writ noting that petitioner had apparently had a fair and impartial trial in the state courts and that the supreme court had refused to review the state court action brown v crawford 98 fsupp 866 the court of appeals considered the case together with no 22 and as stated above affirmed

an attempt to determine the factual context of a statistically representative group of habeas corpus applications is summarized in the appendix the study there reported reflects the examination of the 126 supreme court files in cases in which certiorari was denied to state prisoners during the october 1950 term and habeas corpus applications subsequently made in federal district courts and examination of materials obtained in response to questionnaires sent to the district clerks concerning the applications and the dispositions of those 126 cases in the district courts

see appendix 344 u s 516 as shown there only 13 of 126 petitioners were drawn by lawyers others of course may have been drawn by lawyers either in or out of prison who did not choose to sign the petition but our experience affirms the conclusion set forth in the survey based on one test of the legal adequacy of the petitions that in a large number of cases the petitions must be combed through to find the issues certainly much more so than is true of the ordinary petitions for certiorari

footnote 218

the language of § 2243 when the writ or order is returned a day shall be set for hearing     hardly requires a hearing in every case in which a writ is issued just as the district judge may deny an application without a hearing if the return shows that applicant failed to exhaust the state remedy  as he certainly may do  so may he dispose of the case without a hearing if the return conclusively shows applicants failure to state a claim

see secretary of state for home affairs v obrien 1923 ac 603 610 where the house of lords ruled that despite the fact that

in terms the words of § 3 of the appellate jurisdiction act of 1876 39  40 vict 380 are wide enough to give an appeal in such a matter as the present

the house of lords has no jurisdiction to hear an appeal in a habeas corpus case that went in favor of the liberty of the subject it is worth noting that by this decision the house of lords applied and extended an earlier decision of the house of lords cox v hakes 1890 15 ac 506 in which so powerful a group of judges as lord halsbury lc and lords watson bramwell herschell and macnaghten joined the tenor of that decision is sufficiently indicated by the quotations that follow lord halsbury wrote

in days of technical pleading no informality was allowed to prevent the substantial question of the right of the subject to his liberty being heard and determined the right to an instant determination as to the lawfulness of an existing imprisonment and the twofold quality of such a determination that if favourable to liberty it was without appeal and if unfavourable it might be renewed until each jurisdiction had in turn been exhausted have from time to time been pointed out by judges as securing in a marked and exceptional manner the personal freedom of the subject it was not a proceeding in a suit but was a summary application by the person detained

15 ac at 514515

and this is from the judgement of lord herschell

no court was bound by the view taken by any other or felt itself obliged to follow the law laid down by it each court exercised its independent judgment upon the case and determined for itself whether the return to the writ established that the detention of the applicant was in accordance with the law a person detained in custody might thus proceed from court to court until he obtained his liberty    i need not dwell upon the security which was thus afforded against any unlawful imprisonment it is sufficient to say that no person could be detained in custody if any one of the tribunals having power to issue the writ of habeas corpus was of opinion that the custody was unlawful

we agree with mr justice frankfurter that our previous denial of certiorari in a case should be given no legal significance when an application for a writ of habeas corpus in that case comes before a federal district court we also agree in substance with the views expressed in part ii of his opinion concerning the bearing of the proceedings in the state courts upon the disposition of an application for a writ of habeas corpus in the federal district court

appendix to opinion of mr justice frankfurter

with a view to formulating wise procedures for the exercise of federal habeas corpus jurisdiction on applications by state prisoners a study was made of all federal district court applications for habeas corpus by prisoners serving sentences in state prisons whose prior applications for certiorari to the united states supreme court from state court proceedings had been denied during the october 1950 term footnote 31 that term the first following the decision in darr v burford was chosen because of the greater likelihood that habeas corpus actions initiated in the district courts following a denial of certiorari in that term would be terminated than would be true of cases in which certiorari had been denied last term the petitions for certiorari in the october 1950 term and the number of subsequent applications for habeas corpus can fairly be said to be typical

a list of all such petitions for certiorari was compared with lists of all habeas corpus applications in the federal district courts from october 1950 until may 1952 footnote 32 as a result 126 different petitioners footnote 33 whose petitions for

page 344 u s 515

certiorari or other comparable relief footnote 34 from state decisions were denied here were found to have brought subsequent proceedings footnote 35 in the federal district courts thereupon a questionnaire was sent out concerning each habeas corpus application and the answers to those questionnaires together with a study of supreme court files form the basis for the survey

in 97 of the 126 cases only the original of the petition was filed in the other 29 cases at least one copy of the petition was filed but in only two cases were there the minimum nine copies required of the ordinary petitions for certiorari onehalf of the petitions contained nine pages or less

of the 126 petitions 13 were signed by lawyers in a classification of the other petitions according to the degree of familiarity with law shown by the petitioners 53 petitions were found not even to meet a generous standard requiring only that the petitioner intelligibly allege some facts and make some minimum attempt to connect those facts to a legal principle whether or not the principle was valid or even arguable

b papers filed in support of the petition for certiorari

four of the petitioners whose papers are still on file here footnote 38 submitted over 300 pages of papers in support of the petition for certiorari the other 120 petitioners filed an average of under 30 pages of supporting papers per case

full records though in two cases not in due form were filed by the petitioners in eight cases while excerpts from the records both of the trial proceedings and of the state proceedings in which petitioner assailed the validity

c issues presented

the issues raised by the petitioners varied from substantial federal claims to questions purely of state law in a sorting of the petitions according to the claim that seemed the principal or most substantial one two or three claims were found to have been most often asserted as the principal claim the inadequacy of counsel or representation by counsel not of petitioners choosing was claimed as the principal issue in 14 cases in another 14 the sentences imposed were attacked as illegal excessive or discriminatory in 10 cases a claim was made that the prosecuting attorney knowingly used perjured evidence or suppressed evidence in general errors in the preliminary proceedings were asserted as the main claim in 8 cases errors in the indictment or information in 7 errors affecting the pleas in 14 concerning representation by counsel in 31 affecting the trial including inadmissibility of evidence prejudice and delay in 41 and errors surrounding the sentence in 17 miscellaneous claims such as denials of a right to appeal or to a posttrial hearing and defects in extradition proceedings totaled 8

perhaps of most significance to the central problem here was the discrepancy between the claims made in the supreme court and those made in the district courts this comparison will be made in part ii dealing with the issues presented in the district courts footnote 311

d responses filed by the states and final disposition in the supreme court

table 1 supra shows what papers were filed by the petitioners and not necessarily all the papers before the court in 15 of the 126 cases the supreme court either because of the seriousness of the allegations or the inadequacy of the record as presented by the petitioner called for a response by the state fourteen responses were filed in accordance with these requests in addition

page 344 u s 521

the docket of the supreme court shows that responses were filed by the state in another 7 cases in 10 of the 21 responses in these cases additional parts of the record not already filed by the petitioners thus came before the court but the additions do not substantially change the picture presented in table 1 for example table 1 part 1 shows that in 30 cases the petitioner filed in the supreme court the opinion below or excerpts or cited the opinion the states filed the opinion below with their responses in an additional 4 cases like modifications in no instance exceeding 5 cases would be made in other of the items in table 1 if it included papers filed by the state

the disposition of these cases in the supreme court is in marked contrast with the disposition of ordinary petitions for certiorari petitions for certiorari by state prisoners from state denials of relief and miscellaneous applications to this court are almost always filed in forma pauperis and constitute about 60 of all petitions in forma pauperis since as this study indicates they are only rarely filed by lawyers and seldom accompanied by adequate records the decision whether to entertain these cases is necessarily made upon less information and with greater dispatch than with ordinary petitions for certiorari a rough index to the disposition of these cases as compared with ordinary petitions for certiorari is afforded by published figures showing the proportion of petitions granted while 152 of the ordinary petitions for certiorari are granted only 42 of the in forma petitions and no miscellaneous applications were granted during the 1950 term footnote 312

on an assumption that the certiorari jurisdiction of the supreme court ordinarily is not to be exercised merely

page 344 u s 522

because a decision below may be wrong an attempt was made to indicate in terms of considerations affecting the certiorari jurisdiction the sort of question presented footnote 313 questions purely of state law seemed to be the chief claim of 30 petitions questions probably not of sufficient general importance to warrant the exercise of the certiorari jurisdiction seemed the chief claims in another 61 cases 44 because the issue was one primarily of fact and 17 because the issue raised no substantial issue not already decided by the supreme court eighteen cases defied classification on this basis the remaining 17 cases presented questions of principle although the majority even of these probably did not present questions of the gravity or general importance usually requisite in other areas for granting certiorari

ii
 papers and disposition in district court

requests were sent by the administrative office of the united states courts to the clerks in all districts in which there were applications for habeas corpus subsequent to a denial of certiorari in the october 1950 term in addition to a request for all docket entries and orders or opinions the clerks were requested to send copies of all pertinent papers filed in the action by the applicant or to answer a questionnaire concerning those papers in the bulk of the cases the original papers or copies of them were forwarded to the administrative office these papers together with the answered questionnaires in the other cases were the basis of the following analysis

a the applications for habeas corpus

three applications for habeas corpus had been withdrawn and were unavailable of the remaining 123 17 were drawn by lawyers thirtyfour failed to meet the minimum standards for showing some degree of familiarity

page 344 u s 523

with law referred to in connection with the petitions for certiorari footnote 314 of 122 applications for which data were available 101 were typed or printed the number of pages ran slightly less than in the petitions for certiorari footnote 315 67 applications for habeas corpus contained 9 pages or less while 56 contained 10 or more

b supporting papers filed reference to certiorari

table 2 below shows to what degree the applicant informed the district court of the previous certiorari proceedings and demonstrates that in about 10 of the cases there was not even a reference by the applicant to the fact that he had petitioned for certiorari further in the large majority of cases there was simply an allegation that a petition for certiorari had been filed and denied in less than 10 of the cases did the applicant file any papers which would serve to indicate to the district court what questions were before the supreme court

page 344 u s 524

c supporting papers filed reference to state proceedings

somewhat fewer papers on a percentage basis were filed by applicants in the district courts than in the supreme court concerning the record in the state courts there seems no explanation for this difference footnote 317 of chief significance however was the extent to which papers filed in the district courts were alleged to have been presented to the supreme court in the petition for certiorari it is clear that the district courts may have learned in oral argument or by other means whether the papers had been filed previously in the supreme court but since such information was thought impossible to obtain it was necessary to limit the inquiry to allegations that the papers had also been before the supreme court the almost negligible number of cases in which the papers filed were alleged also to have been before the supreme court is striking even in cases conducted throughout by apparently competent counsel such allegations were often not made the failure to make these allegations may reflect either a fear of counsel or applicants without counsel that a demonstration of the presentation made to the supreme

page 344 u s 525

court would prejudice their cases or perhaps a feeling that it is unimportant to the district judge that the papers had also been before the supreme court in any event it has not been a practice apparently to allege what papers were before the supreme court columns 2 and 3 of table 1 supra set out information exactly parallel to that contained in column 1 which shows what papers from the state proceedings were filed in the supreme court column 2 shows the same information for the district court and column 3 shows how many of the papers before the supreme court and then filed in the district court were alleged to have been filed in the supreme court comparison of columns 1 and 3 shows to what extent papers actually before the supreme court were alleged to have been there for example in 30 cases the supreme court had some information concerning the opinion in the state proceedings the district court was told however that the opinion had been before the supreme court in only 3 of those 30 cases column 2 shows that altogether there were 21 cases in which the district courts had information concerning the opinion

a synoptic view of the comparisons made in table 1 can be had by comparing the line indicating the number of cases in which the record or excerpts were filed thus in over 80 of the cases the supreme court had some part of the state court record while in just over 70 of the cases the district court had some part of the state court record in less than 60 of the cases was the district court told by allegation that the parts of the record before it had been in the supreme court

d issues raised

the issues raised were of course approximately the same as those raised in the supreme court with only insubstantial

page 344 u s 526

variation from the figures given above footnote 318 for the types of claims raised in the supreme court but of some significance was a comparison of the claims in the supreme court with those made by the same petitioners later in the district courts in the 125 cases for which data were available the chief claim made in the supreme court was also the chief claim made in the district court in 105 cases that number of course is subject to some subjective error because of possibly differing interpretations of what the chief claim of an unclear and unlawyerlike petition is perhaps more significant are summaries made which show that the claim that was considered the chief claim in the supreme court reappeared but not necessarily as the chief claim in 107 of the district court cases conversely in 117 cases the chief claim before the district court had been raised in the supreme court petition these data indicate only that it cannot always be assumed that even on the same record and in the same course of proceedings the emphasis on various claims raised will be the same further in some cases the claims raised in the district courts may not have been made at all in the supreme court

e disposition of the cases in the district courts

in only 1 case of the 126 was the writ of habeas corpus granted the district court had originally denied the application for the writ because of a reluctance to review an application already passed on by the highest state court but after reversal on appeal footnote 319 the writ was

page 344 u s 527

granted in 120 the application for the writ has been denied and 5 are still pending 1 on remand from appeal table 3 sets out the extent to which appeal to the court of appeals has been sought or taken it shows that there have been decisions on appeal in 14 cases with reversals in 3 of those 3 cases reversed and remanded one is pending in one the writ has been granted and in the third the application was withdrawn

a variety of procedures were adopted in these cases by the district courts in dealing with the applications chief among the orders entered other than to dismiss the applications without more were orders to show cause or to answer as table 4 shows in 23 cases a lawyer was appointed either as an amicus or as counsel for the applicant in some cases the writ of habeas corpus was issued to bring the applicant before the court table 4 shows which of the devices were used and in what combinations

page 344 u s 530

the average time of disposition of applications for habeas corpus in the district courts was 594 days footnote 323 as compared with the disposition time in the supreme court of 525 days in the district court however only 56 applications were dismissed without more while in the supreme court all but 35 or 91 petitions for certiorari were disposed of without further action such as the filing of a response by the state for whatever significance it might have the important figure seemed to be that showing the number of cases in which the district court disposition time was greater than in the supreme court of the 122 cases for which figures are available 45 took longer from the time of filing until denial of the application for habeas corpus than they had in the supreme court of those 45 only 4 had been dismissed without further pleadings or action of some sort

in 98 cases the district courts indicated their reasons for denying the applications for habeas corpus as will be seen from table 6 the district courts decided only about half of the cases directly on the merits either holding against the applicant on the facts or on his constitutional claim in 45 or almost half of the 98 cases the application was denied on various grounds bearing on the relation between the federal and state courts in these cases twentynine of these 45 denials were based on the applicants failure to exhaust the state remedy since this reason was often not amplified it is not possible

to preserve text flow p 531 containing table 6 appears at end of appendix

page 344 u s 532

to classify these cases further

but from those cases in which a more detailed statement of the reason was made and from other information available in some cases it is possible to say that there were several views below as to what the requirement of exhaustion implied in some cases the applicant had not complied with formal requirements such as those prescribing the time of filing or the kind of papers to be filed for an appeal to a higher state court in others the applicant had fully invoked one remedy but other state remedies were still available or the remedy already invoked was under the state procedural rules available again in some cases of course the applicant failed to allege or show any real attempt to invoke a state remedy the other 16 of the 45 cases not decided directly on the merits were disposed of as the result of varying degrees of reliance on the state adjudication as table 6 shows in some cases the judges below stated that the applicant had had his day in the state courts and the federal courts will not ordinarily reexamine state denials of relief to prisoners while in others they felt that the claim had been fairly considered in the state courts

footnote 32

in all this work we have had the ready cooperation of the administrative office of the united states courts more particularly of will shafroth esq orin thiel esq and joseph spaniol esq and of the clerks of the united states district courts nor should the important share that donald t trautman esq had in carrying out this study go unmentioned

footnote 33

excluding eight petitioners who were codefendants with other petitioners and who presented the same issues as those other petitioners in all 134 petitioners appeared again in the district courts but in only 126 separate cases the words case and petitioner will both be used in reference to the 126 cases when petitioner or applicant is used it should be read as one or more prisoners presenting the same claim arising out of the same trial for clarity the prisoners will be referred to as petitioners for certiorari in the supreme court and applicants for habeas corpus in the district courts

footnote 34

cases in which petitioners in the supreme court sought original habeas corpus or mandamus or other relief have been included in this study unless federal district court relief had already been invoked so that the habeas corpus application could not be interpreted as reviewing a state court determination petitions for certiorari or applications for other relief in the supreme court were not included if dismissed on motion of the petitioners

footnote 35

in cases where two or more petitions for certiorari were made by a single petitioner during the october 1950 term that case was analyzed which presented the issue or the course of proceedings later presented in the district court where several applications for habeas corpus have been made in the district courts that application nearest in time to the denial of certiorari was used unless a the first application was rejected for formal defects such as failure to allege exhaustion of state remedies or failure to set out clearly the course of the proceedings and the second application corrected those defects or b the second or a later application unlike the first presented the issue or the course of proceedings which the supreme court was asked to review in a few instances the proceedings are so tangled that it was impossible to apply these criteria thus although ordinarily a case was excluded if state relief was sought after the denial of certiorari but before the application in the federal district court for habeas corpus occasionally such a case was included if the issue or course of proceedings was the same in the district court as in the supreme court

footnote 36

every file in the 126 cases surveyed was studied the data in the following sections are those revealed by the files it occasionally occurred that particular data were unavailable for that reason wherever tables are presented the total number of cases for which the data were available is indicated at the top of the table

footnote 38

in two cases at least some of the supreme court papers were returned to the petitioner

footnote 39

as there is no bright line between orders and opinions any other containing more than a perfunctory statement in general terms that the relief sought was denied is classified as an opinion

footnote 310

the table does not purport to show all the papers filed in the supreme court but only those filed by the petitioner because such figures give a better index of the lack of technical competence of the petitioners and their inability often because of prison confinement to prepare all the papers at p 344 u s 521 post the insubstantial change effected in these figures by the responses filed by the state is discussed

the terms trial proceedings or trial are used to denote both the trial in which petitioner was convicted and direct appeal from the conviction the terms attacking proceedings or attack include all actions such as habeas corpus coram nobis and other postconviction remedies in the state courts to obtain relief from an invalid conviction delayed motions for new trial have been treated for purposes of these tables as attacking proceedings

orders or opinions in part 2 of the table includes as to the trial proceedings the judgment of conviction the sentence or other conviction papers as well as for example an order or opinion on direct appeal as to trial and attacking proceedings even the perfunctory order discussed in footnote 9 was included

transcript of proceedings or transcript is used to denote a stenographic report of the testimony or hearings adequate excerpts from such transcripts are included

motions or petitions is used to denote any pleadings by either party

in 11 cases there were no attacking proceedings hence the total number of supreme court cases in part 2 of table 1 is 114 rather than 125

these figures reflect only the information or papers filed by the applicant and not any information or papers filed by the state or given the district judge in oral argument however it can fairly be asserted that at least in those cases where the entire files of the district court were sent in response to the questionnaires the pleadings of the state only occasionally referred to the denial of certiorari and almost never gave any information concerning the petition or the papers filed in the supreme court

footnote 317

in a few cases the district clerks may not have given the requested information in sufficient detail however in all cases where any such deficiency was apparent second requests for information were sent out and answers received so that only those cases where the deficiency was not apparent would be in error from the excellence of the response in most cases to the questionnaires it seems unlikely that whatever error arises from cases in which the deficiency of the answers was not apparent could account for the discrepancies in the figures

anderson v eidson 191 f2d 989 a letter from the office of the jackson county sheriff kansas city missouri to mr will shafroth chief of the division of procedural studies and statistics advises that the applicant was remanded to the custody of the sheriff and the case was dismissed by the jackson county prosecutor for lack of available witnesses on december 6 1951 about one and one half years after applicant had first raised the claim in the state courts he had presented his claim to two state courts the united states supreme court the federal district court and the court of appeals for the eighth circuit which reversed a refusal below to grant a hearing and remanded the discharge of the prisoner occurred almost 20 years after his arrest and conviction on a plea of guilty on several unrelated counts one of them capital

footnote 320

in some cases it was difficult to determine from the docket entries whether a hearing had been held a procedure was considered a hearing if at least one party the state or the applicant had appeared in court and argued points of law or fact to the court in addition to all procedures resulting in docket entries stating that a hearing had been held

footnote 321

including one case in which counsel was present but in which it does not appear whether applicant was present

footnote 322

in two of the cases in which there was no information as to the length of the hearing there is information concerning the length of the transcript made by the court stenographer in one it was 20 pages in the other 46 in five cases for which information was available as to the length of the hearing data were also given showing the length of the transcript one of the hearings lasting one hour had a transcript of 36 pages the hearing lasting three hours has a transcript of 15 pages one of the hearings lasting four hours had a transcript of 28 pages another one of 79 pages the hearing lasting three days had a transcript of 319 pages

footnote 323

the time was computed from the day of filing of the application for habeas corpus until its dismissal it does not take into account any appeal time it is slightly inaccurate because most cases are filed in forma pauperis so that a few days may elapse between the time the court receives the application and the time it grants leave to file in forma pauperis in all cases where the docket or other papers indicated the date such an application was received that date was used rather than the date shown by the docket as the date on which the application was filed

footnote 324

that is the claim is in an area in which federal protection is afforded eg representation by counsel but the applicant does not show that his case comes within the requirements for protection eg ignorance and inability adequately to defend himself

mr justice jackson concurring in the result

controversy as to the undiscriminating use of the writ of habeas corpus by federal judges to set aside state court convictions is traceable to three principal causes 1 this courts use of the generality of the fourteenth amendment to subject state courts to increasing federal control especially in the criminal law field 2 ad hoc determination of due process of law issues by personal notions of justice instead of by known rules of law and 3 the breakdown of procedural safeguards against abuse of the writ

1 in 1867 congress authorized federal courts to issue writs of habeas corpus to prisoners in custody in violation

page 344 u s 533

of the constitution or laws or treaties of the united states footnote 41 at that time the writ was not available here nor in england to challenge any sentence imposed by a court of competent jurisdiction footnote 42 the historic purpose of the writ has been to relieve detention by executive authorities without judicial trial footnote 43 it might have been expected that if congress intended a reversal of this traditional concept of habeas corpus it would have said so however this one sentence in the act eventually was construed as authority for federal judges to entertain collateral attacks on state court criminal judgments footnote 44 whatever its justification it created potentialities for conflict certain to lead to the antagonisms we have now unless the power given to federal judges were responsibly used according to lawyerly procedures and with genuine respect for state court fact finding

but once established this jurisdiction obviously would grow with each expansion of the substantive grounds

for habeas corpus the generalities of the fourteenth amendment are so indeterminate as to what state actions are forbidden that this court has found it a ready instrument in one field or another to magnify federal and incidentally its own authority over the states the expansion now has reached a point where any state court conviction disapproved by a majority of this court thereby becomes unconstitutional and subject to nullification by habeas corpus footnote 45

this might not be so demoralizing if state judges could anticipate and so comply with this courts due process requirements or ascertain any standards to which this court will adhere in prescribing them but they cannot of course considerable uncertainty is inherent in decisional law which in changing times purports to interpret implications of constitutional provisions so cryptic and vagrant how much obscurity is inevitable will be a matter of opinion however in considering a remedy for habeas corpus problems it is prudent to assume that the scope and reach of the fourteenth amendment will continue to be unknown and unknowable that what seems established by one decision is apt to be unsettled by another and that its interpretation will be more or less swayed by contemporary intellectual fashions and political currents

we may look upon this unstable prospect complacently but state judges cannot they are not only being gradually subordinated to the federal judiciary but federal courts have declared that state judicial and other officers are personally liable to federal prosecution and to

page 344 u s 535

civil suit by convicts if they fail to carry out this courts constitutional doctrines footnote 46

2 rightly or wrongly the belief is widely held by the practicing profession that this court no longer respects impersonal rules of law but is guided in these matters by personal impressions which from time to time may be shared by a majority of justices whatever has been intended this court also has generated an impression in much of the judiciary that regard for precedents and authorities is obsolete that words no longer mean what they have always meant to the profession that the law knows no fixed principles

a manifestation of this is seen in the diminishing respect shown for state court adjudications of fact of course this court never has considered itself foreclosed by a state courts decision as to the facts when that determination results in alleged denial of a federal right but captious use of this power was restrained by observance of a rule elementary in all appellate procedure that the findings of fact on a trial are to be accepted by an appellate court in absence of clear showing of error the

page 344 u s 536

trial court seeing the demeanor of witnesses hearing the parties giving to each case far more time than an appellate court can give is in a better position to unravel disputes of fact than is an appellate court on a printed transcript recent decisions avow no candid alteration of these rules but revision of state fact finding has grown by emphasis and respect for it has withered by disregard footnote 47

3 the fact that the substantive law of due process is and probably must remain so vague and unsettled as to invite farfetched or borderline petitions makes it important to adhere to procedures which enable courts readily to distinguish a probable constitutional grievance from a convicts mere gamble on persuading some indulgent judge to let him out of jail instead this court has sanctioned progressive trivialization of the writ until floods of stale frivolous and repetitious petitions inundate the docket of the lower courts and swell our own footnote 48 judged by our own disposition of habeas corpus matters

page 344 u s 537

they have as a class become peculiarly undeserving footnote 49 it must prejudice the occasional meritorious application to be buried in a flood of worthless ones he who must search a haystack for a needle is likely to end up with the attitude that the needle is not worth the search nor is it any answer to say that few of these petitions in any court really result in the discharge of the petitioner footnote 410 that is the condemnation of the procedure which has encouraged frivolous cases in this multiplicity of worthless cases states are compelled to default or to defend the integrity of their judges and their official records sometimes concerning trials or pleas that were closed many years ago footnote 411 state attorneys general recently have come habitually to ignore these proceedings responding only when specially requested and sometimes

page 344 u s 538

not then some state courts have wearied of our repeated demands upon them and have declined to further elucidate grounds for their decisions footnote 412 the assembled

page 344 u s 539

chief justices of the highest courts of the states have taken the unusual step of condemning the present practice by resolution footnote 413

it cannot be denied that the trend of our decisions is to abandon rules of pleading or procedure which would

page 344 u s 540

protect the writ against abuse once upon a time the writ could not be substituted for appeal or other reviewing process but challenged only the legal competence or jurisdiction of the committing court footnote 414 we have so departed from this principle that the profession now believes that the issues we actually consider on a federal prisoners habeas corpus are substantially the same as would be considered on appeal footnote 415

conflict with state courts is the inevitable result of giving the convict a virtual new trial before a federal court sitting without a jury whenever decisions of one court are reviewed by another a percentage of them are reversed that reflects a difference in outlook normally found between personnel comprising different courts however reversal by a higher court is not proof that justice is thereby better done there is no doubt that if there were a supersupreme court a substantial proportion of our reversals of state courts would also be reversed we are not final because we are infallible but we are infallible only because we are final

as to the pleading requirements in habeas corpus what has happened may best be learned by comparison of the meticulously pleaded facts and circumstances relied upon by this courts opinion in moore v dempsey 261 u s 86 1923 and in mooney v holohan 294 u s 103 1935 with condonation of their absence in price v johnston 334 u s 266 1948 it really has become necessary to plead nothing more than that the prisoner is in jail wants to get out and thinks it is illegal to hold

page 344 u s 541

him footnote 416 if he fails he may make the same plea over and over again footnote 417

since the constitution and laws made pursuant to it are the supreme law and since the supremacy and uniformity of federal law are attainable only by a centralized source of authority denial by a state of a claimed federal right must give some access to the federal judicial system but federal interference with state administration of its criminal law should not be premature and should not occur where it is not needed therefore we have ruled that a state convict must exhaust all remedies which the state affords for his alleged grievance before he can take it to any federal court by habeas corpus

the states all allow some appeal from a judgment of conviction which permits review of any question of law state or federal raised upon the record no state is obliged to furnish multiple remedies for the same grievance most states and with good reason will not suffer a collateral attack such as habeas corpus to be used as a substitute for or duplication of the appeal a state properly may deny habeas corpus to raise either state or federal issues that were or could have been considered on appeal such restriction by the state should be respected by federal courts

assuming that a federal question not reachable on appeal is properly presented by habeas corpus and decided adversely by the highest competent court of the state should the prisoner then come to this court and ask us to review the record by certiorari or should he go to the district court and institute a new federal habeas corpus proceeding darr v burford 339 u s 200 as

page 344 u s 542

i understand it held that in these circumstances the prisoner must apply to this court for certiorari before he can go to any other federal court because only by so doing could he exhaust his state remedy whatever one may think of that result it does not seem logical to support it by asserting that this courts certiorari power is any part of a states remedy an authority outside of the state imposes a duty upon the state to turn the case over to it in a proceeding which makes the state virtually a defendant to say that our command to certify the case to us is a state remedy is to indulge in fiction and the difficulty with fictions is that those they are most apt to mislead are those who proclaim them

but now it is proposed to neutralize the artificiality of the process and counterbalance the fiction that our certiorari is a state remedy by holding that this step which the prisoner must take means nothing to him or the state when it fails as in most cases it does

the court is not quite of one mind on the subject some say denial means nothing others say it means nothing much realistically the first position is untenable and the second is unintelligible how can we say that the prisoner must present his case to us and at the same time say that what we do with it means nothing to anybody we might conceivably take either position but not rationally both for the two will not only burden our own docket and harass the state authorities but it makes a prisoners legitimate quest for federal justice an endurance contest

true neither those outside of the court nor on many occasions those inside of it know just what reasons led six justices to withhold consent to a certiorari but all know that a majority larger than can be mustered for a good many decisions has found reason for not reviewing the case here because no one knows all that a denial means does it mean that it means nothing

page 344 u s 543

perhaps the profession could accept denial as meaningless before the custom was introduced of noting dissents from them lawyers and lower judges will not readily believe that justices of this court are taking the trouble to signal a meaningless division of opinion about a meaningless act footnote 418 it is just one of the facts of life that today every lower court does attach importance to denials and to presence or absence of dissents from denials as judicial opinions and lawyers arguments show

the fatal sentence that in real life writes finis to many causes cannot in legal theory be a complete blank i can see order in the confusion as to its meaning only by distinguishing its significance under the doctrine of stare decisis from its effect under the doctrine of res judicata i agree that as stare decisis denial of certiorari should be given no significance whatever it creates no precedent and approves no statement of principle entitled to weight in any other case but for the case in which certiorari is denied its minimum meaning is that this court allows the judgment below to stand with whatever consequences it may have upon the litigants involved under the doctrine of res judicata as applied either by state or federal courts a civil or criminal judgment usually becomes res judicata in the sense that it is binding and conclusive even if new facts are discovered and even if a new theory of law were thought up except for some provision for granting a new trial which usually is discretionary with the trial court and limited in time

it is sometimes said that res judicata has no application whatever in habeas corpus cases and surely it does not apply with all of its conventional severity habeas corpus differs from the ordinary judgment in that although an adjudication has become final the application

page 344 u s 544

is renewable at least if new evidence and material is discovered or if perhaps as the result of a new decision a new law becomes applicable to the case this is quite proper so long as its issues relate to jurisdiction but call it res judicata or what one will courts ought not to be obliged to allow a convict to litigate again and again exactly the same question on the same evidence nor is there any good reason why an identical contention rejected by a higher court should be reviewed on the same facts in a lower one

the chief objection to giving this limited finality to our denial of certiorari is that we pass upon these writs of habeas corpus so casually or upon grounds so unrelated to their merits that our decision should not have the weight of finality no very close personal consideration can be given by each justice to such a multiplicity of these petitions as we have had and as a class they are so frivolous so meaningless and often so unintelligible that this worthlessness of the class discredits each individual application if this deluge were reduced by observance of procedural safeguards to manageable proportions so that it would be possible to examine the cases with some care and to hear those that show merit i think this objection would largely disappear the fact is that superficial consideration of these cases is the inevitable result of depreciation of the writ the writ has no enemies so deadly as those who sanction the abuse of it whatever their intent

if a state is really obtaining conviction by laws or procedures which violate the federal constitution it is always a serious wrong not only to a particular convict but to federal law it is not probable that six justices would pass up a case which intelligibly presented this situation but an examination of these petitions will show that few of them tested by any rational rules of pleading actually raise any question of law on which

page 344 u s 545

the state court has differed from the understanding prevailing in this court the point on which we are urged to overrule state courts almost invariably is in their appraisal of facts for example the jury the trial judge and one or more appellate courts below have held that conflicting evidence proves a confession was voluntary the prisoner wants us to say the evidence proves it was coerced the court below found that the prisoner waived counsel and voluntarily pleaded guilty he wants us to find that he did not the jury and the trial judge below believed one set of witnesses whose testimony showed his guilt he wants us to believe the other and to hold that he has been convicted by perjury that is the type of factual issue upon which this court and other federal courts are asked to intervene and upset state court convictions there are plenty of good reasons why we should rarely do that and even better reasons why the district court should not undertake to do it after we have declined to

my conclusion is that whether or not this court has denied certiorari from a state courts judgment in a habeas corpus proceeding no lower federal court should entertain a petition except on the following conditions 1 that the petition raises a jurisdictional question involving federal law on which the state law allowed no access to its courts either by habeas corpus or appeal from the conviction and that he therefore has no state remedy or 2 that the petition shows that although the law allows a remedy he was actually improperly obstructed from making a record upon which the question could be presented so that his remedy by way of ultimate application to this court for certiorari has been frustrated there may be circumstances so extraordinary that i do not now think of them which would justify a departure from this rule but the runofthemill case certainly does not

page 344 u s 546

whether one will agree with this general proposition will depend i suppose on the latitude he thinks federal courts should exercise in retrying de novo state court criminal issues if the federal courts are to test a state courts decision by hearing new evidence in a new proceeding the pretense of exhaustion of state remedies is a sham for the state courts could not have given a remedy on evidence which they had no chance to hear i cannot see why federal courts should hear evidence that was not presented to the state court unless the prisoner has been prevented from making a record of his grievance with the result that there is no record of it to bring here on certiorari such circumstances would seem to call for an original remedy in the district courts which would be in a position to take evidence and make the record on which we ultimately must pass if there develops a conflict of law between a federal and state court

if this court were willing to adopt this doctrine of federal selfrestraint it could settle some procedures rules of pleading and practices which would weed out the abuses and frivolous causes and identify the worthy ones i know the difficulty of formulating practice rules and their pitfalls nor do i underestimate the argument that the writ often is petitioned for by prisoners without counsel and that they should not be held to the artificialities in pleading that we expect in lawyers but i know of no way that we can have equal justice under law except we have some law i suggest some general principles which if adhered to would reduce the number of frivolous petitions make decision upon them possible at an earlier time and alleviate some of the irritation that is developing over illconsidered federal use of the writ to slap down state courts

first habeas corpus shall not in absence of state law to the contrary raise any question which was or could have been decided by appeal or other procedure for review

page 344 u s 547

of conviction in the absence of showing to the contrary habeas corpus will be deemed to lie only for defects not disclosed on the record going to the power legal competence or jurisdiction of the committing state court

second every petition to a federal court is required and those to a state court may be required by state law to contain a plain but full statement of the facts on which it is based unless it states facts which if proved would warrant relief the applicant is not entitled as of right to a hearing technical forms or artificialities of pleading will not be required

presumably a federal court will not release a convict until he proves facts which show invalidity of his conviction if proof is to be required it is no hardship to require a simple statement of what it will be a petitioner should be given benefit of liberal construction of all usual privileges of amendment and if the court finds a probably worthy case appointment of counsel to aid in amending the petition and presenting the case

third petitions to federal courts are required and those to state courts may be required to set forth every previous application to any court for relief on any grounds if the current petition is made upon the same grounds as an earlier one it should state fully any evidence now available in its support that was not offered before and explain failure to present it on the jurisdictional questions appropriate for habeas corpus the petitioner may not be barred from proof by newly discovered evidence but it is not asking too much that his petition disclose that he has it and a basis for appraising its relevance and effect he should not be precluded from raising new grounds of unconstitutionality in a later petition especially in view of the unsettled character of our constitutional doctrines of due process but the facts that make the new grounds applicable should appear if federal

page 344 u s 548

relief is sought on the grounds that state law affords no remedy or his resort thereto has been obstructed and he has been unable to present his case to a state court the facts relied on should be clearly and fully set forth

much probably may be said in criticism of my statement of these principles but nothing i am convinced against their historical authenticity as part of the traditional law of habeas corpus or against their application now to stop abuses so grave that they foreshadow legislative restriction of the writ they do not foreclose worthy causes but earmark them for the serious treatment they deserve they will not even wholly eliminate frivolous petitions but will discourage them by exposing their frivolity at an earlier stage

society has no interest in maintaining an unconstitutional conviction and every interest in preserving the writ of habeas corpus to nullify them when they occur but the constitution does not prevent the state courts from determining the facts in criminal cases it does not make it unconstitutional for them to have a different opinion than a federal judge about the weight to be given to evidence my votes in the cases under review and on other petitions and reviews will be guided as nearly as i can by the principles set forth herein

i concur in the result announced by mr justice reed in these three cases

conference of chief justices  1952 25 state government no 11 p 249 nov 1952

whereas it appears that by reason of certain principles enunciated in certain recent federal decisions a person whose conviction in a criminal proceeding in a state court has thereafter been affirmed by the highest court of that state and whose petition for a review of the state courts proceedings has been denied by the supreme court of the united states may nevertheless obtain from a federal district judge or court under a writ of habeas corpus new independent and successive hearings based upon a petition supported only by the oath of the petitioner and containing only such statement of facts as were or could have been presented in the original proceedings in the state courts

and whereas the multiplicity of these procedures available in the inferior federal courts to such convicted persons and the consequent inordinate delays in the enforcement of criminal justice as the result of said federal decisions will tend toward the dilution of the judicial sense of responsibility may create grave and undesirable conflicts between federal and state laws respecting fair trial and due process and must inevitably lead to the impairment of the public confidence in our judicial institutions

now therefore be it resolved that it is the considered view of the chief justices of the states of the union in conference duly assembled that orderly federal procedure under our dual system of government should require that a final judgment of a states highest court be subject to review or reversal only by the supreme court of the united states

be it further resolved that the chairman of the conference of chief justices be authorized and he is hereby directed to appoint a special committee to give study to the grave questions and potential complications likely to ensue if the power to review or void state court judgments continues to be recognized as lying in any courts of the federal judicial system save and except the supreme court of the united states and that said special committee report its findings and recommendations at the next regular meeting of the conference

when petitioner in brown v allen sought certiorari here after his appeal to the state court failed two justices dissented from the denial of certiorari brown v north carolina 341 us 943

mr justice black with whom mr justice douglas concurs dissenting

the four petitioners in these cases are under sentences of death imposed by north carolina state courts all are negroes brown and speller were convicted of raping white women the two daniels aged 17 when arrested were convicted of murdering a white man the state supreme court affirmed and we denied certiorari in all

page 344 u s 549

the cases these are habeas corpus proceedings which challenge the validity of the convictions

i agree with the court that the district court had habeas corpus jurisdiction in all the cases including power to release either or all of the prisoners if held as a result of violation of constitutional rights this i understand to be a reaffirmance of the principle embodied in moore v dempsey 261 u s 86 i also agree that in the exercise of this jurisdiction the district court had power to hear and consider all relevant facts bearing on the constitutional contentions asserted in these cases i disagree with the courts conclusion that petitioners failed to establish those contentions the chief constitutional claims throughout have been and are a extorted confessions were used to convict b negroes were deliberately excluded from service as jurors on account of their race for the following reasons i would reverse each of the judgments denying habeas corpus

first in denying habeas corpus in all the cases the district court felt constrained to give and did give weight to our prior denials of certiorari so did the court of appeals i agree with the court that this was error but disagree with its holding that the error was harmless it is true that after considering our denials of certiorari as a reason for refusing habeas corpus the district judge attempted to pass upon the constitutional questions just as if we had not declined to review the convictions but the record shows the difficulty of his attempt to erase this fact from his mind and i am not willing to act on the assumption that he succeeded in doing so both the jury and confession questions raised in these death cases have entirely too much record support to refuse relief on such a questionable assumption i would therefore reverse and remand all the cases for the district judge to consider and appraise the issues free from his erroneous

page 344 u s 550

belief that this court decided them against petitioners by denying certiorari

second brown v allen no 32 browns death sentence for rape rests on an indictment returned by a forsyth county grand jury we recently reversed five north carolina convictions on the ground that there had been a systematic racial exclusion of negroes from forsyth countys juries for many years prior to 1947 brunson v north carolina 333 us 851 1948 upon a review of the evidence in browns habeas corpus proceeding this court holds that forsyth countys discriminatory jury practice was abandoned in 1949 when the old jury boxes were refilled the testimony on which the court relies is that the names put in the 1949 box were taken indiscriminately from the list of county taxpayers 16 of whom were negroes 84 whites other evidence relied on was that since 1949 four to seven negroes have been included in each jury venire of 44 to 60 the concrete effect of the new box in this case was stated by the north carolina supreme court to be this

one negro woman served on the grand jury and at least one prospective negro juror was tendered to the defendant for the petit jury and was excused or rejected by his counsel

state v brown 233 nc 202 205 63 se2d 99 101

the foregoing evidence does show a partial abandonment of the old discriminatory jury practices  since 1949 a small number of negroes have regularly been summoned for jury duty but proof of a lesser degree of discrimination now than before 1949 is insufficient to show that impartial selection of jurors which the constitution requires negroes are about onethird of forsyth countys population consequently the number of negroes now called for jury duty is still glaringly disproportionate to their percentage of citizenship it is not possible to attribute

page 344 u s 551

either the pre1949 or the post1949 disproportions entirely to accident and the state has not produced evidence to show that the partial continuation of the longstanding failure to use negro jurors is due to some cause other than racial discrimination cf patton v mississippi 332 u s 463 332 u s 466 332 u s 468469 recognizing this difficulty the court sanctions the continued disproportions because they were the result of selecting jurors exclusively from the county tax list but even this questionable method of selection falls short of showing a genuine abandonment of old discriminatory practices certainly discriminatory results remained i do not believe the court should permit this tax list technique to be treated as a complete neutralizer of racial discrimination

third speller v allen no 22 the jury that tried speller was drawn from vance county north carolina before this trial no negro had served on a vance county jury in recent years no negro had even been summoned that this was the result of unconstitutional discrimination is made clear by the fact that negroes constitute 45 of the countys population and 38 of its taxpayers the court holds however that this discrimination was completely cured by refilling the jury box with the names of 145 negroes and 1981 whites such a small number of negro jurors is difficult to explain except on the basis of racial discrimination the court attempts to explain it by relying upon another discrimination one which can hardly be classified as most appealing in a democratic society what the court apparently finds is that negroes were excluded from this new jury box not because they were negroes but because they happened to own less property than white people in other words the court finds as a fact that the discrimination if any was based not on race but on wealth  the jurors were selected from taxpayers with the most property the court

page 344 u s 552

then even declines to pass on the constitutionality of this property discrimination on the ground that petitioners objections were based on racial not on property discriminations i cannot agree to such a narrow restriction of petitioners objections to the jury that brought in the death verdict jury discriminations here seem plain to me and i would not bypass them

fourth daniels v allen no 20 here also evidence establishes an unlawful exclusion of negroes from juries because of race the state supreme court refused to review this evidence on state procedural grounds absence of state court review on this ground is now held to cut off review in federal habeas corpus proceedings but in the two preceding cases where the state supreme court did review the evidence this court has also reviewed it i find it difficult to agree with the soundness of a philosophy which prompts this court to grant a second review where the state has granted one but to deny any review at all where the state has granted none

the following facts indicate the obviousness of discriminatory negro exclusion from jury service in pitt county where this case was tried

negroes constituted about 47 of the population of the county and about onethird of the taxpayers but the jury box of 10000 names included at most 185 negroes and up to and including the daniels trial no negro had ever served on a grand jury in modern times petitioners made objection in ample time to juries so discriminatorily chosen

the courts conclusion not to consider and act on this manifest racial discrimination rests on these facts after petitioners death sentence they were granted an appeal in forma pauperis to the state supreme court june 6th the trial judge granted 60 days for their lawyers to make up and serve their statement of case on appeal preparation of this statement comparable to a bill of exceptions

consumed valuable time because of difficulty in getting the stenographic transcript on completion petitioners counsel on friday august 5th called the prosecuting attorneys office to serve him but found he was out of town according to the record he and his family were away for the weekend at a beach they returned home sunday but he did not get back to his office until monday august 8th had the statement been delivered at his office by a sheriff on friday the 60th day apparently there would have been compliance with north carolina law instead it was receipted for at his office on the 61st day two days before his return from the beach in the state supreme court the attorney general moved to dismiss on the ground that the notice was one day late although admittedly the court had discretionary authority to hear the appeal it dismissed the case petitioners were thereby prevented from arguing the point of racial discrimination and consequently it has never been passed on by an appellate court this denial of state appellate review plus the obvious racial discrimination thus left uncorrected should be enough to make one of those extraordinary situations which the court says authorizes federal courts to protect the constitutional rights of state prisoners cf frisbie v collins 342 u s 519 342 u s 520521

the court thinks that to review this question and grant petitioners the protections guaranteed by the constitution would subvert the entire system of state criminal justice and destroy state energy in the detection and punishment of crime i cannot agree state systems are not so feeble and the object of habeas corpus is to search records to prevent illegal imprisonments to hold it unavailable under the circumstances here is to degrade it i think moore v dempsey 261 u s 86 forbids this in that case negroes had been convicted and sentenced to death by an allwhite jury selected under a practice of systematic exclusion of negroes from juries the state

page 344 u s 554

supreme court had refused to consider this discrimination on the ground that the objection to it had come too late this court had denied certiorari later a federal district court summarily dismissed a petition for habeas corpus alleging the foregoing and other very serious acts of trial unfairness all of which had been urged upon this court in the prior certiorari petition this court nevertheless held that the district court had committed error in refusing to examine the facts alleged i read moore v dempsey supra as standing for the principle that it is never too late for courts in habeas corpus proceedings to look straight through procedural screens in order to prevent forfeiture of life or liberty in flagrant defiance of the constitution cf united states v kennedy 157 f2d 811 813 perhaps there is no more exalted judicial function i am willing to agree that it should not be exercised in cases like these except under special circumstances or in extraordinary situations but i cannot join in any opinion that attempts to confine the great writ within rigid formalistic boundaries

the court is holding today that a denial of certiorari in habeas corpus cases is without substantive significance the court of appeals sustained denials of applications for writs of habeas corpus chiefly because it treated our denial of a petition for certiorari from the original conviction in each of these cases as a review on the merits and a rejection of the constitutional claims asserted by these petitioners in short while the only significance of the denials of certiorari was a refusal to review the court of appeals for all practical purposes though disavowing the full technical import of res judicata treated substantively empty denials as though this court had

page 344 u s 555

examined and approved the holdings of the supreme court of north carolina that there was no purposeful discrimination against negroes in the selection of juries in these cases

this court could have reached the constitutional claims in controversy had it seen fit to review the cases it declined to do so and that is all that the orders in speller v allen 340 us 835 and brown v state 341 us 943 signify accordingly the proceedings were left precisely as though the petitions for certiorari had not been filed here and habeas corpus had been brought initially in the district court as in frisbie v collins 342 u s 519 if that had been the case could it be held that the district court was foreclosed from going into the merits and was barred from determining whether these cases came within our decisions finding systematic discrimination against negroes in five north carolina trials brunson v north carolina 333 us 851

suppose that the district court in these circumstances had found against brown and speller what basis is there for assuming that on appeal the court of appeals for the fourth circuit with its specialized local knowledge about such matters would not have decided in favor of the petitioners and what basis in reason have we for assuming if the cases had come here with a powerful opinion from judge parker let us say finding that there was systematic discrimination that this court would have deemed it appropriate to review so weighty a conclusion or if we had taken the case that we would have found the facts and their meaning to be different from those which the court of appeals for the fourth circuit found such assumptions are unwarranted especially in light of the impressive showing by mr justice black that in fact there was unconstitutional discrimination in the makeup of the juries in these two cases where life is at stake

page 344 u s 556

i cannot protest too strongly against affirming a decision of the court of appeals patently based on the ground that that court was foreclosed on procedural grounds from considering the merits of constitutional claims when we now decide that the court was wrong in believing that it was so foreclosed the affirmance by this court of the district courts denial of writs of habeas corpus in these cases is all the more vulnerable in that this court without guidance from the court of appeals proceeds to consider the merits of the constitutional claim this court concludes that there was not a systematic discrimination in keeping negroes off juries if this court deemed it necessary to consider the merits the merits should equally have been open to the court of appeals as i have already indicated that court is far better situated than we are to assess the circumstances of jury selection in north carolina and to draw the appropriate inferences

in this case the court of appeals for the fourth circuit 192 f2d 477 also sustained the district court in dismissing applications for writs of habeas corpus based on the claim by the two petitioners here that their convictions for murder in the north carolina court were vitiated by disregard of rights guaranteed by the united states constitution but this case is unlike the brown and speller cases here the court of appeals did not find itself foreclosed to consider the merits by deeming itself bound by an adjudication of the merits in the supreme court of north carolina followed by a denial of a petition for certiorari in this court footnote 51 and the court here does not sustain

page 344 u s 557

the district courts dismissal by contending that the north carolina supreme court had already adjudicated the merits not does this court pass on the merits

this court sustains the lower courts on the ground that the right of review on the merits was foreclosed because the petitioners lost their right of review through failure to comply with the requirements of north carolina law for perfecting an appeal in the supreme court of north carolina state v daniels 231 nc 17 56 se2d 2 id 231 nc 341 56 se2d 646 id 232 nc 196 59 se2d 430

we were given to understand on the argument that if petitioners lawyer had mailed his statement of the case on appeal on the 60th day and the prosecutors office had received it on the 61st day the law of north carolina would clearly have been complied with but because he delivered it by hand on the 61st day all opportunities for appeal both in the north carolina courts and in the federal courts are cut off although the north carolina courts had discretion to hear this appeal for me it is important to emphasize the fact that north carolina does not have a fixed period for taking an appeal the decisive question is whether a refusal to exercise a discretion which the legislature of north carolina has vested in its judges is an act so arbitrary and so cruel in its operation considering that life is at stake that in the circumstances

page 344 u s 558

of this case it constitutes a denial of due process in its rudimentary procedural aspect

for here we are not dealing with a frivolous or even a tenuous claim of a denial of rights guaranteed under the united states constitution in the proceedings that led to a death sentence it suffices to quote what was said in dissent by circuit judge soper one of the most experienced and hardheaded of federal judges

there is no attempt on the part of the state of north carolina in the pending appeal to show that there was not a gross violation of the constitutional rights of the prisoners in the trial court

daniels v allen 192 f2d 763 770 771

and this statement was not questioned by the court of appeals

the basic reason for closing both the federal and state courts to the petitioners on such serious claims and under these circumstances is the jejune abstraction that habeas corpus cannot be used for an appeal judge soper dealt with the deceptiveness of this formula by quoting what judge learned hand had found to be the truth in regard to this generality thirty years ago

we shall not discuss at length the occasions which will justify resort to the writ where the objection has been open on appeal after a somewhat extensive review of the authorities twentyfour years ago i concluded that the law was in great confusion and the decisions since then have scarcely tended to sharpen the lines we can find no more definite rule than that the writ is available not only to determine points of jurisdiction stricti juris and constitutional questions but whenever else resort to it is necessary to prevent a complete miscarriage of justice

kulick v kennedy 157 f2d 811 813

page 344 u s 559

the reasons for finding that we have here so complete a miscarriage of justice are so powerfully stated by judge soper that i cannot do better than to adopt them as my own

the trial courts strict application of the procedural rules in a capital case in these two instances of rulings by that court preventing defendants attorneys from raising the jury question can hardly be approved as a proper exercise of judicial discretion the defendants merely asked for rulings which would have enabled them to obtain a review by the highest court of the state of the trial courts action on a grave constitutional question and the relief could have been granted without interfering with the enforcement of the criminal laws of the state it can hardly be doubted that the decision in each case lay within the discretion of the judge but once it was taken the supreme court of the state deemed itself powerless to interfere thus there is presented an impasse which can be surmounted only by a proceeding like that before this court we have been told time and again that legalistic requirements should be disregarded in examining applications for the writ of habeas corpus and the rules have been relaxed in cases when the trial court has acted under duress or perjured testimony has been knowingly used by the prosecution or a plea of guilty has been obtained by trick or the defendant has been inadequately represented by counsel footnote 52 hawk v olsen 326 u s 271

page 344 u s 560

darr v burford 339 u s 200 339 u s 203 it is difficult to see any material distinction in practical effect between these circumstances and the plight of the prisoners in the pending case who have been caught in the technicalities of local procedure and in consequence have been denied their constitutional right

footnote 51

although there was such a denial in this court no petition for certiorari was sought from the latest of the three decisions by the north carolina supreme court prior to the initiation of the habeas corpus proceedings now under review it is not inappropriate to say that the certiorari that was denied here affords a good illustration of the reason for holding that no legal significance attaches to such a denial it would be beyond the wit of the wisest panel of judges to determine on what ground for what reason the petition was denied the papers in the case do not afford a rational foundation for saying that it was this ground rather than that the conflicting bases for rejection not only may well have influenced different members of the court it is not at all unlikely that individual members of the court did not feel it necessary to determine which of two grounds was decisive

footnote 52

this language is of course not to be read to mean that constitutional rights may not be freely waived under appropriate circumstances conscious failure to appeal may constitute such waiver the very question here is whether there has been a failure to appealembed"
