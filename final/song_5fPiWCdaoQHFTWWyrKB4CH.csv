they wanna sell it out buy it up dumb it down
a good god is hard to find
join the crowd that wants to see me dead
right now i feel i belong for the first time

prechorus
multiply your death divide by sex
add up the violence and what do you get

chorus
we are all just stars and were waiting
we are all just scarred and were hating
we are all just stars on your burning flag

postchorus
you can point your gun at me and hope it will go away
if god was alive he would hate you anyway

verse 2
my right wing is flapping the left one is grey
lets hear it for the kids but nothing they say
they gyrate and grate on election day
we got our abcs and our fuck
fuck fuck

we are all just stars and were waiting
we are all just scarred and were hating
we are all just stars on your burning flag
