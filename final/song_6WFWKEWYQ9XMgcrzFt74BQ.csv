verse 1
new years eve
i was at a festival in new orleans
you were in tribeca kissing nobody
i owe you one yes i do
valentines day
we decided we would do the whole damn thing
but i played to an empty gym at iowa state
i guess i owe you that too

prechorus
i try so hard to be so happy are you happy too
doo doo doo doo

chorus
plan on this
youre no longer gonna be the plan i miss
i wont ever let you down
but just in case can we do christmas in june
oh my god
how lucky am i to have two things i love
makes it that much easiеr to fuck it up
in case i miss it can we do christmas in june

but if it ends up falling on our wedding day
oh god dont make me choose

prechorus
