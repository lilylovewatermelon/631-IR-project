walk you home to see where your livin around and i know this place
pour yourself on me and you know im the one that you wont forget

2nd verse
and in your denim eyes i see somethings awry and i see youre weak
when he comes around see your fixin to shine and my face wont speak

chorus
hate to be so emotional
i didnt aim to get physical
but when he pulled in and revved it up
i said you call that a pick up truck
and in the moonlight i throwed him down
kickin screamin  rolling around
a little piece of a bloody tooth
just so you know i was thinking of you
just so you know ohhhhh

3rd verse
tremblin misery and as cold as a hole
i hug your bones and skin cracklin woods gone white and my eyes swoll up now
i can see the light

chorus
hate to be so emotional
i didnt aim to get physical
but when he pulled in and revved it up
i said you call that a pick up truck
and in the moonlight i throwed him down
kickin screamin  rolling around
a little piece of a bloody tooth
just so you know i was thinking of you
just so you know ohhhhh

i didnt aim to get physical
but when he pulled in and revved it up
i said you call that a pick up truck
and in the moonlight i throwed him down
kickin screamin  rolling around
a little piece of a bloody tooth
just so you know i was thinking of you
just so you know ohhhhh4embed"
