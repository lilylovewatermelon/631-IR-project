verse 1 kev nish
yeah yeah
i never let love in i left it on the dresser
i never let love leave an impression
but like a fingerprint now i found you at my fingertips
and i just wanna text you every second
youre always on my mind like reflections on my shades
i gotta look away cause i could stare at you for days
i can give you every millisecond every day you you
you cant buy the time that i can give away

verse 2 prohgress
yeah yeah yeah
my life isnt measured by the breaths i take
but the moments with you that take my breath away
i dont need you in heels but i need your head over
come a little closer
rest your head up on my shoulder you you
now you got me smiling
blown cover
face with them cupcakes
no butter
they say love is blind but
youre so fine
if i keep you in my life id never close my eyes
