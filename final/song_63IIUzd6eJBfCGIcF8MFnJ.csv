i think im breaking out
im gonna leave you now
theres nothing for me here its all the same
and even though i know
that everything might go
go downhill from here im not afraid

chorus
way away away from here ill be
way away away so you can see
how it feels to be alone and not believe
feels to be alone and not believe
feels to be alone and not believe anything

verse 2
you cant stop me now
you cant hold me down
you cant keep me here im on my way
ive made it this far now
and im not burning out
no matter what you say im not afraid

chorus
way away away from here ill be
way away away so you can see
how it feels to be alone and not believe
feels to be alone and not believe
feels to be alone and not believe anything

letting out the noise inside of me
letting out the noise inside of me
every window pane is shattering
every window pane is shattering
cutting up my words before i speak
cutting up my words
this is how it feels to not believe
letting out the noise inside of me
letting out the noise inside of me
every window pane is shattering
cutting up my words before i speak
cutting up my words
this is how it feels to not believe

chorus
way away away from here ill be
way away away so you can see
how it feels to be alone and not believe
feels to be alone and not believe
feels to be alone and not believe anything3embed"
