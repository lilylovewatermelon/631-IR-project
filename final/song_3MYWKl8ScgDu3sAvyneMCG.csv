verse 1
i know everyone you know
you know everyone i know
our venn diagrams are one circle
you grow up when im not looking
we grow apart without knowing
and all of a sudden im leaving

chorus
so i say im sorry i cant ive got plans
as i watch the time slip through my hands
what you dont know now one day youll learn
that growing up is a heavy leaf to turn
a heavy leaf to turn

postchorus
take me with you
cause even on your own
you are not alone
take me with you
cause even by yourself
my love you are something else

verse 2
one summer turns into ten summers
one lover turns into ten others
but this memory is still with me
so close bring me in so close
your clothes underneath my clothes
once upon a time in portugal

so i say im sorry i cant ive got plans
as i watch the time slip through my hands
what you dont know now one day youll learn
that growing up is a heavy leaf to turn
a heavy leaf to turn

ohohohoh
no matter what you want

somebody else has got it worse
no matter when i got to you
ohohohoh
somebody else got to you first
