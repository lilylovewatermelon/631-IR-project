mother
youre holding my heart screaming
motherfucker
they left me broken bleeding
son of
the man you loved and left for
the son of a bitch
who tried to show me deaths door
everythings eliminated
everything is dedicated
tried to leave this life i hated
living it was overrated

chorus
love song for the dear departed
head stone for the broken hearted
arms to kill or flowers to steal
head trip for the mortal earthbound
one sip of the blood that i found
lying here im dying here

verse 2
ash and
obituaries rain down
and suddenly
were lying naked face down
whats it like decapitated
cant you see me fascinated
youre the only thing ive damaged
only death can be mismanaged

love song for the dear departed
head stone for the broken hearted
arms to kill or flowers to steal
head trip for the mortal earthbound
one sip of the blood that i found
lying here im dying here

verse 3
dont bring me daffodils
bring a bouquet of pills
seeds of geranium
cracked to the cranium
protect me when you can
respect me when i am dying

chorus
love song for the dear departed
head stone for the broken hearted
arms to kill or flowers to steal
head trip for the mortal earthbound
one sip of the blood that i found
lying here im dying here
love song for the dear departed
head stone for the broken hearted
arms to kill or flowers to steal
head trip for the mortal earthbound
one sip of the blood that i found
lying here im dying here2embed"
