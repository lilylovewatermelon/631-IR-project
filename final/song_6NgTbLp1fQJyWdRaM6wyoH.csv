one in the same
one is the time
that remains
snip back the weak before they give away
im twisted in knots from hard work and strain

chorus
ive been waiting so long for this time
im terrified
blind in ways ive never realized
i dont mind

all at a time
all in the same
califormula
ive become prey
strolling down
in my face
these tears im not crying
this will not kill me

chorus
ive been waiting so long for this time
im terrified
blind in ways ive never realized
i dont mind

we must realize
everyone kneads equally

ive been waiting so long for this time
im terrified
blind in ways ive never realized
