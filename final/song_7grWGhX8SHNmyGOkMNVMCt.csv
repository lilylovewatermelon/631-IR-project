never knew my old mans truck could even run like that
shouldve known better than to take that curve so fast
daddy pulled up i was down in a ditch
and he asked me why i did what i did

chorus
there was this girl drink in her hand
shootin me a lets get into trouble grin
i aint never seen somethin so fine
and i was doin anything to make her mine
i was out of my mind she was out of this world
there was this girl

verse 2
some folks ask me why i still pick this guitar
they say livin that life on the road wont get you very far
i say man you shouldve been down in tupelo
seen what was in the front row

chorus
there was this girl beer in her hand
shootin me a play a little skynyrd grin
shes turnin it up shes turnin me on
and id play her anything shed sing along
i was out of my mind she was out of this world
there was this girl
yeah there was this girl

didnt know a diamond ring could cost so much damn
took six months on a farm fore i saved up
all my drinkin buddies still out on the town
wonderin why i ever settled down

chorus
but there was this girl holdin my hand
shootin me a start a life together grin
shes pullin me in she straightened me out
and now i know what love is all about
im still out of my mind shes still out of this world
there was this girl
yeah there was this girl
yeah there was this girl
there was this girlembed"
