what is it about them
i must be missing something
they just keep doing nothing
too intoxicated to be scared
better off without them
theyre nothing but unstable
bring ashtrays to the table
and thats about the only thing they share

chorus
im in their secondhand smoke
still just drinking canned coke
i dont need a xanny to feel better
on designated drives home
only one whos not stoned
dont give me a xanny now or ever

interlude
can you check your uber rating oh my god
and its like wait like when

verse 2
wakin up at sundown ooh
theyre late to every party ooh
nobodys ever sorry ooh
too inebriated now to dance
morning as they come down come down
their pretty heads are hurting hurting
theyre awfully bad at learning learning
make the same mistakes blame circumstance

bridge
please dont try to kiss me on the sidewalk
on your cigarette break
i cant afford to love someone
who isnt dying by mistake in silver lake

outro
what is it about them
i must be missing something
they just keep doin nothing
too intoxicated to be scared
hmm hmm
hmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
come down
