verse 1 brent smith
let me tell you im vicious
not passiveaggressive
ive got my finger on the pulse
starin straight into a hole and i get it
and im a savage its automatic
i got a way of makin noise
the power to destroy with no static

prechorus brent smith
cause victory is all you need
so cultivate and plant the seed
hold your breath and count to ten
just count to ten

chorus brent smith
im gonna make it rain so ring the bell
i know it all too well
switchblade on the edge of your wrist
can i get a witness witness
cause agony brings no reward
for one more hit and one last score
dont be a casualty

verse 2 brent smith
you gotta feel courage
embrace possession
if it was easier to shatter everything that ever mattered
but its not because its your obsession
be a fighter backbone desire
complicated and it stings
but we both know what it means
and its time to get real and inspired

prechorus brent smith
cause victory is all you need
so cultivate and plant the seed
hold your breath and count to ten
just count to ten
just count to ten

chorus brent smith
im gonna make it rain so ring the bell
i know it all too well

can i get a witness witness
cause agony brings no reward
