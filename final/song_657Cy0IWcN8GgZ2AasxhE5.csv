oh lord jetson made another one

verse 1
pull out them racks on a nigga hes so funny
he talk the most shit but got no money
tough on the net but in person a new gandhi
stand on my racks and im mo bambi
i mean mo bamba anklets a new honda
i need threes with titi and with lashonda
i get right its on sight for you newcomers
i got two solid fists for you mouthrunners
with the gang out in public we ho hunters
kick that bitch out the spot like a team punter
think its time i run up me a bugatti
got this bitch ridin dick like a ducati
bought an ap plain jane out in dubai
actin out for attention the new guy
got another lawsuit need a new tie
know some niggas switched up turned ifá
know some niggas out west bangin treetop
made that bitch give me head til her knees pop
switchin sides on the gang tryna ease out
catch you slippin we knockin your teeth out
tryna come down my block need to reroute
tryna see all that shit that you talk bout
know its cap in your rap you aint gotta lie
in la with zack bia at nice guy
in la with zack bia at papis
im in houston ho huntin with tati
i just had me a smooth little ten piece
run it up
stick on my back like im huntin up
yeah if i let my dogs loose they gon run amuck
quick to pull up with them 30s tucked
see lil yachty liveget tickets as low as 45you might also likechorus
run up flatbread lay low stackin tall
hit his head once body dropped rest his soul
i got big guap big killers big pieces
she wan fuck the gang told that bitch to write a thesis
pull up all white lookin like im black jesus
and my new crib fancy like the saint regis
niggas sweet as shit turn em to a reeses pieces
diamonds shinin so damn bright give a nigga seizures

verse 2
nothin make me more happy than backends
im straight to no signal them racks in
these new niggas music is trashcan
he cant feed his fans so they fastin
he told em lets all go muslim
that bitch nigga aint out hustlin
i said take a sip why you guzzlin
give me my damn cup back nigga
im too rich to be out here tusslin
buddy just paid a rack for some tussin
hope he sick cause thats all that its good for
i wish that my big brother did more
i pray that my lil sister live long
paint the rari all yellow like armstrong
got a stock with a stick its an arm long
wow
heard they said i went broke boy was they wrong
i just cashed in a check its a phone number
bitch your ass on the porch like the door number
we gon track your ass down like lojack
why they playin with me i need more racks
to the money im runnin up four flat
this shit right here gon need four plaques
chorus
run up flatbread lay low stackin tall
hit his head once body dropped rest his soul
i got big guap big killers big pieces
she wan fuck the gang told that bitch to write a thesis
pull up all white lookin like im black jesus
and my new crib fancy like the saint regis
niggas sweet as shit turn em to a reeses pieces
diamonds shinin so damn bright give a nigga seizures8embed"
