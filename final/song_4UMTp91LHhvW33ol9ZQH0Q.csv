verse 1 eminem
ahem back by popular demand
now pop a little zantac for antacid if you can
youre ready to tackle any task that is at hand
how does it feel is it fantastic is it grand
well look at all the massive masses in the stands
shady man no dont massacre the fans
damn i think kim kardashians a man
she stomped him just ‘cause he asked to put his hands
on her massive gluteus maximus again
squeeze it then squish it then pass it to a friend
can he come back as nasty as he can
yes he can ken dont ask me this again
he does not mean to lesbian offend
but lindsay please come back to seeing men
samanthas a two youre practically a ten
i know you want me girl in fact i see you grin

and ill invite sarah palin out to dinner then
nail her baby say hello to my little friend
brit forget kfed lets cut off the middleman
forget him or youre gonna end up in the hospital again
and this time it wont be for the ritalin binge

never has there been such finesse and nostalgia
man cash i dont mean to mess with your gal but
jessica alba put her breasts on my mouth blup
wowzers i just made a mess in my trousers
and they wonder why i keep dressing like elvis
lord help us hes back in his pink alf shirt
looking like someone shrinked his outfit
i think hes bout to flip jessica
rest assured supermans here to rescue ya

with a saw blade in it to make my jailbreak
