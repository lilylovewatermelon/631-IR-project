dear friend how have you been
i think about you from time to time
some day id love to know
how you have grown since our last goodbye

chorus 1
i know the world is changing quickly
and i couldnt tell you why
its beyond my understanding
but id love it if we tried
growing older every moment
times falling through my hands
and i dont have to know the meaning
but id love to have a chance

verse 2
these days so much has changed
i stay awake though its hard sometimes
id love to know what you think
oh i miss when youd share what was on your mind

chorus 2
oh i just dont know how im doing
i leave my window open wide
and as far as im concerned
i forget from time to time
im so curious about you
i just saw you in my dream
you showed up just to surprise me
and disappeared so suddenly
apologies for being scattered
i just couldnt go to sleep
i hope you dont think that im crazy
if thats really what you think
sometimes i just feel so helpless
i spend hours in this room
trying to formulate my feelings
and clear the thought of you

dear friend how have you been
i think about you from time to time3embed"
