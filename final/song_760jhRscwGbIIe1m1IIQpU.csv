im the strong one im not nervous
im as tough as the crust of the earth is
i move mountains i move churches
and i glow cause i know what my worth is
i dont ask how hard the work is
got a rough indestructible surface
diamonds and platinum i find em i flatten em
i take what im handed i break whats demanded but

verse 1
under the surface
i feel berserk as a tightrope walker in a threering circus
under the surface
was hercules ever like yo i dont wanna fight cerberus
under the surface
im pretty surе im worthless if i cant be of servicе

prechorus
a flaw or a crack the straw in the stack
that breaks the camels back
what breaks the camels back its

chorus
pressure like a drip drip drip thatll never stop whoa
pressure thatll tip tip tip til you just go pop whoaohoh
give it to your sister your sisters older
give her all the heavy things we cant shoulder
who am i if i cant run with the ball
if i fall to
pressure like a grip grip grip and it wont let go whoa
pressure like a tick tick tick til its ready to blow whoaohoh
give it to your sister your sisters stronger
see if she can hang on a little longer
who am i if i cant carry it all
if i falter

under the surface
i hide my nerves and it worsens i worry somethin is gonna hurt us
under the surface
the ship doesnt swerve has it heard how big the iceberg is
under the surface
i think about my purpose can i somehow preserve this
line up the dominoes a light wind blows
you try to stop it tumbling but on and on it goes

bridge
but wait if i could shake the crushing weight of expectations
would that free some room up for joy
or relaxation or simple pleasure
instead we measure this growing pressure
keeps growing keep going cause all we know is

chorus
pressure like a drip drip drip thatll never stop whoa
pressure thatll tip tip tip til you just go pop whoaohoh
give it to your sister it doesnt hurt and
see if she can handle every family burden
watch as she buckles and bends but never breaks
no mistakes just
pressure like a grip grip grip and it wont let go whoa
pressure like a tick tick tick til its ready to blow whoaohoh
give it to your sister and never wonder
if the same pressure wouldve pulled you under
who am i if i dont have what it takes
no cracks no breaks
no mistakes no pressure40embed"
