i know youve been hurt by someone else
i can tell by the way you carry yourself
if you let me heres what ill do
ill take care of you ill take ill take
ive loved and ive lost

verse 1 drake
ive asked about you and they told me things
but my mind didnt change and i still feel the same
whats a life with no fun please dont be so ashamed
ive had mine youve had yours we both know we know
they wont get you like i will my only wish is i die real
cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
and you cant sleep thinkin that he lies still
so you cry still tears all in the pillowcase
big girls all get a little taste aw
pushing me away so i give her space aw
dealin with a heart that i didnt break
ill be there for you i would care for you
i keep thinking you just dont know
tryna run from that say you done with that
on your face girl it just dont show
when youre ready just say youre ready
when all the baggage just aint as heavy
and the partys over just dont forget me
well change the pace and well just go slow
you wont ever have to worry
you wont ever have to hide
and youve seen all my mistakes
so look me in my eyes

verse 2 drake
its my birthday ill get high if i want to
cant deny that i want you but ill lie if i have to
cause you dont say you love me
to your friends when they ask you
even though we both know that you do you do
one time been in love one time
you and all your girls in the club one time
all so convinced that youre followin your heart
cause your mind dont control what it does sometimes
we all have our nights though dont be so ashamed
ive had mine youve had yours we both know we know
you hate bein alone well you aint the only one
you hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
you love your friends but somebody shouldve told you somethin
to save you instead they say

i dont tell you you dont care if youre true
