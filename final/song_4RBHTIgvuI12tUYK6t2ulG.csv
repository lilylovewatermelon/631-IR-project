got an old dog it dont like me much
that thing starts to bark his head off every time we touch
sitting on the porch listening to the radio
we sing every single song we know
even the ones we dont
when she moves a little closer
she puts her hand in mine
oh what i wouldnt give just to stop the hands of time

chorus
shes got long blonde hair and big blue eyes
i got all i ever need when that girl is by my side
everything i love is there inside
a little brick house on the oklahomatexas line

verse 2
shes got a part time job at the tasteefreeze
she took the weekend off to spend a little bit of time with me
i got an old car we drove to the edge of town
we stopped by old man millers farm
just to watch the world spin around
and she moves a little closer
she puts her lips to mine
aint funny how the good lord out does himself sometimes

everything i love is there inside
a little brick house with a black top drive
big oak tree with our names carved on the side

chorus

oh here they come
long blonde hair and big blue eyes
everything i loveembed"
