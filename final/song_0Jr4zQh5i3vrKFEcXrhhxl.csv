as i ride on the city lights
i wonder who gon ride for me if it go down
and i start to get this feeling like
who gon be there for my sons the day that im not around

chorus
i hope you love me as much as i love you
i aint mean to break your heart but baby thats what thugs do
nothing in the world baby i wouldnt do for you
if i die right now its so much that i would lose

postchorus
ima tell you now i always be there for you
if it go down now i know baby joe gon shoot
if you go broke now they aint gon do shit for you
cant give up now nigga this the life i choose

im turnin up in the party celebratin all the shit that i did
i told my momma im a gangster ill never change the way that i live nah
