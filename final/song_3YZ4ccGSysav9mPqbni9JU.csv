i was a heavy heart to carry
my beloved was weighed down
my arms around his neck
my fingers laced to crown
i was a heavy heart to carry
my feet dragged across the ground
and he took me to the river
where he slowly let me drown

prechorus
my love has concrete feet
my loves an iron ball
wrapped around your ankles
over the waterfall

chorus
im so heavy
heavy heavy in your arms
im so heavy
heavy heavy in your arms

verse 2
and is it worth the wait
all this killing time
are you strong enough to stand
protecting both your heart and mine
who is the betrayer
whos the killer in the crowd
the one who creeps in corridors
and doesnt make a sound

my love has concrete feet
my loves an iron ball
wrapped around your ankles
over the waterfall
my love has concrete feet
my loves an iron ball
wrapped around your ankles
over the waterfall

chorus
im so heavy
heavy heavy in your arms
im so heavy heavy heavy heavy
heavy so heavy in your arms

bridge
this will be my last confession
i love you never felt like any blessing
oh
whispering like its a secret
uttered to condemn the one who hears it
with a heavy heart
whoa

chorus
heavy heavy heavy
heavy im so heavy in your arms
im so heavy heavy heavy
heavy im so heavy in your arms
im so heavy heavy heavy
heavy im so heavy in your arms
im so heavy heavy heavy
heavy im so heavy in your arms
postchorus
i was a heavy heart to carry
my beloved was weighed down
my arms around his neck
my fingers laced to crown
i was a heavy heart to carry
but he never let me down
when he had me in his arms
my feet never touched the ground

outro
im so heavy
heavy in your arms
heavy
im so heavy in your arms23embed"
