if all our life is but a dream fantastic posing greed
then we should feed our jewelry to the sea
for diamonds do appear to be
just like broken glass to me
and then she said she cant believe
genius only comes along in storms of fabled foreign tongues
tripping eyes and flooded lungs
northern downpour sends its love

chorus
hey moon please forget to fall down
hey moon dont you go down
sugarcane in the easy morning
weathervanes my one and lonely

verse 2
the ink is running toward the page its chasing off the days
look back at boat feet and that winding knee
i missed your skin when you were east
you clicked your heels and wished for me
through playful lips made of yarn that fragile capricorn
unraveled words like moths upon old scarves
i know the worlds a broken bone
but melt your headaches call it home

hey moon please forget to fall down
hey moon dont you go down
sugarcane in the easy morning
weathervanes my one and lonely

sugarcane in the easy morning
hey moon please forget to fall down

sugarcane in the easy morning
you are at the top of my lungs
weathervanes my one and lonely
drawn to the ones who never yawn
