i attached my favorite red sticker also
helmet and parachute
i prepared them in pairs
tuturu…　tuturu…
it was easy so far
there was only one thing left to prepare for my travel

i dug up the ground here and there
i ambushed from him at the mailbox with a letter coming
i checked under the table also
i asked a wanderer
tuturu…　tuturu…
he is nowhere to be seen i can’t find
a friend who will travеl together

wherе is my friend smiley？
your name is definitely smiley
mm〜 have you seen smiley？
i give it to you because i felt like it
where is my friend smiley？
the friend im searching for smiley
he hey where is smiley？ his name is smiley

we should be able to throw popcorn into the sky and laugh together
you might also likemigratory birds carrying balloons
say they would like to fly to the south soon
let’s go before the cold winter comes
ah where are you
tuturu…　tuturu…
the sheep cloud invited me on a travel
a standing shadow was the only me

i go around a country i don’t know
i put the same memories on this balloon
it through the wind on every corner of the wide sky
i think the two of us could go
tuturu…　tuturu…
i wonder if we will spend this winter here again this year
all that is smiley even though it’s only you

where is my friend smiley？
you are my friend havent met yet
mm〜 have you seen smiley？
someday ill definitely find you
where is my friend smiley？
the balloons already being inflated
he hey where is smiley？ his name is smiley
i can’t fly away without you so my heart is heavy
where is my friend smiley？
your name is definitely smiley
mm〜 have you seen smiley？
i give it to you because i felt like it
where is my friend smiley？
the friend im searching for smiley
he hey where is smiley？ his name is smiley
we should be able to throw popcorn into the sky and laugh together
i don’t know just a name
my friend…embed"
