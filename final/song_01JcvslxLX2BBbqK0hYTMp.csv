turn the lights on

verse 1
how could someone hurt you
but still make you feel so good
holler scream and curse you and you stand there and let them do it
just cause he gives you pain that don’t mean he ain’t the one
fuck you out your brain you’ll be smiling when he’s done

prechorus
so my advice would be no don’t leave
don’t go so easy
let that argument turn you on
it’s worth it

chorus
and these are the lessons learned by lovers
these are the reasons we make love
there’s no exception one day
we gotta look each other in the eye
you learn all these lessons when you’re in love
a lesson for the lover the lover
a lesson for the lover the lover

verse 2
so hard to imagine
living life without them there
cause now you’re so caught up in the passion
but this shit is beyond compare
cause dont it make your heart beat beat beat like a drum
you fall hard but think about how hard you come

so my advice would be no don’t leave
don’t go so easy
let that argument turn you on
it’s worth it

chorus
and these are the lessons learned by lovers

we gotta look each other in the eye
you learn all these lessons when you’re in love
a lesson for the lover the lover
a lesson for the lover the lover

bridge
no one wants to be fighting
all day long all night long
so well just scream till we start making love
and as time goes on were feeling
okay babe alright love
and well forget about it in the morning

chorus
