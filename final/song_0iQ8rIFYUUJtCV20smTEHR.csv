oh my god im such a terrible mess
im turned on by the tabloids you would never have guessed
that im a sucker for their gossip man i take it too far
i bottle up my hollywood and watch em name their kids after cars

prechorus
im finding me out
im having my doubts
im losing the best of me

chorus
were all part of the same sick little games
and i need a getaway getaway
im wasting my days i throw them away
losing it all on these sick little games

verse 2
i fell in love she was the friend of a sister
of somebody famous  at least for a day
expensive habits and a taste for the town
had me chasing down red carpets
and watching all my friends slip away

prechorus
theyre finding me out
im having my doubts
im losing the best of me
dressed up as myself
to live in the shadow
of who im supposed to be
see all time low liveget tickets as low as 114you might also likechorus
were all part of the same sick little games
and i need a getaway getaway
im wasting my days i throw them away
losing it all on these sick little games

bridges
if i play my cards right
i can make the big time
i could be a reason to stare
caught up in the spotlight
shaking from the stage fright
how did i end up here

chorus
were all part of the same sick little games
and i need a getaway getaway
were all part of the same sick little games
and i need a getaway getaway
im wasting my days i throw them away
losing it all on these sick little games
were all part of the same sick little games
and i need a getaway getaway2embed"
