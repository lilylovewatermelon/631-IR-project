i think im going to stay home
have myself a home life
sitting in the slowmo
and listening to the daylight
i am not a nomad
i am not a rocket man
i was born a house cat
by the slight of my mothers hand
i think im going to stay home

prechorus
i want to live in the center of a circle
i want to live on the side of a square
i used to be in my mz now
youll never find me cause my name isnt there

chorus
home life
been holding out for a home life
my whole life

verse 2
i want to see the end game
i want to learn her last name
finish on a friday
and sit in traffic on the highway
see i refuse to believe
that my lifes going to be
just some string of incompletes
never to lead me to anything remotely close to a home life
see john mayer liveget tickets as low as 99you might also likechorus
been holding out for a home life
my whole life

bridge
i can tell you this much
i will marry just once
and if it doesnt work out
give her half of my stuff
its fine with me
we said eternity
and i will go to my grave
with the life that i gave
not just some melody line
on a radio wave
it dissipates
and soon evaporates
but home life doesnt change home life doesnt change

prechorus
i want to live in the center of a circle
i want to live on the side of a square
id love to walk to where we both can talk but
ive got to leave you cause my ride is here

chorus
in my home life
you take the home life
you keep the home life
ill come back for the home life
i promise
home life i promise
life
home life
