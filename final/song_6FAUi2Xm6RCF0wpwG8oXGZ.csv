we take sour sips from lifes lush lips
and we shake shake shake the hips in relationships
stomp out this disaster town
youll put your eyes to the sun and say i know
youre only blinding to keep back what the clouds are hiding

prechorus 1 patrick stump
and we might have started singing just a little soon
were throwing stones at a glass moon

chorus patrick stump
whoa oh were so miserable and stunning
whoa oh love songs for the genuinely cunning whoa oh

verse 2 patrick stump
we keep the beat with your blistered feet
we bullet the words at the mockingbirds singing
slept through the weekend and dreaming
of sinking with the melody of the cliffs of eternity
got postcards from my former selves saying how you been

prechorus 2 patrick stump
we might have said goodbyes just a little soon
stomp out this disaster town
robbing lips and kissing banks under this moon
see fall out boy liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likechorus patrick stump
whoa oh were so miserable and stunning
whoa oh love songs for the genuinely cunning
whoa oh were so miserable and stunning
whoa oh love songs for the genuinely cunning whoa oh
bridge pete wentz
it was ice cream headaches and sweet avalanche
when the pearls in our shells got up to dance
you call me a bad tipper of the cradle
tired yawns for fawns on hunters lawns
were the hasbeens of husbands
sharpening the knives of young wives
take two years and call me when youre better
take teardrops of mine find yourself wetter

chorus patrick stump
whoa oh were so miserable and stunning
whoa oh love songs for the genuinely cunning
whoa oh were so miserable and stunning
whoa oh love songs for the genuinely cunning whoa oh14embed"
