i was meant to be by your side
and i have waited here a long time
for you to turn around and notice me
but now youre here holding hands with me
mmm

chorus
walk me down the middle of the county fair
walk me down the middle like you dont care
walk me by the ferris wheel and make sure that she sees
let the whole world know you belong to me

verse 2
ive heard about your bitter end
bout how she stole your heart and put it back again
well i may not be the prettiest girl around
but i sure am a sight for sore sore eyes

chorus
walk me down the middle of main street
walk me down where the whole town will be
i dont need no parade but make sure that she sees
let the whole world know you belong to me yeah

id walk through fire for you
walk through barbed wire for you
id walk miles its true
just to be with you
prechorus
if youll walk me down the middle of my mamas church
walk me down that aisle in your finest shirt

let the whole world know
you will walk me down the middle of the county fair
oh walk me down the middle like you dont care
walk me by the ferris wheel and make sure they all see
let the whole world know you belong to me
