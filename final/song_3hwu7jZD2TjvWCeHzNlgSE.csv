everybody tells me its bout time that i moved on
that i need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
but my heart is a valley its so shallow and manmade
im scared to death if i let you in that youll see im just a fake
sometimes i feel lonely in the arms of your touch
but i know thats just me cause nothing ever is enough
when i was a child i grew up by the river lea
there was something in the water now that somethings in me

prechorus
oh i cant go back
but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
i cant go back to the river

chorus
but its in my roots in my veins
in my blood and i stain
every heart that i use to heal the pain
oh its in my roots in my veins
in my blood and i stain
every heart that i use to heal the pain

postchorus
so i blame it on the river lea the river lea the river lea
yeah i blame it on the river lea the river lea the river lea

i should probably tell you now before its way too late
that i never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face
consider this my apology i know its years in advance
but i would rather say it now in case i never get the chance

prechorus
no i cant go back
but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
i cant go back to the river

chorus
but its in my roots in my veins
in my blood and i stain
every heart that i use to heal the pain
oh its in my roots in my veins
in my blood and i stain
every heart that i use to heal the pain

postchorus
so i blame it on the river lea the river lea the river lea
yeah i blame it on the river lea the river lea the river lea
so i blame it on the river lea the river lea the river lea
yeah i blame it on the river lea the river lea the river lea
