im having trouble trying to sleep
im counting sheep but running out
as time ticks by still i try
no rest for crosstops in my mind

refrain
on my own here we go
chorus
my eyes feel like theyre gonna bleed
dried up and bulging out my skull
my mouth is dry my face is numb
fucked up and spun out in my room

refrain
on my own here we go

verse 2
my mind is set on overdrive
the clock is laughing in my face
a crooked spine my senses dulled
past the point of delirium

refrain
on my own here we go
see green day liveget tickets as low as 49you might also likechorus
my eyes feel like theyre gonna bleed
dried up and bulging out my skull
my mouth is dry my face is numb
fucked up and spun out in my room

refrain
on my own here we go
