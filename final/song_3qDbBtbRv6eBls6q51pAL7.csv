verse 1 oddy nuff da now leopard
uh
fuck an introduction bitch you already know
uicide death row
ridin slowmo in a fourdoor with no hoes
kickin it toe to toe with the popo
all of the smoke that i blow ill become a noshow
oddy nuff da now leopard got your hoe froze in a snow globe
leave em hollering oh no
more so when i pour up
when i glow up dont show up
you know what dont throw up the motherfucking set
59 on the grey place a bet
slit wrist same color as the vette uh
cigarette smoke etiquette
forget the old testament
im more reckless than the almighty heaven sent
yeah we never fuckin met again
snake skin belt cuttin off my blood flow
check the motherfuckin severance
jacket full of bullets check the motherfucking letterman

verse 2 yung carecrow
tickyticky time thats why its uicide til the fucking afterlife
keepin a fucking knife right next to the seat
thinkin you wanna die when you move close to me
nosebleeds for the dope fiends sleepin next to me
hopefully ima just be in a bad dream
but it seems that the codeine turned me into a dope fiend
now i’m ridin in a nightmare as my mind screams
for that mo money mo murder
mo junkies mo servin mo runnin
no turnin no swervin on an icecold road
yung carecrow be lookin like death row
bloodcolored bathrobe with an icecold ho ya know
fiftynine grey killers lookin for a fucking homicide

lifes a bitch and then you die thats why we get high
