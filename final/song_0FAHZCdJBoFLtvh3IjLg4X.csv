here we go

verse 1
dance with the devil inside of me
im longing for a second chance
and taste what seems to remind me
of all my skulls and skeletons

chorus 1
live and let live
die and let die
war and peace in my head my temptations
this war and peace inside will take me to the end

verse 2
hell awaits
its closing in on me
it strokes its hand down on my back
and no more mistakes
my intentions are finally clear from how ive always been

chorus 2
live and let live
die and let die
live and let live
die and let die
war and peace in my head my temptations
this war and peace inside wont end
war and peace in my head
this war and peace inside my head will take me to the end

outro
war and peace in my head my temptations
this war and peace inside wont end
war and peace in my head
this war and peace inside my head will take me to the endembed"
