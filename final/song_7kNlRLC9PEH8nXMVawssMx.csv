verse 2 eminem

girl forget remorse ima hit you broads
with chriss force like you pissed him off
talented with the tongue mafucker
you aint got a lick in yours
hittin licks like im robbin liquor stores
makin cash registers shit their drawers
think you spit the rawest
im an uncooked slab of beef layin on your kitchen floor
other words im off the meat rack
bring the beat back bring in two extension cords
ima measure my dick—shit i need six inches more
fuck my dicks big bitch need i remind you
that i dont need the fuckin swine flu to be a sick pig
youre addicted im dope
im the longest needle around here—need a fix ock
im the big shot—get it dicksnots
youre just small pokes little pricks
girl you think that other pricks hot
ill drink gasoline and eat a lit match
before i sit back and let him get hotter
better call the cops on him quick fast
shadys right back on your bitchass
white trash with a half a sixpack in his hatchback
trailer hitch attached to the back dispatch
chorus pnk
you can sound the alarm you can call out your guards
you can fence in your yard you can hold all the cards
but i wont back down
oh no i wont back down oh no

verse 3 eminem
bitch am i the reason that your boyfriend stopped rappin
does a bird chirp does lil wayne slurp zurp
til he burps and smoke purp
does a word search get circles wrapped around it
like you do when i come through
id like you to remind yourself of what the fuck i can do
when im on the mic
oh youre the kind of girl that i could take a likin to
psych im spikin you like a football
been this way since i stood a foot tall
youre a good catch with a shitty spouse
got a pretty mouth and a good jaw
give me good brain watch the woodgrain
dont want no cum stain—bitch you listenin
tryin to turn me down slut im talkin to you
turn me back up are you insane
tryin to talk over me in the car
shut the fuck up while my shits playin
im a shit stain on the underwear of life
whats the saying where theres thunder there is lightning
and they say that it never strikes twice in the same place
then how the fuck have i been hit six times
in three different locations on four separate occasions
and you can bet your stankin ass
that ive come to smash everything in my path
fork was in the road took the psycho path
poison ivy wouldnt have me thinkin rash
so hit the dancefloor cutie while i do my duty
on this microphone shake your booty shorty
im the shit—why you think proof used to call me doody
chorus pnk
you can sound the alarm you can call out your guards
you can fence in your yard you can hold all the cards
but i wont back down
oh no i wont back down oh no62embed"
