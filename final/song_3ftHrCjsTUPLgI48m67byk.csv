this is a song called plush

verse 1
and i feel that times a wasted go
so where you goin til tomorrow
and i see that these are lies to come
but would you even care

prechorus
and i feel it
and i feel it

chorus
where you goin to tomorrow
where you goin with the mask i found
and i feel and i feel when the dogs begin to smell her
will she smell alone

verse 2
and i feel so much depends on the weather
so is it rainin in your bedroom
and i see that these are the eyes of disarray
would you even care

prechorus
and i feel it
and she feels it

where you goin to tomorrow
where you goin with the mask i found
and i feel and i feel when the dogs begin to smell her
will she smell alone

got time time to wait for tomorrow
to find it to find it to find it
when the dogs do find her
got time time to wait for tomorrow
to find it to find it to find it
