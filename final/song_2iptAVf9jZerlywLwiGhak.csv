late at night i could hear the crying
i hear it all trying to fall asleep
when all the love around you is dying

prechorus
how do you stay so strong
how did you hide it all for so long
how can i take the pain away
how can i save

chorus
a fallen angel in the dark
never thought youd fall so far
fallen angel close your eyes
i wont let you fall tonight
fallen angel

verse 2
you do it all for my own protection
you make me feel like ill be okay
still i have so many questions

prechorus
how do you stay so strong
how did you hide it all for so long
how can i take the pain away
how can i save
