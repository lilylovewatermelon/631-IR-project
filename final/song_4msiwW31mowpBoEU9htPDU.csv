verse 1 patrick stump
are you ready for another bad poem
one more offkey anthem
let your teeth sink in
remember me as i was not as i am
and i said ill check in tomorrow
if i dont wake up dead
i kept wishing she had blonde ambition
and shed let it go to my head

cause its never getting any better than this

refrain courtney love patrick stump

this is what we do baby we nightmare you

verse 2 patrick stump
im about to make your sweat roll backwards
and your heart beat in reverse
our guts cant be reworked
as alone as a little white church in the middle of the desert getting burned
but ill take your heart served up two ways
i sing a bitter song
im the lonelier version of you
i just dont know where it went wrong

bridge courtney love patrick stump
shes sick and shes wrong shes young dirty blonde
and you sink inside her like a suicide bomb
he says ive seen bigger she says ive lit better
and they throw the matches down into the glitter
not a dry eye left in the house
talk less mean more
go boy go boy run for your life
lets be electric like we were before
go boy go boy run for your life
talk less mean more
go boy go boy run for your life
