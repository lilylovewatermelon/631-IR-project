its hard to tell from where im sitting
they say that this is where the fun begins
guess its time that i was quitting

a slight figure of speech
i cut my chest wide open
they come and watch us bleed
is it all like i was hoping now

they said i hope that you will never change
i went and cut my hair
they said dont take your business to the big town
i bought us tickets there

a slight figure of speech
i cut my chest wide open
they come and watch us bleed
is it all like i was hoping now

what did you expect
and what did you forget
that to live you let go of me with each step
it becomes a progression i wont let regret manifest
to aggression
are you to assess what ive been what i am or become
did you stop to accept how pathetically dumb
it can be to
attack those around cause youre
true to color a town a time or a place
its not you its not mine
and besides it is gone
and you never will find it again
but i dont want to fight
i just ask let me be
i wont give the chance to be my enemy
so go home
think it through
see the avett brothers liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likea jet plane and a big idea
i jump over the seat
what ifs hot on my trail
but they cant catch me no

a slight figure of speech
i cut my chest wide open
they come and watch us bleed
is it all like i was hoping nowembed"
