it was 648 i was walking home
stepped through the gate and im all alone
i had chicken on the plate but the food was cold
then i covered up my face so that no one knows
i didnt want trouble im the boy in the bubble
but then came trouble
when my mom walked into the living room
she said boy you gotta tell me what they did to you
i said you dont wanna know the things i had to do
she said son you gotta tell me why youre black and blue
i said i didnt want trouble im the boy in the bubble
but then came trouble

prechorus
and my heart was pumping chest was screaming
mind was running air was freezing
put my hands up put my hands up
i told this kid im ready for a fight

chorus
punch my face do it cause i like the pain
every time you curse my name
i know you want the satisfaction its not gonna happen
knock me out kick me when im on the ground
its only gonna let you down
come the lightning and the thunder
youre the one wholl suffer suffer

well i squared him up left my chest exposed
he threw a quick left hook and it broke my nose
i had thick red blood running down my clothes
and a sick sick look cause i like it though
i said i didnt want trouble im the boy in the bubble
but then came trouble

prechorus
and my heart was pumping chest was screaming
mind was running nose was bleeding
put my hands up put my hands up
i told this kid im ready for a fight

chorus
punch my face do it cause i like the pain
every time you curse my name
i know you want the satisfaction its not gonna happen
knock me out kick me when im on the ground
its only gonna let you down
come the lightning and the thunder
youre the one wholl suffer

verse 3
it was 648 he was walking home
with the blood on his hands from my broken nose
but like every other day he was scared to go
back to his house cause his pops was home
drowning his troubles in whiskey bubbles
just looking for trouble
well theres no excuse for the things he did
but theres a lot at home that hes dealing with
because his dads been drunk since he was a kid
and i hope one day that hell say to him
put down those bubbles and that belt buckle
in this broken bubble
chorus
punch my face do it cause i like the pain
every time you curse my name
i know you want the satisfaction its not gonna happen
knock me out kick me when im on the ground
its only gonna let you down
come the lightning and the thunder
youre the one wholl suffer suffer55embed"
