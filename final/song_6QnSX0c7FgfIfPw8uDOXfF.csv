a house on fire
a wall of stone
a door that once was open
an empty face and empty bones

verse 2
who ate your heart
youre cold inside
youre not the one i hoped for
ill see you on the other side
ill see you on the other side

chorus
the wind wouldnt blow me home
to lie in your heart of hearts
will i ever see you again
and lie in your heart of hearts
