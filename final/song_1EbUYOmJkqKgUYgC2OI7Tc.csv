were goin down the road
towards tiny cities made of ashes
im gonna hit you on the face
im gonna punch you in your glasses oh no
i just got a message that said
yeah hell has frozen over
i got a phone call from the lord sayin
hey boy get a sweater right now

bridge
so were drinkin drinkin drinkin drinkin
coca coca cola
i can feel it rollin right on down
oh right on down my throat
and as were headed down the road
towards tiny cities made of ashes
im gonna get dressed up in plastic
gonna shake hands with the masses
oh no

chorus
does anybody know a way that a body could get away
does anybody know a way
does anybody know a way that a body could get away
does anybody know a way
see modest mouse liveget tickets as low as 76you might also likeverse 2
were goin down the road
towards tiny cities made of ashes
im goin to hit you on the face
im goin to punch you in your glasses
im wearin myself a tshirt
that says the world is my ashtray
our hearts pump dust
and our hairs all gray
and i just got a message that says
yeah hell has frozen over
i got a phone call from the lord sayin
hey boy get a sweater right now

chorus
does anybody know a way that a body could get away
does anybody know a way
does anybody know a way

bridge 2
were drinkin drinkin drinkin drinkin
coca coca cola
i can feel it rollin right on down
oh right on down my throat
and as were headed down the road
towards tiny cities made of ashes
im gonna lay down in the spa
where they coat you in molasses right now
chorus
does anybody know a way that a body could get away
does anybody know a way
does anybody know a way that a body could get away
does anybody know a way
