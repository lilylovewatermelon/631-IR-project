i wanna fall inside your ghost
and fill up every hole inside my mind
and i want everyone to know
that i am half a soul divided

chorus
sometimes we will die
and sometimes we will fly away
either way youre by my side
until my dyin days
and if im not there and im far away
i said dont be afraid
i said dont be afraid
were goin home

verse 2
i wanna strip myself of breath
a breathless piece of death ive made for you
a mortal rotting piece of song
will help me carry on but at least you heard

chorus
oh sometimes we will die
and sometimes we will fly away
either way youre by my side
until my dyin days
and if im not there and im far away
i said dont be afraid
i said dont be afraid
were goin home

okay
so the hearse ran out of gas
a passenger person grabbed a map
and the driver inside it contrived a new route to save the past
and checked his watch and grabbed a cab
a beautifully plain taxi cab
a cab had a cleared out back
and two men started to unpack
driving once again but now this time there were three men
and then i heard one of them say
i know the night will turn to gray
i know the stars will start to fade
when all the darkness fades away
we had to steal him from his fate
so he could see another day
and then i cracked open my box
someone must have picked the lock
a little light revealed the spot where my fingernails had fought
then i pushed it open more pushing up against the door
then i sat up off the floor
and found the breath i was searchin for
then there were three men up front
all i saw were backs of heads
and then i asked am i alive and well
or am i dreaming dead
then one turned around to say
were driving toward the morning sun
where all your blood is washed away
and all you did will be undone
outro
i said dont be afraid
i said dont be afraid
