heavy metal love of mine
i should have learned to let you stay
you didnt want me all the time
but you were worth it anyway

prechorus
cause you were so much better
than the rest of them
out of all the others
you were the honest man

chorus
he loved guns and roses
guns and roses
he loved guns and roses
he loved guns
and roses roses roses

verse 2
motorcycle love divine
i should have learned to let you play
i wasnt the marrying kind
i should have done it anyway

prechorus
we should have left las vegas
and then began again
took your bike to detroit
back to the promised land
