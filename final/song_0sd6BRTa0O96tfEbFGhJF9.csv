verse 1
i woke up this morning and figured id call you
in case im not here tomorrow
im hopin that i can borrow
a peace of mind im behind on whats really important
my mind is really distorted
i find nothing but trouble in my life
im fortunate you believe in a dream
this orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
and last night was just another distraction
or a reaction of what we consider madness
i know exactly what happened
you ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up
but the type of bullet that stuck
had went against his will thats blood spilled on your hands
my plans rather vindictive
everybodys a victim in my eyes
when i ride its a murderous rhythm
and outside became pitch black
a demon glued to my back whispering get em
i got em and i aint give a fuck
that same mentality i told my brother not to duck
in actuality its a trip how we trip off of colors
i wonder if ill ever discover a passion like you and recover
the life that i knew as a youngin
in pajamas and duntaduns
when thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb
niggas like me never prosper
prognosis of a problem child im proud and welldevoted
this piru shit been in me forever
so forever ima push it wherever whenever
and i love you cause you love my brother like you did
just promise me youll tell this story when you make it big
and if i die before your album drop i hope— gunshots

i said when the lights shut off and its my turn
to settle down my main concern

verse 2
you wrote a song about my sister on your tape
and called it section80
the message resembled brendas got a baby
whats crazy was i was hearin about it
but doubted your ignorance
how could you ever just put her on blast and shit
judgin her past and shit
well its completely my future
her nigga behind me right now askin for ass and shit
and ima need that forty dollars
even if i got to fuck suck and swallow
in the parking lot gonzales park im followed
by a married man and father of three
my titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin keys
matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with es
he got a cousin named david and i seen him last week
this is the life of another girl damaged by the system
these foster homes i run away and never do miss em
see my hormones just run away and if i can get em
back to where they used to be then ill probably be in the denim
of a family gene that show women how to be woman
or better yet a leader you need her to learn somethin
then you probably need to beat her thats how i was taught
three niggas in one room first time i was tossed
and im exhausted but fuck that sorry for your loss shit
my sister died in vain but what point are you tryna gain
if you cant fit the pumps i walk in
ill wait… your rebuttal a little too late
and if you have a album date just make sure im not in the song
cause i dont need the attention bring enough of that on my own
and matter fact did i mention that i physically feel great
a doctors approval is a waste of time i know im straight
ill probably live longer than you and never fade away
ill never fade away ill never fade away i know my fate
and im on the grind for this cake ima get it or die tryin
im eyein every male gender with intentions of buyin
you lyin to these motherfuckers
talkin about you can help em with my story
you can help me if you sell this pussy for me nigga
dont ignore me nigga fuck your glory nigga you aint shit…
chorus
when the lights shut off and its my turn
to settle down my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
i said when the lights shut off and its my turn
to settle down my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me

verse 3
sometimes i look in the mirror
and ask myself am i really scared of passin away
if its today i hope i hear a
cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon
with the holy ghost til it drown in the blood of jesus
i wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin
the scent of a reaper ensurin that my allegiance
with the other side may come soon and if im doomed
may the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
i suffer a lot
and every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
i tie my stomach in knots
and im not sure why im infatuated with death
my imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
that can come about cause the tongue is mighty powerful
and i can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
maybe cause im a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
really stuck in the schema of wonderin when ima rest
and youre right your brother was a brother to me
and your sisters situation was the one that pulled me
in a direction to speak on somethin
thats realer than the tv screen
by any means wasnt tryin to offend or come between
her personal life i was like it need to be told
cursin the life of twenty generations after her soul
exactly whatd happen if i aint continue rappin
or steady bein distracted by money drugs and 45s
i count lives all on these songs
look at the weak and cry pray one day youll be strong
fightin for your rights even when youre wrong
and hope that at least one of you sing about me when im gone
am i worth it did i put enough work in
chorus
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
i said when the lights shut off and its my turn
to settle down my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
