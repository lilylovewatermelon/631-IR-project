bet every dollar mom’s a model but you’re better yet
just 21 out on the run and turning every head
your body’s built just like a weapon and you’re using it

but the devil can hear you when you say

c’mon and get up get up
move your body use your body
lose control
rub it right up back up
against my body
take my body make it yours so get up

we’re gonna light this room on fire
yeah you and i will burn it up tonight so get up
the two of us are gonna fuel this fire
no way in hell we’re slowing down tonight

and just for fun we take your tongue and run it over my lip
you gotta love the way she does it for the hell of it
we’re in positions that most people only say they know
you’ve got your hand right on a landmine ready to blow

but the devil can hear you when you say
you might also likec’mon and get up get up
move your body use your body
lose control
rub it right up back up
against my body
take my body make it yours so get up

we’re gonna light this room on fire
yeah you and i will burn it up tonight so get up
the two of us are gonna fuel this fire
no way in hell we’re slowing down tonight

you want me tapping on your back door
you’ve got me tapping on your back door baby
i’ve got you acting like you want more
now that i’m tapping on your back door baby

but the devil can hear you when you say
