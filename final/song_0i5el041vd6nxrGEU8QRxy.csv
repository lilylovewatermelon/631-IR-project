baby you a song
you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
ayy baby

verse 1
yeah when i first saw that bikini top on her
sheâ€™s poppin right out of the south georgia water
thought oh good lord she had them long tanned legs
couldnt help myself so i walked up and said

chorus
well baby you a song you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
down a back road blowin stop signs through the middle every little farm town with you
and this brand new chevy with a lift kit would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it heh
so baby you a song you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

verse 2
well she was sippin on southern and singin marshall tucker
we were fallin in love in the sweet heart of summer
she hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
fire it up lets go get this thing stuck

chorus
baby you a song you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
down a back road blowin stop signs through the middle every little farm town with you
and this brand new chevy with a lift kit would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it heh
so baby you a song you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

when that summer sun fell to his knees
i looked at her and she looked at me
and i turned on those kc lights and drove all night
because it felt so right her and i man we felt so right

bridge
i put it in park and grabbed my guitar
and strummed a couple chords
and sang from the heart
girl you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin
hell i cant get you out of my head

interlude
baby you a song you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise hahaha
down a back road blowin stop signs through the middle every little farm town with you

chorus
well baby you a song you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
down a back road blowin stop signs through the middle every little farm town with you
and this brand new chevy with a lift kit would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it come on
baby you a song you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
