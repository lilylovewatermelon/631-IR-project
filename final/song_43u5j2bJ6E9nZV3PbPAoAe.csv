intro wildchild
madvillain

verse 1 wildchild
jump on the track with a hardcore hustle
with a busload a niggas this time we brought yall muscle
wildchilds the one to uplift most and its confirmed
so tonight lets bang this madvillain music till its adjourned yeah
who rushes in head first with the full force of a ram
so the source of the verse coerces the course of a jam yeah
went to hell and back saw devil sellin crack
in fact had to come back with the brother with the mask by yellin black
power to the people who support raw music
blessed from the start to keep upliftin progressive art yeah
to come out and uplift words take verbalistic leaps
to the next splurge concoct dope poetical excerpts
whos the expert wild with the physical frame
whos mental was tamed to get over in this musical game
when the madvillain breaks your dome youll see your interval depth
was written for those that slept uhhuh
we took onehundred per cent unpredictable steps

interlude wildchild
say what
you might also likeverse 2 wildchild
whos the one that rocked up a party with the vigilance urge
when smokin the ism the vision is blurred but vengeance is heard uh
and just when ya got caught up in the cynical thought
intervals in the shape of a mic get pushed straight through your heart like
outro samples
screams with the sound of someone getting a mic pushed straight through their still beating heart while moaning orgasmically9embed"
