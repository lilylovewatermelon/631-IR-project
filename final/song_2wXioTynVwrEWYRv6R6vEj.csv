i need you to fill the void
i wonder how i got by this week
i only touched you once
lately i cant find a beat
i used to feel the rush

verse 1
started with a little bit
now i dont know how to quit
always feel inadequate
same way that my daddy did
mama told me not to try
and i should have taken her advice
and now im all twisted
when its all gone i miss it

refrain
ill try just to do somethin
ill try cause i got nothin
else that gets me through the day
til i find another way
ill try just to do somethin
ill try cause i got nothin
even if i lose again
i wont quit

chorus
and now i need you to feel the vibe
i need you to see the point
i need you to feel alive
i need you to fill the void

verse 2
my insecurities are
my own worst enemy yeah
somethings not lettin me
move the way i used to
thought you could better me but
then you stopped lettin me walk
now youre just settin me off
so im tryna lose you

refrain
ill fight just to do somethin
ill fight cause i got nothin
else that gets me through the day
til i find another way
ill fight just to do somethin
ill fight cause i got nothin
even if i lose again
i cant quit mmm
