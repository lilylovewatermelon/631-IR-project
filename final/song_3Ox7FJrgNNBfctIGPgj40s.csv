why did you go
where did you take my love

you left me abandoned
girl cause if its passion that you want
gave it to you thousands on thousands times over
you said that my love get you drunk
we made love every night never let you stay sober
oh you haffi pin the blame pon me like a poster

girl if i didnt want you woulda let you go
woulda let you know
stop the confusion
stop the illusion
its only you on my mind
its only you all the time
and i need you to stop the accusations

determined to fah love you long i need patience
