bitter baby mama
always point her finger at a nigga whenever its a problem
always put the blame on a nigga instead of tryna solve it

and you know i dont know if the rumors are true
i dont know i dont care its not my business but if it is true
dont let bitches like make
dont let them feel like they have a oneup by destroying your moment
by fucking telling your business to the world
on some haha yeah ima do it on purpose ima do it spitefully
do it your own way and do it beautifully do it special
if you are pregnant and everything say it in a beautiful way in your music
say why you you know decided to be with your nigga
even though you have problems put that drama in your music yeah
cause if bitches wanna get clout off you you gonna get clout off them
and you gonna put that shit in your music
