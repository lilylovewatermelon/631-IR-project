i hope you make it
i hope you make it real far
i wish you greatness and stars
i hope you know who you are
i pray you can take it
pray you can pray to the lord
pray he can heal up the scars
pray he take care of your heart
cause niggas dont care about you
more than you care about you
they never care about you
more than you care about you
so i hope you make it
i hope you make it real far
i wish you greatness and stars
i hope you know who you areyou might also like1embed"
