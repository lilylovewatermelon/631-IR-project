i was walking through icy streams
that took my breath away
moving slowly through westward water
over glacial plains

prechorus
and i walked off you
and i walked off an old me
oh me oh my i thought it was a dream
so it seemed

chorus
and now breathe deep
im inhaling
you and i theres air in between
leave me be
im exhaling
you and i theres air in between
oohhoo oohhoo oohhooooh
oohhooooh
you and i theres air in between
oohhoo oohhoo oohhooooh
oohhooooh

cut my hair so i could rock back and forth
without thinking of you
learned to talk and say
