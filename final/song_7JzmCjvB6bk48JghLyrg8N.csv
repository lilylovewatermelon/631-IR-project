take a gun or how you say
thats no way to behave
youre just alone when you begin
to sing a song that doesnt sing
it grows hey

verse 2 2d
are we the last to get away
to a sun another day
or do we know what we know
it doesnt seem to be conveyed that way

are we the last living souls
are we the last living souls
are we the last living souls

bridge 2d
cause all out of song
i got it down and wrong
i see myself to get
the long allseeing road down
you come and take a sound
i bought the car made up
the coldest man
he doesnt say its wrong

verse 3 2d
we go to the car
i see you walk into the fog
and when you get there what do you see
you fit the last you need on me

yeah were the last living souls
were the last living souls21embed"
