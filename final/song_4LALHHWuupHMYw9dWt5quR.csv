made a living off that old black gold
now there aint nothing but welfare and pills
and the wind never felt so cold
ill be one of the first in a long long line
not to go down from that old black lung
my death will be slower than the rest of my kind
and my life will be sadder than the songs they all sung
old king coal what are we gonna do
when the mountains are gone and so are you
they come from the city to lend a hand
carrying signs saying shut the mines down
we aint looking for pity and you dont understand
so go back to your city now cause this aint your town
my great grandfather spent his days in a coal mine
and his nights on the porch in a chair
now hes in heaven and down here in hell
the rivers run muddy and the mountains are bareyou might also likeembed"
