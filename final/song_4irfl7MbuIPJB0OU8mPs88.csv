its amazing
how you make your face just like a wall
how you take your heart and turn it off
how i turn my head and lose it all

verse 2
its unnerving
how just one move puts me by myself
there you go just trustin someone else
now i know i put us both through hell

prechorus
im not sayin there was nothin wrong
i just didnt think youd ever get tired of me
and im not sayin we ever had the right to hold on
i just didnt wanna let it get away from me

chorus
but if thats how its gonna leave straight out from underneath then well see whos sorry now
if thats how its gonna stand
when you know youve been depending on
the one youre leavin now
the one youre leavin out

verse 3
its aggravating
how you threw me on and you tore me out
how your good intentions turned to doubt
the way you needed time to sort it out
