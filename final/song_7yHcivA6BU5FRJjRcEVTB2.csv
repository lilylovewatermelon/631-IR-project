7yHcivA6BU5FRJjRcEVTB2,Hush Little Baby,Nursery Rhymes Band,72vvkjRrkR6mmvGppIwxGV,"2 contributorsa nightmare on elm street 4 the dream master lyricsa black screen

as the main titles begin two sounds are heard  the first is
the low moaning wind  the second is a slow screeching
its the kind of noise that makes you grit your teeth

fade in

ext elm street  day

gray surface fills the screen  at first its hard to
recognize this rough indistinct surface  but when a childs
hand drags a piece of colored chalk across the frame we
realize that were seeing a very close view of a concrete
walkway

ext elm street  day

a series of close shots follow the movements of the tiny hand
as it proceeds to lay out an intricate chalk drawing on the
walkway

for a while we are too close to identify the image that is
being created  but as the camera pulls back we see a
youthful artists representation of a two story house
the camera tilts up revealing a little girl in white dress
shes holding a handful of colored chalk  behind her sits
the elm street house

as the titles end we

ext elm street  day

the trees lining this residential street are bare and they
sway in the breeze thats blowing their dead leaves across
the sidewalk

kristen a beautiful but pensivelooking blonde teenager is
walking slowly towards the ominous house  although her face
shows signs of fear she is moving with resolve

ext elm street house  day

kristen stops and looks down at the angelic little girl who
has been creating the childish drawing of freddys house
kneeling down beside her kristen takes a closer look at the
colorful chalk sketch

it has an almost exaggerated cheerfulness  and although
awkwardly rendered it makes the house look new and the yard
welltended  the idyllic sidewalk illustration looks nothing
like its subject which has peeling paint boardedup
windows and is horribly rundown
little girl
looking up
hello

kristen
do you live here

little girl
sadly
nobody lives here

kristen
wheres freddy

little girl
giggles strangely
hes not home

just then the child lifts her hand away from the picture
what kristen sees makes her gasp  a crudely drawn but
easily recognizable image of freddy krueger is visible behind
one of the windows

there is a crack of lightning and drops of rain start to
sprinkle down on to the girl and her drawing
ext elm street house  night

kristen glances up at the sky  rain trickles onto her face
then after a second she looks back down at the sidewalk
the little girl is gone  kristen scans the area but the
child is nowhere to be seen

rain is splashing down on the chalk illustration not only is
the image washing away but as the colors blend together
they form a liquid that looks just like blood

kristen hears a creaking noise coming from the direction of
the house  she turns and stares at the menacing structure
the front door is slowly opening  somehow kristen seems
unsurprised by this  and as though drawn by an
uncontrollable urge she turns toward the house  with
thunder and lightning crashing above her she walks
deliberately toward the open door

int entrance hallway  night

as soon as kristen enters the house she hears voices behind
her  its children singing a strange nursery rhyme

childrens voices os
one two freddys coming for you

kristen spins around and looks back through the open door

ext front yard  night  kristens pov

standing out in the yard that was empty a moment before are a
dozen very young children  dressed in their sunday best
they are staring at kristen as they continue to sing

children
three four better lock the door

int entrance hallway  night

the front door slams shut with a bang  kristens determined
expression dissolves and she reaches back for the doorknob
it turns without resistance and the door opens with ease

kristen rushes through the doorway but instead of finding
herself outside she is in

int a duplicate entrance hallway  night

kristens eyes widen as she compares her surroundings with
the dusty decaying room that is visible on the other side of
the stillopen door  they are exactly the same

before she can take another step the door slams shut again
and this time when she tries to open it its locked solid

kristen
muttering
calm and cool im calm and cool

she moves down the hall finds an open door steps through

int dark elm street living room  night

kristen walks in the old floorboards creaking under her
feet  she looks at the walls  they are lined with eerie
paintings of children playing in graveyards  rainwater drips
down from the ceiling

when flashes of lightning illuminate the room kristen
catches sights of an old and dusty couch in one corner  a
couch with a distinctive red and green striped lining

another bolt flashes  kristen is horrified to see
silhouetted on one of the walls the shadow of a hand with
long knifelike fingers

so frightened that she can barely breathe kristen turns to
the large window across the room
another flash lights up the dark room and kristen relaxes
it isnt freddy outside the window  its only a tree branch

relieved kristen starts over toward the window  but before
she reaches it there is a sudden massive clap of thunder
and the entire window explodes into the room

a huge gust of wind roars in through the shattered window
and blows kristen off her feet

int freddys boiler room  night

kristen tumbles down a set of heavy metal chute that has just
appeared out of nowhere and lands on the concrete floor of a
very large dark boiler room  she scrambles to her feet and
looks around terrified like a trapped animal

kristen
under her breath
hes not here hes dead  hes not here
hes dead  hes

just then kristen hears the unmistakable sound of freddys
knives scraping against a nearby metal surface

kristen contd
crying out
no  kincaide  joey  help me

int kincaids bedroom  night

kincaid is sitting at his desk his head drooped down over an
open copy of an illustrated sports magazine  a harmless
looking mongrel is sleeping at his feet

suddenly kincaids chair begins to shake  he lifts his head
in surprise just as he suddenly flies from the chair and
sails through the air straight towards a wall in his room

but instead of piling into the solid surface kincaid sails
right through it and disappears into the void

int boiler room  night

kincaid falls into the boiler room crashing through a pile
of rusty pipes and boilers  as soon as he catches his
breath he looks up and sees kristen  he quickly jumps to
his feet and starts to yell at his friend

kincaid
awww shit kristen not again

kristen motions for kincaid to listen as the screeching
continues
kincaid unimpressed shows kristen that its merely the
metal arature of a boiler attachment scraping against a
railing

kincaid contd
you are one spooked chick

before kincaid can say another word kristen holds up her
hand  footsteps are echoing out of the shadows behind them

kristen
shh

they both spin around just as a figure lurches toward them
kincaid gasps and kristen screams  but a moment later thy
each let out big sighs  its joey  kincaid covers his fear
with cool nonchalance

kristen contd
joey thank god  i thought

joey
thought what  of dragging us in here

kincaid
yeah cut it out  youre puttin a dent
in my beauty sleep

they both glare at kristen  theyre pissed

kristen
in a halting voice
its freddy hes here  i heard him

kincaid
chill out kristenfreddys dead
buried and consecrated  we won
remember

kristen
shaking her head
hes back to get us

joey
now way kincaids right fred krueger is
history cmere

he leads her around the boiler room  he makes her touch
pipes and then positions her in front of the large furnace

joey contd
look the pipes are cold the boiler is
cold see for yourself

he swings open the iron door on the furnace  kristen moves
close to look in the black void  there isnt even the glow
of an ember inside  she turns away

kristen
i dont know

all at once a howling beast leaps out of the furnace  its
kincaids dog  kristen has managed to pull it into her dream
with its master

the terrified animal clamps its jaws around kristens arm
and knocks the screaming girl down to the floor

int joeys bedroom  night

joey wakes up with a start and tries to reorient himself
his sudden movements cause his waterbed to slosh back and
forth like crazy

int kincaids bedroom  night

kincaid jerks his head up off his desk and glances around
his room with an expression of relief  then he hears a
whimpering sound and looks down

his dog is staring up at him with uncomprehending eyes
there is blood around the animals mouth

int kristens bedroom  night

kristen throws her covers off and jumps up out of bed  shes
breathing hard and her arm is bleeding  grabbing a tshirt
off a chair kristen wraps it around the wound

she sits back down on her bed she looks really scared

fade out

fade in

ext alices house  day

the morning sun is rising behind the broadlimbed trees that
shade a collection of unassuming homes  its a peaceful
neighborhood  just the kind that freddy used to like

a girl pulls up in front of one house  shes driving a vw
rabbit convertible

its kristen  she wears a long sleeve shirt but a bulge
reveals where her arm is bandaged

ext alice and ricks house  day

kristen quickly walks to the side door of a modest house
after ringing the bell she glances out at the sidewalk when
kristen turns back a sternlooking man is standing in the
open doorway  although probably not much over forty dennis
johnsons face shows a lot of wear too much scotch too much
work  hes dressed for work and is preparing to leave but
his hangover is selfevident

kristen
how are you mr johnson

johnson ignores her

kristen contd
thats nice

johnson turns away  his daughter alice shows up at the door
slinking warily by her father  in a definite contrast to
kristens easy beauty alice is not especially well put
together  and yet theres something about this shylooking
girl that suggests that she might be incredibly attractive if
she had any confidence

alice
low
hi kristenrickll be out any second

kristen looks in the doorway at johnson who is holding a
tomatojuice and spices hangover delight  kristen makes a
face  alice turns as johnson looks up

johnson
to alice
you going out dressed like that

alice
defensive
whats wrong with me this time

kristen
embarrassed
uhh ill just wait outside

johnson
no its okay  maybe you can help her

johnson pours a shot of vodka into his morning concoction and
slams the door shut leaving the two girls alone on the front
porch  kristen is about to console alice when they hear a
rustling sound above them  rick alices brother is
shimmying out of an upper floor window

he reaches for a nearby tree and with surprising grace he
maneuvers to the ground and lands smiling in front of the
girls  he gives kristen a quick kiss

kristen
something wrong with the stairs

rick
avoidallcontactday

kristen
what

rick
when dads popping aspiring like popcorn
its avoidallcontactday

johnson suddenly reopens the door and reaches for the morning
newspaper  he stares at the kids

johnson
waiting for a limo

rick grabs his fathers face and gives him a big noisy kiss
on the cheek

rick
mock ricky ricardo
okay honey  im off to the club

the girls chuckle as johnson becomes embarrassed and slams
the door on the kids

ext springwood high school  day

springwood high doesnt look particularly inviting but how
many high schools do  students are arriving on foot on
bikes and in a variety of motor vehicles

kristen rick and alice pull up in kristens vw rabbit
convertible and park  they step onto the sidewalk and cross
along beside the student parking lot  they stop beside an
attractive girl who is leaning against a car listening to
the blasting radio inside

the girl debbie stevens is one well put together item  a
tough but smart girl from the wrong side of the tracks
trying to compensate for her roots with defensive spunk
sexy and she knows it

debbie
alright anybody have trig this semester

alice rick and kristen shake their heads no

rick

debbie

rick

alices attention drifts to a tough pickup that is pulling
up not far from them  a handsome darkhaired teenager dan
climbs out of the car

debbie eyes him too

debbie
appreciative

in a more confident seductive pose  she looks him up and
down and flashes a lauren bacall smile

awkward as if hes the shy one now

dan

ext school  day back to reality

earth to alice

alice snaps out of it  dan is suddenly back where he was
walking away with a group of his friends

rick contd
you spacing again

alice
hushhush
rick please

debbie
alright i think i see salvation

a battered and sputtering vespa scooter is zipping towards
them through the parking lot  the black girl riding the
scooter looks a bit nerdy with thick glasses and short hair
but makes up for it with a hip sense of style  her scooter
has been souped up with a few homemade gadgets and
attachments

as soon as sheila kopecky reaches them she hops off her
bike and unstraps the pile of books and papers from the
back  tons of smoke pour out the back of it

debbie contd
bats smoke away
how can you ride that health hazard
its no wonder you have asthma

sheila
asthma is an inherited condition  if you
read a book now and then you might know
something

debbie
speaking of books isnt trig your
favorite

sheila stares at debbie a beat

sheila
dynasty again huh  girl get a vcr

sheila pulls out her asthma inhaler and sticks it in her
mouth  she takes a few puffs  a cocky obnoxious black jock
walks by and comments to sheila

jock
yo baby youre sucking on the wrong
nozzle

sheila is embarrassed and falls short of managing a retort
debbie steps in between sheila and the jock and does it for
her

debbie
hey needledick  i bet youre the only
male in this school suffering from penis
envy

the jock stares in confusion not quite understanding the
insult  our group cracks up and pats debbie on the shoulders
as the jock walks off

sheila
alright i owe you one

debbie suddenly stops laughing and lets out a disgusted gasp
a huge roach is crawling around her books  she shakes the
book until the bug falls off then grinds it under her foot
a little too enthusiastically

rick
supergirl i think its dead

the group gets their stuff together and heads for class

int school hallway  day

students are moving through the hallway that cuts through the
center of springwood high

kristen is standing against one wall spinning the dial on
her locker  rick can be seen a dozen lockers down from her

kristen gets the locker open grabs a couple of her books
then slams it shut  but as the locker door swings away it
suddenly reveals the faces of kincaid and joey just inches
from kristen  they startle the hell out of her

kristen
higuys

kincaid
hi guys  hi guys  thats all you
got to say after last night

kristen studies her two angry friends for a moment then
speaks up in a firm voice

kristen
im telling you hes coming back

he tries to move around but bumps his head on something low

kincaid
yo open this sucker up

he pounds on the metal above it moves just enough to reveal
a thin crack of blue light  he continues to mutter to
himself in confusion

he pounds a few more times starting to panic when the metal
above his head finally pops open

ext junkyard  night

kincaid sticks his head out of the trunk of a wrecked car and
looks around  hes in an ominous auto graveyard

kincaid
this aint my dreamland  kristen  if
you here im gonna pound your ass

kincaid looks around  no ones to be seen

kincaid contd
calling
kristen  hey kristen
beat then sheepishly
kristen

he collects himself and puts on a badass walking gait  when
he hears a low growling kincaid looks down  a few feet away
from him is his dog  it has an odd expression on its face

kincaid contd
jason
relaxes becomes sympathetic
listen little sister we know you got
this talent for bringing folks into your
dreams but we dont need it anymore
time to live like regular people

joey
let it rest sides who knows you might
stir him back up if you keep going in
kincaid and ill help were still a
team and we all have better things to
dream about

kincaid
you got that right signed and sealed

kristen wants to believe but she cant because

kristen
then what about this

kristen pulls up her sleeve and reveals the bloodstained
bandage on her forearm

kincaid
that dont mean dick  my dogs like me
drag him into a crazy dream and he gets
wild

the guys see rick approaching

kincaid contd
jokingly trying to change the
subject
here comes your boyfriend  cant he give
you a good nights sleep

rick arrives in time to hear kincaids comment

rick
we dont kiss and tell  how bout you
guys

kincaide starts to mount a comeback but joey pulls him away
kristen watches them disappear into the crowd

rick contd
those guys are kind of spooky

kristen
then you must think im a total freak

rick ponders this

rick
i go back and forth

kristen is not amused

rick contd
lighten up  no one died

rick strokes her cheek  kristen forces a weak smile

int kincaids bedroom  night

kincaid is getting into bed  his night time attire consists
of a tshirt and a pair of sweat pants

as the sleepy young man settles between the sheets a force
begins to slowly open the door behind him  it squeaks as it
inches open  kincaid is on alert  after a few moments of
suspense kincaids mangy dog shoves the door the rest of the
way open and trots into the room

the mutt hops up onto the bed and circles a couple of times
when it finally lies down kincaid shoves it over a bit

kincaid
come on jason move over

the dog and his master adjust their positions then kincaid
reaches over and turns off the light

close on kincaid

his eyes slowly shut  the room is still  but suddenly a
screeching sound wakes him

int car trunk  night

kincaid opens his eyes  its too dark for him to see much
so he reaches for the light on his bedstand  but instead of
finding a lamp his hand slams against a metal surface

ext car box canyon  night

the dog is furiously digging below the back of an imposing
looking old cadillac  some strange instinct seems to have
overpowered the animal

the boy rushes forward and tries to stop his dog  but its
no longer acting like a friendly pet and it turns and snarls
at him viciously

kincaid stops and stares in disbelief as the dog lifts its
leg and pisses fire onto the spot where its been digging

a flaming stream runs along the ground and a moment later
the earth rumbles and starts to crack open along this line of
fire  shafts of light erupt out of the crack

its job complete the dog howls and runs off into the night
kincaid watches it disappear between the stacks of cars then
steps forward and looks down into the smoldering pit

ext freddys grave  night

down at the bottom of this freshly formed crevice a pile of
bones is forming itself into a human skeleton  they click
together like a machine gun put together by an experienced
soldier

and as if that isnt creepy enough a body is quickly
regenerating

flesh appears on the bones  cartilage knits the joints and
muscle swells within the oozing tissue that is forming all
over the body  its the antithesis of decomposition

when burned skin forms over the flesh and clothes reverse
their rot and cover the skin there is no longer any doubt
whos rebirth we are witnessing

ext car box canyon  night

kincaid watches in horror as the sinister figure rises from
the grave  freddys back

freddy raises his right hand and with a flick of his wrist
extends the long shiny blades at the ends of the fingers
like switch blades

freddy
you shouldntve buried meim not
dead

kincaid doesnt hesitate for another second  before freddy
even starts to move toward him the terrified dreamer turns
and runs  he finds the opening where he entered and madly
squeezes himself back through it

ext labyrinth of cars  night

kincaid starts to weave his way through the maze of piledup
cars

he turns a corner and pauses to catch his breath  he looks
around  theres no sign of freddy  breathing hard he turns
around at the piles of cars around him  the expression on
his face tells us hes got an idea

on freddy

he round the corner and stops theres no kincaid  he looks
around confused  he hears the squeak of metal

on kincaid

whos on top of a pile of cars  hes straining with his
super dreamstrength to push the top car off the pile  he
succeeds

the car topples down onto freddy squashing him flat  a
victorious kincaid jumps down onto the roof then hood of the
car

kincaid
take that muthafucker

kincaide jumps to the ground  as soon as he lands the cars
around him go wild  horns honk lights flash windshield
wipers wipe

suddenly before kincaid can react cars start to pile in
around him  he spins around to watch as he is quickly boxed
in by piles of cars which come crashing in

kincaid is boxed in like a trapped mouse  the horns on the
cars around him honk and headlights flash at him

there is no way out  hes completely trapped in a space not
much larger than a single car

suddenly kincaid hears a scraping noise right behind him
freddys claws are scraping a windshield

he spins around and finds freddy standing just inches away
with his knives raised

freddy brings his blades down and jams them into kincaids
chest

kincaid contd
gurgling
kiss my ass ill see you in hell

freddy
smiling
tell them freddy sent ya hahahaha

freddy pushes the knives farther and farther into kincaid
the tips of the sharp blades pop out of the center of
kincaids back  one at a time accented by cruel sound fx

freddy contd
one downtwo to gohahahah

int kincaids bedroom  night

kincaids eyes shoot open and he clutches his chest in agony
his dog wakes and nuzzles up to his dying master but the boy
is oblivious to the dogs tender attention

with his final breath kincaid tries unsuccessfully to call
out kristens name

int kristens bedroom  night

kristen is sitting in bed with her knees drawn to her chest
holding her breath shes listening  the room is silent  it
must have been the wind tickling the chimes outside her
window that drew her attention

she sighs and reaches for the can of hicaf cola thats
sitting beside her
she takes a final swig then tosses the can in the waste
basket where it joins a number of other empties

kristen rummages through the drawer in her nightstand and
grabs some cigarettes and matches  she gets out of bed
crosses to the window and slides it open

she slumps into the chair beside the window and lights a
match by striking it against her thumbnail  very cool  she
lights the cigarette and takes a deep drag

ext alices house  night

alice can be seen by the kitchen window  a sliver of light
creeps out of the garage along with a thumping noise

int garage  night

rick is involved in a series of interesting exercises  hes
kicking and sparring with a suspended bodybag doing martial
arts spins between returns  he wears an oriental bandana
around his forehead

int kitchen  night

alice is standing at the sink in front of the kitchen window
finishing up a stack of dishes  she looks up when headlights
sweep across her face

ext alices house  night

alices pov

a car is swerving into the driveway it makes an awkward
approach and knocks over a garbage can thats positioned
well off to one side

int garage  night

rick stops his exercises and steps away from the opening
electric door  the car jerks into the garage and johnson
climbs out  as he walks uneasily to the house he takes a
quick nip from the bottle hes brought home  johnson becomes
self conscious when he sees his sone watching him

johnson

he shuffles by rick

int kitchen  night

johnson comes in and crosses to alice  rick follows as far
as the doorway but holds his position there

johnson

ext joeys house  night

establishing shot of house

int joeys bedroom  night

posters of rock groups and girls line the walls  the camera
pans them slowly tilting down past a particularly
provocative poster of a sexy bikinied babe  camera reaches
the led display of a stereos vu meter which is hitting all
the red peaks  but we can barely hear any music

the camera follows a headphone cord away from the stereo
passes some gorgeous pinup posters on the wall and then
finally reveals joey stretched out on his waterbed  he has
his tv hooked up to his stereo and is watching mtv which he
hears through the headphones

theyre rocking out to a tune that spills out of his
headphones  hes also flipping through the latest issue of
rolling stone  his eyes slowly shut

the magazine drops to his chest

all at once a rocking motion starts to make joey rock back
and forth  something is causing waves within the waterbed
joey snaps to  he notices that the girl in the slutty poster
has vanished leaving only her photographed background  joey
has no time to be puzzled however as he rolls over and pulls
back the sheets on the bed

to joeys surprise and delight a beautiful naked girl is
staring up at him from inside his waterbed

not just any girl but the girl from the poster  her hair is
floating around her face and shes pressing her body up
against the inside of the clear plastic  her voice cant be
heard but it looks like shes mouthing joeys name

joey
what a great bed

entranced joey spreads his arms out over the girl and tires
to hug her  hes in heaven  she starts to slowly drift away
from him dropping down into the water until her features are
no longer clear

suddenly the swimming figure bobs back up to the surface of
the bed  but its no longer a beautiful girl  its freddy

our old pal smiles up at joey and the blades of his knives
push against the surface of the vinyl mattress

joey cries out but before he has time to react freddys
arms rip up through the plastic and grab a hold of the boy
as water gushes all over freddys demonic face pops up
behind him

freddy
hows this for a wet dream

joey
noooo  kristen  help

freddy pulls joey back down beneath the surface of the bed
and holds him under  joey thrashes but its hopeless

freddy os
two down  one to go  hahahaha

camera moves back around the room to the led meter watching
as it dies down to nothing

int kristens bedroom  night

kristen is sitting on her window seat finishing off another
cigarette  she blows smoke out the window then uses the
butt to light a fresh cigarette

int joeys bedroom  night

joeys mother comes in to say goodnight

mom
joey are you asleep already  joey

she gets to the bed

mom contd
cmon give your mother a kiss

she pulls down the covers to reveal joey in the bed  she
screams

joey is floating motionless inside the waterbed  his face
pressed up against the unbroken vinyl surface his hair is
billowing back in the stillswirling current and his eyes
are open in an eerie death stare

int kristens bedroom  night

a gentle breeze is blowing in the window and kristen closes
her eyes for a few seconds as she lets the fresh air wash
across her tired face

suddenly the wind dies away and the soft sound of the
tinkling chime abruptly stops  kristen opens her eyes and
stares out the window  the night air is absolutely still
the leaves have stopped fluttering and the wind chime hangs
motionless in the tree

she hears someone calling her so she gets up and goes out

ext front door  night

kristen comes out and starts to walk slowly away from the
door  she is listening to the faint sound that is wafting
through the air but she isnt really sure just what it is

as kristen steps away from the house the camera moves with
her in a continuous shot so when she turns and heads back
the camera is still following her  and what kristen sees
makes her scream

ext elm street house  night

her home is now gone  standing in its place is the decaying
elm street house kristen spins around

int weird thin space between walls with chain curtain

shes in a long weird thin space between the walls  she
passes through a chain curtain and moves further in the
corridor is filled with wailing and strange sounds

int weird thin space between walls with chain curtain

kristen tries to navigate through the thin space  she
screams and starts running as arms begin bursting out of the
sides of the corridor  she ducks as they grab for her
theyre freddyarms each one weilding his deadly claw

the arms force her down the next segment of the corridor  as
she looks ahead she sees shes been led straight to freddy
he laughs

kristen
i knew youd be back

freddy
and then there were none

freddy charges towards her she turns and runs but suddenly
freddy is right in front of her  she stops cold and
concentrates

kristen
kincaid  joey

theres no answer  no response

freddy
elm streets last brat

freddy steps forward and raises his blades  hes about to
strike  trapped kristen raises her hands in a final futile
attempt at selfdefense

but before freddy can swing his deadly blades down at her
kristens outstretched arm suddenly bursts into flame  she
screams and then we cut to

int kristens bedroom  night

freddys last brat line echoes a few times before fading
out as kristen comes awake

kristen jumps out of the chair as flames shoot out of her
wastebasket  her cigarette has started a small fire  she
grabs her can of soda and pours the rest out onto the fire
putting it out  she nurtures a small burn on her hand

she turns to the window and cries out under her breath

kristen
joey  kincaid

ext school steps  morning

its right before school starts the grounds are deserted
save for kristen  she sits alone on the steps rocking
herself slightly  shes looked better  shes nervous and
agitated

she reaches into her pocket and withdraws a cigarette  she
takes out a match ignites it by striking it against her
thumbnail and lights the cig  after a deep inhale she blows
smoke into the morning air

alice appears

alice
here you are  where were you this
morning  ricks looking all over for
you

kristen
very anxious
have you seen joey and kincaid  god i
cant find them  i cant find them
anywhere

alice

kristen
afraid

alice sits beside kristen  kristen looks at her  each girl
has bags under their eyes

kristen contd
we have matching luggage again

alice looks at kristen puzzled  she doesnt get it
kristen smiles and puts her finger on the bags under one of
alices eyes

kristen contd
the bags under your eyes  nightmares

alice nods yes

kristen contd
god i hate dreaming

alice
i love to dream i just hate ones about
my dad

kristen

kristen stamps out her cigarette

kristen contd
how do you deal with your nightmares

alice
my mom taught me when i was little  did
you ever hear of the dream master

kristen
sounds like a game show host to me

alice
no really its a fable  the guardian
of good dreams  it was like my teddy
bear when i was growing up

kristen
great you wouldnt happen to know his
phone number

alice laughs

kristen contd
so what do you do now

alice
i daydream  you have to dream about some
place fun  remember youre in control

kristen
howd you learn so much about dreams

alice
when theyre all you have you kinda
become an expert

kristen gives alice a sympathetic look  the two girls sit in
silence for a moment

kristen
i used to bring people into my dreams

alice doesnt know what to make of this

alice
you what

kristen
when i used to have nightmares  i
brought my friends in to help me  until
they all started dying

kristen notices that alice isnt getting what shes talking
about

kristen contd
never mind  its too complicated  lets
get in before your brother starts a
search party

int brysons classroom  day

a teacher a young hip man named bryson writes on the board
as the final stragglers come in  kristen and alice enter
meeting rick whos there already

kristen takes on look at the roomful of students and all the
blood drains from her face  she isnt looking at the
students who are there  she is staring at two empty seats

kristen starts to tremble a murmuring begins deep inside her
and builds to a tortured cry as she shakes her head no

kristen starts to back away  her knees are getting weak
the other students are mesmerized by the outburst  some of
them are glancing over at the empty seats

rick
what is it

kristen
screaming
oh god  he killed them

rick takes hold of her arm but shes really losing it now
and she pulls herself away from him with all her strength

the momentum of this violent move throws her off balance and
she falls back slamming against the door  she strikes her
head slumps to the floor knocked out

int school nurses office  day

a school nurse is passing an ampule of smelling salts under
kristens nose  she shakes her head then opens her eyes
the nurse leans down over her and smiles

nurse
feeling better now

kristen
groggy
yeah  i guess so what happened

nurse
you had a nasty bump

as kristens sense of focus returns she looks up at the
nurse with an expression of extreme urgency

kristen
i gotta get out of here

nurse
you just stay put  you need rest

kristen
you dont get it hes after me

nurse
dont worry honey

the woman turns and sets down the smelling salts  her back
begins to bleed blood soaks through her white uniform
saturating the fabric kristens eyes widen in horror  when
she turns back an instant later shes no longer the nurse
now standing above kristen is freddy

freddy
i need to draw some blood

kristen lets out a scream

int school nurses office  day

kristens eyes suddenly snap open  the nurse is passing an
ampule of smelling salts under the girls nose  the woman
leans down over her and smiles

nurse

kristen doesnt say a word

rock and roll music builds on the soundtrack as we

ext diner  day

music is blasting as cars pull up and kids make their way
into the crave inn

int crave inn  day

cu of jukebox  pull back as dan and his buddy walk fro the
jukebox to their table  dan passes by the counter and
glances at alice

dan

head

alice

alice
smiles

dan is already walking away toward his table  alice picks up
an order and watches dan walk away  debbie who is also a
waitress steps in

debbie

debbie walks to dans table  sheila catches alice offguard
they both watch debbie talking to dan

both laugh

alice

debbie

sheila gathers her books  alice starts cleaning the table
nearby as rick and kristen walk in  they startle alice

sitting next to the shy alice whos desperately trying not
to make eye contact with him  she sneaks little peeks

debbie is seated in back on the other side of dan  shes
trying very hard to make eye contact with dan  ricks in

hey cmon  everybody has nightmares

kristen

play by freddys rules  wake up or die

dan

everyone in the car has been leaning in towards kristen
engrossed in her story  rick grows uncomfortable with the
crowding as if he had a strong aversion to tight spaces
which we would like to telegraph for later exploitation

rick
hey cmon  give me some room  i hate
tight spaces

those in the back seat back off  kristen speaks up

kristen

ext elm street house  late afternoon

species

alice is staring at the house  she suddenly speaks almost
to herself

alice

kristen glances over at alice who notices kristens
attention

alice contd

rhyme  the master of dreams my soul

elaine impatiently honks the horn again

kristen

rick leans in and gently kisses her

rick

they are near the curb alice stops as something on the
walkway catches her attention  there are traces of a chalk
drawing on the concrete  alice bends down and runs a finger
across its surface

rick os contd
alice

she looks up to dan and rick  she starts to join them
before she goes she turns and looks back down  the drawing
is gone  she stares at the walkway a beat before joining
dan rick and debbie

int kristens dining room  late afternoon

elaine is silently watching her daughter eat  you could cut
the tension with a knife  finally elaine speaks up

elaine
something the matter with the cuisine

kristen
well mom ill tell ya when two of your
friends die the same day you let me know
what it does to your appetite

elaine
youre just tired  dont think i havent
noticed your not sleeping  that has to
stop honey

kristen quickly stands but shes dizzy  she grabs a hold of
the table to steady herself then sits back down again

kristen
concerned
whats wrong with me

elaine
your distraught  itll help

theres a straightened tone in her mothers voice that is
making kristens eyes open wide  shes starting to
understand whats happening

kristen
oh godnowhatd you do

kristen grabs her glass and pours the last of her milk out
onto the table  theres a grainy sediment remaining in the
bottom of the glass

when kristen stands again shes unsteady on her feet she
tries to brace herself on the back of her chair with one
hand and when she does this she loses her grip on the empty
milk glass and it falls and shatters on the floor

with a wobbling gait kristen lurches away from the table

kristen stumbles around grabs her mothers purse and dumps
its contents on the counter  fumbling around she finds a
halffull container of prescription capsules  she turns and
throws it at elaine  pills fly everywhere

elaine
im sorry honey but

kristen
screaming
sorry sorry that you and your tennis
pals torched this guy whos now after me
in case you havent been keeping score
its his fucking banquet and im the
last course

elaine
honey we went over this in therapy

kristen
mother youve just murdered me  take
that to your goddamn therapy

on deserted beach

wearing club med beach wear kristen is lying on a towel on a
beach that runs along the edge of a broad lake  the sun is
high and the sky is blue

kristen contd
softly to herself
thanks alice

she slowly glances around the beach  down near the water a
little girl is building a sand castle

when the child turns and looks at her kirsten sees that its
the same little girl that she saw drawing a picture on the
sidewalk

just off the shore

the glassy surface of the water is unexpectedly broken by fin
like objects that rise up and slice through the surf  at
first it looks like a shark but as it gets closer we can
clearly see that it is four blades in ascending height

on the beach

kristen looks back at the sand castle but the little girl is
gone  she does not notice the fins

moving with the fins

they turn and head straight for shore directly in line with
the sand castle and kristen beyond it  when they reach the
shore they continue straight on cutting through the sand
now instead of the water

on the beach

the knifelike fins move through the sand and enter the front
of the elm street sand castle  at this point the sand
castle changes into a sand castle of the elm street house
then explodes revealing

freddy squinting against the harsh sunlight  freddy pops on
a pair of raybans  he smiles as he steps forward and stands
over kristen his backlit form is towering above her

freddy
time to turn or else youll burn

kristen is sunken halfway into the sand preventing escape

freddy raises his claw as if to attack kristen and the shadow
of the claw burns blisters onto her otherwise pale skin

freddy saunters over unaffected by the quicksand  he
watches the girl struggle and laughs when her screaming mouth
fills with sand as she sinks below the surface

int elm street house  upside down dining room  night

kristen appears hanging upside down on all fours on the
ceiling of the room shes disoriented  she starts to get
some kind of bearing and starts crawling towards a wall

she makes it and struggles to reach a door  she crawls down
the wall and manages to open the door  she flings herself
through it

kristen is horrified to discover that she is back in the
boiler room  the place is really strange now theres a fire
and steam all around

she realizes shes standing on a catwalk high above the room
she looks around and sees that freddy is standing in front of
a furnace watching her with a grin on his face

with a defiant cry kristen runs at freddy  she does a
series of cartwheels and throws herself at her tormentor
crashing into him

caught off guard freddy stumbles backwards and falls onto
the grating

freddy
do it til ya dizzyhahahahaha

kristen
we beat you before

freddy
but youre all alone

freddy advances on the terrified girl

freddy contd
hey kristen  why dont you call in some
help

freddy closes in  kristen struggles not to drag anyone in

kristen
neverim the last

freddys almost on top of her

freddy
reach out and touch someone

freddy raises his claw to slash kristen  she panics and on a
reflex calls for

kristen
alice

suddenly alice comes crashing down on top of them  kristen
is enraged

but freddy is happy

freddy
how sweet  fresh meat

kristen suddenly slaps alice hard across the face

kristen
come on  wake up and get out  it was
a mistake oh god im sorry

nothing happens kristen starts to back up taking alice with
her  freddy pulls open his shirt and reveals the tortured
faces of the souls of his previous victims

kristen contd
stepping forward
leave her alone

freddy grabs kristen and as alice reacts in utter horror he
throws her into a nearby wall in which appears a burning sea
of flames

kristen writhes as she burns

as the flames finish off the doomed girl a blast of energy
shoots out of the steaming furnace and slams into freddy

his body crackles he arches his back and seems to grow as he
contorts and pulsates

freddy
now no one sleeps  ahhhh

he starts to advance on the terrified alice  as kristen
roasts to a fiery death she calls out to alice

kristen
pained
youll need my power

a second bolt of energy flies from kristens body inside the
furnace and slams into alice causing her to glow and shake

freddy closes in for the kill and is about to slice into
alice

kristens smoldering face pushes out and emerges onto
freddys chest

int alices bedroom  night

alice sits bolt upright in bed screaming  she takes a few
breathes gets her bearings then walks towards her vanity
she stares at the mirror

one of the pictures on it is new  its a snapshot of a
beaming freddy and a terrified kristen down in the boiler
room  freddy smiles for the camera  alice stares at it
she turns it over

theres an inscription on the back  it reads freddy and
kristen hell 1988  the picture suddenly bursts into flames
and disintegrates startling alice  she looks back at the
mirror  the hole the picture has left on the reflective
surface allows alice to see a portion of her face her
reflection is subtly altered more enhanced

rick bursts in

rick
you alright

alice
barely a whisper
kristen

she grabs him and pulls him out of the room

ext kristens house  street  night

rick and alice pull up to kristens house and get out of
ricks car

ext kristins house  night

the dancing orange of flames can be seen in kristens
upstairs bedroom window

rick and alice charge into the house

rick
calling out
kristen

int kristens bedroom  night

rick alice and elaine enter the room  the bed is in a blaze
of flames  the last of kristen is just a charred arm

ext school  day

rick is sitting on a bench wearing dark sunglasses the
oriental bandana ties tightly around his forehead  hes in
mourning  seated around him are alice whos dressed a bit
like kristen debbie and dan  silence surrounds them  each
is respectful of ricks mood

dan
hey man were all sorry

rick
she knew she was gonna die

debbie
you mean it was like suicide

dan cuts in not letting debbie finish her sentence

dan
i thought it was an accident  smoking in
bed

alice
it was no suicide  it was not an
accident  it was freddy and hes coming
back for seconds thirds and fourths

debbie
come on freddys not real  she couldnt
have been serious

dan
i mean you cant really believe that

alice
i was there in the dream  he took her
it was awful  it was awful

dan
in her dream

alice gets up and abruptly walks away from the bench  rick
takes off his glasses and watches his sister go

rick
somethings very wrong here

debbie
what

rick
for a minute shewell reminded me of
kristen

dan
werent they close

a beat

rick
not that close

int girls restroom  day

alice stares at her reflection for a few moments she studies
it  she leans in real close to the mirrors surface

she takes out a cigarette sticks it in her mouth and lights
it by striking a match against her thumbnail eerily
reminiscent of kristen

she takes a drag and coughs violently  she quickly stamps it
out  she looks into the mirror

alice
i dont smoke
beat
kristen what did you do to me

sheila enters the restroom heads for a faucet next to alice
and immediately splashes her face with cold water  alice
watches her  she gets a look at sheilas tired face

sheila
ohhhhbaby i am dead on my feet

alice
we have matching luggage

sheila
what

again reminiscent of kristen alice points to a spot under
sheilas eye

alice
youve been up all night

sheila
that obvious huh

alice
then you saw him too

sheila
saw who i was up all night cramming for
this physics test and i was putting this
little baby together  look

sheila reaches into her purse and withdraws a small neat
looking gadget not unlike a joy buzzer only this means
business  she squeezes it and it emits a highpitched whine

sheila contd
you know how debbies afraid of bugs  i
made this for her ultra high sound
waves  makes em run screaming their
antenna off

sheila collects herself and starts to leave

sheila contd
see ya in class

she exits leaving alice alone in the rest room

int physics classroom  day

the students are sitting at their desks waiting for the
dreaded exam  sheila starts to wheeze a little but she
takes a hit off of her aspirator and that settles her down
she looks exhausted

while the teacher places test papers face down in front of
each of the students sheila checks out her classmates
alice and rick are there and so is dan

when the teacher finally gets to sheila he drops the test in
front of her giving her a little slap on the back

the teacher glances up at the clock above the blackboard
then turns to the students

teacher
alrightyou have forty minutes  good
luck and go to it

test papers are turned over  the examination has begun
concentration scribbling thinking cheating satisfaction
and despair  its all there

sheila is staring at her paper  she holds her eyes open
wide  they slowly shut for a second  she recovers and
opens her eyes wide again  she stares back at the paper



int physics classroom  day dream begins

on the test

the equations dance about on the page like acrobats  sheila
blinks in confusion yet they still move  she takes a look
around  all the other students are working including alice

sheilas pen is poised over her paper her eyes get heavy
her head droops forward but she again snaps to with a start

she shakes her head and looks down at her test  sheila puts
her pencil to paper and tries to fill in an answer but no
writing appears on the paper

blinking again the equations on the page start to dance
slowly the letters start to form words again  they spell out
learning is fun with freddy

sheila shakes her head and looks around  then she looks down
at her page where a drop of blood splatters  her pen is
leaking blood

alice awake turns and notices sheilas troubles  no one
else in the classroom reacts

sheila tries to clean the blood with her hand making an even
bigger mess  then her hand pushes right into the desk  she
struggles to free it but shes pulled even further

suddenly she pulls it free looks around relieved  the
tension mounts then suddenly a mechanical beastie type claw
thing jumps out of the desk and grabs hold of sheilas arm
she yells

alice turns and sees sheila struggling  alice starts to rise
when a bar shoots out across her lap and straps her in she
struggles to help sheila  but all the other students are
calmly involved in the test

sheila looks forward at the teachers desk  freddy sits at
the table peeling an apple with a claw

freddy
schools out

finally sheila pulls her arm free but the bar slips around
her waist entrapping her

freddy heads down the aisle

sheilas breathing all but stops  she tries to scream but
can only choke and wheeze

freddy contd
suck me sidewayssave your breath

freddy yanks sheila to him and kisses her hard on the mouth
and begins to suck literally drawing the air from her lungs

the freddycreatedvacuum is intense  sheilas ribs are
drawn into themselves and crack in half  her body is
imploding as her insides life essence is sucked completely
dry

young skin now cracked and peeling brown  the rind you throw
away  freddy lets go of sheilas shell and it drops to the
desk with a dusty thud

freddy contd
sorry you fail

freddy turns to the terrified alice he walks over
screeching his talons on the blackboard

int physics classroom  day back to reality

suddenly freddy is gone and sheila is lying across her desk
choking for air while the teacher and students gather
around  alice fumbles with sheilas inhalator forcing it
into her mouth but

sheilas head just droops to one side  dead

alice is suddenly hit by a jolt  she recovers after a shaky
moment

sheilas homemade zapper falls out of one pocket and falls
on the floor  alice quickly scoops it up

rick dan and debbie surround her  alice starts to freak

alice
didnt you see it  he was here

they all stare at her strangely  rick leads her carefully
from the classroom supporting her exhausted body  the other
students file out

student
the test wasnt that bad

ext school  day

schools been let out for the day and dozens of students are
standing around the parking lot watching the paramedics lift
a nylon sheetcovered body into a waiting ambulance

sheilas friends watch in silence as the vehicle pulls away
a burp of siren to part the crowd of teens

debbie
fighting tears
asthma attackwhat 17year old has a
fatal asthma attack  she was gonna be a
doctor

alice
it was freddy

debbie

alice

alice

dan

rick

int alices bedroom  night

alice empties her pockets on her vanity table  she comes up
with sheilas gadget  she begins to tinker with it she
hefts it sizes it up  she sets it down and looks up at the
mirror

she hesitantly reaches out and pulls another photo off the
mirror revealing more of her reflection
its a picture of her and sheila she puts it down alices
image is prettier stronger

she hears a noise from downstairs and leaves her room to
investigate

int kitchen  night dream

alice enters the kitchen

alice

alice flicks on the lights  she gasps  her father is
sitting at the table  he looks up at her smiles warmly

johnson

school  i guess i havent been very much
of a father through this

alice shrugs

alice

johnson
nah ive been using that excuse since
your mother died

he crosses to the fridge opens the door and bends down to
take a look  the door blocks alices and our view of him

johnson contd
but i promise honey ill make things
better for you

the fridge door slams shut revealing johnson

johnson contd
now if i could only kick the habit

hes holding an oversized martini glass  his face looks like
the worst case of alcoholic deterioration  blood seeps from
burst blood vessels in his eyes his nose is red and lined
and warped

hes wearing freddys sweater  he takes a swig off the huge
vodka bottle  he vomits up blood as he speaks

johnson contd
freddys voice

bursts in and hits the light

rick

picks it up

rick

alice

alice looks sympathetically at her brother

alice
i miss her too  she gave me her ability
but i dont know how to use it  i can
bring people into my dream but i cant

alice looks straight at her brother

alice contd
freddy lives in my dreams rick  like he

rick

alice

rick
then well stay up together

int crave inn  night

alice is standing behind the diners counter  adding up the
nights receipts near the cash register  her waitress
uniform is spotted with stains evidence of a hard day

she finishes up the receipts and closes the cash register
she then pours coffee grounds into a cup of black coffee as
if it were sugar  she stirs it halfheartedly and drinks it
down

dan suddenly walks in and heads for the counter about to
place an order to go he sees that its alice behind the
counter and is surprised

dan
hey how ya doin

alice looks up  from the look of her shes not doing that
well  dan is taken a bit aback by her appearance

dan contd

alice
ive been working double shifts

dan

alice

believe me

dan looks around and leans in to her

dan
no offense or anything but its kind of
hard to swallow

alice

with

alices eyes well up  she begins to come unraveled

alice contd
i dont know what to do  i cant stop
it  why doesnt he just kill me

dan

alice

dan lets this sink in  alice becomes embarrassed and self
conscious under dans scrutiny

alice contd

dan

true why does freddy all of a sudden
need you

alice
kristen was the last child left of the
people who killed freddy  maybe freddy
cant get to new kids without someone
like me  someone to bring them to him

dan and alice are both silent for a moment  they look at
each other  dan reads the mix of emotions on alices face
guilt shame anger exhaustion  hes about to say something
when a sudden voice calls out  dans date a pretty and
polished cheerleader type appears at the door

girl

alice hurries off to the kitchen as dan watches in

int locker room toilet area  day

rick heads to a stall

int lecturers classroom  day

alice is struggling to stay awake in a back row of the class
at the front a typical high school lecturer drones on in
boring monotone

we hear the words from alices point of view as they distort
as she gets closer and closer to falling asleep

lecturer
every society dating back to the
ancients has had theories regarding
dreams what they mean how to control
them  aristotle believed that during
sleep you soul roams free  what it sees
are dreams  skilled dreamers control
what they see  there is a theory that
there are two gates your soul can enter
one a positive gate the other a
negative  the dreammaster guards the
positive gate and protects its sleeping
host  there are fewer theories about the
negative gate

int toilet stall  day

rick sits on the toilet he looks up in surprise when the
door begins to rattle  a bunch of girls in cheerleading
costume suddenly barge in  they look down at rick and laugh
as he struggles to pull up his trousers

suddenly the room begins to shake  rick looks around and
sees the room transform into an elevator  buttons push out
of the walls and the doors change

int elevator  day

one of the girls pushes button 13  the elevator shoots up
rick is astonished  the doors open and the girls shove out
rick can see alice among the girls  she is pushing forward
trying to go help him  she disappears in the crowd  rick
looks around at

int hellish bathroom  night

rick looks ahead into the hellish bathroom  in front of him
he sees the familiar back of kristen  she leans over the
sink looking in the mirror  the mirror image speaks to him

kristen
cmon rick  make me laugh

rick steps forward to go to kristen  she turns revealing
her face is a burned horrific mess  kristen laughs evilly
rick reels back into the elevator

int elevator  day

the doors slam shut in ricks face  suddenly the elevator is
rocketed downward  rick holds on for his life  the buttons
sequence faster and faster until they are a blurry glow

through the elevator speaker comes freddys voice

freddy vo
going down  womens wear lingerie
cutlery butcher knives  china

the elevator comes to sudden halt rick is thrown to the
ground by the impact  he gets up and looks around as the
door opens into

int chinese living area  day

a pristine clean chinese room a la living quarters in
chinese ghost story  tatami mattes white and colored
screens open light and airy  rick steps out tentatively
he scans the room suspiciously then more calmly

suddenly out of nowhere rick is hurtled backward as if
kicked by an invisible opponent

rick
what the

freddys voice is heard

freddy os
a true warrior ricksan needs no eyes

rick is kicked again and floored  he stands now angry  he
flails around at the air then is hit again

rick
come out and fight me you chicken shit

freddys laugh is heard

freddy os
ninja warriors have calm  find your
balance rick

rick is hit again and thrown back against a screen which
breaks  he stands up slowly with ultimate concentration he
turns quickly as if with radar suddenly he kicks back at the
air and connects  a resounding thump is heard  he
progresses forward in a series of karate moves all of which
connect soundly and quickly with the invisible force

rick
too wimpy to show yourself krueger
well hows this for balance

with extra strength rick kicks out in the air  he connects
hard and suddenly freddys glove appears out of thin air and
lands on the floor as if kicked off by ricks power

rick stops and stares at the glove on the ground  he laughs
victoriously

rick contd
hahaha  you superhero  how you gonna
get me without your weapon  youre dead
meat

rick looks down as freddys laugh resounds through the room
suddenly the glove jumps up in the air and goes straight for
rick reaming him in the stomach  rick falls over  dead

freddy

glowing marquee of a movie theater at the end of the street

alice reaches the bo  she takes a ticket from the attendant
and wanders in

int balcony  night

alice takes a seat in the fifth row  she has a box of
popcorn and a soda  there are other patrons scattered about

a mouthful of popcorn

film is making her uncomfortable

int on the movie screen  night

but its not as we know it from earlier scenes  its the
craveinn of the future  a beatendown forgotten mutt of a
place  all peeling paint and flapping canvas awning

we watch as the lights in the diner switch on and a wind
kicks up blowing tumbleweeds and newspapers across the front
of the diner

suddenly the front doors are blown off their hinges and wind
picks up  it whistles as the air becomes thick with dust and
debris

int movie theater  night

as the wind whips over alice her popcorn scatters like a
white rain  her drink is pulled out of her hand by the
winds force

int on the movie screen  night

now hurricanes speeds are pounding the diner the wind
getting stronger and stronger as

int movie theater  balcony  night

alice is standing fighting the wind thats pulling her to
the edge of the balcony  she tries to grab her seat clawing
fingers ripping into seatbacks only to slip away

alice is lifted off her feet and sucked right over the
balcony by the wind

she just manages to grab the balconys edge and hold on legs
swinging free trying to crawl back up

the wind beating her back

alice
screaming
noooooo

suddenly one of alices shoes is pulled right off her foot
and flies across the auditorium into

int on the movie screen  night

as alices shoe hits the movie screen and passes through  we
see it roll across the floor of the diner

int movie theater  balcony  night

the wind is stronger still and alice is struggling to
maintain her grip on the balcony

the other patrons just sit in their seats watching

alice manages to hoist herself up just a bit in order to see
the faces of the others in the theater

theyre all blank looking pastyfaced people with deathlike
visages

alice screams as a gust of wind rips her from the balcony and
sends her flying across the auditorium passing through the
movie screen

she sees her zombielike theater patrons their deathlike
faces displaying emotionless vacuums as they clap

int crave inn diner  day

alice turns and looks around the diner  its in just as bad
shape inside as it was out  it may be open for business but
there are no customers to be seen  a single waitress is
standing behind the barren counter

alice walks across to the counter and settles onto a stool
the waitress steps over and slides a tattered menu in front
of her  alice studies the woman for a moment  something
about her is familiar  it makes the girl uneasy

in her sixties the waitress looks like shes worked every
day of her life  her hair is streaked with gray and there
are deep pockets under her eyes  she seems to be the kind of
person whose life has passed her completely by

waitress
whatll it be

alice doesnt answer

waitress contd
impatiently
cmon honey  i dont want to be here
forever

alice notes the waitress name badge alice

the waitress turns and heads down to the end of the counter
as the woman walks away alice swivels on her stool to watch
her go

alice is startled to discover that another patron is now
sitting next to her  its freddy

freddy

the waitress brings over a piping hot pizza  she places it
in front of freddy

int crave inn diner  day

faces  screaming miniature faces  the faces of kristen
sheila and rick

alice reacts in horror to the deathpizza  the faces cry out
to her  their voices are high and squeaky as youd expect
miniature voices to be  the effect would be comical if it
wasnt so torturous

freddy tears the rick face off the pizza and pops it in his
mouth  alice gets up to run but freddy grabs her by the
throat

freddy

off the tires

and smashes into a void an invisible brick wall

the trucks front end gets totaled bits of metal and glass
fly through the air as the truck crumples as if it has hit
solid stone

ext road real world  night

minutes before dan is forced to sleep

swinging exit doors

ext hospital  night

alice jumps in her fathers car and cranks it over burning
rubber to back out of the parking lot

alice drops the car in gear and takes off at top speed but
she sideswipes another car which is parked next to her
sparks metal against metal

alice blasts through the hospital liftgate before skidding
into traffic and screaming away into the darkness

int hospital hallway  night

dan is being wheeled on a gurney  hes struggling to stay
awake

ext intersection  night

alice barrels through a light and fishtails around a corner

int car  night

alice grips the wheel  the speedometer is straining she
looks at the dashboard clock

something

int operating room  night

a nurse and an orderly lift dan onto the operating table
the room is being quickly prepped checking instruments
doctors scrubbing up

activity all around

ext alices house  night

out of the car and runs into the house

int operating room  night

as the nurses lay out the instruments dan is still groggy

the operating room clock tells us alice has 5 minutes left

int den  night

as alice runs through she passes a gun rack mounted on the
wall  she doubles back to it  she regards it

alice
couldnt hurt

she opens it and grabs a mean looking mother of a pump
shotgun and a box of shells

int operating room  night

we see the oxygen and anesthesia hoses put into place and the
gauges register pressure

the anesthesiologist preps the mask for dans face  dan
watches protesting weakly

dan

gashave to stay up

he fades out

int alices bedroom  night

alice throws the gun and the shells on the bed  she opens a
bottle of sleeping pills and pops more than enough for a trip
on freddy express

she starts to load the gun inserting each shell with vicious
precision  she cocks it

alice
this ends  now

she walks over to the mirror on the vanity table  her eyes
travel over the tokens shes collected form her friends

she starts to power up  she takes sheilas gadget which
shes improved and hangs it around her neck  she takes
debbies studded bracelet and snaps it around her wrist

lastly she takes ricks oriental bandana and ties it like
amazonian around her forearm  she hoists the gun  she likes
her reflection in the mirror  somethings very different
the pills are starting to take effect  alice grabs her
forehead

she looks back at the mirror  shes strong confidant ready
to accept her destiny
with forceful determination she tears the rest of the
pictures off her mirror  what she sees makes her gasp

int alices bedroom  night

on the reflection

its alice alright but everythings turbocharged  shes
leaner meaner her clothes are tighter more battlelike
everythings accented  the gadget around her neck is now a
super hightech amulet  the bracelet has spikes instead of
studs and seems to be made of shining titanium

this is no high school girl  this is no dream warrior  this
is the dream master ancient guardian of the gate of good
dreams  alice speaks to her reflection

alice
now i lay me down to sleep

the reflection speaks back

alices reflection
the master of dreams my soul ill keep

alice
in the reflection of my minds eye

alices reflection
evil sees itself and it shall die

alice
fuckin a

alice looks at the shotgun which remains the same in the
reflection  next to her supernatural image it doesnt seem
an impressive weapon

alice contd
save it for rambo

she tosses the gun aside and notices the clock on her vanity
table  its 15 seconds to ten

int operating room  night

suddenly dan starts to choke

he opens his eyes and sees the doctor standing over him
its freddy in surgical greens razorfingers at the ready
dan pulls the mask from his face and cries out

dan

freddy

int alices bedroom  night

alice hears dans distant cry

the reflection of the alice as the dream master has been
replaced by the image of the operating room  alice can see
freddy menacing dan

alice
screaming

alice goes diving headfirst into the mirror  it sucks her
in

int operation room  night

alice rolls onto the floor  she now has the image of the
dream master from her mirror complete with all the regalia
shes one pissed superhero

she looks around freddys gone

alice helps dan off the table since were in the dream his
injury is healed  he gets an eyeful of alices spectacular
new appearance

dan
astonished

alice
save it for later  come on

alice and dan turn around and run for the doors  just as
they get to them freddy throws them open from the other
side

on instinct dan leaps in front of alice to confront freddy
he grabs dans fist holds his arms out and slashes dan
once twice across the chest  blood spurts but its only
superficial damage

alice grabs the sharper of the the surgical instruments and
turns on freddy

alice contd
ill mail your guts back to hell

alice starts to hurl the instruments at freddy kung fu style
with blurring speed and accuracy  rick would be proud

alice nails freddy once a dozen times in the space of a few
seconds  freddy doubles over sharp instruments sticking out
of every part of him  alice advances on him and delivers a
massive sharp kick to freddys balls  freddy makes a sound
that banshees would flee from

alice grabs dan and the two plunge through the doors

int kaleidoscope hallway  night

dan and alice run into the hallway  but its no hallway
its a huge rotating cylinder  it looks like a hallway but
its spinning  dan and alice immediately become dizzy

at the end of the hallway theres a large walltowall
sheet of colorful lights  it gives the impression that dan
and alice are trapped within a huge kaleidoscope

they careen down the hallway and go crashing through the
colorful lights which turn out to be stained glass

dan and alice crash through a stained glass window without
the gurney and land with such tremendous force that even
after hitting the floor they dont stop  they skid along the
floor out of control

keeping dans hand in one hand alice reaches out and slams
her spiked bracelet into the floor  the spikes dig in and
serve as her break  they screech across the floor smoke
rises from the grooves they make  alice digs in deeper and
they manage to come to a stop in a pile of broken stained
glass

they stand up just as freddy appears

freddy
welcome to wonderland alice  hahahaha

dan leaps at freddy  freddy slashes him across the chest
superficially but theres plenty of blood

alice
nooo

int operating room  night

the doctors are working on dan  suddenly blood starts to
spurt wildly from his chest

doctor
christ hes hemorrhaging badly  close
it off and bring him out of it  hurry

begin to chant  theyre standing in the choir box

alice rushes to dans side he starts to flicker like a bad
tv then he starts to fade

dan

over him

int church  night

alice crouches into a fighting position a la rick as
krueger advances fingerblades flashing

alice leaps and delivers a perfect kick to freddys face
knocking him back

alice lands on her feet as freddy lunges for her

alice jumps over a church pew as freddy slashes at the air

alice whirls and kicks freddy again and again and again
just pounding him

but freddy laughs at the blows

freddy
contemptuous
you think you got what it takes i been
guarding my gate forever hahaha

freddy grabs alice by the ankle and whirls her around like a
rag doll and tosses her away

alice is thrown the length of the church and crashes into the
confessional booth splintered wood and cracking bones

alice sinks heavy among the debris  she doesnt move
freddy advances on her  going in for the kill  just when
hes close enough alice springs up  she was playing possum

she reaches out and punches a hole in the wall behind the
debris of the confessional  she pulls out several crackling
electric cables  she looks bizarre and powerful framed for a
moment in the blue light of the sparkling electricity

she rips off the gadget from around her neck and aims it at
freddy  freddy laughs at her and it

alice shoves on of the electric cables into the center of the
gadget  it hums and builds and glows until a loud
incredibly powerful laser bolt shoots out of it and hits
freddy square in the chest

a stunned freddy looks at his midsection  quite frankly
its missing  theres only a gaping smoking hole through
which alice can see the rest of the church

alice throws the smoking gadget and cable to the floor  she
has no time to savor her temporary victory however

freddys playing fill in the blanks with himself  the
charred hole in his midsection begins to fill in  in a
matter of seconds hes whole again

he laughs and starts to advance on alice  frustrated she
grabs a huge cross which she handles easily then charges
him

freddy raises the cross  on one pass she tears open
freddys sweater revealing the faces of the souls trapped
within freddy  she gags at the sight

freddy seizes the moment and grabs the cross  he tosses it
away

freddy smacks alice across the face  he grabs the back of
her head and throws her over him across the church and into
the altar  he advances on her

freddy contd
i am eternal

alice is looking pretty bloody  she tries to fend off freddy
but he smashes her into the opposite wall  she crumples in
pain beneath the broken stained glass window she came in
through

freddys coming for her  his tongue wiggling like a demented
wile e coyote about to grab the road runner

the kids in the choirs sing out

children
for in the reflection of my minds eye

the sun rises behind the window the children are standing in
front of  the light hits the wall and works its way to
alice and the floor freddy steps into it as he advances

alice
remembering
let evil see itself

alice looks down and sees a large piece of stained glass
she sees her reflection in it unbruised pretty the true
her  she scoops it up and holds it in front of freddy

the chorus of ghostly kids complete the rhyme with alice

alice and kids
and it shall die

freddys about to slice into alice he raises his arm

light hits freddy off the glass like a blast  he looks at
alice and sees himself reflected in the glass  he screams

we push in on freddys screaming reflection right into his
mouth

int freddys body  night

we zoom down into freddys innards which are made up of
struggling dead kids  the souls all trapped and hanging
inside freddys body start to break free as they scream and
cry

int church  night

we travel through then emerge out of freddys eye  we pull
back to reveal that freddys entire body is pulsing and
ripping from within

alice
let them out

the trapped souls begin tearing through freddys body flesh
and blood erupting in all directions

freddys sweater stretches and rips apart  freddy doubles
over as his head bulges  all the tiny bodies inside him
surge upwards  a tiny hand smashes through one eye

finally freddys head explodes and the freed souls pour out
the force shatters the glass in alices hands  she
straightens up and watches as the souls swoop around her
before zooming out the broken window

alice contd
youre dead

alls quiet except for a steady wind that blows the shell of
freddy krueger and his hat down the church aisle

and out the door  the double doors slam shut

int church  night

alice stands alone shes no longer dressed like dream
master  having fulfilled her mission shes now just normal
alice again but retains the newfound beauty and confidence

alice stands frozen for a moment then regards her quiet
surroundings

alice
rest in hell

dissolve to

ext park  day

dan and alice are walking through the park arms around each
other  from the look of their healing bruises its some
weeks later

fade to blackembed"
