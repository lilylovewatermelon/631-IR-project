verse 1 romeo da black rose
finding love in all the wrong places shuffling through pretty faces
im glad you had a nice time but right now i need my space bitch
i dont wanna waste your time and i definitely dont wanna waste mine
if i dont feel the vibe ill curb you like a stop sign yeah uh
i been goin through some shit
i guess im gettin used to it
i been goin through some shit
i guess im gettin used to it
i used to doubt my usefulness
she a bad bitch and her ass thick
she gon turn me into a sad simp another habit
goddamn im such an addict i always gotta have it
one more time for validation
watch me turn into a rabbit

what do ya know its young wetto riding with a ho
that bitch before she was tripping had to let her go
eeniemeeniemineymoe now her finger froze
i was sold when i showed my flaws and she loved me more
used to fuckin hate her and she stated that she hate me too
now its babe i love you and she sayin boy i love you too
still i deal with trauma from this ex in my past
only bitch i know psycho enough to land me in rehab
i ran forty yard dash with a stash in my pants
now lookin back she never had a chance ayy
movin on to better things bigger dreams
like cummin in pussy and hope my girl has a mini me

outro sarah juers
i i truly had thoughts in my mind
of us and future youll come true
and i know youre tryin to be everything i need
youre the sweetest thing treated me like everything and
hes everything we need hes everything we need
makin us to who we supposed to be
and im just tryna go where he tellin me
be right where im supposed to be
and i will never say i–11embed"
