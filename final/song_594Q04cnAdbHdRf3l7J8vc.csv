between heaven and hell the devil in me
burned another bridge on the family tree
you take the bottle from my hand and the whiskey off my breath
tell me is there really still anything left
theres a limit to livin on gods green earth
im still tryin to figure what thats worth
not makin any choices im just makin mistakes
livin in a world where the sinners are saints

chorus
how can i win when the battle keeps changing
should i just lay down my gun
surrender to the demons im facing
do i fight or do i run
is this the moment i finally take a stand
win this war on a desperate man

verse 2
been praying to god to let me hear his voice
take me now if thats his choice
whos it gonna be who makes me realize
there are days i dont even wanna open my eyes

chorus
how can i win when the battle keeps changing
should i just lay down my gun
surrender to the demons im facing
do i fight or do i run
is this the moment i finally take a stand
win this war on a desperate mansee eli young band liveget tickets as low as 44you might also likeembed"
