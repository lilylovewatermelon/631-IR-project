hey how have you been
since you let in
the clouds through your window as it rained
the last time we spoke
you were glued to that telescope
i heard you say it was too far away
was it too far away

verse 2
me i’ve been fine
i work most of the time
digging for secrets deep in the ground
a few days ago
they called for that big snow
man i thought that i would never get warm
did you ever get warm

bridge
all inside the rain
we carry what we’re able
among the sewer rats and angels
and all of us in between

outro
before i go i’ll leave you with this poem
about the galvanized moon and her rings in the rainsee gregory alan isakov liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likeembed"
