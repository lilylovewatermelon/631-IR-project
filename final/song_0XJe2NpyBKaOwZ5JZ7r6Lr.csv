this appeal from a judgment of the circuit court for waukesha county max raskin circuit judge was certified to this court by the court of appeals sec rule 80961 stats 197980 as presenting an issue of first impression namely whether an owner of a solarheated residence states a claim upon which relief can be granted when he asserts that his neighbors proposed construction of a residence which conforms to existing deed restrictions and local ordinances interferes with his access to an unobstructed path for sunlight across the neighbors property this case thus involves a conflict between one landowner glenn prah the plaintiff interested in unobstructed access to sunlight across adjoining property as a natural source of energy and an adjoining landowner richard d maretti the defendant interested in the development of his land

the circuit court concluded that the plaintiff presented no claim upon which relief could be granted and granted summary judgment for the defendant we reverse the judgment of the circuit court and remand the cause to the circuit court for further proceedingsiaccording to the complaint the plaintiff is the owner of a residence which was constructed during the years 19781979 the complaint alleges that the residence has a solar system which includes collectors on the roof to supply energy for heat and hot water and that after the plaintiff built his solarheated house the defendant purchased the lot adjacent to and immediately to the south of the plaintiffs lot and commenced planning construction of a home the complaint further states that when the plaintiff learned of defendants plans to build the house he advised the defendant that if the house were built at the proposed location defendants house would substantially and adversely affect the integrity of plaintiffs solar system and could cause plaintiff other damage nevertheless the defendant began construction the complaint further alleges that the plaintiff is entitled to unrestricted use of the sun and its solar power and demands judgment for injunctive relief and damages1

after filing his complaint the plaintiff moved for a temporary injunction to restrain and enjoin construction by the defendant in ruling on that motion the circuit court heard testimony received affidavits and viewed the site

the record made on the motion reveals the following additional facts plaintiffs home was the first residence built in the subdivision and although plaintiff did not build his house in the center of the lot it was built in accordance with applicable restrictions plaintiff advised defendant that if the defendants home were built at the proposed site it would cause a shadowing effect on the solar collectors which would reduce the efficiency of the system and possibly damage the system to avoid these adverse effects plaintiff requested defendant to locate his home an additional several feet away from the plaintiffs lot line the exact number being disputed plaintiff and defendant failed to reach an agreement on the location of defendants home before defendant started construction the architectural control committee of the subdivision and the planning commission of the city of muskego approved the defendants plans for his home including its location on the lot after such approval the defendant apparently changed the grade of the property without prior notice to the architectural control committee2 the problem with defendants proposed construction as far as the plaintiffs interests are concerned arises from a combination of the grade and the distance of defendants home from the defendants lot line

the circuit court denied plaintiffs motion for injunctive relief declared it would entertain a motion for summary judgment and thereafter entered judgment in favor of the defendantiithe defendant argues that because the circuit court conducted a hearing and considered all material issues of fact we should consider this case an appeal from a judgment after trial not as an appeal from a summary judgment we do not accept the defendants characterization of the circuit courts proceedings

the circuit court held a hearing to consider plaintiffs motion for a temporary injunction a primary consideration on such motion is whether the moving party has a reasonable probability of ultimate success the ruling on the motion does not resolve the issue of whether the moving party will in fact ultimately succeed in the lawsuit werner v grootemaat 80 wis 2d 513 520 259 nw2d 310 1977 the circuit court denied the motion for a temporary injunction concluding that there was no reasonable probability that the plaintiff would ultimately succeed and that the plaintiff had not stated a claim upon which relief could be granted the circuit court ended its memorandum decision on the motion for a temporary injunction with the following comment

in as much as the court is of the opinion that the plaintiff has failed to state a claim upon which equitable relief can be granted and the parties having joined issue the court will entertain a motion by the defendant for summary judgment

this statement clearly indicates the intention and expectation of the circuit court to deal with this case on a motion for summary judgment we therefore consider this as an appeal from a judgment entered on a motion for summary judgment

in deciding a motion for summary judgment the initial question is the same as that on a sec 802062 stats 197980 motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted namely whether the complaint states a claim upon which relief can be granted kanack v kremski 96 wis 2d 426 435 291 nw2d 864 1980 abrahamson j concurring if the complaint states a claim and the pleadings show the existence of factual issues the court then examines the affidavits and other proof and determines whether there are disputed material facts that entitle the nonmoving party to a trial on summary judgment the court does not decide those issues of fact it merely decides whether genuine issues of fact exist coleman v outboard marine corp 92 wis 2d 565 57071 285 nw2d 631 1979

in this case there is some ambiguity whether the judgment was based on the complaint or on factual matters outside the pleadings which were presented to the circuit court in connection with the motion for a temporary injunction consequently we shall first test the sufficiency of the complaint and then determine whether the matters outside the pleadings present disputed material facts sufficient to justify a trialiiiin testing the sufficiency of the complaint the facts pleaded by the plaintiff and all reasonable inferences therefrom are accepted as true hartridge v state farm mutual auto ins co 86 wis 2d 1 45 271 nw2d 598 1978 the pleadings are to be liberally construed with a view to substantial justice to the parties sec 80202 6 stats 197980 and the complaint should be dismissed as legally insufficient only if it is quite clear that under no circumstances can the plaintiff recover clausen  lowe the new wisconsin rules of civil procedure chapters 801803 59 marq l rev 1 54 1976 quoted with approval in morgan v pennsylvania general ins co 87 wis 2d 723 731 275 nw2d 660 1979

the plaintiff presents three legal theories to support his claim that the defendants continued construction of a home justifies granting him relief 1 the construction constitutes a common law private nuisance 2 the construction is prohibited by sec 84401 stats 1979803 and 3 the construction interferes with the solar easement plaintiff acquired under the doctrine of prior appropriation4
as to the claim of private nuisance the circuit court concluded that the law of private nuisance requires the court to make a comparative evaluation of the conflicting interests and to weigh the gravity of the harm to the plaintiff against the utility of the defendants conduct the circuit court concluded a comparative evaluation of the conflicting interests keeping in mind the omissions and commissions of both prah and maretti indicates that defendants conduct does not cause the gravity of the harm which the plaintiff himself may well have avoided by proper planning the circuit court also concluded that sec 84401 does not apply to a home constructed in accordance with deed and municipal ordinance requirements further the circuit court rejected the prior appropriation doctrine as an intrusion of judicial egoism over legislative passivity

we consider first whether the complaint states a claim for relief based on common law private nuisance this state has long recognized that an owner of land does not have an absolute or unlimited right to use the land in a way which injures the rights of others the rights of neighboring landowners are relative the uses by one must not unreasonably impair the uses or enjoyment of the other5 via american law of property sec 2822 pp 6465 1954 when one landowners use of his or her property unreasonably interferes with anothers enjoyment of his or her property that use is said to be a private nuisance hoene v milwaukee 17 wis 2d 209 214 116 nw2d 112 1962 metzger v hochrein 107 wis 267 269 83 nw 308 1900 see also prosser law of torts sec 89 p 591 2d ed 19711the private nuisance doctrine has traditionally been employed in this state to balance the conflicting rights of landowners6 and this court has recently adopted the analysis of private nuisance set forth in the restatement second of torts cew mgmt corp v first federal savings  loan association 88 wis 2d 631 633 277 nw2d 766 1979 the restatement defines private nuisance as a nontrespassory invasion of anothers interest in the private use and enjoyment of land restatement second of torts sec 821d 1977 the phrase interest in the private use and enjoyment of land as used in sec 821d is broadly defined to include any disturbance of the enjoyment of property the comment in the restatement describes the landowners interest protected by private nuisance law as follows

the phrase interest in the use and enjoyment of land is used in this restatement in a broad sense it comprehends not only the interests that a person may have in the actual present use of land for residential agricultural commercial industrial and other purposes but also his interests in having the present use value of the land unimpaired by changes in its physical condition thus the destruction of trees on vacant land is as much an invasion of the owners interest in its use and enjoyment as is the destruction of crops or flowers that he is growing on the land for his present use interest in use and enjoyment also comprehends the pleasure comfort and enjoyment that a person normally derives from the occupancy of land freedom from discomfort and annoyance while using land is often as important to a person as freedom from physical interruption with his use or freedom from detrimental change in the physical condition of the land itself restatement second of torts sec 821d comment b p 101 1977

although the defendants obstruction of the plaintiffs access to sunlight appears to fall within the restatements broad concept of a private nuisance as a nontrespassory invasion of anothers interest in the private use and enjoyment of land the defendant asserts that he has a right to develop his property in compliance with statutes ordinances and private covenants without regard to the effect of such development upon the plaintiffs access to sunlight in essence the defendant is asking this court to hold that the private nuisance doctrine is not applicable in the instant case and that his right to develop his land is a right which is per se superior to his neighbors interest in access to sunlight this position is expressed in the maxim cujus est solum ejus est usque ad coelum et ad infernos that is the owner of land owns up to the sky and down to the center of the earth the rights of the surface owner are however not unlimited us v causby 328 us 256 2601 1946 see also 11403 stats 197980

the defendant is not completely correct in asserting that the common law did not protect a landowners access to sunlight across adjoining property at english common law a landowner could acquire a right to receive sunlight across adjoining land by both express agreement and under the judgemade doctrine of ancient lights under the doctrine of ancient lights if the landowner had received sunlight across adjoining property for a specified period of time7 the landowner was entitled to continue to receive unobstructed access to sunlight across the adjoining property under the doctrine the landowner acquired a negative prescriptive easement and could prevent the adjoining landowner from obstructing access to light8

although american courts have not been as receptive to protecting a landowners access to sunlight as the english courts american courts have afforded some protection to a landowners interest in access to sunlight american courts honor express easements to sunlight american courts initially enforced the english common law doctrine of ancient lights but later every state which considered the doctrine repudiated it as inconsistent with the needs of a developing country indeed for just that reason this court concluded that an easement to light and air over adjacent property could not be created or acquired by prescription and has been unwilling to recognize such an easement by implication depner v united states national bank 202 wis 405 408 232 nw 851 1930 miller v hoeschler 126 wis 263 26869 105 nw 790 1905

many jurisdictions in this country have protected a landowner from malicious obstruction of access to light the spite fence cases under the common law private nuisance doctrine9 if an activity is motivated by malice it lacks utility and the harm it causes others outweighs any social values via law of property sec 2828 p 79 1954 this court was reluctant to protect a landowners interest in sunlight even against a spite fence only to be overruled by the legislature shortly after this court upheld a landowners right to erect a useless and unsightly sixteenfoot spite fence four feet from his neighbors windows metzger v hochrain 107 nw 267 83 nw 308 1900 the legislature enacted a law specifically defining a spite fence as an actionable private nuisance10 thus a landowners interest in sunlight has been protected in this country by common law private nuisance law at least in the narrow context of the modern american rule invalidating spite fences see eg sundowner inc v king 95 idaho 367 509 p2d 785 1973 restatement second of torts sec 829 1977

this courts reluctance in the nineteenth and early part of the twentieth century to provide broader protection for a landowners access to sunlight was premised on three policy considerations first the right of landowners to use their property as they wished as long as they did not cause physical damage to a neighbor was jealously guarded metzger v hochrein 107 wis 267 272 83 nw 308 1900

second sunlight was valued only for aesthetic enjoyment or as illumination since artificial light could be used for illumination loss of sunlight was at most a personal annoyance which was given little if any weight by society

third society had a significant interest in not restricting or impeding land development dillman v hoffman 38 wis 559 574 1875 this court repeatedly emphasized that in the growth period of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries change is to be expected and is essential to property and that recognition of a right to sunlight would hinder property development the court expressed this concept as follows

as the city grows large grounds appurtenant to residences must be cut up to supply more residences    the cistern the outhouse the cesspool and the private drain must disappear in deference to the public waterworks and sewer the terrace and the garden to the need for more complete occupancy    strict limitation on the recognition of easements of light and air over adjacent premises is in accord with the popular conception upon which real estate has been and is daily being conveyed in wisconsin and to be essential to easy and rapid development at least of our municipalities miller v hoeschler supra 126 wis at 268 270 quoted with approval in depner supra 202 wis at 409

considering these three policies this court concluded that in the absence of an express agreement granting access to sunlight a landowners obstruction of anothers access to sunlight was not actionable miller v hoeschler supra 126 wis at 271 depner v united states national bank supra 202 wis at 410 these three policies are no longer fully accepted or applicable they reflect factual circumstances and social priorities that are now obsolete

first society has increasingly regulated the use of land by the landowner for the general welfare euclid v ambler realty co 272 us 365 1926 just v marinette 56 wis 2d 7 201 nw2d 761 1972
second access to sunlight has taken on a new significance in recent years in this case the plaintiff seeks to protect access to sunlight not for aesthetic reasons or as a source of illumination but as a source of energy access to sunlight as an energy source is of significance both to the landowner who invests in solar collectors and to a society which has an interest in developing alternative sources of energy11

third the policy of favoring unhindered private development in an expanding economy is no longer in harmony with the realities of our society state v deetz 66 wis 2d 1 224 nw2d 407 1974 the need for easy and rapid development is not as great today as it once was while our perception of the value of sunlight as a source of energy has increased significantly

courts should not implement obsolete policies that have lost their vigor over the course of the years the law of private nuisance is better suited to resolve landowners disputes about property development in the 1980s than is a rigid rule which does not recognize a landowners interest in access to sunlight as we said in ballstadt v pagel 202 wis 484 489 232 nw 862 1930 what is regarded in law as constituting a nuisance in modern times would no doubt have been tolerated without question in former times we read state v deetz 66 wis 2d 1 224 nw2d 407 1974 as an endorsement of the application of common law nuisance to situations involving the conflicting interests of landowners and as rejecting per se exclusions to the nuisance law reasonable use doctrine

in deetz the court abandoned the rigid common law common enemy rule with respect to surface water and adopted the private nuisance reasonable use rule namely that the landowner is subject to liability if his or her interference with the flow of surface waters unreasonably invades a neighbors interest in the use and enjoyment of land restatement second of torts sec 822 826 829 1977 this court concluded that the common enemy rule which served society well in the days of burgeoning national expansion of the midnineteenth and earlytwentieth centuries should be abandoned because it was no longer in harmony with the realities of our society deetz supra 66 wis 2d at 1415 we recognized in deetz that common law rules adapt to changing social values and conditions12

yet the defendant would have us ignore the flexible private nuisance law as a means of resolving the dispute between the landowners in this case and would have us adopt an approach already abandoned in deetz of favoring the unrestricted development of land and of applying a rigid and inflexible rule protecting his right to build on his land and disregarding any interest of the plaintiff in the use and enjoyment of his land this we refuse to do13

private nuisance law the law traditionally used to adjudicate conflicts between private landowners has the flexibility to protect both a landowners right of access to sunlight and another landowners right to develop land private nuisance law is better suited to regulate access to sunlight in modern society and is more in harmony with legislative policy and the prior decisions of this court than is an inflexible doctrine of nonrecognition of any interest in access to sunlight across adjoining land14

we therefore hold that private nuisance law that is the reasonable use doctrine as set forth in the restatement is applicable to the instant case recognition of a nuisance claim for unreasonable obstruction of access to sunlight will not prevent land development or unduly hinder the use of adjoining land it will promote the reasonable use and enjoyment of land in a manner suitable to the 1980s that obstruction of access to light might be found to constitute a nuisance in certain circumstances does not mean that it will be or must be found to constitute a nuisance under all circumstances the result in each case depends on whether the conduct complained of is unreasonable2accordingly we hold that the plaintiff in this case has stated a claim under which relief can be granted nonetheless we do not determine whether the plaintiff in this case is entitled to relief in order to be entitled to relief the plaintiff must prove the elements required to establish actionable nuisance and the conduct of the defendant herein must be judged by the reasonable use doctrineivthe defendant asserts that even if we hold that the private nuisance doctrine applies to obstruction of access to sunlight across adjoining land the circuit courts granting of summary judgment should be affirmed

although the memorandum decision of the circuit court in the instant case is unclear it appears that the circuit court recognized that the common law private nuisance doctrine was applicable but concluded that defendants conduct was not unreasonable15 the circuit court apparently attempted to balance the utility of the defendants conduct with the gravity of the harm sec 826 restatement second of torts 197716 the defendant urges us to accept the circuit courts balance as adequate we decline to do so

the circuit court concluded that because the defendants proposed house was in conformity with zoning regulations building codes and deed restrictions the defendants use of the land was reasonable this court has concluded that a landowners compliance with zoning laws does not automatically bar a nuisance claim compliance with the law is not the controlling factor though it is of course entitled to some weight bie v ingersoll 27 wis 2d 490 495 135 nw2d 250 1965 the circuit court also concluded that the plaintiff could have avoided any harm by locating his own house in a better place again plaintiffs ability to avoid the harm is a relevant but not a conclusive factor see secs 826 827 828 restatement second of torts 1977

3

furthermore our examination of the record leads us to conclude that the record does not furnish an adequate basis for the circuit court to apply the proper legal principles on summary judgment the application of the reasonable use standard in nuisance cases normally requires a full exposition of all underlying facts and circumstances too little is known in this case of such matters as the extent of the harm to the plaintiff the suitability of solar heat in that neighborhood the availability of remedies to the plaintiff and the costs to the defendant of avoiding the harm17 summary judgment is not an appropriate procedural vehicle in this case when the circuit court must weigh evidence which has not been presented at trial 6 pt 2 moores federal practice 5615 7 pp 56638 1982 10 wright and miller federal practice and procedure — civil secs 2729 2731 1973

because the plaintiff has stated a claim of common law private nuisance upon which relief can be granted the judgment of the circuit court must be reversed we need not and do not reach the question of whether the complaint states a claim under sec 84401 stats 197980 or under the doctrine of prior appropriation attoe v madison professional policemens assoc 79 wis 2d 199 205 255 nw2d 489 1977

for the reasons set forth we reverse the judgment of the circuit court dismissing the complaint and remand the matter to circuit court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion
by the court — the judgment of the circuit court is reversed and the cause remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion

ceci j took no partwilliam g callow j dissentingthe majority has adopted the restatements reasonable use doctrine to grant an owner of a solar heated home a cause of action against his neighbor who in acting entirely within the applicable ordinances and statutes seeks to design and build his home in such a location that it may at various times during the day shade the plaintiffs solar collector thereby impeding the efficiency of his heating system1 during several months of the year because i believe the facts of this case clearly reveal that a cause of action for private nuisance will not lie i dissent

the majority arrives at its conclusion that the common law private nuisance doctrine is applicable by analogizing this situation with the spite fence cases which protect a landowner from malicious obstruction of access to light supra at 233235 see piccirilli v groccia 114 ri 36 39 327 a2d 834 837 1974 plaintiff must prove allegedly objectionable fence was erected solely for the avowed purpose of damaging the abutting neighbor and not for the advantage of the person who constructed the fence schorck v epperson 74 wyo 286 28788 287 p2d 467 1955 doctrine of private nuisance founded on maxim that no one should have a legal right to make a malicious use of his property for no benefit to himself but merely to injure another accord daniel v birmingham dental mfg co 207 ala 659 661 93 s 652 1922 green v schick 194 okla 491 492 153 p2d 821 1944 see also comment obstruction of sunlight as a private nuisance 65 calif l rev 94 99102 1977 the ironclad rule has been that the obstruction of a neighbors light and air is not a nuisance if it serves any useful purpose id at 101 emphasis in original courts have likewise refused to limit interference with television reception and other broadcast signals the people ex rel hoogasian v sears roebuck and co 52 ill 2d 301 305 287 ne2d 677 1972 cert denied 409 us 1001 clearly the spite fence cases as their name implies require malice which is not claimed in this case

the majority then concludes that this courts past reluctance to extend protection to a landowners access to sunlight beyond the spite fence cases is based on obsolete policies which have lost their vigor over the course of the years supra at 237 the three obsolete policies cited by the majority are 1 right of landowners to use their property as they desire as long as no physical damage is done to a neighbor 2 in the past sunlight was valued only for aesthetic value not a source of energy and 3 society has a significant interest in not impeding land development supra at 235 see comment obstruction of sunlight as a private nuisance supra at 10512 the majority has failed to convince me that these policies are obsolete

as one commentator has suggestedit is fashionable to dismiss such values as deriving from a bygone era in which people valued development as a goal in itself but current market prices for real estate and more particularly the premiums paid for land whose zoning permits intensive use suggest that people still place very high values on such rightswilliams solar access and property rights a maverick analysis 11 conn l rev 430 443 1979 footnote omitted cf goble solar access and property rights reply to a maverick analysis 12 conn l rev 270 1980

the majority cites two zoning cases village of euclid v ambler realty company 272 us 365 1926 and just v marinette county 56 wis 2d 7 201 nw2d 761 1972 to support the conclusion that society has increasingly regulated private land use in the name of public welfare supra at 236 the cases involving the use of police power and eminent domain are clearly distinguishable from the present situation as they relate to interference with a private right solely for the public health safety morals or welfare in the instant case we are dealing with an action which seeks to restrict the defendants private right to use his property notwithstanding a complete lack of notice of restriction to the defendant and the defendants compliance with applicable ordinances and statutes the plaintiff who knew of the potential problem before the defendant acquired the land seeks to impose such use restriction to accommodate his personal private benefit — a benefit which could have been accommodated by the plaintiff locating his home in a different place on his property or by acquiring the land in question when it was for sale prior to its acquisition by the defendant

i know of no cases repudiating policies favoring the right of a landowner to use his property as he lawfully desires or which declare such policies are no longer fully accepted or applicable in this context supra at 2362 the right of a property owner to lawful enjoyment of his property should be vigorously protected particularly in those cases where the adjacent property owner could have insulated himself from the alleged problem by acquiring the land as a defense to the potential problem or by provident use of his own property

the majority concludes that sunlight has not heretofore been accorded the status of a source of energy and consequently it has taken on a new significance in recent years solar energy for home heating is at this time sparingly used and of questionable economic value because solar collectors are not mass produced and consequently they are very costly their limited efficiency may explain the lack of production

regarding the third policy the majority apparently believes is obsolete that society has a significant interest in not restricting land development it cites state v deetz 66 wis 2d 1 224 nw2d 407 1974 i concede the law may be tending to recognize the value of aesthetics over increased volume development and that an individual may not use his land in such a way as to harm the public the instant case however deals with a private benefit i note that this court in deetz stated the reasonable use rule retains    a policy of favoring land improvement and development id at 20 see also id at 15 accord moritz v buglewicz 187 neb 819 194 nw2d 215 1972 i find it significant that community planners are dealing with this countrys continued population growth and building revitalization where the number of households is expected to reach almost 100 million by the end of the decade that would be 34 percent higher than the number in 1970 f strom 1981 zoning and planning law handbook sec 22023 396 1981 it is clear that community planners are acutely aware of the present housing shortages particularly among those two groups with limited financial resources the young and the elderly id while the majoritys policy arguments may be directed to a cause of action for public nuisance we are presented with a private nuisance case which i believe is distinguishable in this regard3

i would submit that any policy decisions in this area are best left for the legislature what is desirable or advisable or ought to be is a question of policy not a question of fact what is necessary or what is in the best interest is not a fact and its determination by the judiciary is an exercise of legislative power when each involves political considerations in re city of beloit 37 wis 2d 637 644 155 nw2d 633 1968 see generally holifield v setco industries inc 42 wis 2d 750 758 168 nw2d 177 1969 comment solar rights guaranteeing a place in the sun 57 or l rev 94 12627 1977 litigation is a slow costly and uncertain method of reform i would concur with these observations of the trial judge while temptation lingers for the court to declare by judicial fiat what is right and what should be done under the facts in this case such action under our form of constitutional government where the three branches each have their defined jurisdiction and power would be an intrusion of judicial egoism over legislative passivity

the legislature has recently acted in this area chapter 354 laws of 1981 effective may 7 1982 was enacted to provide the underlying legislation enabling local governments to enact ordinances establishing procedures for guaranteeing access to sunlight this courts intrusion into an area where legislative action is being taken is unwarranted and it may undermine a legislative scheme for orderly development not yet fully operational

chapter 354 laws of 1981 sec 66032 provides specific conditions for solar access permits in part that section provides for impermissible interference with solar collectors within specific limitations66032 solar access permits 1   

f impermissible interference means the blockage of solar energy from a collector surface or proposed collector surface for which a permit has been granted under this section during a collector use period if such blockage is by any structure or vegetation on property an owner of which was notified under sub 3 b impermissible interference does not includeblockage by a narrow protrusion including but not limited to a pole or wire which does not substantially interfere with absorption of solar energy by a solar collectorblockage by any structure constructed under construction or for which a building permit has been applied for before the date the last notice is mailed or delivered under sub 3 bblockage by any vegetation planted before the date the last notice is mailed or delivered under sub 3 b unless a municipality by ordinance under sub 2 defines impermissible interference to include such vegetation emphasis addedsec 66032 3 b provides for notice3 permit applications

b an agency shall determine if an application is satisfactorily completed and shall notify the applicant of its determination if an applicant receives notice that an application has been satisfactorily completed the applicant shall deliver by certified mail or by hand a notice to the owner of any property which the applicant proposes to be restricted by the permit under sub 7 the applicant shall submit to the agency a copy of a signed receipt for every notice delivered under this paragraph the agency shall supply the notice form the information on the form may include without limitation because of enumeration

i examine with interest the definition of nuisance as set out in the restatement second of torts and adopted in the majority opinion a private nuisance is a nontrespassory invasion of anothers interest in the private use and enjoyment of land restatement second of torts sec 821d 1977 emphasis added the majority believes that the defendants obstruction of the plaintiffs access to sunlight falls within the broad definition of use and enjoyment of land supra at 230232 i do not believe the defendants obstruction of the plaintiffs access to sunlight falls within the definition of invasion as it applies to the private use and enjoyment of land invasion is typically synonymous with entry attack penetration hostile entrance the incoming or spread of something unusually hurtful websters third international dictionary 1188 1966 most of the nuisance cases arising under this definition involve noxious odors smoke blasting flooding or excessive light invading the plaintiffs right to the use of enjoyment of his property see prosser law of torts sec 89 59192 4th ed 19714 see williams solar access and property rights a maverick analysis 11 conn l rev at 441 there are significant practical differences between dust and noise on the one hand and solar access blockage on the other clearly an owner who merely builds his home in compliance with all building code and municipal regulations is not invading anothers right to the use and enjoyment of his property to say so is to acknowledge that all construction may be an invasion because all construction has some restrictive impact on adjacent land a view for example is modified by any construction simply because it is there

in order for a nuisance to be actionable in the instant case the defendants conduct must be intentional and unreasonable5 it is impossible for me to accept the majoritys conclusion that mr maretti in lawfully seeking to construct his home may be intentionally and unreasonably interfering with the plaintiffs access to sunlight in addressing the unreasonableness component of the actors conduct it is important to note that there is liability for a nuisance only to those to whom it causes significant harm of a kind that would be suffered by a normal person in the community or by property in normal condition and used for a normal purpose restatement second of torts sec 821f 1979 the comments to the restatement further reveal that if normal persons in that locality would not be substantially annoyed or disturbed by the situation then the invasion is not a significant one even though the idiosyncracies of the particular plaintiff may make it unendurable to him id comment d6 see bie v ingersoll 27 wis 2d 490 493 135 nw2d 250 1965 belmar drivein theatre co v the illinois state toll highway commission et al 34 ill 2d 544 54749 216 ne2d 788 1966

i conclude that plaintiffs solar heating system is an unusually sensitive use in other words the defendants proposed construction of his home under ordinary circumstances would not interfere with the use and enjoyment of the usual persons property see w prosser supra sec 87 at 57879 the plaintiff cannot by devoting his own land to an unusually sensitive use such as a drivein motion picture theater easily affected by light make a nuisance out of conduct of the adjoining defendant which would otherwise be harmless id at 579 footnote omitted7

looking solely at the defendants conduct the circuit court concluded that the defendants construction of a house did not create a cause of action for nuisance because the defendants proposed home was in conformity with zoning regulations building codes deed restrictions as well as the fact that the defendants use of the land to build his home was reasonable the majority however cites bie v ingersoll supra for the proposition that compliance with the law is not the controlling factor in evaluating a nuisance claim i note that bie involved the operation of an asphalt plant from which dust and odors permeated the plaintiffs adjoining residence the defendants asserted that because the property occupied by the asphalt plant was zoned for industrial use the plant could not constitute a nuisance this court concluded that the zoning classification was not the controlling factor it is rather the peculiar nature and the location of the business not the fact that it is a business that constitutes the private nuisance 27 wis 2d at 495 the bie case is clearly distinguishable from the case at bar here the defendant seeks to build his home in compliance with all existing laws and it will have no peculiar nature as i read the bie case the negative implication from its facts is that a business which does not emit dust or odors ie which has no peculiar nature and which is in conformity with zoning regulations is not a private nuisance i would hold under the facts of the instant case that the defendants conduct is not unreasonable per se and consequently a nuisance cause of action cannot stand

i further believe that the majoritys conclusion that a cause of action exists in this case thwarts the very foundation of property law property law encompasses a system of filing and notice in a place for public records to provide prospective purchasers with any limitations on their use of the property such a notice is not alleged by the plaintiff only as a result of the majoritys decision did mr maretti discover that a legitimate action exists which would require him to defend the design and location of his home against a nuisance suit notwithstanding the fact that he located and began to build his house within the applicable building municipal and deed restrictions

obviously the legislature was cognizant of the importance of notice in chapter 354 laws of 1981 secs 66032 5 and 6 deal with notice to an adjoining landowner5 permit grant a the agency shall grant a permit if the agency determines thatthe granting of a permit will not unreasonably interfere with the orderly land use and development plans of the municipalityno person has demonstrated that she or he has present plans to build a structure that would create an impermissible interference by showing that she or he has applied for a building permit prior to receipt of a notice under sub 3 b has expended at least 500 on planning or designing such a structure or by submitting any other credible evidence that she or he has made substantial progress toward planning or constructing a structure that would create an impermissible interference andthe benefits to the applicant and the public will exceed any burdens

b an agency may grant a permit subject to any condition or exemption the agency deems necessary to minimize the possibility that the future development of nearby property will create an impermissible interference or to minimize any other burden on any person affected by granting the permit such conditions or exemptions may include but are not limited to restrictions on the location of the collector and requirements for the compensation of persons affected by the granting of the permit

6 record of permit if an agency grants a permit

a the agency shall specify the property restricted by the permit under sub 7 and shall prepare notice of the granting of the permit the notice shall include the identification required under s 70605 2 c for the owner and the property upon which the solar collector is or will be located and for any owner and property restricted by the permit under sub 7 and shall indicate that the property may not be developed and vegetation may not be planted on the property so as to create an impermissible interference with the solar collector which is the subject of the permit unless the permit affecting the property is terminated under sub 9 or unless an agreement affecting the property is filed under sub 10

b the applicant shall record with the register of deeds of the county in which the property is located the notice under par a for each property specified under par a and for the property upon which the solar collector is or will be locatedin recognizing this common law cause of action this courts decision is in direct conflict with the 1981 legislative provisions for the granting of solar access permits in a municipality which enacts the ordinance in conformity with the statute neighbors know their respective rights under the majority decision in a municipality which does not enact the ordinance a common law cause of action for nuisance exists without any defined rights

i believe the facts of the instant controversy present the classic case of the owner of a solar collector who fails to take any action to protect his investment there is nothing in the record to indicate that mr prah disclosed his situation to mr maretti prior to marettis purchase of the lot or attempted to secure protection for his solar collector prior to marettis submission of his building plans to the architectural committee such inaction should be considered a significant factor in determining whether a cause of action exists

the majoritys failure to recognize the need for notice may perpetuate a vicious cycle maretti may feel compelled to sell his lot because of prahs solar collectors interference with his plans to build his family home if so maretti will not be obliged to inform prospective purchasers of the problem certainly such information will reduce the value of his land if the presence of collectors is sufficient notice it cannot be said that the seller of the lot has a duty to disclose information peculiarly within his knowledge i do not believe that an adjacent lot owner should be obliged to experience the substantial economic loss resulting from the lot being rendered unbuildable by the contour of the land as it relates to the location and design of the adjoining home using solar collectors8

i am troubled by the majoritys apparent retrospective application of its decision i note that the court in deetz saw the wisdom and fairness in rendering a prospective decision 66 wis 2d at 24 surely a decision such as this should be accorded prospective status creating the cause of action after the fact results in such unfair surprise and hardship to property owners such as maretti

because i do not believe that the facts of the present case give rise to a cause of action for private nuisance i dissent

3 sec 84401 stats 197980 provides1 any person owning or claiming an interest in real property may bring an action claiming physical injury to or interference with the property or his interest therein the action may be to redress past injury to restrain further injury to abate the source of injury or for other appropriate relief

2 physical injury includes unprivileged intrusions and encroachments the injury may be surface subsurface or suprasurface the injury may arise from activities on the plaintiffs property or from activities outside the plaintiffs property which affect plaintiffs property

3 interference with an interest is any activity other than physical injury which lessens the possibility of use or enjoyment of the interest

4 the lessening of a security interest without physical injury is not actionable unless such lessening constitutes waste

we do not find the reasoning of fontainebleau persuasive the court leaped from rejecting an easement by prescription the doctrine of ancient lights and an easement by implication to the conclusion that there is no right to protection from obstruction of access to sunlight the courts statement that a landowner has no right to light should be the conclusion not its initial premise the court did not explain why an owners interest in unobstructed light should not be protected or in what manner an owners interest in unobstructed sunlight differs from an owners interest in being free from obtrusive noises or smells or differs from an owners interest in unobstructed use of water the recognition of a per se exception to private nuisance law may invite unreasonable behavior

15 as noted previously this court has adopted the reasonableness doctrine set forth in sec 822 of the restatement second of torts cew mgmt corp v first federal savings  loan association 88 wis 2d 631 633 227 nw2d 766 1979 sec 822 provides as followsone is subject to liability for a private nuisance if but only if his conduct is a legal cause of an invasion of anothers interest in the private use and enjoyment of land and the invasion is either

a intentional and unreasonable or

b unintentional and otherwise actionable under the rules controlling liability for negligent or reckless conduct or for abnormally dangerous conditions or activitiesfurther sec 821f restatement second of torts 1977 provides as followsthere is liability for a nuisance only to those to whom it causes significant harm of a kind that would be suffered by a normal person in the community or by property in normal condition and used for a normal purpose

16 the factors involved in determining the gravity of the harm caused by the conduct complained of are set out in sec 827 of the restatement as follows

sec 827 gravity of harm — factors involved

in determining the gravity of the harm from an intentional invasion of anothers interest in the use and enjoyment of land the following factors are important

a the extent of the harm involved

b the character of the harm involved

c the social value that the law attaches to the type of use or enjoyment invaded

d the suitability of the particular use or enjoyment invaded to the character of the locality and

e the burden on the person harmed of avoiding the harm

the factors involved in determining the utility of conduct complained of are set out in sec 828 of the restatement as follows

sec 828 utility of conduct — factors involved

in determining the utility of conduct that causes an intentional invasion of anothers interest in the use and enjoyment of land the following factors are important

a the social value that the law attaches to the primary purpose of the conduct

b the suitability of the conduct to the character of the locality and

c the impracticability of preventing or avoiding the invasion17 see also note 2 supra

1 plaintiff testified that he has a backup electrical system as required by law in this state thus if the solar system fails or loses efficiency he may resort to the electrical system

2 perhaps one reason courts have been hesitant to recognize a cause of action for solar blockage is that such a suit would normally only occur between two abutting landowners and it is hoped that neighbors will compromise and reach agreement between themselves this has undoubtedly been done in a large percentage of cases to now recognize a cause of action for solar blockage may thwart a policy of compromise between neighbors see williams solar access and property rights a maverick analysis 11 conn l rev 430 44142 1979 see also s kraemer solar law 138 1978 a deterring factor to the use of private nuisance to assure access to direct sunlight is the resultant litigation between neighbors

3 i am amused at the majoritys contention that what constitutes a nuisance today would have been accepted without question in earlier times supra 237 this calls to mind the fact that in early days of travel by horses the first automobiles were considered nuisances later when automobile travel became developed the horse became the nuisance ellickson alternatives to zoning covenants nuisance rules and fines as land use controls 40 u chi l rev 681 731 1973 this makes me wonder if we are examining the proper nuisance in the case before us in other words could it be said that the solar energy user is creating the nuisance when others must conform their homes to accommodate his use i note that solar panel glare may temporarily blind automobile drivers reflect into adjacent buildings causing excessive heat and otherwise irritate neighbors certainly in these instances the solar heating system constitutes the nuisance

4 dean prosser also includes disturbances with peace of mind occasioned by bawdy houses stored explosives or fire hazards within the purview of the definition of nuisance i submit these indicia of nuisance relate to a defendants unreasonable or unlawful use of his property

5 unintentional conduct may also be actionable if the plaintiff asserts negligence or recklessness or if an abnormally dangerous condition or activity exists restatement second of torts sec 822b 1979 the plaintiffs complaint does not specify whether the defendants conduct was intentional negligent or reckless

6 consider for example the following illustrations provided in the restatement2 a operates a race track which is illuminated at night by flood lights directed downward b operates next door an openair motion picture theater screened off from the highway the reflection of as lights equivalent to the light of the full moon would be harmless and unobjectionable to anyone making a normal use of adjoining land but so seriously interferes with the operation of bs motion pictures that b loses customers b cannot recover from a for a private nuisance

3 a operates a slaughterhouse which gives off highly offensive orders sufficient to make life unendurable for any normal person living near it b who lives next door is without any sense of smell and is not personally troubled by the odors b can recover from a for a private nuisancerestatement second of torts sec 821f 1979 in my opinion the instant case clearly fits under the first example

7 amicus curiae united states of america in its brief to this court advances the proposition that even a sensitive use is entitled to protection from unreasonable interference amicus analogizes to several mink cases which involve negligence actions see bell v grayrobinson construction company 265 wis 652 62 nw2d 390 1954 maitland v twin city aviation corp 254 wis 541 37 nw2d 74 1949 a thorough reading of these decisions reveals that they are clearly distinguishable from the case at bar no cases have been cited in this jurisdiction which limit this

i note that the federal government supports the plaintiffs position in the instant case if solar energy is in the national interest federal legislation should be enacted
