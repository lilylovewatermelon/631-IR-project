i woke up in montecito
i was thinkin about my life
and the questions made more questions
starin out into the night
yes ive worn the golden gstring
put my hand into hellfire
i did it all to make you love me and to feel alive

chorus
oh thats just the world that were livin in
the old boys hold all the cards and they aint playin gin
you dare to call me crazy have you looked around this place
i should walk away
oh i should walk away
but i think ill stay

verse 2
there are layers to this body
primal sex and primal shame
they told me i should cover it
so i went the other way
i was tryin to own my power
still im tryin to work it out
and at least it gives the paper somethin they can write about
you might also likechorus
and oh thats just the world that were livin in
the old boys hold all the cards and they aint playin gin
and you dare to call me crazy have you looked around this place
i should walk away
oh i should walk away
but i think ill stay

bridge
so the mad mans in the big chair
and his hearts an iron vault
he says if you cant make ends meet honey it must be your fault
we all focus on the winners
and get blinded by their shine
maybe caring for each others just too 1969

chorus
but oh thats just the world that were livin in
the old boys hold all the cards and they aint playin gin
and you dare to call me crazy have you looked around this place
i should walk away
oh i should walk away
but i think ill stay

outro
and i think ill stay yeah
i have too much to lose
so i think ill stay
i cant walk away33embed"
