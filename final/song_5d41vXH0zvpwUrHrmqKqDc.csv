its been a long time comin’ comin
seeming like we all been runnin runnin’
feeling like the wild west gunnin gunnin
listen to our elders shunnin shunnin
flipping on the news beat talkin talkin
all about the problems shockin shockin’
we put on our headphones walking walking
we put on our headphones

verse 2
all we see is faces color color
all the other races other other
why can’t you just be my brother brother
we dont have to kill one another kill one another
all around the world we are one we are one
all around the world we are one
