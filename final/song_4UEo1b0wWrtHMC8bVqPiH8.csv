nightmare
now your nightmare comes to life

verse 1
dragged ya down below
down to the devils show
to be his guest forever
peace of mind is less than never
hate to twist your mind
but god aint on your side
an old acquaintance severed
burn the world your last endeavor

prechorus
flesh is burning you can smell it in the air
cause men like you have such an easy soul to steal steal
so stand in line while they ink numbers in your head
youre now a slave until the end of time here
nothing stops the madness turning
haunting yearning pull the trigger

chorus
you should have known
the price of evil
and it hurts to know that you belong here yeah
ooh its your fuckin nightmare
while your nightmare comes to life
see avenged sevenfold liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likeverse 2
cant wake up in sweat
cause it aint over yet
still dancin with your demons
victim of your own creation
beyond the will to fight
where all thats wrong is right
where hate dont need a reason
loathing selfassassination

prechorus
youve been lied to just to rape you of your sight
and now they have the nerve to tell you how to feel feel
so sedated as they medicate your brain
and while you slowly go insane they tell ya
given with the best intentions
help you with your complications

chorus
you should have known
the price of evil
and it hurts to know that you belong here yeah
no one to call
everybody to fear
your tragic fate is looking so clear yeah
ooh its your fuckin nightmare hahahaha

not to fail fail
not to fall fall
or youll end up like the others

die again die
drenched in sin sin
with no respect for another

breakdown
down down
feel the fire fire
feel the hate hate
your pain is what we desire
lost lost
hit the wall wall
watch you crawl crawl
such a replaceable liar

bridge
and i know you hear their voices
calling from above
and i know they may seem real
these signals of love
but our lifes made up of choices
some without appeal
they took for granted your soul
and its ours now to steal
as your nightmare comes to life
chorus
you should have known
the price of evil
and it hurts to know that you belong here yeah
no one to call
everybody to fear
your tragic fate is looking so clear yeah
ooh its your fuckin nightmare46embed"
