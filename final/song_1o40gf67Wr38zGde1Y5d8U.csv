in the failing light of the afternoon
lucy in the shade of the dogwood blooms
yesterday the solace of a poison fish
tomorrow ill be kissing on her blood red lips

verse 2
no one is the savior they would like to be
the lovesong of the buzzard in the dogwood tree
with a train of horses laughing through the traffic line
and the cradles unimaginative sense of time

verse 3
springtime and the promise of an open fist
a tattoo of a flower on a broken wrist
lucy tells me jokingly to wipe her brow
with a pocket map to heaven and the sun goes downsee iron  wine liveget tickets as low as 60you might also likeembed"
