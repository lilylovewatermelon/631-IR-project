come on

verse 1
watch those idiosyncrasies
watch all the idiots fall on me
running out of ways to get outta the way
take another shot just to stay the same
but i need some balance back it off
fill your lungs till it makes you cough
tell me everythings gonna be all right
cause i dont think ill make it through tonight

refrain
the only way
is all the way
the only way
is all the way
the only way the only way
is all the way is all the way
the only way the only way
is all the way

verse 2
oh my god
its judgment day and im not prepared
everybody out theres runnin scared
so take a little bit off the top
i dont care just make it stop
see slipknot liveget tickets as low as 85you might also likechorus
i wont give another soul to you i will never
i wont give another life to you

postchorus
no you have to stop stop
stop stop

bridge
do one thing and say something cryptic
but the styles always clash
one thing i know for sure
the hypothetical wont work anymore
one wrong move and they will pound
my nails are tight inside my wrists
this sacrament is sacrilege and sentimental
deity experimental faith is accidental

chorus
i wont give another soul to you i will never
i wont give another life to you i will never
i wont give another thought to you i will never
i wont give any more of my hope to you

outro
quit it what do you want
quit it what do you want4embed"
