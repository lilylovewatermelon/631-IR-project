i aint heard you laugh like that in a long time
i wonder if you stopped his world like you did mine just now
i see you sippin white wine instead of whiskey
and does he want you to be just a little more city
well im sorry if im overstepping boundaries
i dont mean to be but ive just got to tell you how i feel

chorus
if he ever singles you up if hes ever stupid enough
imma be the first one calling you baby baby
if he aint holding you tight if he aint treating you right
imma be the first one calling him crazy crazy
cause girl its just a matter of time until you find
that the right guys staring you back into your eyes right now
no rush but if he ever singles you up

verse 2
he hasnt even looked your way since you walked in walked in
but i cant help it that i cant take my eyes off of you
your favorite song just came on and me and you were singing along singing along
and he dont even know a single word

chorus
if he ever singles you up if hes ever stupid enough
imma be the first one calling you baby baby
if he aint holding you tight if he aint treating you right
imma be the first one calling him crazy crazy
cause girl its just a matter of time until you find
that the right guys staring you back into your eyes right now
no rush but if he ever singles you up
if he ever singles you up
imma be the first to call baby

sorry if im overstepping boundaries
i dont mean to be but ive just got to tell you how i feel

chorus
if he ever singles you up if hes ever stupid enough
imma be the first one calling you baby baby
if he aint holding you tight if he aint treating you right
imma be the first one calling him crazy crazy
cause girl its just a matter of time until you find
that the right guys staring you back into your eyes right now
