told em i was gonna be somethin
that broke shit made me sick big appetite with a weak stomach
aint had nowhere to go nigga i was lost in them streets runnin
and i hit rodeo just to get stylish ran through three hundred
just happy i did it nigga nobody ever gave me nothin
flexin so hard i might pull a muscle but i just keep stuntin
thirty in the mag you get bodybagged im just gon keep dumpin
police get behind me ima press the gas im just gon keep stompin
im just gon keep stompin

verse 1 polo g
plottin on the comeup we was schemin
now i hit the stage and they screamin
i was tryna cope through them hard times
for them x pills i was fiendin
got a bad bitch honey skintone pretty long hair she belizean
tryna tell you girl i cant love you im a coldhearted lil demon
dysfunctional i cant show affection might bug out for no reason
really you dont even gotta be here i done got so used to people leavin
you was ridin for me then you switched up now its fuck you and i mean it
couple situations left me traumatized now i say less cause im speechless
if my brother need it then i got him man the whole gang know how im bleedin
tryna wake up from them nightmares devil in my ear while im dreamin
in my past life did some bad things i know karma tryna get even
tryna get away from all the drama hopped in the benz now im speedin

told em i was gonna be somethin
that broke shit made me sick big appetite with a weak stomach
aint had nowhere to go nigga i was lost in them streets runnin
and i hit rodeo just to get stylish ran through three hundred
just happy i did it nigga nobody ever gave me nothin
flexin so hard i might pull a muscle but i just keep stuntin
thirty in the mag you get bodybagged im just gon keep dumpin
police get behind me ima press the gas im just gon keep stompin
im just gon keep stompin

verse 2 lil baby
goofy tried stealin my formula
look these niggas corny these niggas cant come on my corner
im the one do what i wanna
i made the guys spin that bitch every day like a carnival
bought her a patek philippe cause she wanted one
these niggas nothin like me i am one of one
take the bentley four hundred i pay the bond
you aint scarin no one with no gun in this bitch
everybody go dumb in this bitch
niggas hoes and they mama a bitch
in the hood like obama and shit
presidential tint no tellin who in it
ask around i bet they tell you we winnin
different foreign cars aint none of em rented
hundred million cash im comin to get it
out in cali but my mind in the trenches
i advise the boy to play his position
run it up and show love to my city
never leave em im bringin em with me
keep a glizzy its goin in with me i cant let em get me
no time for bullshit im sorry im busy
ima go hard til im forty or fifty
niggas be talkin but they never do shit
so if it aint money i dont even listen
chorus polo g
told em i was gonna be somethin
that broke shit made me sick big appetite with a weak stomach
aint had nowhere to go nigga i was lost in them streets runnin
and i hit rodeo just to get stylish ran through three hundred
just happy i did it nigga nobody ever gave me nothin
flexin so hard i might pull a muscle but i just keep stuntin
thirty in the mag you get bodybagged im just gon keep dumpin
police get behind me ima press the gas im just gon keep stompin
im just gon keep stompin19embed"
