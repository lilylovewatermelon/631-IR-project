spongebob and patrick vs gumball and darwin

spongebob and patrick
im ready to flip this battle like a krabby patty
was this fart of a cartoon created by his flabby daddy
ill have you like your voice actors cause this kittys getting fired
your shows an acid trip of styles that makes tobias look tired
why dont they take their insults and push them somewhere else
have a nasty patty but hes already full of himself oh yeah
patrick guess who i am uhh stupid no
im the amazing world of gumball whats the difference i dont know

gumball and darwin
who earns minimum wage and is dumb as can be
spongebob squarepants
annoying eccentric and stupid is he
spongebob squarepants
if a dead drawnout show is something that you wish
spongebob squarepants
then grab your remote and change over to nick
spongebob squarepants
youve hit bikini bottom i could squeeze this sponge with any diss
what the whats wrong springboob
i think that hes just jellyfish
whether its rap or boating school
youre always gonna fail
both because this goofy goobers even slower than his snail
im a real star fish do you live under a rock
youve both been demoted to tweedledee and dumbf dolphin squeak
you might also likespongebob and patrick
i cant wrap my head around your raps like a trombone
chewing out this gumball who cant even wumbo
who are you calling spongebob im patrick
im not your girlfriend but your disses sure crack me up
your early reel had potential but i think i oughta mention it went down the drain when doodledarwin lost his third dimension
you aint the center of attention next to teen titans go reruns since kids only line up for you when theyre after the refund

gumball and darwin
your repetitive slapstick couldnt make the viewers stay amazed
both these tuna fish will get creamed like they rapped with mayonnaise
hop back on hasselhoff
dont hassle us
yeah you oughta run
both you look up to us you live under the wattersonsembed"
