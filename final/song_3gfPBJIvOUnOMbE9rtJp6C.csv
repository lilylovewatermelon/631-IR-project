my vessel is capsized
i sailed through the tides
through my tears through my cries

ill go down with a smile
under the stormy sky
a passive suicide
a suicide i didnt invite

live and let die
youre born with hands tied
i cant save your soul
for i lost mine long ago

let me crawl into your heart
sting myself and burn your nest
let me crawl into your heart
for the wicked get the rest

i wanna alchemize
my sorrow with your smiles
and how i was chastised and exhiled
i will rise

ill drag you down the aisle
your hands cuffed close to mine
well sail the seven seas
and forever be lost at sea
you might also likelive and let die
youre born with hands tied
i cant save your soul
for i lost mine long ago

let me crawl into your heart
sting myself and burn your nest
let me crawl into your heart
for the wicked get the rest

for the wicked get the rest
for the wicked get the rest

i wanna prophesize
my vessel is capsized
i sailed through the tides
through my tears through my cries

ill go down with a smile
under the stormy sky
a passive suicide
a suicide i didnt invite

let me crawl into your heart
sting myself and burn your nest
let me crawl into your heart
for the wicked get the rest
let me crawl into your heart
sting myself and burn your nest
let me crawl into your heart
for the wicked get the restembed"
