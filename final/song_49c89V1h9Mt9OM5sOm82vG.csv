charlie what are you barking at
charlie im trying to sing a song you gotta go
charlie go

intro
my mind is like a puzzle or a rubiks cube
but figuring me out is something that you shouldnt do
because my thoughts are locked inside a padded room
and if these padded walls could talk id surely be doomed
lets go

verse 1
well troubles what theyve told me since the day i was born
evils what theyve stamped upon my hospital forms
i tried to choke my mom with my umbilical cord
the doctor was too busy amputating my horns
well the devil and the lord both keep waging a war
pulling me in opposite directions im torn
a change of course a deadly force a terrible storm
kicking down the devils door to settle the score

prechorus
its over im older
im alive im sober
believe me im living
im happy im winning
see falling in reverse liveget tickets as low as 105you might also likechorus
faster faster i am on my way straight up
this disaster i can truly say saved us
and i know in my heart if you reach for the stars
all the things that you dream will indeed take you far
so just hope for the best
and just say fuck the rest

verse 2
well i shouldve been aborted when they had their chance
cause now im spilling venom in the ears of the class
and all the high school kids are sick of being told to relax
the crazier the kid the tighter his pants
yeah ill start a revolution bringing gothic back
i got em marching like an army wearing blackonblack
out of a thousand of these motherfucking copycats
none of them can do it quite like i can

prechorus
its over im older
im alive im sober
believe me im living
im happy im winning

chorus
faster faster i am on my way straight up
this disaster i can truly say saved us
and i know in my heart if you reach for the stars
all the things that you dream will indeed take you far
so just hope for the best
and just say fuck the rest
interlude
im so tired of being sick im so sick of being tired
this is for everyone out there who feels like theyve had enough
this song is for you
and your mother too

bridge
youll never win they said
so stop while youre ahead
and music is my love and passions in my blood
so say what you will cause i just dont give a fuck
so get the fuck up go

chorus
faster faster i am on my way straight up
this disaster i can truly say saved us
and i know in my heart if you reach for the stars
all the things that you dream will indeed take you far
so just hope for the best
and just say fuck the rest
and just say fuck the rest
and just say fuck the rest
