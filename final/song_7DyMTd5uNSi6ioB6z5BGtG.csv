well i killed a man in birmingham
i hit him with a tire iron
he did not move and i do not give a damn
ive been working here like a slave mule
sucking the earth of dry crude
looking for a way out of it all
cops are coming
i can feel em here
my back is crawling with standing hair
wouldn’t mind to see a few pigs fall

chorus
so take me down to the river
with my blood all on the floor
cause i dont know if i can carry this weight much longer anymore
take me up the mountain
on a cloud bound for the sky
dont go prayin for me because tonight im prepared to die

instrumental break

verse 2
at night i often wonder what my tombstone would say
would they mention any of my good or just the evil in my days
that night out there in birmingham
that boy he tried to rob me
i did not want to but i had to
show that boy the real me

take me down to the river
with my blood all on the floor
cause i dont know if i can carry this weight much longer anymore
take me up the mountain
on a cloud bound for the sky
dont go prayin for me because tonight im prepared to die

oh oh oh

verse 3
the dust has now settled
on those boys who busted in
i am not a bad man
but theres bullets in my skin

chorus
so take me down to the river
with my blood all on the floor
cause i dont know if i can carry this weight much longer anymore
take me up the mountain
on a cloud bound for the sky
dont go prayin for me because tonight im prepared to dieembed"
