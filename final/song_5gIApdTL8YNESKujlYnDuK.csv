lately ive been reflecting stuck at this intersection
cant figure which way to go to get myself out this depression
wonderin if its worth it wonderin while im searchin
wonderin if ill find out that nothing is ever perfect
i wonder if god can hear me never felt more deserted
feel like ill never flourish ive never felt more discouraged
gotta be more to life than just living and dying
a cloud of smoke behind me now because the bridge is on fire
i used to think it was cool to hustle but now i know
that i cant buy my way to heaven with the drugs i sold
lord wont you guide the way for me cause ive got both eyes closed
and if moses can part the sea then help me just let go

chorus jelly roll
woah woah

if these tears could talk tears could talk
i wonder what theyd say woah
woah woah
woah
all the times we lost times we lost
we lose ourselves along the way

mamas got an addiction been running for way too long
she been playing the same old game and she hasnt been the same
since i was little she used to be my shoulder to cry on
when the hurricane came and nobody was there to save me
i used to be mamas little baby
but now im looking at her like shes the villain
she was disguised as the joker now im feelin like
im batman when im looking in the mirror and my visions clearer
hiding my truth done livin under a rock
bars on my heart i need a key for the lock
if tears could really talk heres the story they would tell
now listen closely as my tears begin to yell

chorus jelly roll
woah woah
woah
if these tears could talk tears could talk
i wonder what theyd say woah
woah woah
woah
all the times we lost times we lost
we lose ourselves along the way

if these tears could talk tears could talk
if these tears could talk tears could talk
if my tears could talk tears could talk
i wonder what theyd say
