red sun red sun over paradise
red sun red sun over paradise

verse 1
golden rays of the glorious sunshine
setting down such a bloodred light
now the animals slowly retreat to the shadows out of sight
arid breeze blows across the mountains
giving flight to the birds of prey
in the distance machines come to transform eden day by day

prechorus
only love is with us now
something warm and pure
find a peace within ourselves
no need for a cure

chorus
when the wind is slow and the fires hot
the vulture waits to see what rots
oh how pretty all the scenery
this is natures sacrifice
when the air blows through with a brisk attack
the reptile tail ripped from its back
when the sun sets we will not forget the red sun over paradise
