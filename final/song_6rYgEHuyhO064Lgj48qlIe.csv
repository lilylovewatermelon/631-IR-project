sitting in the back seat
were driving so fast
hands out the window
were not going back
summer on a green hill
laughing so loud
taking my body
and youre taking it down

chorus
break me down
and ill call you mine
and i know ive been around
and ill call you mine and ill
break me down
and ill call you mine
and i know ive been around

verse 2
sitting in the back seat
were driving so fast
living in a daydream
its too good to last
rainy days and bad luck
coming my way
i look for you when i am lost
so i dont go insane
