i found god
i found him in a lover
when his hair falls in his face
and his hands so cold they shake
i found the devil
i found him in a lover
and his lips like tangerines
in his colorcoded speak

prechorus
now were lost somewhere in outer space
in a hotel room where demons play
they run around beneath our feet
we roll around beneath these sheets

chorus
ive got a lover a love like religion
im such a fool for sacrifice
hes coming down down coming down
its coming down down coming down
ive got a lover and im unforgiven
im such a fool to pay this price
its coming down down coming down
its coming down down coming down

i found a martyr
he told me that id never
with his educated eyes
and his head between my thighs
i found a savior
i dont think he remembers
cause hes off to pay his crimes
and hes got no time for mine

prechorus
now were lost somewhere in outer space
in a hotel room where demons play
they run around beneath our feet
we roll around beneath these sheets

chorus
ive got a lover a love like religion
im such a fool for sacrifice
hes coming down down coming down
its coming down down coming down
ive got a lover and im unforgiven
im such a fool to pay this price
its coming down down coming down
its coming down down coming down
down down down down
bridge
every single night pray the sun will rise
every single time make a compromise
every single night pray the sun will rise but
its coming down down coming down
hes coming down down coming down

chorus
ive got a lover a love like religion
im such a fool for sacrifice
hes coming down down coming down
its coming down down coming down
ive got a lover and im unforgiven
im such a fool to pay this price
its coming down down coming down
its coming down down coming down

bridge
every single night pray the sun will rise
every single time make a compromise
every single night pray the sun will rise but
its coming down down coming down
hes coming down down coming down

outro
its coming down down coming down
hes coming down down coming down
its coming down down coming down
hes coming down down coming down
its coming down down coming down
