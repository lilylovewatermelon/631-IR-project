we call out to the beasts of the sea
to come forth and join us
this night is yours
because one day we will all be with you in the blackened deep
one day we will all go into the water

bridge
go into the water
live there die there
live there die

chorus
we reject our earthly fires
gone are days of land empires
lungs transform to take in water
cloaked in scales we swim and swim home

verse 2
we are alive and well metamorphosize
and well sink as we devolve back to beasts
our home is down here
and weve known this for years
we must conquer from the sea
were an army with water steeds
see dethklok liveget tickets as low as 47you might also likewell rise
from our depths down below
release yourselves
drown with me
we will conquer land with water

chorus
gone are days of land empires
lungs transform to take in water
cloaked in scales we swim and swim home
we swim home
we swim homeembed"
