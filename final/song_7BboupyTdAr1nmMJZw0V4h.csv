i broke down at the side of the road
stranded at the outskirts and the suns creepin up
babys in the backseat still fast asleep
dreaming of better days
i dont wanna call you but youre all i have to turn to

what do you say when its all gone away
baby i didnt mean to hurt you
truth spoke in whispers will tear you apart
no matter how hard you resist it
it never rains when you want it to

you humble me lord
you humble me lord
im on my knees empty
you humble me lord
you humble me lord
so please please please forgive me

baby theresa shes got your eyes
i see you all the time
when she asks about her daddy
i never know what to say
heard you kicked the bottle
and you helped build a church
you carry an honest wage
is it true you have somebody keeping you company
see norah jones liveget tickets as low as 26you might also likewhat do you say when its all gone away
baby i didnt mean to hurt you
truth spoke in whispers will tear you apart
no matter how hard you resist it
it never rains when you want it to

you humble me lord
you humble me lord
im on my knees empty
you humble me lord
you humble me lord
so please please forgive me

you humble meembed"
