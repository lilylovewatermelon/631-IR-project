you got a smile so bright
you know you couldve been a candle
im holding you so tight
you know you couldve been a handle
the way you swept me off my feet
you know you couldve been a broom
and baby you smell so sweet
you know you couldve been some perfume

chorus
well you couldve been anything that you wanted to
i can tell
the way you do the things you do
i like the way you do the things you do

verse 2
as pretty as you are
you know you couldve been a flower
if good looks were minutes
you know you could have been an hour
the way you stole my heart
you know you could have been a crook
and baby your so smart
you know you could have been a school book
