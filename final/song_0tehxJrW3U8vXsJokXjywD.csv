verse 1 kanye west
and ill never let my son have an ego
hell be nice to everyone wherever we go
i mean i might even make him be republican
so everybody know he love white people
and ill never let him leave his college girlfriend
and get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwinds
and ill never let him ever hit the telethon
i mean even if people dyin and the world ends
see i just want him to have an easy life not like yeezy life
just want him to be someone people like
dont want him to be hated all the time judged
dont be like your daddy thatd never budge
and ill never let him ever hit a strip club
i learned the hard way that aint the place to get love
and ill never let his mom move to la
knowin she couldnt take the pressure now we all pray

verse 2 jayz
sorry junior i already ruined ya
cause you aint even alive paparazzi pursuin ya
sins of a father make your life ten times harder
i just wanna take ya to a barber
bondin on charters all the shit that i never did
teach you good values so you cherish it
took me twentysix years to find my path
my only job is cut the time in half
so at thirteen well have our first drink together
black bar mitzvahs mazel tov mogul talk
look a man dead in his eyes
so he know you talk truth when you speak it
give your word keep it
and if the day comes i only see him on the weekend
i just pray we was in love on the night that we conceived him
promise to never leave him even if his mama tweakin
cause my dad left me and i promise never repeat him
never repeat him never repeat him
