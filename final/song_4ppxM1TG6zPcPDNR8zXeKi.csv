i dont think this is working out to well
i wish you would die and go to hell i do
i dont mean to be negative
but you bring it out in me i swear
i hate you and its not that hard to tell

chorus 1
i want to take a sledgehammer to your car
and break every little part
just wait until i get the nerve to break
your precious little heart
your precious little heart


verse 2
i never want to see your face again
everything you say to me i dont want to hear
i just want to forget that we ever met
or i just might start breaking all your shit
that might make me feel better so maybe i will

chorus 2
im going to take a sledgehammer to your car
and break everything apart
too late i finally got the nerve
to break your precious little heart
you might also likeim going to take a sledgehammer to your car
and break everything apart
too late i finally got the nerve
to break your precious little heart


bridge
your precious little heart
your precious little heart
your precious little heart
your precious little heart

chorus 1
i want to take a sledgehammer to your car
and break every little part
just wait until i get the nerve to break
your precious little heart
your precious little heart

chorus 2
im going to take a sledgehammer to your car
and break everything apart
too late i finally got the nerve
to break your precious little heartembed"
