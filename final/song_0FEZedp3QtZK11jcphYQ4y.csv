you who are rich and whose troubles are few
may come around to see my point of view
what price the crown of a king on his throne
when you’re chained in the dark all alone

verse 1 jadakiss
i’m real as they come i follow the rules
i’m still in the hood but i probably should move
made enough money i don’t fuck around
i just felt they needed me so i stuck around
feds got my man shit is real son
cause my godson just became my real son
think life is a game but all you get is a turn
you live and you learn either you freeze or you burn
kush in the air i’m pushin the gears
love turned into hate hate turned into fear
if it aint right i don’t sign the deal
shoot me in the watch i got time to kill
gasoline propane
aint no salary cap in the dope game
aint no collective bargainin on cocaine
so in other words nigga do your thing

verse 2 drake
mind in one place heart in another
please pardon my brother he’s just angry at you niggas
who dont have your heart in your rap shit
and got too fuckin comfy
cause we still fuckin hungry young money got the munchies
faded fuckin faded aw yeah im fuckin faded
they tellin’ lies about me aw yeah i mustve made it
rikers island on this flow eight months for that pistol
but at least they had some bad bitches workin’ in that shit hole
