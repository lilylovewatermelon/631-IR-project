let me die let me drown lay my bones in the ground
i will still come around when the time for sleep is through
over hill over dale through the valley and vale
do not weep do not wail i am coming home to you

verse 2
every tomb every sea spit the bones from your teeth
let the ransomed be free as the revel meets the day
let the valleys awake let them rattle and shake
in the wind that remakes all that time has worn away

chorus
to and fro i will not follow
where you go i will not also

bridge
i will look for you
as the sun rises high
when the dry bones dance
with the timbrel and lyre
theres a wind alive
in the valley
it will fill your lungs
if youll have it
you might also likecoda
where i go will you still follow
will you leave your shaded hollow
will you greet the daylight looming
learn to love without consuming3embed"
