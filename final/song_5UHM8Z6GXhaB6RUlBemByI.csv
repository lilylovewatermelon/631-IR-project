hold my hand
feel the touch of your body cling to mine
you and me makin love
all the way through another night
i remember you and i
walkin through the park at night
kiss and touch nothin much
let it blow just touch and go
love me more never leave me alone by house of love
people talk people say
what we have is just a game
oh i’ll never let you go
come here girl
just got to make sweet love ‘til the break of dawn

chorus
i don’t want the sun to shine i wanna make love
its the break of dawn
just this magic in your eyes
and in my heart break of dawn
i don’t know what i’m gon do
i can’t stop lovin you
its the break of dawn
i won’t stop ‘til break of dawn makin love

let me groove let me soothe
let me take you on a cruise

i bet youve never been there before
have you ever wanted to dream
about those things you never known

prechorus
break of dawn break of dawn
there’s no sun up in the sky
break of dawn break of dawn
i can see it in your eyes
break of dawn break of dawn
