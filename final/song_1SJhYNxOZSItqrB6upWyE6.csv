flexibility love and trust
take a moment to think of just
flexibility love and trust

here comes a thought
that might alarm you
what someone said
and how it harmed you
something you did
that failed to be charming
things that you said are
suddenly swarming and oh

youre losing sight
youre losing touch
all these little things seem to matter so much
that they confuse you
that i might lose you

take a moment remind yourself to
take a moment and find yourself
take a moment to ask yourself if
this is how we fall apart

but its not but its not but its not but its not but its not
its okay its okay its okay its okay its okay
youve got nothing got nothing got nothing got nothing to fear
im here im here im here
