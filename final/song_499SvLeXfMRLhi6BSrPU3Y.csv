homeliness and loneliness are wearing at the scars
rehash information so to tell them who you are
definition blurs when youre staring through the smoke
nothing really hurts when everythings a joke

verse 2
smart enough to make it dumb enough to use it
dropping to the floor when all the girlies lose it
he dont really like the taste so he cover it in salt
taste that shit so much he dont notice it at all
