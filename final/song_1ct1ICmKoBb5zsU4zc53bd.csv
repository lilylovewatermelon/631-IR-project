restless little one
comfortable and warm
let me fall apart
crippled in your arms

prechorus 1
chase me through the dark
ready on your mark
first to reach the stars
wins a broken heart one that broke apart
shattered from the start

chorus
are you there
do you read me
are you there
i dont feel you anymore

verse 2
cages and alarms
keepin us from harm
i will be the guard
hope to rest upon

prechorus 2
could i be the one
to break a will so strong
pray it wont be long
til your will is gone everythin is done
nothin left at all
