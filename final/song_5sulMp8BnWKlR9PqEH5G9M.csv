back of the room
looking at you
counting the steps
between us
a hundred and five
little blades in a line
from your skin to mine
and i feel it
eyes on the ground
but i cant look up now
dont wanna give it away
my secret

prechorus
in another life
my teeth and tongue
would speak aloud what until now
ive only sung

chorus
cause i would die to make you mine
you bleed me dry each and every time
but i dont mind no i dont mind it
i will come back 1000 times
you can make me wait forever
push me away and tell me never
but i dont mind no i dont mind it
i will come back 1000 times
you might also likeverse 2
kiss me goodnight like a good friend might
and ill do the same but wont mean it
cause love is a cage and these words on a page
can carry the pain but they dont free it

prechorus
in another life i wouldnt need to
console myself as i resign to release you

chorus
cause i would die to make you mine
you bleed me dry each and every time
but i dont mind no i dont mind it
i will come back 1000 times
you can make me wait forever
push me away and tell me never
but i dont mind no i dont mind it
i will come back 1000 times

bridge
again again i let it go let it go
cover my mouth
dont let a single word slip out
i wouldnt wanna tell you no tell you no
nothing could be worse
than the risk of losing what i dont have now
im weaker by the minute though
is it so bad if i wanna cry outâ€“
chorus
that i would die to make you mine
you bleed me dry almost every time
but i dont mind no i dont mind it
i will come back 1000 times
make me wait forever
push me away and tell me never
but i dont mind no i dont mind it
i will come back 1000 times
i will come back 1000 times
hey hey
i will come back 1000 times3embed"
