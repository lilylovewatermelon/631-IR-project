verse 1 papa pine
reach into my pocket and i grab a couple crumpled hunnids

blunted out the fuzz is huntin woo woo
paranoia turn my stomach
h1 hummer rough and rugged desert camo truck to the front
and shirt unbuttoned seat adjusted ayy
one hunnid miles per hour
bitch i seem accustomed to life in the fast lane
nothin in the motherfucking gas tank
dumpin ashes and laughin hahaha
fucking ducking what comes from the government fuck
peelin out into the sunset fuck
eyes so low look like a sunset

chorus papa pine  yung christ

got a death list that some still got to catch this

high until my death i got a propane tank low
gas seepin all over the house until my say so
light the fuckin match now that tank blow
so glad i stayed home
someone call the cops from the payphone
flames all around me man i hope they fuckin drown me
crown made of ashes only way they fuckin found me
forget about me only way you might not feel so lousy
forget about me on my own head i would have priced a bounty

chorus project pat

interlude bloody mary
in new orleans there were many bizarre things i always saw growing up here especially in the graveyards and as a child i spent a lot of time in the graveyards as an adult i still spend a lot of time in the graveyards but as a child it was a regular weekend thing to do—i always needed to know why um sometimes my whys got me in trouble
missed my cue for curtain call

intro ruby da cherry  lick loth
and for my last trick i dont think im cut out for this rap shit
ayy you wanna keep going—or
nah thats it

verse 1 ruby da cherry
uicide i fucking scream it from the rooftop
the only thing i ever did worth mentionin
ever since lick burned me a cd of lil wayne
that shit prolly still in my boombox
but nowadays i can walk into an establishment
and select myself on the fuckin jukebox
if i wanted to cop a black countach drive that shit like two blocks
and then smash in the back of a new cop car
now i think im wanted too

interlude

losin losin—
im on the lean yeah that drank

im on a lotta amphetamines got no time for sleep
lost in my thoughts i dont know who a friend or who a enemy
nerves real disturbed down from head to toe

creator of the movement creator of the music
