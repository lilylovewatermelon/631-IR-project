ooh oh hey

verse 1
those things you did i didnt recognize how much they hurt me
only i blamed it i wanna apologize
was i being too difficult for complainin for the pain i was dealin with
or catchin you in different lies
that you would deny coldfaceed yeah
but you found a way to make it back
but as much as i refused my heart is still askin do you

chorus
do you mean it when you say my name
cause lately all this bullshit aint makin me feel what you say
tell me do you mean it when you say my name
cause its always constant bullshit when you dont do what you say

verse 2
beside apart from you i would ride for you i will i will
even them times you aint do me right i was right hеre
showin you what the word bein loyal is
but wе would always end up fightin
but the truth is i was only tryin to make it right
even thought i mightve been wrong in the way that i didnt keep it private
respondin in the best way i knew
when you know that a bitch stay down
when you been doubtin where i stay

do you mean it when you say my name
cause lately all this bullshit aint makin me feel what you say
tell me do you mean it when you say my name
cause its always constant bullshit when you dont do what you say
