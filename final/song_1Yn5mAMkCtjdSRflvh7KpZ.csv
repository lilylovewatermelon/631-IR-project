real smooth yeah
here we go again

verse 1 nelly
they said a country boy came through and then
changed the game
if you what you got aint hot then  check your flame
if what you spittin aint hittin then  check your aim
your record sales start to slip and then  nelly to blame
now who you know come through first time on the scene
no setups no guest appearances in between
fire like a nigga drinkin gasoline
i keep it hot like my dirty down in new orleans
the rams won the superbowl bought myself a ring
whether you sparkle or you bling dont matter same thing
thug drinkin mo but don the king
