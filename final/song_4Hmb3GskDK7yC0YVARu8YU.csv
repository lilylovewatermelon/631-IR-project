love will be the armor
protect us from the pain
in our life in our life
even when the storm comes
well stand out in the rain
watch it slide let it slide

refrain william  skylar grey
here we stand
against the world

prechorus william
you and i we rock the lullaby
make me feel alive cause the love it never die

aint no need to worry dont call 911
bang bang a lot of bang bang
