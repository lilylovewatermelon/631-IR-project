children growing women producing
men go work and some go stealing
everyones got to make a living

verse kanye west
no more promos no more photos
no more logos no more chokeholds
we on bezos we get payrolls
trips to lagos connect like legos
make this final make this my eyes closed
burn false idols jesus disciples
i can feel your pain now i done bled my vein out
new level the game now simulation changed
no more problems no more argue
no more askin who really arе you
i know the real you you know we feel you
you know hе hears you you know we with you
straight from beirut chicago beirut
you cray we cray too
you pray we pray too
never too late for him to save you
this your movie cause no one can play you
devil lay down devil lay down
this that level make devils pray now heaven and hell
hold up no peace hold up police
dont call police just stay focused is on earth
pray for new life pray for new breath
hey lord make sure its safe for whos left heaven and hell
know you cant find a place to rest
know the lord my bulletproof vest is on earth
when we survive know that we blessed
save my people through the music
