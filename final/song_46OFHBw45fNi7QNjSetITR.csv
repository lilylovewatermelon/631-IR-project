verse 1
i wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
this little light of mine im finna let it shine
im finna take yall back to them better times
im finna talk about my mama if yall dont mind
i was three years old when you and i moved to the chi
late december harsh winter gave me a cold
you fixed me up something that was good for my soul
famous homemade chicken soup can i have another bowl
you work late nights just to keep on the lights
mommy got me training wheels so i could keep on my bike
and you would give anything in this world
michael jackson leather and a glove but didnt give me a curl
and you never put no man over me
and i love you for that mommy cant you see
seven years old caught you with tears in your eyes
cause a nigga cheatin telling you lies then i started to cry
as we knelt on the kitchen floor
i said mommy ima love you til you dont hurt no more
and when im older you aint gotta work no more
and ima get you that mansion that we couldnt afford
see youre unbreakable unmistakable
highly capable lady thats makin loot
a livin legend too just look at what heaven do
sent us an angel and i thank you mama

verse 2
forrest gump mama said life is like a box of chocolates
my mama told me “go to school get your doctorate
something to fall back on you could profit with”
but still supported me when i did the opposite
now i feel like its things i gotta get
things i gotta do just to prove to you
you was getting through can the choir please
give me a verse of you are so beautiful to me
cant you see youre like a book of poetry
maya angelou nikki giovanni turn one page and theres my mommy
come on mommy just dance wit me
let the whole world see your dancing feet
now when i say hey yall say mama
now everybody answer me come on
chorus

hey mama

break
i guess it also depends though if my ends low
second they get up you gon get that benzo
tint the windows ride around the city and let your friends know hey mama
tell your job you gotta fake em out
since you brought me in this world let me take you out
to a restaurant upper echelon
ima get you a jag whatever else you want
just tell me what kind of stype donda west like
tell me the perfect color so i make it just right
it dont gotta be mothers day or your birthday
for me to just call and say

outro
