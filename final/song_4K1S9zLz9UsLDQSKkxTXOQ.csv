simply explains its all that remains
its no wonder why i have not slept in days

the dust on the floor
piled up from the years all those scars and souvenirs
now that youre gone its easy to see

but so hard to believe

by the way
you left without sayin goodbye to me
now that youre gone away
all i can think about is you and me
you and me

its not like before
youve left nothing here its all disappeared
it hurts me to see that weve been a lie

would it have hurt you to try

by the way
you left without sayin goodbye to me
now that youre gone away
all i can think about is you and me
you and me
you might also likeits sad to say that this pain is killin me inside
but its sad to say that this pain is keepin me alive
twistin and turnin it rips through my heart
its been tearin me apart

by the way
you left without sayin goodbye to me
now that youre gone away
all i can think about is you and me
you and me

you and me yeah
all i think about now is you and me you and me
you and me yeah
all i think about now is you and me you and me
you and me you and me yeah
