from the unknown
i ran away i dont think im coming back home
whoawhoawhoawhoawhoawhoa
like a crawlspace its a dark place i roam
aint no right way just the wrong way i know
i problemsolve with styrofoam
my world revolves around a black hole
the same black hole thats in place of my soul uh
empty i feel so goddamn empty
i may go rogue
dont tempt me big bullet holes
tote semiautos

verse 1
huh yeah
im keepin it real real
im keepin it real uh yeah
life gets tough shit is getting real yeah
i dont know how to feel
swallowing all these pills
numb my real feels uh
devil standing here
tryna make a deal uh
it aint no deals
feel like im going crazy but still took a lot to get me here
losing my sanity up in a house in the hills hills hills
i aint have anything then and i still dont have anything still still still uh
bein me i rock pnb
these hoes actin like gossip tmz
these drugs acting like
mosh pits squishing me
oh my oh me how they kill me slowly
lonely i been gettin no peace
od feel like overdosing
low key i been looking for the signs
but all i can find is a sign of the times

verse 2
i aint suicidal
only thing suicide is suicide doors
fight for survival
gotta keep hope up rolling good dope up uh
hold my hand through hell we go
dont look back it aint the past no more
gonna get to the racks all them niggas want war
yeah i was put here to lead the lost souls
exhale depression as the wind blows
these are the laws of livin in vogue
were perfectly imperfect children
rose from the dust all of us are on a mission
never gave a fuck really came from rags to riches
now we live it up driving with the rooftop missin
i dont give a fuck really came from rags to riches
now i live it up driving with the rooftop missin
