i try to picture the girl
through a looking glass
and see her as a carbon atom
see her eyes and stare back at them
see that girl
as her own new world
though a home is on the surface she is still a universe

prechorus
glory god oh god is peeking through the blinds
are we all here standing naked
taking guesses at the actual date and time
oh my justifying reasons why
is an absolutely insane resolution to live by

chorus
live high
live mighty
live righteously
taking it easy
live high
live mighty
live righteously

verse 2
try to picture the man
to always have an open hand
and see him as a giving tree
see him as matter
matter fact hes not a beast
no not the devil either
always a good deed doer
and its laughter that were making after all

the call of the wild is still an ordination why
and the order of the primates
all our politics are too late
oh my the congregation in my mind
is this assembly singing of gratitude
practicing their loving for you

chorus
live high
live mighty
live righteously
taking it easy
live high
live mighty
oh live righteously

verse 3
sing it out
and just take it easy
and celebrate the malleable reality
you see nothing is ever as it seems
this life is but a dream oh

chorus
live high live high
live mighty mighty mighty
oh live righteously
taking it easy live high
live mighty oh live righteously
just take just just taking easy high
oh live mighty mighty
oh live righteously
oh just take it easy
just live high
oh live righteously
just take it easyembed"
