yeah
oh wait

verse 1
abusing all my authority
shutting down these sororities
music is the priority
all the other shit is a minority
superman they cant stop me now
bad vibes i just block them out
michigan where i was poppin out
now im in the hills and im poppin now
i cant take my eyes
take them off this life
oh yeah
my paradigm is to feel alive

prechorus
if you ever turn your back on me
ima turn this thing into a tragedy
and i dont want to end this shit tragically
but i know things aint what they tend to be
and i want to feel your energy
i dont want to turn you to an enemy but
you might also likechorus
we all want to be somebody
we all want to be anybody
we just want to feel something real
we all want to be somebody
we all want to be anybody
we just want to feel something real

verse 2
i got somethin to focus on
they see diamonds they focus gone
20 years and im more than strong
im in this thing til my pulse is done
feelin after like novacane
i feel the sun i dont see the rain
found myself and the game was changed
no more sleep and im wide awake

prechorus
if you ever turn your back on me
ima turn this thing into a tragedy
and i dont want to end this shit tragically
but i know things aint what they tend to be
and i want to feel your energy
i dont want to turn you to an enemy but
chorus
we all want to be somebody
we all want to be anybody
we just want to feel something real
we all want to be somebody
we all want to be anybody
we just want to feel something real

outro
