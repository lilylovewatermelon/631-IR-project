in the lane snow is glistening
a beautiful sight were happy tonight
walking in a winter wonderland
gone away is the bluebird
here to stay is a new bird
he sings a love song as we go along
walking in a winter wonderland
in the meadow we can build a snowman
then pretend that he is parson brown
hell say are you married well say no man
but you can do the job when youre in town
later on well conspire
as we dream by the fire
to face unafraid the plans that weve made
walking in a winter wonderland
over the ground lies the mantle of light
a heaven of diamond in the lovely night
in the meadow we can build a snowman
then give him a name and call him parson brown
hell say are you married and then well say no man
but now you can do the job whenever youre in town
later on well conspire
as we dream sittin by the fire
to face unafraid all the plans that weve made
walking in a winter wonderland
sleigh bells ring are you listening
in the lane snow is glistening
a beautiful sight were happy tonight
walking in a winter wonderland
