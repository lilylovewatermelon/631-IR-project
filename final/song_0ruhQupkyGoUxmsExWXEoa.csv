verse 1 jesse rutherford
put yourself down have a little shame
help me bring it back before we go away
we are all the same we are all to blame

chorus jesse rutherford
i dont feel the way that i used to anymore
i dont ever wanna confuse you anymore
we were never on the same page never ever
and it might be time for a change
but what do i do if i lose you

verse jesse rutherford
do you remember when we were friends
nothing more than that had to last
told me that you had my back
i said ive got yours back
no matter what you do no matter where you go
ill be there to let you know ill be true
no matter whats at stake i wont ever lie or fake
we both know somethings off its so easy to see
we know its obvious but dont wanna believe it
di didnt do the best but we got there first
huddled up together when the weather got worse
there for each other for whatever like brothers
so we gotta make it work
chorus jesse rutherford
i dont feel the way that i used to anymore
i dont ever wanna confuse you anymore
we were never on the same page never ever
and it might be time for a change
but what do i do if i lose you
