think ill grab a bottle of patron
when i get off work on my way home
fill that hot tub full of bubble bath kick back relax
baby you and me and nothing on yea

got a weekend coming just in time
were both needing what ive got in mind
what i got in mind thats me and you into me and you
cant wait to get you all alone yea

chorus
lay low stay home and stay high
stay up make love all night
i want to run my fingers over every single inch of you
take my time taking it slow
stay home stay high and lay low

verse 2
well let our kisses do the talking girl
take each other to another world
feel like were a million miles from here
somewhere out there without going anywhere at all

chorus
lay low stay home and stay high yea
stay up make love all night
i want to run my fingers over every single inch of you
take my time taking it slow
stay home stay high and
