road trippin with my two favorite allies
fully loaded we got snacks and supplies
its time to leave this town its time to steal away
lets go get lost anywhere in the usa
lets go get lost lets go get lost

prechorus
blue you sit so pretty west of the one
sparkle light with yellow icing just a mirror for the sun

chorus
just a mirror for the sun
just a mirror for the sun
these smiling eyes are just a mirror for

verse 2
so much has come before those battles lost and won
this life is shining more forever in the sun
now let us check our heads and let us check the surf
staying high and drys more trouble than its worth in the sun

chorus
just a mirror for the sun
just a mirror for the sun
these smiling eyes are just a mirror for
see red hot chili peppers liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likeverse 3
in big sur we take some time to linger on
we three hunky dorys got our snake finger on
now let us drink the stars its time to steal away
lets go get lost right here in the usa
lets go get lost lets go get lost

prechorus
blue you sit so pretty west of the one
sparkle light with yellow icing just a mirror for the sun

chorus
just a mirror for the sun
just a mirror for the sun
these smiling eyes are just a mirror for
these smiling eyes are just a mirror for
your smiling eyes are just a mirror for8embed"
