the smoke mollifies the lung into which it rips
in a sunlit tavern in a corner booth
sucking stale popcorn there i met dear ruth
shed only just lost the baby seven months and a week
drank a month of seagrams kissed me on the cheek

never wouldve been my style
but i could spot it from a mile
that it would mean a world of good
if we got friendly for a while
o what a dear my dear girl might have been

in my nine dollar room there was nothing on tv
she asked if she could use my toothbrush it dont bother me
i thank you for the company she most solemnly said
when i woke the next morning she had fallen from the bed
quite a sight i have to say
where once had blossomed a bouquet
now all but wilting like a leaf
in the ruthless light of day

o what a dear my dear girl might have been
you might also likeruth sweet girl theres no place for you
here in my little nine dollar room2embed"
