we never had that much to do
so we just lay around in someones house

then wed just get up and go outside
open a window let the breeze blow in forget everything

well wed go drinking in the afternoon
lie out on the grass and fall asleep

verse 4
yeah we used to share a cigarette
and throw together everything we had
and then go driving in my parents car
we never strayed too far
