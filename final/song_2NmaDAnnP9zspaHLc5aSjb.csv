im in the business of losin your interest
and i turn a profit each time that we speak
dont you know theres a coffin buried under the garden
it was there when we got here will be there when we leave
and my house was designed to kinda look like its cryin
the eyes are the windows the garage is the mouth
so when they mention thе sad kid
in a sad house on balch street
you wont have to guess who thеy speakin about

chorus
come over
come over

verse 2
im in the process of clearin out cobwebs
i was takin the wrong meds feels good to be sad
and my house is just barely big enough for my family
but it feels like a fortress when the weather gets bad
and my mouth was designed for my foot to fit in it
oh the words they went missin when the stock market crashed
and the dow jones keeps fallin but i promise you darlin
with the view in the morning you wont ever go back

chorus
come over
come over
come over
come over
see noah kahan liveget tickets as low as 102you might also likebridge
i know that it aint much i know that it aint cool
oh you dont have to tell the other kids at school
my dadll strike it rich well be the big house on the block
someday im gonna be somebody people want

outro
but im in the business of losin your interest
and i turn a profit each time that we speak
dont you know theres a coffin buried under the garden
it was there when we got here will be there when we leaveembed"
