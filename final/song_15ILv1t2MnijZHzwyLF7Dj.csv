id have to be crazy to stop all my singing
and never play music again
youd call me a fool if i grabbed up my top hat
and ran out to flag down the wind
id have to be weird to grow me a beard
just to see what the rednecks would do
id have to be crazy plum out of my mind
to fall out of love with you

verse 2
you know ive done weird things
told people ive heard things
when silence was all in abounds
been days when it pleased me to crawl on my knees
following ants as they crawled across the ground
been insane on a train but im still me again
and the place where i hold you is true
but id have to be crazy plum out of my mind
to fall out of love with you

bridge
i dont intend to
but should there come a day
when i say that i dont love you
you can lock me away
you might also likeverse 3
well it sure would be dingy to live in an envelope
in a world waiting along for a stamp
youd swear i was loco to rub for a genie
while burning my hand on a lamp
i may not be normal but nobody is
so id like to say before im through
id have to be crazy plum out of my mind
to fall out of love with you

outro
id have to be crazy plum out of my mind
to fall out of love with youembed"
