is it much too much to ask
not to hide behind the mask

verse 1 mf doom
head on straight mask on crooked
exit stage left with the cash gone took it
off like a khufi the fit was a bit doofy
he tried to get screwy with that two for you
one two for me g cut the cranky attitude
wet em like a handkerchief on a stanky fatter dude
whether yous a rapper or a dang singer
once you in theres only one way out like a gangbanger
with a new crew key chain and street name
what set do he claim for fame peep game
just to keep feta and stay dipped
you need it like a letter or better a getaway whip
this old things rusted
encrusted as the gold rings the old kings busted
planning in global starvation and fat herb
now what in tarnation did i go and do that for
stuff happens like getting snuffed for tough tit rappings
see i told him enough quit your yapping
the same apply to any and all chumps
the only question he had for yall was how many lumps
three or four either or
mon ch√©ri amour so why you need your heater for
the super villain slid in your party for free
want an mc get out of here kid you bother me
you might also likeverse 2 ghostface killah
the day i took my mask off my face was missing for two days
for the record g came back a year later
a whole new identity tony starks pedigree
my money green like my nickname was celery
who is ghost he flashed his toast
never wore sheets but bulletproof coats
oh no the feds cried for the mask back on
told them ghost is dead hell return at the crack of dawn
few years from now him and his pals
before the jetson era arrive hell be back summertime 2005
with a half of face iron
the other half water look like alien science
in the summertime here you can see the face boil
but the other side i keep lubed with the pennzoil
mad loyal uhhuh when the winter time come what
i gets stuck cause my brain all numb
its like i ate a thousand icees and frozen pepsis
aquamans pops cant water check me
disrespect me indirectly
i seen his feet and they both lefty he steppin half correctly
as i stroll the globe and terrorize the planet
with a bill clinton mask and them playskool hammers
me and doom always be the best on the landing
superheroes for life until our souls vanish
outro brak  zorak
check me out my name is brak and thats a fact
i got a mom and a dad and they are out back
we sit by the pool and we nibble on snacks
then we eat a big lunch and we all take naps
whyd the beat stop hey hey
i got a mask too so gimme the mic
cheh youre no doom
cmon danger mouse gimme that beat
turn the beat around love to hear percussion
you suck
turn it upside down love to hear it
i know talent and you aint got it
i wasnt done2embed"
