i cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them
and then it was clear
i cant deny i really miss it
to think that i was wrong
i guess you dont know what you got til its gone
pain is just a consequence of love
im saying sorry for the sake of us

chorus
he wasnt my everything til we were nothing
and its taking me a lot to say
but now that hes gone my heart is missing something
so its time i push my pride away
cause you are you are
you are my everything
you are you are
you are my everything

verse 2
i know youre not far but i still cant handle all the distance
youre traveling with my heart
i hope this is a temporary feeling
cause its too much to bear without you
and i know sorry aint the cure
if i cross your mind just know im yours
cause what we got is worth fighting for
cause you are

you are my everything
you are you are
