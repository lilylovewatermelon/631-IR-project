dressed up for a big date
like halloween day but it was fourth of july now
a car crash with a suitcase and a painted face
she was one of a kind
she wears a plastic crown like cinderella
and roller skates in bed
he rides the greyhound from his hometown
when he comes around cause they dont let him drive now
mixed up as a milkshake
but make no mistake
crash is looking like a star

chorus
you and me
were invincible together
we can be oh so tragical whatever
dressed up just like ziggy but he couldnt play guitar
captain crash and the beauty queen from mars

verse 2
share a toothpick trading lipstick
watching traffic for days at the diner
holding hands making big plans
playing superman he was wearing eyeliner
another local legend and his longtime lucky charm
you might also likechorus
you and me
were invincible together
we can be oh so tragical whatever
all dressed up like ziggy but he couldnt play guitar
captain crash and the beauty queen from mars

verse 3
theyre drunk on love as you can get
getting high on lust and cigarettes
living life with no regrets
at least theyre gonna try to fly

chorus
you and me
were invincible together
we can be oh so tragical whatever
were sid and nancy
fred and ginger
clyde and bonnie
liz and richard
kurt and courtney
bacall and bogie
jolting joe and ms monroe
heres captain crash and the beauty queen from mars
outro
captain crash and the beauty queen from marsembed"
