well how a chief keep havin problems with kansas city

the only reason yo simple ass blew up is cause of yo cali crip image
at one point i thought it was a battle rap gimmick
but then i realized that it isnt
yall youtube geechi gotti proposes if im lyin im flyin
this nigga hid behind his girl with the ring but he was in that bitch jail posing
my nigga you couldnt get on one knee
you even gangsta in a mans biggest moment
we get it you crip but you take that shit way too serious
like anwar when hes bowling

and yall got the nerve to let this bitch have gun bars
thats disrespectful
to all the shooters in the venue knowin if a crime was to happen niggas would have to hit you
and you know what got me pissed too
cause you the type of bitch that have to send muhfuckas out and make em think george floyd was a threat
yo job is half the reason he ended up with a knee on his neck
you dont get no respect
how do you feel good sendin out police to deescalate situations
knowin in the hood they shoot first and ask after the demonstration
smack this bitch is nypd

she part of the reason that shit happened to sean bell
you a fuckin sellout
i blame you for every time niggas in here have to bail out
i blame you for every time a muhfucka gotta hear a siren

i had to hide geechis body this niggas been dead for days
now his homies wanna slide for him cause they kinda scared of my ways
im low key thinkin about instagraming his face
cause they dont know if they should fuck with me
but when i post nut clarity gon be made

when you battled my sis all i heard was jaz jaz jaz get off my dick
you gotta rectify it
nigga you said my name so much with case i thought you was testifying
yall see me on stage doin dope what else i gotta do to prove im not a cop
gotti 30 damn yall cant boost a nigga yall act like i aint got a shot
nigga you hype you got an extra 50 from drake that nigga got a lot of money
but these guns is not a prop
somebody tell aubrey 50 from this drac will get champaign papis bottle popped
geechi you know what scuffs my timbs
you run efb right

they out the loop you not ashamed
jc battle tomorrow why you aint get him on the card with you
its cause you selfish and you lame
he need class you steve nash you horrible handling a team nigga you better in the game
but why when people say you predictable you get mad
nigga you cant take the truth
dont be mad at us the blame is you
niggas ran my cherry down to the ground but you still talk about it cause you the type to go for low hangin fruit
geechi you know what scuffs my timbs
ya teeth

nothing about that is alright
you be rockin gucci dior i like high fashion too but why the fuck  ya teeth off white
you got baby fangs and cavities you okay with how you walk round
then got the nerve to tell people how to live how dare you even talk down
you be braggin like im three time champion nigga you worried bout the wrong crown
and you be childhood shaming
he be like whatchu know bout bein 8 years old slidin on the ops just for shootin ya man
nigga nothin
i was a normal kid that enjoyed peelin glue off my hand
and you aint even got no ops
you got shot by accident in the ass
so that gangsta shit you preach is blasphemy
he the crip swindler
he be lyin talkin bout my enemies are after me
aint nobody after you marcus
yall peep how i brought up bad boys earlier
shit get crazy shit is ill
in the movie martins name was marcus and he got shot in the ass
oh you think you a bad boy for real
but you know what i peep bout you gotti
you threatened to beat up math snake eyez even loaded lux and ive been keepin a tally
but you only this bully when you got your homies behind you and you battle in cali
cause in virginia you hid behind that tree you wasnt even half a bit rowdy
in tampa ored called you a crab you didnt even give him hands in the alley
i thought you was gon drag him across the street
leave him bleeding til the clown dead
nigga i was there
we partied through that whole city but you was supposed to paint the town red
basically you dont bully shit when you all alone
yall dont see what this crip pull
he uses his homies as a crutch he aint a stand up nigga on his own
but shoutout to the west
yall on top and im a hater so i dont like that
south midwest east coast we gotta fight back
so fuck dre vishiss fuck danny fuck nitty ill up the sig
aint lil slap efb too i love the kids
but he cant say every fuckin bar hes just a kid
so i brought the fn effin for him fuck them kids
and real name brandon ill lace his weed
now he actin different aint no claim to fame no more
yall remember niggas used to sing out in the rain
rnb rb aint the same no more
after this whoever want smoke they cant challenge ya
cause im at every fuckin bar like frank gallagher
but you went to jail for a week right
stealin out of walgreens
i know times get hard and all
but i dont care how hard times get for me gotti im never stealin tylenol
they used to beat yo ass in jail and when you did do anything you aint rep yo set
you are not tough you treated jail like jenga
cause when you pulled somethin you was scared to pull your block up
i swear the shit is so sad you soft with yo hoe ass
i get why he hid behind a tree
why
he traumatized he cant control that
he went to jail for stealin drugs and seen somebody stealin drugz
and he caught ptsd like i dont wanna go back
when its real you can tell you can see it in they eyes
ima tell yall where he got that slogan from cause he been livin a lie
my nigga time
round 2 geechi gotti
i heard a couple niggas sayin facts when she was sayin that shit
we whoopin yall ass after this
facts
aye but look she bring up the tree shit
but see when coffee wanted to whoop yall bitches ass for sayin stupid shit
and i made sure it didnt happen at that moment i was a super crip
im sayin she talkin crazy like we dont ride
the tree i get it cause them bitches was scared to branch off away from me and wouldnt wood not leave my side
whoever did your hair for this battle didnt care for you
its 430 you couldve hit me fo 30 inch bundles this shit terrible
when you came out i was kinda scared of you
cause i know a bitch with a wig like that aint no tellin what she prepared to do
she talkin bout gotti i just came to rap and thats it
shut the fuck up you saga lookin ass bitch
all that touchin and bumpin last round bad fo yo health
instead of lookin like saga you need to act like saga and keep yo hands to yoself
you know how bad that i felt when i found out you was a dispatcher
i was fuckin hot
literally my heart fuckin dropped
i had dreams of you runnin and duckin shots
had sheets on top of ya dead body
finally see you upgrade from a dispatcher to an undercover cop
speakin of undercover lets talk about this undercover hate that you got fo yo team
and how all this bardashian love aint really all that it seems
see cause after official smoked you you became an o hater
you only teamed up with her to soak up some of o flavor
you got mad that she really was the goat you dont like being number two
so you created the bardashians knowin she was too fat to be kim so she gotta be under you
and casey a sucka too
cause she know you aint really her homie
theres plenty of interviews where you were sayin she dont deserve to be woty
you fake and you phony
every battle we see you on stage cheering and spazzin
but you couldnt make it to support her in none of them tournament matches
tell me whats crackin
she do somethin you ashamed of
its like ever since they started callin her the face you changed up
multiple interviews they askin you who to give a shot to you aint say her name once
all you do is play dumb
dont tell me that i dont battle my friends shit
cause her and official battled and they put on a classic
see you need yo ass whipped
you dont like to see yo sister shine
didnt they just have a big ass battle on remy ma card in new york aint that the city that you reside
aint this bitch from brooklyn
aint that where the fuck you stay
you decided to take a vacation on the bardashians biggest day
them vacation hours you get from yo job you couldnt pick a different date
them foreigners who be flyin you out to fuck them niggas couldnt wait
look at these bitches face
ima tell em that shit is not cool aint nothin straight
ima tell yall why she dont like bein on stage when they rap
cause even that jaz face cant hide the fuckin hate
bitch you dont never wanna congratulate
you told casey to break a leg and looknothin left to say
now shes sellin phones with pictures on the back of the case
ima tell yall how thats really gay and expose the hate
she got tired of hearin case was the face
fuck around and put her face on a case
you a fuckin disgrace
i dont care if its the bar she spit or when she post a pic stop gassin it
battle rap from looks to her bars she below average
imagine if she actually did battle all of the killers
yall wouldve think she did that
but official smoked her she still aint get no get back
yall say she top five and how she so in but i dont get that
when theres still battles she hasnt did yet myverse and fit and couture you wouldve think she did that
i mean listen theres a couple of new girls that claim she lacin em but its all a front like a wig cap
see theres a couple of battles thats still hangin over her head she need closure from and thats big facts
bitch you still aint had a decent wig yet
and gotti got bundles
this bitch couldve banged my line
if my prices was too high you couldve come over to suck my dick prolly wouldve changed my mind
just dont waste my time
cause i know you fuck for bars thats how you got into that shit with qp wasnt it
he claimed it was just head but we know he said that to say that image you love coverin
truth is you had qp all in that pussy like you was smugglin
im done with it
her whole image is bein so innocent but tell yall the truth watson is the only one we knew about
you mightve gave him stupid clout but theres a list of top tiers who you be chewin out
oh she aint want yall yeah exactly cause these fans think you some kind of trophy
but niggas like me know deep down you got mo bodies than yoshi
oh she aint want yall to know she be suckin surf dick just be callin him bro
yall sayin aw cause yall actually thought it befo
youse a true thot
we aint gotta talk about the battle rap bodies that you got
but we all know youve have the wave in ya mouth like the food hot
fool stop
can yall tell this fool to stop lyin bout her body count
news flash if you fucked a nigga even if they dont know about it bitch the body count
i highly doubt i could even lose to jaz when i get paid more
even if i dont get my second half all the merch sold out so i already made more
im talkin bout the efb gone i done did a live podcast meet and greets club appearances and thats really what i came for
see you a lame whore remember you told me 5k was the most you ever get
i told you i spent that on a light day
you wanna be like bay
cause no matter how much they convinced you this major bitch
behind closed doors you barely even makin rent to pay yo rent
in battle rap she like gotti im always the main event but i leave the venue and i aint content
cause i rap my heart out but smack and them barely gave me shit
but they paid you didnt they
so you should be sayin thank you bitch
all them different niggas you done fucked
and they just had you leavin lookin dumb
all them different niggas you done fucked
but im the only nut you actually benefit from
i told you how to market yoself and yo brand so you can get the type of money you make and equate that
i told you not to take no bullshit money from a league you dont want dont take that
yeah bitch you stupid as shit
i even told you how much to charge url for this battle you owe me 20
make her rap
cause when its real you can
you can see it in they eyes
go head make niggas believe them lies
time

round 3 jaz the rapper
when people say you lost a battle you cry on twitter to convince us that you didnt
dont even think about tryin it
see ive been chillin
but if i see somethin i dont like im firin
cause they gon say i won you might try to sway the polls im eyeing it
so if you decide to tamper tampa bay this tom comin out of retirement
ill pop some shit
ill drop some shit
im tryin to overkill so i dont care if im over bay hell get the tecs text for no reason im a toxic bitch
and jr ill catch you at the show and get to shootin like a movie role

nostudion thats ya brand
you makin bread off of shit i already live
nigga i was 13 recordin in the basement ive been no studioing since a kid
every day you go on that podcast and rant about shit you dont like shit is all bad
but they let you get away with bitchin like a girl cause you call that shit a podcast
you got these niggas brainwashed just cause you do that lyrical tough shit
i mean we know you went to college but why we aint know the compton crip go for criminal justice
i mean smack who did a background check on this man
i swear you really be pickin em
i know you aint graduate but if you call me a snitch you was just a snitch in trainin
you my twin and em
im bout to shake shit now that wasnt my major but i went to school for the same shit
you learn about verdicts felons misdemeanors i know the biz
yall wanna know my verdict i think he done fell in some shit
cause yall think mister meaner misdemeanor than he is
i do due process that you a crip but that dont make you exempt still
them gangsta claims caught up with you but i wont judge you the best still
nigga ill rob you for your jewelry then move on to the next drill
thats kill some cs and assist cease  desist casey and o for they next kills
when you battle my sisyou did amazin
i aint come here to hate
i came to dance with a great
but now we know where the fuck you learn how to handle a case
when its real you can tell you can see it in they eyes
whole time i thought you learned that from these gangsta goons
but when its real you can tell you can see it in they eyes nigga those is techniques we learned from the interrogation rooms
you a fraud and everything you rep screams that
i cant believe i didnt doubt you
geech is a language from the south
gotti is a nigga from ny ya whole alias is a clout move

actin like she broke ya heart
i aint seen a nigga mad at nunu like that since atl
and you and coffee had words on twitter
why you always arguin with women online you got flaws that ima
check
serena won 23 grand slam titles thats the only compton bitch i wanna see go back and forth across the net
and you told o you would slap her if she was a man
that threat was pretty weird
cause all she did was mention the tree
see that shit hurts you and its clear
when that video dropped i thought youd get canceled you lucky you even here
i know you dont play overseas but ask oj mayo fuckin with them trees couldve ended ya career
smack this ya face
as soon as i got that call i said its lit for him
after this they gon say a brooklyn bitch fucked up the face more than lil kim
now im bout to tell yall somethin
and i hope after this i hope im forgiven and you still love me
see i aint never fucked a crip before
but one night i was lit in la and i was just tryin to get some cutty
this when i knew that crip shit was in him
he said i gotta throw up cs while he fuck me
so im ridin and asked if you liked it the nigga said on nutty
i just knew you bout to cum as far as strokes you got like two more
but then he stopped right before he nutted then he left this niggas so crip he wouldnt blew blue balls
but what happened with you and miss get comfortable
yall was mr and mrs west coast
yall made cali look good
nigga you sad and you a joke
the timing was perfect yall could brag and yall could boast
it makes my skin burn nervous intern you dropped coffee when it mattered the most
that was yo sis
if casey or o aint want somebody at they shit id have made them bitches leave
she just aint want  and her friends at the battle you should accommodate her needs
but i get it he thought if he kicked em out that somebody would call the cops up
but remember hes traumatized and the last time he took rx out a buildin his dumb ass got locked up
and when its real you can tell you can see it in the eyes
go head make niggas believe them lies

round 3 geechi gotti
she said geechi went to school for criminal justice that shit was so basic
the whole hood up here i aint doin no fakin or hoe claimin
they know i just had got out at 16 that shit is documented for an attempted murder
ill take whatever class the judge told me to get out of jail and probation
bitch youse a clown and yall all garys
the first place i went to when i got locked up was the law library
they dont understand that though
but shes a witness
they dont understand that if you know more about the law then you can actually beat the system
and i didnt even understand that shit either
ah well i went to school for like three months came back did a burglary and went right back to jail
my whole life fail
but now im back on stage
and i ended up seein this bitch in a black compass interview
and she was lookin kinda pretty too
i was actually thinkin bout puttin some dick in you
