you got the lights on in the afternoon
an the nights are drawn out long
and youre kissin to cut through the gloom
with a cough drop coloured tongue
and you were sittin in the corner with the coats all piled high
and i thought you might be mine
in a small world on an exceptionally rainy tuesday night
in the right place and time

chorus
when the zeros line up on the 24hour clock
when you know whos callin even though the number is blocked
when you walked around your house wearin my sky blue lacoste
and your knee socks

verse 2
well you cured my january blues
yeah you made it all alright
i got a feelin i might have lit the very fuse
that you were tryin not to light
you were a stranger in my phonebook i was actin like i knew
cause i had nothin to lose
when the winters in full swing and your dreams just arent comin true
aint it funny what youll do
you might also likechorus
when the zeros line up on the 24hour clock
when you know whos callin even though the number is blocked
when you walked around your house wearin my sky blue lacoste
and your knee socks

postchorus
the late afternoon the ghost in your room
that you always thought didnt approve of you knockin boots
never stopped you lettin me get hold of the sweet spot
by the scruff of your knee socks

you and me could have been a team
each had a half of a king and queen seat
like the beginning of mean streets
you could be my baby could be my baby
you and me could have been a team
each had a half of a king and queen suite
like the beginning of mean streets
you could be my baby could be my baby
all the zeros lined up
you and me could have been a team
each had a half of a king and queen suite
like the beginning of mean streets
you could be my baby could be my baby
but the numbers blocked
you and me could have been a team
each had a half of a king and queen suite
when youve come undone
like the beginning of mean streets
you could be my baby could be my baby
chorus
when the zeros line up on the 24hour clock
when you know whos callin even though the number is blocked
when you walked around your house wearin my sky blue lacoste
and your knee socks
when the zeros line up on the 24hour clock
when you know whos callin even though the number is blocked
when you walked around your house wearin my sky blue lacoste
and your knee socks
