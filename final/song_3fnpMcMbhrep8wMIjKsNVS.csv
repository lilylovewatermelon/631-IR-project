love is like the sea
leaves you on your knees
then it pull you in
then it takes ya takes ya over over
love is like the sea
leaves you on your knees
first youre floating high
then it takes ya takes ya
under under

verse 1
well its cold
cold under water
in the nighttime
but i dove
dove to the bottom
to see what id find

prechorus 1
thats when i saw a light
a glowing paradise
thought id stay a while
its been callin me underwater child
everything that i ever dreamed
taking my breath away ay
currents got hold of me
sweeping me away
wish that i could stay
takes me to the top
its a cycle that never stops
