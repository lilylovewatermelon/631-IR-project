stranger than your sympathy
and this is my apology
i killed myself from the inside out
and all my fears have pushed you out
and i wished for things that i dont need
all i wanted
and what i chased wont set me free
all i wanted
and i get scared but im not crawling on my knees
oh yeah
everythings all wrong yeah
everythings all wrong yeah
where the hell did i think i was

chorus 1
and stranger than your sympathy
take these things so i dont feel
im killing myself from the inside out
and now my heads been filled with doubt

verse 2
were taught to lead the life you choose
all i wanted
when all your lucks run out on you
all i wanted
and you cant see when all your dreams are coming true
oh yeah
its easy to forget yeah
when you choke on the regrets yeah
who the hell did i think i was

and stranger than your sympathy
and all these thoughts you stole from me
and im not sure where i belong
and nowheres home and im all wrong

bridge
and i was in love with things i tried to make believe i was
and i wouldnt be the one to kneel before the dreams i wanted
and all the talk and all the lies were all the empty things disguised as me

outro

stranger than your sympathy
stranger than your sympathy
mmm hmmm mmmembed"
