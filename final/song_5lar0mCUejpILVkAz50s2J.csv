i remember i had walked home that day content with all my misery
told myself itd get better no clue what there was next for me
remember there was people walkin talkin in the distance
i was dressed for winter weather but the summer rays were kissin me
i i was lost

verse 1
so i took a different path in the distance he awaited me
had no weapon im guessin his hands were just enough for me
was no question im guessin he laughed just at the sight of me
i was lost

chorus
i remember i had walked home that day content with all my misery
told myself itd get better no clue what there was next for me
remember there was people walkin talkin in the distance
i was dressed for winter weather but the summer rays were kissin me
i i was lost

verse 2
and there he was his presence was alarming
as he approached was casual we talked bout selfharmin
he told me kid you shouldnt be walkin on your own
he smiled and laughed and pat my back
he asked how far are you from home
i said maybe thirty minutes
his frequency distorted quick i seen it in his image
i shouldve run right fuckin there a—

verse 3
you ever woke up on a train track with no motherfuckin clothes on
death before your eyes you prayin to god but aint no response
tryna scream for hope just a shoulder that you can lean on
but aint nobody comin so you scream on and scream on and scream on
while this evil fuck laugh at you
train gettin closer you still surprised that he battered you
tears fallin harder and harder minutes get minuscule
coulda had a son or a daughter now what you finna do
you finna die here on this train track
cause clearly after death aint no way you can find your way back
thinkin bout your previous memories goin way back
all them fuckin dreams bout a diamond chain and a maybach
now your time finally up
ask yourself this final question is you goin down or up
recollectin all the moments that you never gave a fuck
now its here death has now arrived times finally up137embed"
