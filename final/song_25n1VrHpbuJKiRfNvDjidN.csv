to feel a new touch to smell a new scent
to learn a new love the kiss of new lips
to build a new trust you know thats hard to find with people now a days
id say that im so glad to find a new valentine

chorus
to start all this all over
without no vision or way of how its suppose to be
see back then i was real young but now im much older
so i wont make no mistakes
back then i just couldnt see
im thinking that we need a harmony
uh huh uh huh
so this is the perfect harmony
uh huh uh huh
for this melody

to see a new face to hold a new hand
to live a new life to be a new man
to win a new heart you know that cupids arrows not right all the time
but your smile is like the sun that rise
so girl i wont mind

chorus
to start all this all over
without no vision or way of how love suppose to be
see back then i was real young but now im much older
and i wont make no mistakes
back then i just couldnt see
im thinking that we need a harmony
uh huh uh huh
seem like its the perfect harmony
uh huh uh huh
for this melody
you might also likeill gently take your hand
and try this love thing once again
but gotta take our time and share each moment day and night
or else it just slips away
oh slips away
so are you willing

chorus
to start all this all over

to feel a new touch to smell a new scent
to learn a new love the kiss of new lipsembed"
