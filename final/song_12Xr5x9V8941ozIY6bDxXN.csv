father forgive me for i have sinned
you know we all fall short in the glory of god ya know
but uh true life is just so hard you know
espically when you tryin to find a way out
all i need is a sign
lord just give me a sign
can you just just show me a sign lord

verse 1
dig it i dug it some hate it some love it
politic in the game im just a puppet for the public
if i spit it you can quote it
if you read it then i wrote it
knew its dirty in this bitch yall let me in it so i sold it
niggas pussy why
cuz they givin they clothes up
sayin that they pimpin but really givin they hoes up
am i sick exactly from takin care of the family
carry a scar on my nose that came from my granny
a major player in this game knew it since day one
lookin for shit to be the same nigga keep waitin
i done done all i can do for the streets
humble now im waitin to see what the streets do for me
got a child so im like payin support
still a child now who the hell payin support
i can slang and bang on st louis streets
better yet keep it grimey till im 6 feet deep come on

verse 2
feelin strange cuz deaths upon me
damn i should of knew man was not gone warn me
still rappin while watchin my papers stackin
tryin to leave coke alone but the streets callin me back in
and i aint actin watchin homie subtracting
check the murder rate i aint lyin thats a fact and
im from a city where they want they corners back
body bag toe tag if you dont know how to act
picture that niggas straight scrambling for crack
baby mamas keep up drama but i love where im at
if you aint never been to the lou this here lyrical too
and if you thinkin bout comin then you best be true come on
hook

we nobody until somebody kills you
gettin high till the morning light
we gettin high till the morning light
2x
