drivin through the night tryna keep my eyes open
generators busted and the acs broken
talkin to the lord hope he helps us get there safe
and we made it to the show now were singin to the crowd
and play an encore and theyre screamin real loud
try to get home early but i know that aint the case

chorus
yeah its another hotel room sleepin on the floor
im hurtin in the mornin from the night before
paid my duеs im leadin up the road
im comin home baby lеave the porch light on

verse 2
breakfast in the morning from seven to nine
but we just cant seem to wake up in time
grab a cup of coffee and were off to hit the road
now were runnin on fumes no time to kill
we got one more show and its a shitty door deal
breakin my back just to make a couple bones

chorus
yeah its another hotel room sleepin on the floor
im hurtin in the mornin from the night before
paid my dues im leadin up the road
im comin home baby leave the porch light on
