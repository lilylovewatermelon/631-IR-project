it must be nice it must be nice to have
washington on your side
it must be nice it must be nice to have
washington on your side

jefferson
ev’ry action has its equal opposite reactions
thanks to hamilton our cab’net’s fractured into factions
try not to crack under the stress we’re breaking down like fractions
we smack each other in the press and we don’t print retractions
i get no satisfaction witnessing his fits of passion
the way he primps and preens and dresses like the pits of fashion
our poorest citizens our farmers live ration to ration
as wall street robs ‘em blind in search of chips to cash in
this prick is askin’ for someone to bring him to task
somebody gimme some dirt on this vacuous mass so we can at last unmask him
i’ll pull the trigger on him someone load the gun and cock it
while we were all watching he got washington in his pocket
jefferson and burr
it must be nice it must be nice to have
washington on your side
it must be nice it must be nice to have
washington on your side
you might also likelook back at the bill of rights

madison
which i wrote

jeffersonmadisonburr
the ink hasn’t dried
it must be nice it must be nice to have
washington on your side

madison
so he’s doubled the size of the government
wasn’t the trouble with much of our previous government size

burr
look in his eyes

jefferson
see how he lies
madison
follow the scent of his enterprise

jefferson
centralizing national credit
and making american credit competitive
madison
if we don’t stop it we aid and abet it

jefferson
i have to resign

madison
somebody has to stand up for the south

burr
somebody has to stand up to his mouth

jefferson
if there’s a fire you’re trying to douse

madison and jefferson
you can’t put it out from inside the house

jefferson
i’m in the cabinet i am complicit in
watching him grabbin’ at power and kiss it
if washington isn’t gon’ listen
to disciplined dissidents this is the difference
this kid is out

madisonburrjefferson
oh
this immigrant isn’t somebody we chose
oh
this immigrant’s keeping us all on our toes
oh
let’s show these federalists who they’re up against

because every second the treasury grows

ensemble

if we follow the money and see where it leads
get in the weeds look for the seeds of
hamilton’s misdeeds

it must be nice it must be nice

madison
follow the money and see where it goes
