i only got you in my stories
and you know i tell them right
i remember you and i when im awake at night
so give it up for fallen glory
i never got to say goodbye
i wish i could ask for just a bit more time

prechorus
every step i take you used to lead the way
now im terrified to face it on my own

chorus
youre not there
to celebrate the man that you made
youre not there
to share in my success and mistakes
isnt fair
youll never know the person ill be
youre not there
with me

verse 2
though i know that youre not there
i still write you all these songs
its like you got the right to know whats going on
as i struggle to remember how you used to look and sound
at times i still think i can spot you in the crowd

every step i take you used to lead the way
now im terrified to face it on my own

chorus
youre not there
to celebrate the man that you made
youre not there
to share in my success and mistakes
isnt fair
youll never know the person ill be
youre not there
with me

bridge
time can heal your wounds if
youre strong and standing tall
ive been doing all of that it didnt help at all
they say youll grow older and itll get better still
yes i will but no it wont
they dont get it cause

chorus
youre not there
to celebrate the man that you made
youre not there
to share in my success and mistakes
isnt fair
youll never know the person ill be
youre not there
with me12embed"
