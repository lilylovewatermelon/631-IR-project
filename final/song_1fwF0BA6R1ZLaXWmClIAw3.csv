now i face out i hold out
i reach out to the truth of my life seeking to seize
on the whole moment yeah

verse
yeah naked truth lies only if you realize
appearing in nobodys lives til they sterilize
stop the guerilla warfare to keep it fair
bro change your rage to a smarter greater cause
you know the stake is high stardom is near
those you sympathized with died killers pass you by
do not waste your time in hating flirting guys
use your mind to ais bring justice to them all

chorus
now i face out i hold out
i reach out to the truth of my life seeking to seize
on the whole moment to now break away
oh god let me out can you let me out
can you set me free from this dark inner world
save me now last beat in the soul
