oh we gon have a party
all my friends will be there
we drink all the vodka
theres music everywhere
now wait a minute wait a minute
do you like to party
cause if you dont oooohhwah
dont come over here
we got smoking blue dream
drinking cocaine fucking
i wanna show you what it is ohh

verse
thought i was done but that wasnt the case
got a new stack that i threw in your face
got a new girl and she look mila kunis
infinity pool and a statue thats buddhist
got bottles and bottles and bottles of grino
saw i was rich now they fucking with bino
brown leather bag the vacation messina
the boat in the harbor i rule the marina
10k for the drinks now they say im insane
its been that for a minute now hedi slimane
i been black lucrative since danity kane
who came back for a minute now everything changed
high as a kite lime in the light
yall niggas might whine every night
i aint invite all these people to my motherfuckin house
get the fuck out of my house
