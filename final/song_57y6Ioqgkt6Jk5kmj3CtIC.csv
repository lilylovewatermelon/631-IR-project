jenna
my hands pluck the things i know that ill need
i take the sugar and butter from the pantry
i add the flour to begin what i am hoping to start
and then its down with the recipe
and bake from the heart

sugar
and butter
and flour
and mother

whats inside
everyone wants to know whats inside
and i always tell them
but i feel more than words can say
you wanna know whats inside
simple question so then whats the answer
my whole life is in here
in this kitchen baking
what a mess im makingyou might also like2embed"
