shes as pretty as model on tv
you got to see her to believe me
that little lollipop will really make your jaw drop
you get to staring you cant stop

chorus
sweet as a honey bee hive
she got my attention from the get go
she goes walking on by
shes looking so fine
shes a little piece of eye candy

verse 2
when the good lord made that little looker
he must of used a whole lot of sugar
maybe thats the reason why i crave her
so much flavor all the time

chorus

verse 3
she gets me higher than anything can
she melts my heart when shes holding my hand
let me tell you something about her kisses
they aint nutritious but theyre delicious
if your looking for a woman thats a goddess or the hottest
shes it
