its 2 am in your car
windows down you pass my street the memories start
you say its in the past you drive straight ahead
youre thinkin that i hate you now
cause you still dont know what i never said

chorus
i wish you would come back
wish i never hung up the phone like i did i
wish you knew that
id never forget you as long as i live and i
wish you were right here right now its all good
i wish you would

verse 2
its 2 am in my room
headlights pass the window pane i think of you
were a crooked love in a straight line down
makes you want to run and hide
but it makes you turn right back around

chorus
i wish you would come back
wish i never hung up the phone like i did i
wish you knew that
id never forget you as long as i live and i
wish you were right here right now its all good
i wish you would
i wish we could go back
and remember what we were fighting for and i
wish you knew that
i miss you too much to be mad anymore and i
wish you were right here right now its all good
i wish you would
