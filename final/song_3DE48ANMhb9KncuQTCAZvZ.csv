verse 1
had me convinced that i just wasnt enough
me and you fussin and fightin cussin all of that stuff
now i know that i mightve done you wrong
didnt know id pay so long til you did the same
i know id done you wrong i was makin it up to you
i apologized in a million ways
but i thought that was that
but i guess you got me back
didnt know itd be like that but you did the same

pre chorus
now were caught in a circle a constant battle
the day that you hurt me
the clouds cast a shadow on us
and i hope that youre happy were even now
so cry baby cry

chorus

i need to see you cry cry cry
until your tears run dry dry dry
like the deserts need the rain
want ya tears to fall down on me

i need to see you cry cry cry
until your tears run dry dry dry
like the deserts need the rain
want ya tears to fall down on me

and just before you walk away

verse 2
what is this what happens to relationships
started off so good and ended up so bad

before we knew it we were at it again no no no
somehow i dont think we can ever be friends
wish it wasnt so ooh wish it wasnt so but you did the same
