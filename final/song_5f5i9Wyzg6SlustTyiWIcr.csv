damn ryder

chorus
uh stay in my lane play the game how the game go
stayed the same these niggas changed i dont change though
we in the booth back to back let that pain go
we in them coupes back to back black durangos
slide down this block let them things go
they get to drummin aint no running from a draco
fuck a hater we get paper thats a case closed
play the game how the game go

verse
i play the game that was taught to me
i fry the beef that was brought to me
these niggas hating throwing salt on me
my mouth be blinging we cant talk for free no he dont talk for cheap
dont know who to trust dont know who i could believe in
dont know who to trust every night he fighting demons
i never gave a fuck i got me so i dont need them
never gave it up i kept strivin and reachin
now my mama happy new watch is a patek pistol in his jacket
still bout action reach i let you have it put that on my granny grrah
remember when i told em i was him they all was laughing
and now done millions and got brand new whips and brand new mansions
now i walk round this bitch my neck and wrist be full of carats
i just was homeless sleeping on my cousin blowup mattress
that shit was tragic it be tragic how these fuck niggas be hatin and shit
but i was made for this shit yeah
