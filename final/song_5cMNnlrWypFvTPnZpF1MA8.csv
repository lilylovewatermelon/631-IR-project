i ain’t in no debt i got a real good woman
and a pretty good dog that don’t shit in the house
i’m in a traveling band with some pretty good pickers
and only one of em snores the rest are quite as a mouse

refrain
well packed into this van like sardines inside a can
that’s the only life that i wanna lead
well i love home but the roads got all i need yessir

verse 2
we ain’t got no hits but we sell a few tickets
and it seems like a lot to a guy like me
that ain’t never had nothing but a dream and a guitar
and this road dog itch that wont quit bothering me

refrain
oh packed into this van like sardines inside a can
that’s the only life that i wanna lead
well i love home but the roads got all i need

packed into this van like sardines inside a can
