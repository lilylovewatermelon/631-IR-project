and this is how it starts
take your shoes off in the back of my van
yeah my shirt looks so good
when its just hanging off your back
and she said use your hands and my spare time
we got one thing in common its this tongue of mine
she said oh
shes got a boyfriend anyway

verse 2
theres only minutes before i drop you off
all we seem to do is talk about sex
shes got a boyfriend anyway
shes got a boyfriend anyway
i loved your friend when i saw his film
hes got a funny face but i like that cause he still looks cool
shes got a boyfriend anyway
shes got a boyfriend anyway

bridge
now were on the bed in my room
and im about to fill his shoes
but you say no you say no
does he take care of you
or could i easily fill his shoes
but you say no you say no
see the 1975 liveget tickets as low as 9you might also likeverse 3
now were just outside of town
and youre making your way down
shes got a boyfriend anyway
shes got a boyfriend anyway
and im not trying to stop you love
if were gonna do anything we might as well just fuck
shes got a boyfriend anyway
shes got a boyfriend anyway

outro
got your tongue pierced anyway
you in your hightops any day
you in your skinny jeans anyway
you and your fit friends anyway
id take them all out any day
they all got backcombs anyway
they all got boyfriends anyway141embed"
