my aunt used to live in paris i remember she used to come home and tell us these stories about being abroad and i remember she told us that she jumped into the river once barefootâ€‹ she smiled

sung
leapt without looking
and tumbled into the seine
the water was freezing
she spent a month sneezing
but said she would do it again

heres to the ones who dream
foolish as they may seem
heres to the hearts that ache
heres to the mess we make
she captured a feeling
sky with no ceiling
the sunset inside a frame
she lived in her liquor
and died with a flicker
ill always remember the flame

heres to the ones who dream
foolish as they may seem
heres to the hearts that ache
heres to the mess we make
you might also likeshe told me
a bit of madness is key
to give us new colors to see
who knows where it will lead us
and thats why they need us
so bring on the rebels
the ripples from pebbles
the painters and poets and plays
and heres to the fools who dream
crazy as they may seem
heres to the hearts that break
heres to the mess we make
i trace it all back to then
her and the snow and the seine
smiling through it
she said shed do it again14embed"
