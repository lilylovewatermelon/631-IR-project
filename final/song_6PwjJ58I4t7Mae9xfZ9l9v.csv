seventeen tracks and ive had it with this game
im breakin my back just to know your name
but heaven aint close in a place like this
anything goes but dont blink you might miss

cause heaven aint close in a place like this
i said oh heaven aint close in a place like this
bring it back down bring it back down tonight oohooh
never thought id let a rumor ruin my moonlight

chorus
well somebody told me you had a boyfriend
who looked like a girlfriend that i had in february of last year
its not confidential ive got potential
