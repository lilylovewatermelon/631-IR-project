dancing to her favorite song
a little girl with nothing wrong
is all alone

eyes wide open
always hoping for the sun
and shell sing her song to anyone
that comes along

fragile as a leaf in autumn
just fallin to the ground
without a sound

crooked little smile on her face
tells a tale of grace
thats all her own

fragile as a leaf in autumn
just fallin to the ground
without a sound

spinning laughing
dancing to her favorite song
shes a little girl with nothing wrong
and shes all alone
a little girl with nothing wrong
and shes all alonesee norah jones liveget tickets as low as 26you might also like1embed"
