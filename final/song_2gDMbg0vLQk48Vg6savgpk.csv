to let you treat the people down there
just as coldly as you always treated me

anna  elsa
lifes too short

elsa
to listen to a reckless fool
who only ever sees the things she wants to see

anna elsa anna  elsa
you dont know
you have no idea
what ive been through
because of you
lifes too short to waste another minute
lifes too short to even have you in it
lifes too short
ive been so wrong about you
you youve been so wrong about everything
maybe you are the prophecy
i am not the prophecyembed"
