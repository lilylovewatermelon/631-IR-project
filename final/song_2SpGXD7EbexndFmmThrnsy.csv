circumventing circuses lamenting in protest
to visible police presencesponsored fear
battalions of riot police with rubber bullet kisses
baton courtesy service with a smile

prechorus
beyond the staples center you can see america
with its tired poor avenging disgrace
peaceful loving youth against the brutality
of plastic existence

chorus
pushing little children with their fullyautomatics
they like to push the weak around
pushing little children with their fullyautomatics
they like to push the weak around

verse 2
a rush of words pleading to disperse
upon your naked walls alive
a political call the fall guy accord
we cant afford to be neutral on a moving train

prechorus
beyond the staples center you can see america
with its tired poor avenging disgrace
peaceful loving youth against the brutality
of plastic existence

pushing little children with their fullyautomatics
they like to push the weak around

they like to push the weak around

bridge
push them around
a deer dance invitation to peace
war staring you in the face
dressed in black
with a helmet fierce
trained and appropriate for the malcontents
for the disproportioned malcontents
a little boy smiled itll all be well
and say a little boy smiled itll all be well
pushing little children with their fullyautomatics
they like to push the weak around

chorus
pushing little children with their fullyautomatics
they like to push the weak around
pushing little children with their fullyautomatics
they like to push the weak around

outro
push the weak around
push the weak around
push the weak around
they like to push the weak around23embed"
