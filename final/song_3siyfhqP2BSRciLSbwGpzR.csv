two million miles a minute babe huh
headed for certain destruction
jot down your dying wishes hey
all of your dying wishes

verse 1
breathe
baby dont defy our needs
simple things make a difference in your day
take the time to tell me why what is it anyway
my apologies im so sorry
i just got back from the gastroenterologist
he told me that i cant drink so now i be high and shit
and all insensitive
and then when you cry i get fuckin anxiety
breathe darlin dont defy our needs
simple things make a difference in your day
take the time to tell me how it ended up this way

chorus
two million miles a minute babe huh
headed for certain destruction
jot down your dying wishes hey
all of your dying wishes

your love is cheap
babe it dont cost anything
if you stay is it mine to give away
just who is it that decides
what happens when you cant keep doin it
it makes you wonder if i was careful
would it be something worth repair or
or am i just scared for ya4embed"
