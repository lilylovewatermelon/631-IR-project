i tell you what were gonna do
what you need to know
what youve gotta get to get where you wanna go
never ever miss an aisle
keep your eye on all displays
when you find your style every days a holiday

ill show you how to work it
to find the fit thats perfect
you know that you deserve it

this is the good life
dining with your friends at the fancy restaurants
living the good life we have such a good time i know

verse 2
grab a little gucci bag and some prada shoes
