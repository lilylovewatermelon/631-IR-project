well its not that easy babe
just to walk into my mind
because the door stays locked stays locked
well most of the time
well its not an easy game
trying to keep myself in line
cause temptations always knocking always knocking
well down the stop sign

chorus
is it safe to assume its my fault
what a joke
so please let me be on my own
overgrown

verse 2
getting too old to feel
things for the first time
but the clock keeps spinning keeps spinning
while i die
i cant control the beast
never wants to comply
because it knows that youre turning that youre turning
a blind eye

is it safe to assume its my fault
what a joke
so please let me be on my own
overgrown
is it safe to assume its my fault
what a joke
so please let me be on my own
overgrown
