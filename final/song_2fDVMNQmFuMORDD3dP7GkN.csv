wish i were with you but i couldnt stay
every direction leads me away
pray for tomorrow but for today

hook
all i want is to be home

verse 2
stand in the mirror you look the same
just lookin for shelter from cold and the pain
someone to cover safe from the rain

hook
and all i want is to be home

verse 3
echoes and silence patience and grace
all of these moments ill never replace
no fear of my heart absence of faith

hook
and all i want is to be home
oohoohooh
