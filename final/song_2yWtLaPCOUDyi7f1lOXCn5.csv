if your dream house
is a doublewide trailer sitting back in the holler
on a country road
then baby thats where well go
if you dont wanna settle down
we can bounce around from town to town
and thats fine with me
if you wanna just ride the breeze

chorus
ill go anywhere
west virginia baby i dont care
mexico on a wild hair
have you ever seen california
pick a spot on any old map
i travel light and my bags are packed
just as long as im where youre at
im gonna have a real good view
ill go anywhere anywhere with you

verse 2
ill bet theres a two lane
running right through the middle
of a wide open desert to a ghost town
if you wanna just hide out
we could send a postcard back
from a mountain top out in idaho
maybe get snowed in
anytime baby you say when
