something i just might regret
something you will not forget
maybe i should throw away
everything ive learned today

all over me all over me
all over me all over me

pushing forward from the truth
maybe its me and maybe its you
sometimes i dont know myself
twentyeight years straight to hell

chorus
all over me all over me
all over me all over me
all over me all over me
all over me all over me
