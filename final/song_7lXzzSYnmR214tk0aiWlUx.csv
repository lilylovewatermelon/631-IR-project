go ahead and close the door
ill stand outside in the rain
a little bird just told me so
its time to start over again
so ill man up and take this boat
far away from these shores
and ill reach behind an enemy line
and find my curable cure

chorus
cause its a cruel and beautiful world
and i got my girl
and if it seems like were falling behind
or just slipping on top from the mouths of our mind

verse 2
i buried a treasure far off near the desert
im trying to find my way there
its been too long since ive been myself
and my eyes cant see anymore
but theres a song inside this heart of mine
and id like to sing it to you
cause theres an earthquake shaking inside my country
now what am i gonna do

cause its a cruel and beautiful world
and i got my girl
and if it seems like were falling behind
or just slipping on top from the mouths of our mind

and i got my girl hes got his girl
and if it seems like were falling behind seems like were falling behind
or just slipping on top from the mouths of our mindembed"
