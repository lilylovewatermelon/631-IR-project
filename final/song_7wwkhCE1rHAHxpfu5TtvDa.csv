hmm there she goes uh huh
she moving fast
like a train
somebody say babe

she ran out of patience
fed up with my lies uh huh
now she’s leaving with no luggage
and a broken heart to the train station
i want her to know
if she come back home i’ll be waiting

there my honey goes 
there she goes

verse 2
while i was sleeping
she slipped out the back door uh huh
didn’t even even bother
bother to leave a note uh huh
i want her to know
if she come back home i’ll be waiting now
