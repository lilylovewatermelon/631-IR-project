you said i was the most exotic flower
holdin me tight in our final hour
i dont know how you convince them and get them babe
i dont know what you do its unbelievable
and i dont know how you get over get over
someone as dangerous tainted and flawed as you

chorus
one for the money and two for the show
i love you honey im ready im ready to go
how did you get that way i dont know
youre screwed up and brilliant
look like a million dollar man
so why is my heart broke

verse 2
youve got the world but baby at what price
something so strange hard to define
it isnt that hard boy to like you or love you
id follow you down down down youre unbelievable
if youre goin crazy just grab me and take me
id follow you down down down anywhere anywhere

chorus
one for the money two for the show
i love you honey im ready im ready to go
how did you get that way i dont know
youre screwed up and brilliant
