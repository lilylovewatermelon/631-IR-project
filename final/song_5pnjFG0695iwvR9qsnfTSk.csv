stealin anything the eye could see
said gather round you people anything you need
ill keep my name on your lips
and put the word out on the street
and i will ride til my fingers they are down to the bone
wander til i cant remember my own home
drink til i dont know the meaning of alone
until that bullet flies to carry me home
til that bullet flies that bullet flies that bullet flies
that bullet flies that bullet flies to carry me home
til that bullet flies that bullet flies that bullet flies
that bullet flies that bullet flies to carry me home

well he never ever smiled
but he always seemed pleased
said ill never live down upon my bended knees
said i see the game and the game it sees me
and we will dance until they bury me

so i will rise like the ashes from a building as it burns
screamin all my enemies youll all have your turn
the more pain i feel the less that it hurts
the more i move on the more i am sure
that i will ride til my fingers they are down to the bone
wander til i cant remember my own home
drink til i dont know the meaning of alone
until that bullet flies to carry me home
til that bullet flies that bullet flies that bullet flies
that bullet flies that bullet flies to carry me home
til that bullet flies that bullet flies that bullet flies
that bullet flies that bullet flies to carry me homeyou might also likeembed"
