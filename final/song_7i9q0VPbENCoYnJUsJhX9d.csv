i have a confession that you will not believe
that you could not perceive this freak gonna set it off
i have a confession of a side that i hide
its a cloak or disguise unleashed gonna get it off

cause if i try to stray
it only holds me closer
no ill never get away
i love it anyway
ill never stop

that the black of my tie contains all your dirty thoughts
