wballs its your main man dj ez dick

and the word is on the streets and the word is the streets
we gon go to a live remote licking wit my main man mr doggy dogg

snoop dogg
a day in the life of a rollin 20 crip
im just a stubborn type of fella with a head like a brick
now just because i sip moet they say that im hopeless
but i dont give a fuck so blame it on the locness
now this is how we do it when we checking the grip
snoop dogg is in this bitch so dont even trip
i bust a funky composition thats as smooth as a prism
so check it while i kick off in this funkyass rhythm
its six dub the phone is ringing off the deck
and its some homies talking about i disrespected they set
aww nah dogg aint diss yall
i got a couple relatives up off of crenshaw
this is about me and simon not me and yall
i got love for a bunch of real bdogs
like kdub top cat breal erock boolay face
and the homie heron rest in peace
big jay from campanella park
he used to blaze with his nephew after dark
on and on rocking big neckbone
mausberg i had to put you on my song
its so real i had to show some love
now back to this scrub it aint about crip or blood
its about you bein jealous of what i does
cause i does it the most the king of the coast
in the paint playin post  i back you down
like shaqdaddy and bust on ya out the new caddy
and skirt up wilshire boulevard
im not xzibit you cant pull my ho card
i fucked all your groupies
when you was doing time in camp snoopy
with the fags and snitches no killers just bitches
and you was payin niggas off with all my riches
you so hardco why you aint go to level fo
oh i know bitch
but i walk the mainline every time i go down
you can check my g files i do it lbc style
i got the word on you simon
you need to just start rhymin
cause you the biggest star on your label
and them other niggas just crumbs off my table
youre not able to compete with the heat that i drop
and i still aint been paid for 187 on a cop
i started yo shit and i will end yo shit
if you keep talkin shit on crip
