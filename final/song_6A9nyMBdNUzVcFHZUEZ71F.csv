last years wishes are this years apologies
every last time i come home
i take my last chance to burn a bridge or two
i only keep myself this sick in the head cause i know how the words get you off

prechorus
were the new face of failure
prettier and younger but not any better off
bulletproof loneliness
at best at best
chorus
me and you setting in a honeymoon
if i woke up next to you if i woke up next to you
me and you setting in a honeymoon
if i woke up next to you if i woke up next to you

verse 2
collect the bad habits that you couldnt bear to keep
out of the woods but i love
the tree i used to lay beneath kissed teeth stained red
from a sour bottle baby girl with eyes the size of baby worlds

prechorus
were the new face of failure
prettier and younger but not any better off
bulletproof loneliness
at best at best

me and you setting in a honeymoon
if i woke up next to you if i woke up next to you
me and you setting in a honeymoon
if i woke up next to you if i woke up next to you
me and you setting in a honeymoon
if i woke up next to you if i woke up next to you
me and you setting in a honeymoon
if i woke up next to you if i woke up next to you

bridge
the best way to make it through with hearts and wrists intact
is to realize two out of three aint bad aint bad

outro
me and you setting in a honeymoon
if i woke up next to you if i woke up next to you
me and you honeymoon
setting in a honeymoon a honeymoon
me and you setting in a honeymoon honeymoon
if i woke up next to you if i woke up next to you
me and you setting in a honeymoon honeymoon
if i woke up next to you honeymoon22embed"
