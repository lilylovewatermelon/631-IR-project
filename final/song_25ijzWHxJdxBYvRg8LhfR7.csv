lifes been sucked out of me
and this routines killing me
i did it to myself
i cannot say it would not be
somebody put me out of my misery
expression stimulation hollow sense of myself
i did it to myself again
somebody put me in my place

chorus
never enough
never enough
do i deserve
what i got

verse 2
now everythings okay
theres nothing wrong with me
this seems unnatural
to me id say in every way
somebody kick me in my face
now somethings wrong with me
im bleeding profusely
and this seems natural
to me i fuck up everyday
somebody put me in my place

i feel as if im running
back to where i started
you ask whats wrong with me
and i say nothing
is everything okay
is something wrong with me
pushing and pulling feelings eternal
my heart is yours

i feel as if im running
