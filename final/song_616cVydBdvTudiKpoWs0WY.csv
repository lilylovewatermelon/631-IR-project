theres a moment in time and its stuck in my mind
way back when we were just kids
’cause your eyes told the tale of an act of betrayal
i knew that somebody did

prechorus
oh waves of time
seem to wash away the scenes of our crimes
for you this never ends

chorus
can you stay strong can you go on
kristy are you doing okay
a rose that wont bloom winters kept you
dont waste your whole life trying to get back what was taken away

verse 2
though the marks on your dress had been neatly repressed
i knew that something was wrong
and i shouldve spoke out and im so sorry now
i didnt know ’cause we were so young

prechorus
oh clouds of time
seem to rain on innocence left behind
it never goes away

can you stay strong can you go on
kristy are you doing okay
a rose that wont bloom winters kept you
dont waste your whole life trying to get back what was taken away

prechorus
oh clouds of time
seem to rain on innocence left behind
it never goes away
it never goes away

chorus
can you stay strong can you go on
kristy are you doing okay
a rose that wont bloom winters kept you
dont waste your whole life trying to get back what was taken away
dont waste your whole life trying to get back what was taken away2embed"
