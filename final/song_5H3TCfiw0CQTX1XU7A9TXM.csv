your skin is warm like an oven
your kiss is sugary sweet
your fingers feel like cotton
when you put your arms around me
i feel like im just missin
somethin whenever you leave
weve got all the ingredients
except you lovin me

im not a piece of cake
for you to just discard
while you walk away
with the frosting of my heart
so im takin back
whats mine youll miss
the slice of heaven that i gave to you last night
