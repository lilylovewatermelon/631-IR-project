verse 1
theres a first time for everything
its definitely one of them nights nights
i knew when i looked in his eyes eyes
that he was gonna be trouble for me oh
i never wanted to lie lie
i knew that my baby would cry
if he knew what we were doin
but if his love dont pass the test the test
i gotta get it from somewhere else
