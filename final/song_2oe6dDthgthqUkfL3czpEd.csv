i cant seem to find someones shoulder
who will i rely on when its over
took a chance with you it made me colder
better on my own when its all over

verse
so when im weak who do i call
my god it hurts i cant be calm
what do i do where do i run
im tired of hate im tired of love
i dug my nails into my arms
she turned and laughed at all my scars
what is my worth
what is my worth

outro
gave my love a piece of me
she put my heart beneath her feet
she turned and left i question whats my worth
gave my love a piece of me
she put my heart beneath her feet
she turned and left i question whats my worth
my worth my worthyou might also like105embed"
