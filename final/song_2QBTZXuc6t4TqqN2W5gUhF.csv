i want some touch
all over my body give some love
to me my dove

let me get inside of your core
let me live inside of your core
let me hide up under your core
let me live inside of your core

i want a kiss
all over my face and even my lips
while i grab your hips

refrain
let me get inside of your core
let me live inside of your core
let me hide up under your core
let me live inside of your core

let me live outside of your core
let me ease on out of your core
let me live outside of your core2embed"
