i took two weeks vacation for the honeymoon
a couple tickets all inclusive down in cancun
i couldnt get my money back so im in seat 7a
im getting drunk on a plane
i bet the fella on the aisle thought i was crazy
cause i taped your picture to the seatback right beside me
now ive got empty mini bottles fillin both our trays
im getting drunk on a plane

chorus
buyin drinks for everybody
but the pilot its a party
got this 737 rocking like a g6
stewardess is somethin sexy
leanin pourin coke and whiskey
told her about my condition
got a little milehigh flight attention
its mardi gras up in the clouds
im up so high i may never come down
ill try anything to drown out the pain
they all know why im getting drunk on a plane

verse 2
we had this date marked on the calendar forever
wed take that new wed limo airport ride together
i feel like a plastic groom alone there at the top of the cake
so hey im getting drunk on a plane
see dierks bentley liveget tickets as low as 25you might also likechorus
buyin drinks for everybody
but the pilot its a party
got this 737
rocking like a g6
stewardess is somethin sexy
leanin pourin coke and whiskey
told her about my condition
got a little milehigh flight attention
its mardi gras up in the clouds
im up so high i may never come down
ill try anything to drown out the pain
they all know why im getting drunk on a plane

verse 3
on my way home ill bump this seat right up to first class
so i can drink that cheap champagne out of a real glass
and when we land ill call her up and tell her kiss my ass
cause hey im drunk on a plane

chorus
buyin drinks for everybody
but the pilot its a party
got this 737
rocking like a g6
stewardess is somethin sexy
leanin pourin coke and whiskey
told her about my condition
got a little milehigh flight attention
its mardi gras up in the clouds
im up so high i may never come down
ill try anything to drown out the pain
they all know why im getting drunk on a plane
outro
im getting drunk on a plane
i might be passed out
in the baggage claim
but right now
im drunk on a plane25embed"
