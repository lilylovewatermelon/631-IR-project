ive never so adored you
im twisting allegories now
i want to complicate you
dont let me do this to myself
im chasing roller coasters
ive got to have you closer now
endless romantic stories
you never could control me

chorus
well i never really thought that youd come tonight
while the crown hangs heavy on either side
give me one last kiss while were far too young to die
were far too young to die
far too young to die

verse 2
fixation or psychosis
devoted to neurosis now
endless romantic stories
you never could control me

chorus
well i never really thought that youd come tonight
while the crown hangs heavy on either side
give me one last kiss while were far too young to die
well i never really thought that youd come tonight
while the crown hangs heavy on either side
give me one last kiss while were far too young to die
were far too young to die
far too young to die

well i never really thought that youd come tonight
while the crown hangs heavy on either side
give me one last kiss while were far too young to die
were far too young to die35embed"
