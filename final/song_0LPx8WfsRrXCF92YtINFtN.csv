i never thought id feel this
guilty and im broken down inside
living with myself nothing but lies
i always thought id make it
but never knew id let it get so bad
living with myself is all i have

prechorus
i feel numb
i cant come to life
i feel like im frozen in time

chorus
living in a world so cold
wasting away
living in a shell with no soul
since youve gone away
living in a world so cold
counting the days
since youve gone away
youve gone away

verse 2
do you ever feel me
do you ever look deep down inside
staring at yourself paralyzed

i feel numb
i cant come to life
i feel like im frozen in time

chorus
living in a world so cold
wasting away
living in a shell with no soul
since youve gone away
living in a world so cold
counting the days
since youve gone away
youve gone away from me
