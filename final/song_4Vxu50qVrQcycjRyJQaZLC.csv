waking up in my college dorm
yeah my life it was pretty normal
looking for a date to the spring formal
wasnt worried bout nothing else no
majoring in undecided
notebook full of bad songs i was writing
never dreamed anybody else would like them
now theyre sitting on a walmart shelf

chorus
aint it funny how life changes
you wake up aint nothing the same and life changes
you cant stop it just hop on the train and
you never know whats gonna happen
you make your plans and you hear god laughing
life changes
and i wouldnt change it for the world the world oh no
and i wouldnt change it for the world the world oh no

verse 2
i bought a ring and she said i do
but everybody else said man youre twentytwo
whatcha trying to prove hey why dont you wait
cause ive been waiting on her since the second grade yeah
and now she got her own set of fans
she got a blue check mark by her instagram
and i wrote a little song about holding her hand
and now everybody wanna die a happy man
