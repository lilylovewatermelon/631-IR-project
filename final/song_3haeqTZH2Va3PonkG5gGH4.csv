verse 1 joell ortiz
if anybodys road was hard dawg it was mine
no pops and mommy nose finished more than a dime
only child so my hands was active
i used to get jumped and still yell but your mans a faggot
no name jeans with the grass stains and wack zipper
tucked up under the button up for the class picture
eatin twice in the lunch room
already feast with mom but some food just keep on callin
hey aint no shame in my game im from the ps too
felt had to act tough for a piece too
yes it was that serious
back then
empty refrigerators and back rent
do me a favor and ask quinn if i could borrow some sugar
joell knockin down the hall with a note and nose full of boogers
cant forget that
now that i spit crack
the phones keep ringin
nah dont let em get that let em keep on callin

verse 2 joell ortiz
i love it when i hear yall voice
yall gotta understand i aint drop them tears by choice
another man couldnt have dealt with the cruel jokes
winter time feathers flying out my blue coat
the girls aint like me
cause i aint have nikes
my hair wasnt spicy
a cut was five beans i only had like three
so i bought an ice
hopin it would cool me down
i was heated all my friends had wifeys
easter day everybody got fresh
me i just tried to look my best
poked out my chest
never let them see me sweat
these are the things i used to wanna forget
now im glad i remember
you kept me on my toes it was cold in december
the roof on my building aint have no chimney
maybe thats why santa skipped me
and his hotline was always busy
i used to keep on callin
