yeah this could be your last drink from a stranger in a bar
the last time that youre dancing in unfamiliar arms
yeah this could be your last first kiss if we do this thing right
your last time alone beneath neon lights

chorus
it could be your last night coming in here drinking all by yourself
the last time giving your heart away to someone else
yeah we could be some history in the making girl tonight
might be your last night lonely

verse 2
yeah you could be the last first name thats ever been worth asking
yeah you could be the last phone number i write down on a napkin
yeah you could be the last girl that i take back home to mama
the last time that were talked about in this smalltown drama

chorus
its gonna be the last night coming in here drinking all by yourself
the last time giving your heart away to someone else
yeah we could be some history in the making girl tonight
might be your last night lonely
it could be your last night lonely

verse 3
it could be your last night coming in here drinking all by yourself
the last time giving your heart away to someone else
yeah we could be some history in the making girl tonight
might be your last night lonely
