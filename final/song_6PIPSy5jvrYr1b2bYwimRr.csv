in my old town
there is no street with my name
no crown i am no king
and the kids they dont all know my name
its like nothing has changed

hook
life takes you up and down
and life spins you all around
the good life
i know i made it
the good life
i know i made it with you

verse 2
in my own town
my friends are saying
what happened to you
we thought youd make it
and youd be driving bentleys
and living the good life for us all
my father says
when will you make it
my mother says
youll learn to fake it
but im not you and youre not me
but im as good as i can be baby

life takes you up and down
and life spins you all around
the good life
i know i made it
the good life
i know i made it with you
life takes you up and down
and life spins you all around
the good life
i know i made it
the good life
i know i made it with you

oh i know that it’s the good life
i can see it in your eyes
oh i know that it’s the good life
i can see it in your eyes

and i say
i know i made it
the good life
open your eyes
your friends your lover
your soul your mind
its right there baby all the time
hook
life takes you up and down
and life spins you all around

and life spins you all around
