baby if i seem a little bit distracted
like im in another place and another time well well

verse 1
i apologize for the way im acting
i just got to lot of loving you on my mind
baby since this morning ive been wondering
how you do that thing you did last night well well
let me tell you girl that was really something
thats why i gotta lot of loving you on my mind
i walk around and dream about you
every single minute of every day
its all i can do to make it through
until the night i can hardly wait oh i can hard wait
girl the kind of loving you put on me
aint no way theres a better kind
so baby just tell me when you want me
i always got a lot of loving you on my mind
