know its been raining i swear im not lonely
always complaining that you never see me
call in the morning when you wake
maybe tomorrow were okay when its a sunny day

prechorus
i keep you posted i promise im better
with the sun well leave my house im sorry for yesterday
you know i dont mean it i promise im better
with the sun well leave my house im sorry for yesterday

chorus
keep me here
with your skin on mine again
while youre there
its еasy if i pretend

verse 2
dont know why i feel this way treating all my friеnds the same
havent had enough to do but im not ignoring you
call in the morning when you wake
maybe tomorrow were okay when its a sunny day

prechorus
i keep you posted i promise im better
with the sun well leave my house im sorry for yesterday
you know i dont mean it i promise im better
with the sun well leave my house im sorry for yesterday
