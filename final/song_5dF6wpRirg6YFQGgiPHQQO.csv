dadada dada
ooh
yeah yeah

verse 1
if you could only see
that i was not put here for you
to judge me and dispute my in most truth

verse 2
and after all these years of enmity envy and tears
its a shame you dont know me at all

chorus
i was wondering would you cry for me
if i told you that i couldnt breathe
if i was drowning suffocating
if i told you that i couldnt breathe

verse 3
those ageless buried recollections
we transform them and select them
you have yours i have mine thats fine

verse 4
why are we too torn to heal
our stitches never disappear
i have mine you have yours im sure

i was wondering i was wondering
would you reach for me
if you saw that i was languishing

chorus
oh i was wondering would you cry for me
if i told you that i couldnt breathe
if i was drowning suffocating
if i told you that i couldnt breathe1embed"
