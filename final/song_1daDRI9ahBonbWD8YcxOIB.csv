mmm mmm mmm

verse 1
flowers in hand waiting for me
every word in poetry
wont call me by name only baby
the more that you give the less that i need
everyone says i look happy
when it feels right

chorus
i know that youre wrong for me
gonna wish we never met on the day i leave
i brought you down to your knees
cause they say that misery loves company
its not your fault i ruin everything
and its not your fault i cant be what you need
baby angels like you cant fly down here with me

postchorus
im everything they said i would be
la la la
im everything they said i would be

verse 2
ill put you down slow love you goodbye
before you let go just one more time
take off your clothes pretend that its fine
a little more hurt wont kill you
tonight mother says you dont look happy
close your eyes

i know that youre wrong for me

cause they say that misery loves company
its not your fault i ruin everything
