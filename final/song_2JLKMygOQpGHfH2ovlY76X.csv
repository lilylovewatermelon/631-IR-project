we live in the rain a sea of change
you cant keep anything you take
the lovely face of lives we chase
is but dust for wind to take
when all is gone the only loss
is to not have loved at every cost
when you can say and i can say
we loved with every step we take
ill be okay

chorus
how do you love when your heart is broken
how do you speak when you feel outspoken
i can forgive and be forgiven
by learning to heal with a heart wide open

verse 2
with open hearts despite the stakes
we take a chance on our mistakes
a brand new day we will embrace
an open wound that heals with grace
in all the fears that we will face
in this time and in this place
when you can say and i can say
we loved with every step we take
ill be okay

how do you love when your heart is broken
how do you speak when you feel outspoken
i can forgive and be forgiven
by learning to heal with a heart wide open
ill be okay
ill be okay
