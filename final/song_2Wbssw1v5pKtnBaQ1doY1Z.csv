waiting on something to change from the dugout
behind all the pain
never got me very far
i know that its wrong

verse 2 josh
but i dont want to
drop the ball today
id rather stay in and hide away

prechorus josh  jonas
tide gets strong and washed you out
take some time to figure it out
four long months of grinding teeth
ill take the hate
still dont have the strength to leave
ill waste away

chorus josh
i saw your window at 2 am
and your light was still on
i found the letters that you wrote for me
and i couldnt bring myself to throw them away

postchorus josh
did she get some sleep tonight
did she get with someone nice
that knows what youre thinking
doesnt let it scare him
yes im changing but
now youre facing your fears
