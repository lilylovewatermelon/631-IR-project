wait do you see my heart on my sleeve
its been there for days on end
and its been waitin for you to open up yours too
baby come on now im trying to tell you just how
id like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
say that its always been me

chorus
thats made you feel a way youve never felt before
and im all you need and that you never want more
then youd say all of the right things without a clue
but youd save the best for last like im the one for you

postchorus
you should know that youre just a temporary fix
this is not rooted with you it dont mean that much to me
youre just a filler in the space that happened to be free
how dare you think youd get away with tryin to play me yeah

verse 2
why is it every time i think ive tried my hardest
it turns out it aint enough
youre still not mentioning love
what am i supposed to do to make you want me properly
im takin these chances and getting nowhere
and though im trying my hardest you go back to her
and i think that i know things may never change
im still hopin one day i might hear you say
see adele liveget tickets as low as 165you might also likechorus
i make you feel a way youve never felt before
and im all you need and that you never want more
then youd say all of the right things without a clue
but youd save the best for last like im the one for you

postchorus
you should know that youre just a temporary fix
this is not rooted with you it dont mean that much to me
youre just a filler in the space that happened to be free
how dare you think youd get away with tryin to play me yeah

bridge
but despite the truth that i know
i find it hard to let go and give up on you
seems i love the things you do
like the meaner you treat me more eager i am
to persist with this heartbreak of runnin around
and i will do until im findin myself with you

chorus
and make you feel a way youve never felt before
and be all you need so that you never want more
then youd say all of the right things without a clue
and youll be the one for me and me the one for you
yeah yeah yeah yeah9embed"
