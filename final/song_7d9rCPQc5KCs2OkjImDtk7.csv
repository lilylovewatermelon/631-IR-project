a busy nigga put the president on hold

got the inside of the laws smokin like broke stogs
you can find me in the mall buyin up all the clothes
or in atl or club 112 throwin them bows
left and right arms froze cold like the ice from the cooler
just left the jeweler rose gold frank mueller
i smoke big growin weed in my garage
