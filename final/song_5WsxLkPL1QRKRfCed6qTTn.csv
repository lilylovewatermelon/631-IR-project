whiskey wont you come and take my troubles
cause i cant seem to do it on my own
in the morning there is hours and infinity
the starlit evenings come to take me home

verse 2
i aint got a dime in my pocket
and i just stepped on my last cigarette
but theres a bar downtown thatll give me credit
a home away from home away i went

verse 3
tomorrow theres a train to carolina
tomorrow thats where im gonna go
feel the warm sunshine on my shoulders
and live my days a free and easy soul

verse 4
my home is with the hills and trees around me
my ceiling holds the moon and stars above
so ill never be a lonely man awalking
ill never live one day without love

verse 5
so whiskey wont you come and take my troubles
cause i cant seem to do it on my own
in the morning there is hours and infinity
the starlit evenings come to take me home
the starlit evenings come to take me homesee trampled by turtles liveget tickets as low as 54you might also likeembed"
