to a rope and a tree
what that ol judge called first degree
and all the folks around town
swore to lay me in the ground
when they found out id put that poor boy down

you see i did not much care
for the way that hed sit and glare
so i closed his eyes for good with a barroom chair

so go and lay my poor bones
past appalachian stone
far beneath that cold ground all alone

oh but if youre asking me
where i would rather be
it was worth it to see that boy cut from the kneessee colter wall liveget tickets as low as 68you might also likeembed"
