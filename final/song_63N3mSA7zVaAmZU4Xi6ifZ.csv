youve always said that youd love to live out here
where you can smell the morning glories in the air
with that sun shining through that crystal blue
sure looks good on you
cant you just see a drive winding up that hill
leading to a house with flowers on the windowsill
it might take a while to clear this land
but ive got a plan

chorus 1
dont tell your mama yet im begging you
dont tell your daddy til the paperwork goes through
when the time is right well let em know
but right now is between you and me and these here fenceposts

verse 3
dont worry bout the money got a couple things i can sell
and mr folder down the road could always use some help
whatever it takes ill go that extra mile
if it makes you smile

chorus 1
so dont tell your mama yet im begging you
dont tell your daddy til the paperwork goes through
when the time is right well let em know
but right now is between you and me and these here fenceposts
see cody johnson liveget tickets as low as 15you might also likeinstrumental bridge

chorus 2
aint nobody round to see us now
what do ya say we lay a blanket down
anything that happens baby when we get this close
stays between you and me and these here fenceposts

outro
youve always said that youd love to live out hereembed"
