she said its not enough
ohohoh uh

chorus
now ive been drownin in this liquor bottle but drownings not enough
they tell me that i wont live to see tomorrow but i dont give a fuck
im running out of patience out of pleasure and runnin out of luck
im really scared that we wont stay together
what if you run out of your love you run out of your love

verse 1
i hope you know if i said it baby i meant it
straight lovers we aint goin to a friendship
fell for you i dont know how it happened uh
when we kissin i taste all the passion
time worth more than money but ill spend
all of it on you me and you until the end
no talking baby im about that action
all these othеr hoes are so irrelеvant honest
you taught me what real love is

chorus
now ive been drownin in this liquor bottle but drownings not enough
they tell me that i wont live to see tomorrow but i dont give a fuck
im running out of patience out of pleasure and runnin out of luck
im really scared that we wont stay together
what if you run out of your love you run out of your love

verse 2
my bad for all of the stressful times that we had
i know you scared that im gon relapse i love that

ink on my brain like a tattoo
glad we aint meet in high school
