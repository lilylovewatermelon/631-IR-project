well the house of cash just burned down
all the way to the cold hard ground
the doctors came from all over town
to see the memories scattered all around

verse 2
then the stars came out by the light of day
and they heard their old friend passed away
that yard looked like a funeral hall
without the pies and casseroles

chorus
well its goodbye johnny goodbye june
goodbye fancy living room
well no one sleeps in cashs bed
except the man in black and the woman he wed
and the ring of fire comes full circle
and the ring of fire comes all the way around

verse 3
and if those ashes in the pool could talk
to the anchor man out on the walk
id bet theyd be happy to announce
therell be no yard sale now
see george strait liveget tickets as low as 102you might also likechorus

outro
and the ring of fire comes full circle
and the ring of fire comes all the way aroundembed"
