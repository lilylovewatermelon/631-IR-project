verse 1 northside shorty
the one pullin all them robberies the boy whos born from carecrow carecrow
came up from the slums walking product of the ghetto
i cant feel my face but feeling great as the vice goes
round and round and pound for pound life going in a circle
from pentagrams to instagram how i mainstream the 6
them boys can hate i got their fate suck on my dick
aks all around me want to die pick out a stick
grave been dug load up a slug lay him to rest up in a ditch
see uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likebridge

verse 2 southside shorty
southside shorty outside early morning
not a knock empty out the glock
dot in front the 40 turnin you into a pourin forty
or ill come back when youre poor and forty
take it how you want it take it as a warning
dont ever ignore me nah
hide behind the door me and the fellas bring the storm
well keep it coming keep it coming
mixin up milligrams with millimeters nine in the chamber
got thirty inside the heater bloody nose i smell the reaper
smoke surrounds my steps im either chokin on my breath or reefer
coughin til my death im eager leaving all my fans as grievers
