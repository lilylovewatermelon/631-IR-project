a 2 3 4

verse 1
well i met her in a bar the men with big guitars were playin
and i listened with my ears but i couldnt hear what she was sayin

prechorus 1
i guess she talked with her mind
but i didnt want to seem too unkind so i just laughed
and kept my eyes peeled to the door
wondering what i was there for

chorus
but its alright and its alright
and its alright and its alright
i got ma nuts from a hippie in a camper van on saturday night

verse 2
well i asked if she believed in adam and eve the fable
and i guess she wouldve given me an answer if only she was able

prechorus 2
and she danced like a medicine man
drew a crazy picture on my hand and told me
she wanted to change my point of view
asked me where i was going to

but its alright and its alright

verse 3
well she whispered in my ear we got to get us out of here to the country
i asked her for a ride she took me aside she said try me

i thought im gonna wake pretty soon
in the middle of a sunday afternoon just dreamin
and it was warm in the back of her van
when she made me a real man

bridge
she made me cry she made me cry
wah she made me cry wah she made me cry

well its alright well its alright
well its alright well its alright
i got ma nuts from a hippie in a camper van on saturday night
