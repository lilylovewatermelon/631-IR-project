gotta get it how you live
everybody talking bout rb shit
im just talking me shit
you know what i mean
let me hear that

verse
i gave it all for a fantasy
is anybody gon remember me
if i go tonight i doubt the worldll change
i just pray they dont forget my name
is it game rules i cant lose
when its all said and done will i still be cool
spent like how much ten thousand ten thousand
twenty thousand twenty thousand thirty thousand thirty thousand
forty thousand forty thousand
how much ima spend profilin
she come in and compliment my closet
fuck her on the floor like i dont give a fuck bout it
your judgement get clouded when you clouted
my opposition wish id stop smilin
my family wish id stop wildin
im still on the east side smokin with my ogs
cause they the only ones that really know me
i was fuckin superstars when i was nineteen mm
the shit we did you wont believe me
now im at the turn up lookin lonely
then they wonder why im quiet at them house parties
cause everybody see me see me
roll some blunts and hit her once and now she need me need me
her nigga wanna be me yeah
but they dont know im fightin demons
i feel like dyin every season
ive been swimmin in the deep end
all my bitches know im leavin at some point mm im out
whether theres a reason or not
