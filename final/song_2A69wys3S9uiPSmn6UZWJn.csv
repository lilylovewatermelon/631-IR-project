turn me on turn me off then you turn me back on by the weekend
and you won’t say the words that i want but you flirt when you’re drinkin’
i see those bubbles pop up like you’re texting then they disappear
lets cut through the shit then let’s get to what we’re doing here

chorus
are we just a backseat tryna get it while we can
are we names in a tattoo or just a number on a hand
are we last call kissing or will we be reminiscing with each other for the next forty years
are we written in the stars baby or are we written in the sand

verse 2
yeah i want you to want me to take you back home to my mama
put my name on your lips call me yours and forget all this drama
your makeup is next to my toothbrush but you never put it away on the shelf
im asking you baby cause i’m tired of asking myself

chorus
are we just a backseat tryna get it while we can
are we names in a tattoo or just a number on a hand
are we last call kissing are we dancing in the kitchen baby tell me what it is or what it isnt
are we written in the stars baby or are we written in the sand

outro
are we just a backseat tryna get it while we can
are we names in a tattoo or just a number i should wash right off my hand
are we last call kissing or will we be reminiscing with each other for the next forty years
are we written in the stars baby or are we written in the sand
are we written in the stars baby or are we written in the sandsee old dominion liveget tickets as low as 69you might also like4embed"
