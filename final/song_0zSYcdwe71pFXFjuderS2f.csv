verse 1 marsha
im gonna take you on a ride on a lyrical expedition

i be wishin everybody would listen
kissin ass until i was able to step into the arena
make an impression a lesson to our discoverin

braved through expeditions
through commission or division by those who pause predictions
in addition got a mission a vision if you would listen
produce collaborations increasing palpitations

verse 3 floetry natalie

and if we fail again well overcome the pain again

verse 4 natalie
