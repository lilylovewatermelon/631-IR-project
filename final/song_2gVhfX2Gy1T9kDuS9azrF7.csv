im like the water when your ship rolled in that night
rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife
and if it was an openshut case
i never wouldve known from that look on your face
lost in your current like a priceless wine

chorus
the more that you say the less i know
wherever you stray i follow
im begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans thats my man

verse 2
life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
head on the pillow i could feel you sneakin in
as if you were a mythical thing
like you were a trophy or a champion ring
and there was one prize id cheat to win

chorus
the more that you say the less i know
wherever you stray i follow
im begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans thats my man
you know that my train could take you home
anywhere else is hollow
im begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans thats my man

life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
they count me out time and time again
life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
but i come back stronger than a 90s trend

verse 3
wait for the signal and ill meet you after dark
show me the places where the others gave you scars
now this is an openshut case
i guess i shouldve known from the look on your face
every baitandswitch was a work of art

chorus
the more that you say the less i know
wherever you stray i follow
im begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans thats my man
you know that my train could take you home
anywhere else is hollow
im begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans thats my man
the more that you say the less i know
wherever you stray i follow
im begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans thats my man
you know that my train could take you home
anywhere else is hollow
im begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans thats my man

hey thats my man

hey thats my man
im begging for you to take my hand
