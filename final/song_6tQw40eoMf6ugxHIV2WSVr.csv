verse 1 euro
we went from quarter juices from the corner to wine glasses
we pass blunts thinking bout the past as the time passes
i went from roaming hallways with a backpack tryna find classes
to ducking off with girls that snuck backstage tryna find passes
went from ripped shoes looking through handmedowns trying to find my look
and now its an overlook the water views thanks to my rhyme book
thanks to my flows now youll be more than good if you pay for my verses
with punchlines youll be ko backwards if you buy my hooks
okay you might not have got that
that means ok as in doing ok
i mean who would have thought that
that id be doing this from back in the old days i couldnt have bought that
but i was sold a dream i ran away with it now look what i brought back
i might have changed is what the niggas that i used to know say
ive brought change is what the niggas that i call my bros say
thats all i hear the familys all right here
i swear thats all i hear yeah
for as long as im here we all right here

chorus 1 euro
i think im getting wasted tonight
i realized that i made it tonight
you gotta hear just how i made it tonight
coz its crazy how i made it
and tonight is the night
i think ive realized that i made it tonight
raise your glass lets make a toast and celebrate it tonight
you could be anywhere in the world youre here with me
i know what it takes to get here and im glad that you could make it tonight
so cheers

i flew afternoon and made it by night
i landed the flight was amazing i just stayed up and write
chauffeur was waiting with a sign except my name wasnt right
the drive was scenic the night was dark and the lobby was white
im reminded forgot to text mack that i made it i typed that i made it
he hit me back like checkin i told him i appreciate it like twice
scoop me up in the ghost and headed to the skatepark
bumping some old jigga the same song i think it played like twice
under the street lights in miami thinking damn this is life
with no hype never dropped a song im just saying im nice
trying to prove santi right the only one that kept saying im nice
and all along he believed in me all along
im out to prove wrong whoever said i would do wrong motherfucker
and stunna went from birdman to stunna to uncle stunna
and tune went from lil wayne to tune to my big brother

and tell her

ive waited days after days ive grown age after age
ive ripped page after page now im running stage after stage
with a story coming from nothing to dinner in a house with mad stories
