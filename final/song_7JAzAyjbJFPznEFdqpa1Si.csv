she says that the world is a broken mess
and its always on her mind
she cries at the news when the shots ring out
oh every single time

and no i cannot fix it no i cannot make it stop

chorus
so i said hey turn your phone off wont you look me in my eye
cant we live that real life real life
oh hey turn your phone off wont you look me in my eye
cant we live that real life real life

verse 2
she prays on her knees as the towers fall
to a god she does not know
shes begging him to stop the mess
as the boston bombs will blow ooh
she says how could i ever believe in something
that would step aside and watch
and i got no words to say cause i think i lost my faith
but i fake it for the day oh everything will be okay

prechorus
but no i cannot fix it and i cannot make it stop
