yeah i mean she wants somebody thats working a 9to5
i apologize but those aint my hours yeah you never been with a man
whos working this kinda job who works with this kind of drive i wouldnt be with me either
hold up yeah i think thats work on the other line i gotta go we can argue some another time
hang up the phone i regret it right after
this is the chance that i just  couldnt pass up
see i signed a deal you said i shouldve asked ya
i guess i was scared to see how you reacted
or maybe i knew id be selfish
these are the things i aint proud of
is always the type to get jealous theres always two sides of the story
and youre not the one that i blame when i tell it thats real yeah
you aint the one you aint the one
i mean i shouldve manned up and thats hard to say as a man
the older i get the more i understand a relationships more than just holding her hand
im sorry you can blame me yeah you can blame me
