i am a dominant gene live as i die
never say forever cause forevers a lie
i can see right through you so i can ignore you
the story changes but the ending wont bore you
i tried to tell you but you simply obeyed
they didnt listen so they threw you away
now all you do is talk i dont wanna hear your bullshit
is this what you want

prechorus
this is where it begins
this is where it ends
this is where it begins
and this is where it ends

chorus
they called us a dead generation
they told us that we wouldnt survive
they left us alone in the maelstrom
as you can see were all clearly alive
we know where you are and were coming
lets see ya say that shit to our face
3030150 remembers

in my own peculiar way i feel mercurial
before i get ahead of myself again
i know the where but i still dont know the when
you want to live in a onesided world
be prepared for a whole world of hurt
now its the grand facade
i dont wanna be an angel
i just wanna be god

chorus
they called us a dead generation
they told us that we wouldnt survive
they left us alone in the maelstrom
as you can see were all clearly alive
we know where you are and were coming
lets see you say that shit to our face
3030150 remembers
3030150 hates
hates

verse 3
i am a fuckin machine fueled by the past
a memorys a memory until its a fact
i can bury the hatchet and let some shit go
but i got too many grudges to hold
saw a lot of people die in the end
i never wanna walk that road again
now i will never give up
i dont wanna have it all
i just wanna have enough
prechorus
this is where it begins
this is where it ends
this is where it begins
and this is where it ends

chorus
they called us a dead generation
they told us that we wouldnt survive
they left us alone in the maelstrom
as you can see were all clearly alive
we know where you are and were coming
lets see you say that shit to our face
