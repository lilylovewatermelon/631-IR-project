i know i dont want her
i swear thats a fact
but the thought of somebody else
rubbing her back just kills me
oh it kills me

verse 2
i know she dont love me
i know she aint home
so why in the hell do i
pick up this phone and call her
why do i call her

chorus
ive dropped by her mamas
stoned out of my mind
just to hear that its over
from her one more time
as if i didnt see that red chevy
not slowing down loaded down
and rolling down our road
yeah shes already left
so why cant i leave her alone

verse 3
ive wrote her letters
signed i was a fool
she wrote me back saying
go find a stool and drink one
like youve always done
see george strait liveget tickets as low as 102you might also likeverse 4
so thats what i did
cause thats what i do
backsliding hiding away
from the truth until the tears run
oh here comes one

chorus
ive dropped by her mamas
stoned out of my mind
just to hear that its over
from her one more time
as if i didnt see that red chevy
not slowing down loaded down
and rolling down our road
yeah shes already left
so why cant i leave her alone

chorus
ive dropped by her mamas
stoned out of my mind
just to hear that its over
from her one more time
as if i didnt see that red chevy
not slowing down or turnin round
or loaded down headin out of town
and rolling down our road
shes already left
so why cant i leave her alone
outro
i know i dont want her
i swear thats a fact
but the thought of somebody else
rubbin her back just kills meembed"
