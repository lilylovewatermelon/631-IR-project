i come flutterin in from neverland
time can never stop me no no no no
i know you tried to
i come ridin in on a pale white horse
handin out highs to less fortunate
i do advise you
run it back run it on back
when youre breakin it down for me
cause i cant hear you
two times run it on back
will it ever make sense to me

chorus rihanna
i got to do things my own way darlin
will you ever let me
will you ever respect me no
do things my own way darlin
you should just let me
why you aint ever let me grow
postchorus sza
when i look outside my window
i cant get no peace of mind
when i look outside my window
i cant get no peace of mind oh

word on the street you run it low lately
i needed you to please give my reflection a break
from the face its seein now
ooh darlin would you mind givin my reflection a break
from the pain its feelin now

chorus sza both
i got to do things my own way darlin
