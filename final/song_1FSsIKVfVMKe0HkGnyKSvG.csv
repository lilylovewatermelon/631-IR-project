woke up from a dream last night
where all the skies were green
you were the sun
down on the wave came your daylight
oh nadine you were the sun

oh nadine
i cant help have a funny feeling youd be good to me
you were in my dream

oh nadine
you once had a lovely dream
and woke with pain of loss
you looked at the sky
lost in the darkness round the moon
oh nadine ill be there soon
oh nadine ill be thereyou might also like1embed"
