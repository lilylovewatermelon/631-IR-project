life is too
to two onetwo
verse 1 mf doom
how doom hold heat and preach nonviolence
shhh he about to start the speech cmon silence
on one starry night i saw the light
heard a voice that sound like barry white said sure youre right
dont let me find out who tried to bite
they better off goin to fly a kite in a firefight
during tornado time with no coat than i caught ya
wrote the book on rhymes a note from the author
with no headshot he said its been a while
got a breadwinner style to get a inner child a thinner smile
and thats no exaggeration
the doctor told a patient its all in your imagination negro
ahh what do he know
about the buttery flow he need to cut the ego
trippin to date the metal fellow been rippin flows
since new york plates was ghetto yellow
with broke blue writing this is too exciting
folks leave out the show feelin truly enlightened
they say the villain been spitting enough lightning
to rock shock the boogie down to brighton alright then
you might also likebreak med
yeah check its enough
uh yeah now

verse 2 med
how med hold heat like clint east is reborn
leave you with more holes than a dartboard
haters watch him hennessy double shot drink
like the answer to the problems at the bottles bottom
uhh from the bottom top that homey pay how you owe me
my niggas take no like kobe
even with the the arms of the hulk you couldnt hold me
from gettin mines stogies be rolled smokin and gettin by
thanks to rap i aint got a dime
got me sneakin out of checkout lines with bottles by the waistside
yeah smack em in the face let em taste pride
face trial end up washed up like the shorelines
do or die ride how the dead return
street turns keep me in this dirt like an earthworm
what he spit hits and grows will brothers ever learn
worth a word chat with a nerd meeting adjourned42embed"
