what have we done oh my god
what have we done oh my god

verse 1
this is really happening
you never looked so bored
can you feel my fingernails
theyve never been so short

prechorus
its hard to lay a golden egg with everyone around
its hard to stay inside my head when words keep pouring out

chorus
like starlight crashing through the room well lose our feathers
yes i know it hurts at first but it gets better
it gets better it gets better
it gets better well get better
it gets better it gets better
it gets better well get better

verse 2
i can taste your summer sweat
its never been so warm
so can we kick the covers off
theyre always on
its never been so warm

its hard to keep a straight face when i just want to smile
if you could see the look thats in your eyes

chorus
like starlight crashing through the room well lose our feathers
yes i know it hurts at first but it gets better
it gets better it gets better
it gets better well get better
it gets better it gets better
it gets better well get better

bridge
theres a fire in sky
some snow on the ground
not quite enough cigarettes
to calm me down

bridge
what have we done oh my god
what have we done oh my god

outro
it gets better it gets better
it gets better well get better
it gets better it gets better
it gets better well get better  this is really happening
it gets better it gets better
it gets better well get better  this is really happening
it gets better it gets better
it gets better well get better3embed"
