and sort out all the feelings in your mind
sometimes i think youve found someone
to do your thinkin for ya
cause lately youve been showin all the signs

should i come home or should i go crazy
im beggin you please make up your mind
if you love me then think it all over
so make up your mind or ill lose mine

last night when i came by
i rang the bell and no one answered
but i heard voices whisper through the door
now im not sure if anyone was home to do the talkin
cause lately i hear voices more and more

should i come home or should i go crazy
im beggin you please make up your mind
if you love me then think it all over
so make up your mind or ill lose mine

should i come home or should i go crazy
im beggin you please make up your mind
if you love me then think it all over
so make up your mind or ill lose mine
