ahah ahah ahah ahah

verse 1
i was listenin to the ocean
i saw a face in the sand
but when i picked it up
then it vanished away from my hands dah
i had a dream i was seven
climbin my way in a tree
i saw a piece of heaven
waitin in patience for me dah

prechorus
and i was runnin far away
would i run off the world someday
nobody knows nobody knows
and i was dancing in the rain
i felt alive and i cant complain

chorus
but no take me home
take me home where i belong
i cant take it anymore

verse 2
i was painting a picture
the picture was a painting of you
and for a moment i thought you were here
but then again it wasnt true dah
and all this time i have been lyin
oh lyin in secret to myself
ive been putting sorrow on the farthest place on my shelf
