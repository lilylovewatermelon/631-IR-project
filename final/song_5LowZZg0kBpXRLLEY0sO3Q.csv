yeah nothin bigger than the umbrella
yeah yeah perfect
forever you just gotta feel me nigga
lil tory cannon

verse
told my bitch i love her she aint say it back
my heart i cant play with that
fuck it thats that and we made it that
runnin through the trap to find my reup tryna make it back
bm trippin im just tryna cop my son his favorite snacks
love from the crip bloods and gds
scammin out the bank i made like fifty thou on td
in this trap my homeboys my heart but shit i gotta move greedy
got a budget for the lawyer case i lose with this pd perfect
cause we tryna get more than rich fuck the fame and all the glitz
my bitch aint had tits so i bought her tits
im a lil older so i mold her til i taught the bitch
boy i woulda swore that she was loyal til i caught the bitch
i wont trust a soul its just me and my pole playin position
on that road watchin jackboys close
gun closer than the sirens see if them boys try me
bitch im openin the fire catchin bodies like corona in the virus nigga
weed bought the rolex crack bought the bussdown
trappin did a home run scammin did a touchdown
thinkin bout my son now know i gotta stay alive
cause i done let him down like four times and i cant make it five
cops from a naked eye watchin in a foreign
but we movin neat the da cant grant them no warrants perfect
the birdman with me like wayne in new orleans
rainin and pourin ragin and warin
prolly lost my bitch to an athlete
fuck it ima pull up with another bitch mad fleek
i remember crystal done told me i was mad weak
from that day i never let another bitch embarrass me perfect
i had to wear the same drawers
goin out for weeks a nigga stank but this shit paid off
flexin like i own the rental nigga i had to play it off
hoes i put this dick off in they hole just like im playin golf
anytime i ran up out of work i sold em drywall
i was broke and threw it on the scale cause i cant eyeball
homie i just came from bein homeless thats a sidebar
thats why with this rap shit i be focused cant take time off
boy im not a killer but dont push me thats on my mama
cause my killers out there swimmin in the deep end
fore he knew that nigga drowned cause he was deep in
scoreboard bitch you playin on the defense
my lil niggas catchin bodies every weekend
my lil shooter made the movie with the sequence
play with us and we gon turn that nigga pretense
in the foreign picked him up from out the precinct
cause he gon still put in that pressure til the beef ends ayy
i wanna cheat but ill prolly kill her if she cheat on me
homicidal thoughts dont mix with gs on me
plus i be with gs homie stick hot like ninetyeight degrees on me
trigger finger itchy like some fleas on me
sleepin on my nigga sofa sleepin on the floor
i couldnt even tell a bitch come over
now its all dior all on my body like my melatonin
niggas took the stand i cant believe them boys were tellin on me
street shit is hella phony yeah
look in my eyes you see im dodgin all the demons
came a long way from swipin fraud cards at all the neimans perfect
i was plottin and schemin poppin bad beans and shit
i thought it then dreamed it turned it to reality
this a fatality killin any nigga sayin he got the same style as me
im the only rapper sayin shit with no apology
pull up you could holler b
your favorite rappers shit just aint as hot as me
tory perfect
