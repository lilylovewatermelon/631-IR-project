verse 1
im not fuckin around
i think im comin out
all the deceivers and cheaters i think weve got a bleeder right now
want you to slap me around
want you to knock me out
well you missed me kissed me now you better kick me down

chorus
maybe youre the runnerup but the first one to lose the race
almost only really counts in horseshoes and handgrenades

verse 2
im gonna burn it all down
im gonna rip it out
well everything you employ was meant for me to destroy to the ground now
so dont you fuck me around
because ill shoot you down
im gonna drink fight and fuck and im pushin my luck all the time now

chorus
maybe youre the runnerup but the first one to lose the race
almost only really counts in horseshoes and handgrenades
