the heart is a stone and this is a stone that we throw
put your hand on this stone its the stone of a home you know
they say we will go far but they dont know how far well go
with our legs on the edge and our feet on the horizon

verse 2
they say we can throw far but they dont know how far we throw
with our legs on the edge and our feet on the horizon
the heart is a stone and this is a stone that we throw
they say we will go far but they dont know how far well go

chorus
it cant be gone were still right here
it took so long cant say we heard it all
limbs parallel we stood so long we fell
tear a moment from the days that carry us on forever

verse 3
this push and pull is the force of a wave of time
in the heat of the night we would cry you are not mine
they said we would go far but they dont know how far wed go
cause this heart is a stone and this is a stone that we throw

chorus
it cant be gone were still right here
it took so long cant say we saw it all
limbs parallel we stood so long we fell
bright pyramids at night that carry us on forever
it cant be gone were still right here
she took so long cant say we felt it all
limbs parallel we stood so long we fell
loves like a pantheon it carries on foreveryou might also like3embed"
