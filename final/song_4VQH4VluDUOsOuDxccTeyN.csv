go ahead and park after dark
fallen star im your one call away
motel halls neon walls
when night falls i am your escape

prechorus
when you lay alone i ache
something i wanted to feel

chorus
if you’ve been waitin for fallin in love
babe you don’t have to wait on me
cause ive been aimin for heaven above
but an angel aint what i need

verse 2
not anyone youre the one
more than fun youre the sanctuary
cause what you want is what i want
sincerity

prechorus
souls that dream alone lie awake
i’ll give you somethin’ so real

if youve been waitin’ for fallin in love
babe you dont have to wait on me
cause i’ve been aimin for heaven above
but an angel aint what i need

bridge
hold me oh so close
cause you never know
just how long our lives will be

chorus
if youve been waitin for fallin in love
babe you dont have to wait on me
cause ive been aimin for heaven above
but an angel aint what i need172embed"
