uh simple as that for your simple ass
simple way i wish you wouldve called it how it shouldve been
they try to tell me they dont get it they dont underdig
now ill be damned i came this far to let a fool live
i gotta terminate the hate spread the positive
without it bein wack and cheesy to the little kids
so i curse like a sailor and i smoke weed
i am exactly who an older rappers kids be
and who they love hands to the universe
probably think they drug addicts if they spit a cudi verse
mad lil mama switch to converse without a purse
long as the booty lookin juicy and he stylin on em

outro common
as our hero seems to be dreaming in peace
a dark chapter unfolds
throwing scott into the most eerie
and unstable part of his imagination
so intense he cannot tell his dreams from reality
this is the rise of the night terrors23embed"
