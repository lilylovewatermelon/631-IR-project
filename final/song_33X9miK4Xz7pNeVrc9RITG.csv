the businessmen are drinking my blood
like the kids in art school said they would
and i guess ill just begin again
you say can we still be friends

if i was scared i would
and if i was bored you know i would
and if i was yours but im not

verse 2
all the kids have always known
that the emperor wears no clothes
but they bow down to him anyway
because its better than being alone

chorus 1
if i was scared i would
and if i was bored you know i would
and if i was yours but im not

verse 3
now youre knocking at my door
saying please come out with us tonight
but i would rather be alone
than pretend i feel alright
if the businessmen are drinking my blood
like the kids at art school said they would
then i guess ill just begin again
you say can we still be friends

now im ready to start
i would rather be wrong

to step out into the dark
