we can never go home
we no longer have one
ill help you carry the load
ill carry you in my arms
we walk through the ash
and the charred remains of our country
keep an eye on my back
ill keep an eye on the road

chorus
help me to carry the fire
to keep it alight together
help me to carry the fire
this road wont go on forever

verse 2
if i say shut your eyes
if i say look away
bury your face in my shoulder
think of a birthday
the things you put in your head
they will stay there forevеr
im trying hard to hide your soul son
from things its not meant to see
see editors liveget tickets as low as 50you might also likechorus
help mе to carry the fire
to keep it alight together
help me to carry the fire
this road wont go on forever
help me to carry the fire
to keep it alight together
help me to carry the fire
this road wont go on forever oh

bridge
if i say shut your eyes
if i say shut your eyes
bury me in surprise
when i say shut your eyes eyes
oh help me to carry the fire

oh

chorus
help me to carry the fire
to keep it alight together
help me to carry the fire
this road wont go on foreverembed"
