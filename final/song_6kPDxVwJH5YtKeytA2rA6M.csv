heres the weight of the world on my shoulders
heres the weight of the world on my shoulders
on my shoulders

verse 1
all alone i pierce the chain
and on and on the sting remains
and dying eyes consume me now
the voice inside screams out loud

prechorus
i am focused on what i am after
the key to the next open chapter

chorus
cause i found a way
to steal the sun from the sky
long live that day
that i decided to fly from the inside

verse 2
every day a new deception
pick your scene and take direction
and on and on i search to connect
but i dont wear a mask and i have no regrets

the key to the next open chapter

chorus
cause i found a way
to steal the sun from the sky
long live that day
that i decided to fly from the inside

bridge
i cant escape the pain i cant control the rage
sometimes i think that im gonna go insane
im not against whats right im not for whats wrong
im just making my way and im gone

heres the weight of the world on my shoulders

chorus
cause i found a way
to steal the sun from the sky
long live that day
that i decided to fly from the inside

that i decided to fly from the inside
