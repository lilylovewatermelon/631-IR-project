you know what you know what you know what yeah

verse
hey koolaid and frozen pizza
its a work of art i aint talking mona lisa
dream of rocking crowds see me filling up arenas
this weed got me laughing like a damn hyena
yeah i live a life pretty similar to yours
used to go to school hang with friends and play sports
every single summer taking trips to the shore
and that was all gravy but i knew i wanted more
aint ever seen a young rapper like moi
cant believe they eyes swear its just a mirage
still got my training wheels in the garage
but i aint gonna need those ima go hard go hard
so far ive done pretty well for myself
couple trophies on the shelf so what else
could i want that i dont have yet
well a little more cash and my own fast jet
so i can go anywhere anywhere anywhere anywhere
cali for the kush cause boy i know theres plenty there
bout to be in music stores everywhere but not yet
they cant understand my concept
ive been climbing up the great wall havent had a fall yet
these blogs gotta know im on next
clean conscience good samaritan
companies send me clothes so im wearing them
if you didnt know well im from the burgh
everything i drop recorded by big jerm
i smoke herb then i make music
i dont even talk about it boy i just do it
everybody got their own opinion the reasons why they feeling him
you must admit hes killing em running off adrenaline
waiting for the game to wanna let him in so open up
the boy a barrel of a smoking gun
whether im old or young the chosen one
i got a hundred billion flows to come
i hope you know the lyrics to every single song
so when im at a show everyone can sing along
my weed bag empty bottle at its last drop
im feeling like this could be my last shot
but many more songs to make cousin
so why the fuck you bugging haha
