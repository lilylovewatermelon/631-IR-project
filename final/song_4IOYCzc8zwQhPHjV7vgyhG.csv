cracks on its surface made it clear
that there’s warm water bubbling up from within
cracks on its surface made it clear
that there’s warm water bubbling up from within
cracks on its surface made it clear
that there’s warm water bubbling up from within
cracks on its surface made it clear
that there’s warm water bubbling up from within

chorus 1 yoko ono
snow is falling all the time
snow is smiling all the time
im ready im ready im ready to move on

verse 1 bleachers  grace dunham
cracks on its surface made it clear
that there was a war of honor bubbling up from within
they closed the parkway late last night
and as i sat with the echoes of the lies that i told
i felt young never changed by crooked hearts
so put your shotgun back in the glove
come on and wait another year for the dream far away
to come home to be brave

chorus 1 yoko ono
snow is falling all the time
snow is smiling all the time
im ready im ready im ready to move on
see bleachers liveget tickets as low as 52you might also likeverse 2 bleachers
they boarded up the windows and the doors to my house
no one will ever read the letters of the lies that i told
from the years i was changed by crooked hearts
why did they have to go and do us like that
why did they have to go and run from the dream far away
were we there was that brave

chorus 2 bleachers
to think everything must die
for anyone to matter
got to find any way to your wild heart
i will find any way to your wild heart

outro
i will find any way
now everything has changed and i cant tell what matters
i will find any way to your wild heartembed"
