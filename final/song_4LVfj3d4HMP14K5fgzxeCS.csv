im nothing special in fact im a bit of a bore
if i tell a joke youve probably heard it before
but i have a talent a wonderful thing
cause everyone listens when i start to sing
im so grateful and proud
all i want is to sing it out loud

chorus
so i say thank you for the music the songs im singing
thanks for all the joy theyre bringing
who can live without it i ask in all honesty
what would life be
without a song or a dance what are we
so i say thank you for the music for giving it to me

verse 2
mother says i was a dancer before i could walk
mhm she says i began to sing long before i could talk
and ive often wondered how did it all start
who found out that nothing can capture a heart
like a melody can
well whoever it was im a fan

chorus
so i say thank you for the music the songs im singing
thanks for all the joy theyre bringing
who can live without it i ask in all honesty
what would life be
without a song or a dance what are we
so i say thank you for the music for giving it to me
