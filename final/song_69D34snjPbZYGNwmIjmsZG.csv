verse 1 glc
my brother told me a long time ago
dont focus where you been g focus where you tryna go
i swear the game make you cold like abominable
snowman old man when you trying to shine like gold
when its my time to blow partner imma know
in the midst of getting dough i was hit with highs and lows
my melo tried to play me like my fucking eyes was closed
now im sittin here wishing that my guys didn’t know
they love a g so they despise a soul
what they gon’ do to him beyond my control
when the reaper calls its your time to go
never play a nigga when you see that he is trying to grow
im benny blanco when he knocked out carlito
and pachanga so im watching every angle
under the moonlight with the devil ive tangoed
church on the move like jesus in the manger
better control the money its better to control the anger
so now i watch a friend the way that i watch a stranger

verse 2 king chip
chillin rolling up something to change my feelin
thinkin about how i came up from nothing while i’m splittin
this cigarillo phone rings i get a call
one of my dogs tripping hard talkin about really killin them all
i say slow down slow down what the fuck you mean nigga
just ran in your crib and popped your daughter in the spleen
i’ll be there in 20 minutes but it only took fifteen
we wasn’t that tight but cool enough for me to hit the scene
not knowing this was all a set up secretly they want me wet up
jealous of my future cheddar however
they fastest move was too slow for me
i pulled up wasn’t no ambulance there wasn’t no police
something fishy going on naive kept pressing on
nine gripped thinking the killer could still be on the lawn
opened the front door they shot i shot someone dropped shit
the nigga with something to lose just almost lost it
wont trust him again
chorus nicole wray
do it again i’d never do it again
cuz this is the end this is the end
this is the end
i’d never do it again do it again
i’d never do it again
cuz this is the end this is the end
this is the end i’d never do it again

verse 3 kid cudi
cheese came through at 3
salute at ease c had supplied the weed
cause ibn had odd
its me with a black rockstar steeze
real rock tees 300 a pop for these
please bummy you don’t know me money
day  nite got flipped and i got blow for a grip
sipping on a heine with my jamieboo beside me
thats my fucking best friend
when im tweaking she be calming a brother
like the touch from a mother
i am so damn comfortable i never want to leave it
the feeling is something like a spiritual healer
that could end me i think that’s the part i find intriguing
a little bit off i am i am i am
i see that im caught i am i am i am
it’s something like a spiritual healer that could end me
i think thats the part i find intriguing im fiending
