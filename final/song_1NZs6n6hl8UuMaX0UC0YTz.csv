verse 1
they say im too young to love you
i dont know what i need
they think i dont understand

im churning out novels like
beat poetry on amphetamines

youre up im down
youre blind i see

im talking bout my newer nation

you never liked the way i said it
if you dont get it then forget
cause i dont have to fucking explain it

chorus
and my boyfriends in a band
he plays guitar while i sing lou reed
