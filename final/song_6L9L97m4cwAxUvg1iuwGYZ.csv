im not brave but i kept trying
im not strong enough but i kept going
with all the hardship i went knowing
that if i dont fight id forever be
moaning with pain
if i give up thats an automatic loss for me
and a win for my enemies cant let it be what
took a few knockouts to understand
the game now im ready for the ring
yo the title for the king
wearing armbands of sees
succeeds to be the state of no fear
fixed like a supreme team what
as we proceed no guarantees as we
take these footsteps to our destiny
who knows what happens
though we believe in the win
no space for doubts we believe in our team
unwelcome guests
disregarding requests
putting these enemies in forever unrestyou might also likeembed"
