i know ill do it again
i know were gonna collide
i know well call it the end
its always always a lie
you wear your heart on your sleeve
i wear my blood on my tie
but its only love underneath this disguise

prechorus
oh you left a hole in me
but i dont cut easily
im only just holding up on my knees
i think its time to open up
and i dont mean bleed

so turn it on
we can go wild if its what you want
fire at me

chorus
i cant bear to let you go
so keep on throwing your sticks and stones
id rather fight with you all night
than never have you in my life
i cant bear to let bear to let you go

its just a game

prechorus
oh you left a hole in me
but i dont cut easily
im only just holding up on my knees
i think its time to open up

so turn it on
we can go wild if its what you want

i cant bear to let bear to let you go
bridge
all i know is i love it when our shit blows
we keep turning red hot and stone cold
sweet burn inside
deals get broke
we fall in and fall out
were too close its dead love
until curtains close and we come alive

chorus
i cant bear to let you go
so keep on throwing your sticks and stones
id rather fight with you all night
than never have you in my life
i cant beart to let bear to let no

i cant bear to let you go
so keep on throwing your sticks and stones
id rather fight with you all night
than never have you in my life
i cant bear to let bear to let you go10embed"
