i gotta place my rearview when i pull in the parking spot
cause where im from all the young niggas die in the parking lot
get ten seconds on the news they barely talk about us
you gotta watch the way you move theyll make a target outcha
oh the reaper comin gotta keep it on me
i told my momma i wont leave her lonely
too much drama get these demons off me
we still at war i got that thing in arm reach
fuck what happened
thats what my momma told me when they caught me with a ratchet
rather see me in a cell than see me in a casket
i show love to all my fans cause i prevail through all this rapping whoa
i got homies that died young and i miss em tell the truth
i feel like i let em down and thats word to lil snupe
i put diamonds in yo face so when they see me they see you
know theyd kill me in my hood but i just keep on comin through
still wit it the graveyard throwing a party for all the real niggas
they invited me but shit i got a meal ticket
when everybody want me to get out we gotta deal wit it

prechorus
as i walk through the valley of the shadow of death
i did some things that i had to regret
i seen some things i could never forget
the reaper took my homies soul feel like he after me next oh lord

verse 2
grew up round them monsters theyll shoot you in your face
aint used to showin no love thats cause we grew up in that hate
live by the sword die by the sword way
tried to make it home they shot him in the hallway
tears on my face feel like i be cryin blood
momma wont see her son again we call that blind love
i cant trust these niggas theyll get you lined up
tried to rob me he got smoked for a rollie his times up
you gon be a killer or a homicide
make your momma shed a tear before my momma cry
was young and great but they still smoked him at the waffle spot
only god can judge me when i clutch and let that chopper rock brrr
feel this shit
i wrote this in blood this some of my realest shit
they say if he rich as fuck why he movin so militant
cause in my hood it aint no love and i know what im dealin wit

prechorus
as i walk through the valley of the shadows of death
i did some things that i had to regret
i seen some things i could never forget
the reaper took my homies soul feel like he after me next oh lord
chorus
i just wanna ball a hunnid summers
seen too many of my dogs goin under
how i made it out alive sometimes i wonder
cause we been goin to war since contra
