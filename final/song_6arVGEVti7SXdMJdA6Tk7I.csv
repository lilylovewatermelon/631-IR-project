the vampire in literature

a consideration of the vampire theme in literature must of necessity be somewhat eclectic if not even arbitrary in the selection of works which it reviews and with which it sets out to deal any exhaustive inquiry is wellnigh impossible and this not so much perhaps on account of the wealth of the material although indeed there is a far vaster field than might generally be supposed as owing to the very vague definition and indeterminate interpretation one is able to give to vampirism from a purely literary point of view it is the craft of an artist in the telling of ghoststories to see that his colours should not be too vivid and too clear and no mean skill is required to suggest without explanation to mass the shadows without derangement to be occult yet not to be obscure accordingly it would be a matter of extreme difficulty to differentiate the malignant and deathdealing spectre or it may be even corpse who returns to wreak his foul revenge from the vampireusing this latter word in its widest sense as one must employ it when speaking of literature a caution which here given as regards this chapter will serve once for all in such a story for example as dr m r james count magnus1 is the horrible revenant a ghost or a vampire the writer has left the point ambiguous it is of the very essence of his happy invention that he should do so and the deftly veiled incertitude adds to the loathly terror of the thing it will be readily remembered that the story relates how a traveller in sweden about the middle of the last century whilst staying near an ancient manor house in vestergothland obtains permission to examine the family papers and among these he comes upon the traces of a certain count magnus de la gardie who in the year 1600 had built the house or herrgård even after the lapse of two and a half centuries dark traditions are still lingering concerning this mysterious nobleman whose body lies in a richly ornate copper sarcophagus that stands the principal feature of a domed mausoleum at the eastern end of the church reluctantly the landlord tells a story which happened in the time of his grandfather ninetytwo years before two men determined to go at night and have a free hunt in the woods upon the estate they are warned no do not go we are sure you will meet with persons walking who should not be walking they should be resting not walking the two men laughed and cried the count is dead we do not care for him but in the night the villagers hear someone scream just as if the most inside part of his soul was twisted out of him then they hear a hideous laugh it was not one of those two men that laughed and indeed they have all of them said that it was not any man at all in the morning they go out with the priest and they find one of the men dead killed in so terrible a fashion that they buried him on the spot he was once a beautiful man but now his face was not there because the flesh of it was sucked away off the bones the other man is standing with his back against a tree pushing with his handspushing something away from him which was not there

there was some vague gossip that the count had been on the black pilgrimage and had brought something or someone back with him during his investigation of the papers the english traveller mr wraxall found a liber nigrae peregrinationis or at least a few lines of such a document indicating that the count had once journeyed to the city of chorazin and there adored the prince of the air in careless mood as he is passing near the mausoleum mr wraxall exclaims ah count magnus there you are i should dearly like to see you he is indiscreet enough to cry out thus flippantly on two further occasions and at last he is thoroughly alarmed by hearing the sound of metal hinges creaking and he knows that the sarcophagus is slowly opening wide in a state of frenzied fear he sets out for england the next day yet turn and double as he will he is everywhere haunted by two hideous figures a man in a long black cloak and a broadleafed hat and something in a dark cloak and hood upon landing at harwich he makes his way across country to a neighbouring village when on looking out of the carriage window he sees at a crossroad the two horrible creatures he finds a lodging but within the next fortyeight hours his pursuers fall upon him he is discovered dead and in the district it is still remembered how the jury that viewed the body fainted seven of em did and none of em wouldnt speak to what they see and the verdict was visitation of god and how the people as kep the ouse moved out that same week and went away from that part

this story may i think certainly be considered as vampire lore and although it must of course be perfectly familiar to all who delight in tales of the supernatural i have related it at some little length here partly because it is told so excellently well and partly because it so admirably fulfils and exemplifies the qualities that this kind of literature should possess it is brief and succinct although there are many details but every touch tells no ghost story should be of any length the horror and the awe evaporate with prolixity the ghost is malevolent and odious in fiction a helpful apparition is a notable weakness and the whole narrative becomes flabby to a degree the authentic note of horror is struck in the eerie suggestion which as we have noticed is of intent left illdefined nothing could be more crude than an explanation and it is this banality that often ruins a story which otherwise might be of the very first order

to review the traces of vampire legends which appear in sagas and which are in truth but few and unimportant seems to be outside our province here and even more foreign to our purpose would be the present examination of the vampire legend in folklore since this has already been dealt with in the course of the preceding chapters and to regard such traditions merely as literature would be not only to look at them from a wrong perspective but to misrepresent their quality and essentially to pervert their purpose

since some point must be chosen at which to consider vampirism in literature we may most fairly recall to mind the many academic and philosophical treatises upon the vampire which were rehearsed and discussed in german universities during the earlier part of the eighteenth century and these startling themes soon began to attract the attention of poets and literary men thus among the poems of heinrich august ossenfelder2 we have a short piece entitled der vampir which is as follows

mein liebes mägdchen glaubet
beständig steif und feste
an die gegebnen lehren
der immer frommen mutter
als völker an der theyse
an tödtliche vampiere
heyduckisch feste glauben
nun warte nur christianchen
du willst mich gar nich lieben
ich will mich an dir rächen
und heute in tockayer
zu einem vampir trinken
und wenn du sanfte schlummerst
von deinen schönen wangen
den frischen purpur saugen
alsdenn wirst du erschrecken
wenn ich dich werde küssen
und als ein vampir küssen
wann du dann recht erzitterst
und matt in meine arme
gleich einer todten sinkest
alsdenn will ich dich fragen
sind meine lehren besser
als deiner guten mutter
the poet wieland3 has a passing reference to the vampire

der jüngling aus den wolken
herab gefallen stumm und bleich
als hätt ein vampyr ihm die adern ausgemolken
steht ganz vernichtet von dem streich4

it would be an exaggeration to say that the vampire entered german literature with goethes famous ballad die braut von korinth but it would be difficult to overestimate the influence and the popularity of this piece the subject of which is directly derived from phlegon of tralles the young athenian who visits his fathers old friend to whose daughter he has been betrothed receives at midnight the vampire body of the girl whom death has prevented from becoming his bride and who declares

aus dem grabe werd ich ausgetrieben
noch zu suchen das vermifste gut
noch den schon verlornen mann zu lieben und zu saugen seines herzens blut
ists um den geschehn
muss nach andern gehn
und das junge volk erliegt der wut6

even more famous are the charnel horrors of bürgers lenore which was first printed in 1773 in the gottinger musenalmanach and which notwithstanding the legions of hostile comments and parodies whereof brandl gives an ample list6 has remained a household word

in spite of the immense enthusiasm at that date in contemporary england for german romantic literature it is remarkable that no translation of lenore was published here until 1796 when william taylor of norwich printed in the monthly review of march his rendering which in some respects must be called an adaptation he had however by his own account written the translation as early as 17907 and there can be no doubt that very shortly after its completion it was declaimed applauded and much discussed in norwich literary circles we know that mrs barbauld who visited edinburgh about the summer of 1793 or 17948 read aloud taylors version to a number of enthusiastic admirers this event was described to sir walter scott by miss cranstoun afterwards countess purgstall9 although scott himself mentions that his curiosity was first attracted to this truly romantic story by a gentleman who having heard lenore once read in manuscript could only recollect the general outline and part of a couplet which from the singularity of its structure and frequent recurrence10 had remained impressed on his memory11 this gentleman was mr cranstoun the brother of countess purgstall and so her statement is no doubt accurate as scott might well have received his account both from the brother as well as from the sister it was in the course of 1794 or at any rate early in the following year that scott made his own rendering of the ballad the account of taylors version ellenore which electrified the assembled company at dugald stewarts house when read by the famous anna letitia barbauld had given him the strongest desire to see the original just about this time however it was a difficult matter to procure books from the continent and it was not until after some delay that a copy of bürgers works was conveyed to him from hamburg he immediately devoured the german ballad and was so impressed that he forthwith set about englishing it i well recollect he writes that i began my task after supper and finished it about daybreak next morning12 scotts friends privately printed a few copies of the poem as a surprise for the author and as it went from hand to hand it met with the most flattering reception in 1796 besides the public issue of the translations from bürger by taylor and by scott no less than three other versions appeared from the several pens of w r spencer h j pye and j t stanley the translation by the last named author was given to the public in an édition de luxe at five shillings as well as in the ordinary edition of half a crown14 in 1797 a pasquil followed miss kitty a parody on lenora a ballad translated from the german by several hands whilst in the following year mrs taylor turned the popular poem into italian as a novella morale15 probably the most faithful if not the most spirited translation was that by the rev j beresford which was published in 1800

it was in 1797 that coleridge wrote the first part of christabel and german critics have somewhat superfluously endeavoured to emphasize herein the influence of lenore since upon examination it would hardly seem that such is present even in the smallest degree for example if the narrative of geraldine be carefully read16 it must be evident that the following judgment of professor brandl is without foundation this critic writes ihre vorgeschichte of geraldine schöpfte er grossentheils aus bürgers lenore in taylors uebersetzung die dame ist wenigstens ihrer erzählung nach auf einem windschnellen ross entführt und halbtodt vor furcht hier abgesetzt worden statt des schwarzen leichenzuges der lenoren auf ihrem ritt durch die mondnacht aufstiess will sie den schatten der nacht gekreuzt haben noch zittert das verdorrte blatt neben ihr wie aus herzenangst17

as we might expect the young shelley was enchanted by lenore and medwin relates how the poet long treasured cc a copy of the whole poem which he made with his own hand18 dowden tells the story how one christmas eve shelley dramatically related the bürger ballad with appropriate intonation and gesture working up the horror to such a height of fearful interest that the company fully expected to see wilhelm stalk into the parlour in his study of shelley charles middleton has remarked it is hinted somewhat plausibly that the leonora of bürgher first awakened his poetic faculty a tale of such beauty and terror might well have kindled his lively imagination but his earliest pieces written about this time and consisting only of a few ballads are deficient in elegance and originality and give no evidence whatever of the genius which soon after declared itself20 to suggest as zeiger would have it21 that lenore influenced the poem which in the romance st irvyne22 megalina inscribes on the wall of her prison and which commences

ghosts of the dead have i not heard your yelling
rise on the nightrolling breast of the blast   
is the merest ineptitude since these verses are taken almost word for word from lachin y gair in byrons hours of idleness and that had been published some four years previously23

as i have elsewhere shown in some detail shelleys two juvenile romances owe not only their inspiration but a great deal of their phrasing and noctivagations to charlotte dacres zofloya or the moor which appeared in 1806 and which as the poet himself declares quite enraptured him24 it is a very remarkable circumstance that in spite of the extremely plain hint which might profitably have been taken from such poems as die braut von korinth and lenore the novelists of the gothic school soaked though they were in german literature searching the earth and the depths of the earth for thrills and sensation of every kind do not seem to have utilized the tradition of the vampire it is a puzzle indeed if we ask how it was that such writers as monk lewis apollos sexton who would fain make parnassus a churchyard25 and charles robert maturin who as he himself confessed loved bells rung by viewless hands daggers encrusted with long shed blood treacherous doors behind still more treacherous tapestry mad nuns apparitions26 et hoc genus omne the two lords of macabre romance should neither of them have sent some hideous vampire ghost ravening through their sepulchral pages in the gothic romance we have horror heaped on horrors head mouldering abbeys haunted castles banditti illuminati sorcerers conspirators murderous monks and phantom friars apparitions without number until the despairing reviewers cried aloud surely the misses themselves must be tired of so many stories of ghosts and murders we have such titles as the famous horrid mysteries the midnight groan the abbot of montserrat or the pool of blood the demon of venice the convent spectre the hag of the mountains27 and a hundred such lurid nomenclatures but until we come to polidoris novel which will be considered later nowhere so far as i am aware do we meet with the vampire in the realm of gothic fancy so vast however is this fascinating library and so difficult to procure are these novels of a century and a quarter ago that i hesitate sweepingly to assert that this theme was entirely unexploited there may be some romance which i have not had the good fortune to find where a hideous vampire swoops down upon his victims but if such be the case i am at least prepared to say that the vampire was not generally known to gothic lore and had his presence made itself felt in the sombre chapters of one votary of this school i think he would have reappeared on many occasions for the writers were as accustomed to convey from one another with an easy assurance as they were wont deftly to plunder the foreign mines inevitably one of the band t j horseley carties francis lathom william herbert edward montague mrs roche eliza parsons miss m hamilton mrs helme mrs meeke isabella kelley and many another beside insatiably agog for horrid phantasmagoria would have utilized the vampire in some funereal episode

one might even have supposed that the notes to southeys thalaba the destroyer28 must have put them on the track and surely stanzas eight nine and ten in book viii could not have passed unnoticed

a night of darkness and of storms
into the chamber of the tomb
thalaba led the old man
to roof him from the rain
a night of storms the wind
swept through the moonless sky
and moand among the pillard sepulchres
and in the pauses if its sweep
they heard the heavy rain
beat on the monument above
in silence on oneizas grave
her father and her husband sate
the cryer from the minaret
proclaimd the midnight hour
now now cried thalaba
and oer the chamber of the tomb
there spread a lurid gleam
like the reflection of a sulphur fire
and in that hideous light
oneiza stood before them it was she   
her very lineaments    and such as death
had changed them livid cheeks and lips of blue
but in her eye there dwelt
brightness more terrible
than all the loathsomeness of death
still art thou living wretch 
in hollow tones she cried to thalaba
and must i nightly leave my grave
to tell thee still in vain
god hath abandoned thee
this is not she the old man exclaimd
a fiend a manifest fiend
and to the youth he held his lance
strike and deliver thyself
strike her cried thalaba
and palsied of all power
gazed fixedly upon the dreadful form
yea strike her cried a voice whose tones
flowd with such a sudden healing through his soul
as when the desert shower
from death deliverd him
but obedient to that wellknown voice
his eye was seeking it
when moath firm of heart
perform d the bidding through the vampire corpse
he thrust his lance it fell
and howling with the wound
its fiendish tenant fled
a sapphire light fell on them
and garmented with glory in their sight
oneizas spirit stood

it is important to remark that in his notes29 upon this passage southey cites at considerable length various cases of vampirism particularly from the lettres juives the vampires of gradisch also the history of arnold paul and the very ample account given by tournefort he further says the turks have an opinion that men that are buried have a sort of life in their graves if any man makes affidavit before a judge that he heard a noise in a mans grave he ie the body is by order dug up and chopped all too pieces the merchants at constantinople once airing on horseback had as usual for protection a janisary with them passing by the burying place of the jews it happened that an old jew sat by a sepulchre the janisary rode up to him and rated him for stinking the world a second time and commanded him to get into his grave againroger norths life of sir dudley north30

it might perhaps not unfairly be argued that the two notorious romances of the marquis de sade justine on les malheurs de la vertu and juliette depict scenes of vampirism and if we are to take the word in any extended sense this is certainly the case in the first place it must be remembered that as it passed through various editionsit was first issued in 1791 2 vols 8vountil it appeared in its final and complete form in 1797 as la nouvelle justine on les malheurs de la vertu suivie de lhistoire de juliette sa soeur 10 vols 18mo of which justine occupies four and juliette six justine was added to and augmented until the last version is practically double the length of the first and the book has been entirely rewritten in justine we have the episodes in the house of monsieur rodin and more particularly the orgies of the comte de gernade who takes a lustful pleasure in watching the blood flow from the veins of his victims as also the cruelties of the monster roland all of which may well be esteemed vampirism many similar scenes are described with great prolixity in juliette and this romance is distinguished by such horrible figures as the muscovite giant minski whose favourite meat is human flesh and in whose castle the table and chairs are made of bleaching bones and cordelli the necrophilist of ancona

in the new monthly magazine31 1 april 1819 was published the vampyre a tale by lord byron which although it may seem to ussteeped in le fanu and m r jamesa little oldfashioned at the time created an immense sensation and had the most extraordinary influence being even more admired and imitated on the continent than in england it was almost immediately known that actually the story did not come from the pen of lord byron but had been written by dr john william polidori physiciancompanion to the poet byron had as a matter of fact been writing a work of the same title in imitation of mrs shelleys frankenstein but he denied the authorship of this piece in the famous letter facsimilied in galignanis edition of his works a first printed the vampyre forms a part of extracts from a letter from geneva with anecdotes of lord byron here is to be read that among other things which the lady from whom i procured these anecdotes related to me she mentioned the outline of a ghost story by lord byron it appears that one evening lord byron mr p b shelley the two ladies and the gentleman the daughters of godwin and dr polidori before alluded to after having perused a german work which was entitled phantasmagoriana32 began relating ghost stories when his lordship having recited the beginning of christabel then unpublished the whole took so strong a hold of mr shelleys mind that he suddenly started up and ran out of the room the physician and lord byron followed and discovered him leaning against a mantlepiece with cold drops of perspiration trickling down his face after having given him something to refresh him upon enquiring into the cause of his alarm they found that his wild imagination having pictured to him the bosom of one of the ladies with eyes which was reported of a lady in the neighbourhood where he lived he was obliged to leave the room in order to destroy the impression it was afterwards proposed in the course of conversation that each of the company present should write a tale depending upon some supernatural agency which was undertaken by lord byron the physician and miss m godwin my friend the lady above referred to had in her possession the outline of each of these stories i obtained them as a great favour and herewith forward them to you as i was assured you would feel as much curiosity as myself to peruse the ébauches of so great a genius and those immediately under his influence upon this the editor has the following note we have in our possession the tale of dr  as well as the outline of that of miss godwin the latter has already appeared under the title of frankenstein or the modern prometheus the former however upon consulting this author we may probably hereafter give to our readers

the vampyre is introduced by several paragraphs which deal with the tradition this preamble commences the superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the east among the arabians it appears to be common it did not however extend itself to the greeks until after the establishment of christianity and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the latin and greek churches at which time the idea becoming prevalent that a latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory it gradually increased and formed the subject of many wonderful stories still extant of the dead rising from their graves and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful in the west it spread with some slight variation all over hungary poland austria and lorraine where the belief existed that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims who became emaciated lost their strength and speedily died of consumptions whilst these human bloodsuckers fattenedand their veins became distended to such a state of repletion as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies and even from the very pores of their skins

the editor then recounts the famous instance of arnold paul and continues we have related this monstrous rodomontade because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance we could adduce in many parts of greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence that the deceased is doomed to vampyrise but be compelled to confine his visitations solely to those beings he loved most while on earththose to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection this supposition is we imagine alluded to in the following fearfully sublime and prophetic curse from the giaour32

but first on earth as vampyre sent
thy corse shall from its tomb be rent
then ghastly haunt thy native place
and suck the blood of all thy race
there from thy daughter sister wife p 283
at midnight drain the stream of life
yet loathe the banquet which perforce
must feed thy livid living corse
thy victims ere they yet expire
shall know the demon for their sire
as cursing thee thou cursing them
thy flowers are withered on the stem
but one that for thy crime must fall
the youngest best beloved of all
shall bless thee with a fathers name
that word shall wrap thy heart in flame
yet thou must end thy task and mark
her checks last tingeher eyes last spark
and the last glassy glance must view
which freezes oer its lifeless blue
then with unhallowed hand shall tear
the tresses of her yellow hair
of which in life a lock when shorn
affections fondest pledge was worn
but now is borne away by thee
memorial o thine agony
yet with thine own best blood shall drip
thy gnashing tooth and haggard lip
then stalking to thy sullen grave
goand with ghouls and afrits rave
till these in horror shrink away
from spectre more accursed than they

after an allusion to southeys thalaba tourneforts travels and dom calmets classical work the editor concludes we could add many curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition and we may perhaps resume our observations upon it at some future opportunity for the present we feel that we have very far exceeded the limits of a note necessarily devoted to the explanation of the strange production to which we now invite the attention of our readers and we shall therefore conclude by merely remarking that though the term vampyre is the one in most general acceptation there are several other synonimous with it which are made use of in various parts of the world namely vroucolocha vardoulacha goul broucoloka c

the story tells how at the height of a london season there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman more remarkable for his singularities than his rank he gazed upon the mirth around him as if he could not participate therein apparently the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention that he might by a look quell it and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned those who felt this sensation of awe could not explain whence it arose some attributed it to the dead grey eye which fixing upon the objects face did not seem to penetrate and at one glance to pierce through to the inward working of the heart but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass this original is invited to every house and in the course of the winter he meets a young gentleman of the name of aubrey he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth by parents who died while he was yet in childhood aubrey is greatly fascinated by lord ruthven for this is the name of the mysterious nobleman and intending to travel upon the continent he mentions this intention to my lord and is surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him flattered by such a mark of esteem from him who apparently had nothing in common with other men he gladly accepted it and in a few days they had passed the circling waters

as they travelled from town to town aubrey notices the peculiar conduct of his companion who bestows largess upon the most worthless characters broken gamblers and the like but refuses a doit to the deserving and virtuous poor however the recipients of this charity inevitably found that there was a curse upon it for they all were either led to the scaffold or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery eventually the travellers arrive at rome and here aubrey receives letters from his guardians who require him immediately to leave his companion as since their departure from london the most terrible scandals adulteries and seductions have come to light at rome aubrey is able to foil lord ruthvens plans frustrating an intrigue designed to ruin a heedless young girl and then he directed his steps towards greece and crossing the peninsula soon found himself at athens here he lodges in the house of a greek whose daughter ianthe is a paragon of the most exquisite beauty as he sketches the ruins of the city she is wont to entertain him with greek legend and tradition and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre who had passed years amidst his friends and dearest ties forced every year by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months his blood would run cold whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies but ianthe cited to him the names of old men who had at last detected one living among themselves after several of their relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiends appetite and when she found him so incredulous she begged of him to believe her for it had been remarked that those who had dared to question their existence always had some proof given which obliged them with grief and heartbreaking to confess it was true she detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters and his horror was increased by hearing a pretty accurate description of lord ruthven he however still persisted in persuading her that there could be no truth in her fears though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of lord ruthven

before long it becomes evident that aubrey is in love with ianthe and while he ridicules the idea of a young man of english habits marrying an uneducated greek girl still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him he endeavours to occupy his time with antiquarian excursions which lead him farther and farther afield and at length he determines to proceed to a point beyond any he has as yet visited when ianthes parents hear the name of the place he proposes to visit they most earnestly implore him on no account to return when once dusk has fallen as he must necessarily pass through a wood where no greek would ever remain after the day had closed upon any consideration they described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path aubrey made light of their representations and tried to laugh them out of the idea but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze he was silent

having given his promise to ianthe that he will be back well before evening he sets out very early the exploration however takes longer than he has supposed and when he turns his horse homeward the darkness is already hurrying on urged by a terrific storm the steed alarmed at the battle of the elements dashes off at breakneck pace and only halts trembling and tired before a distant hovel in the heart of a solitary wood as he approached the thunder for a moment silent allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stiffled exultant mockery of a laugh continued in one almost unbroken sound with a terrific effort aubrey burst open the door and rushing into the darkness found himself in contact with someone whom he immediately seized when a voice cried again baffled to which a loud laugh succeeded and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman determined to sell his life as dearly as he could he struggled but it was in vain he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground his enemy threw himself upon him and kneeling upon his breast had placed his hand upon his throat when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day disturbed himhe instantly rose and leaving his prey rushed through the door and in a moment the crashing of the branches as he broke through the wood was not longer heard several peasants now hastened into the hut bearing flambeaus which illuminate the scene and to the horror of all there is discovered hard by the lifeless body of ianthe a curious dagger lies near but her death was not the result of a blow from this weapon there was no colour upon her cheek not even upon her lip yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt thereupon her neck and breast was blood and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the veinto this the men pointed crying simultaneously struck with horror a vampyre a vampyre it appears that ianthe had followed the traveller to watch over his safety aubrey is carried back to the city in a raging fever and the parents of the unfortunate girl die brokenhearted owing to so terrible a loss

whilst aubrey lies ill lord ruthven arrives in athens and establishing himself in the same house nurses the invalid with such care that past differences are forgotten since aubrey not only becomes reconciled to his presence but even seeks his company together they travel into the wildest interior of greece and here in some mountain pass they are attacked by brigands from whose guns lord ruthven receives a shot in the shoulder his strength strangely decreasing a couple of days later it is plain to all that he is at the point of death he now exacts a terrific oath that his companion shall conceal all that is known of him and that the news of his death shall not be allowed to reach england swear cried the dying man swear by all your soul reveres by all your nature fears swear that for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way whatever may happen or whatever you may see aubrey binds himself most solemnly by the prescribed oath and in a paroxysm of hideous laughter ruthven expires

according to a promise which has been obtained from the robbers by a heavy bribe the body was conveyed to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon which rose after his death aubrey insists that it shall be interred in the ordinary way but when he is conducted to the place it is found that the body has disappeared and in spite of the protestations of the band he is convinced that they have buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes one circumstance however gives aubrey much food for thought among the effects of the deceased he discovered a sheath of most curious pattern and make which exactly fits the dagger that had been found in the deserted hut upon the occasion of ianthes death

returning to england as he retraces his journey through rome to his horror aubrey discovers that in spite of the precautions he had so carefully taken lord ruthven succeeded only too well in his bad designs and now there is bitter sorrow and distress where once reigned peace and happiness the lady had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship and aubrey instinctively divines that she has fallen a victim to the destroyer of ianthe

upon his arrival in london the traveller is greeted by his sister whose presentation into society had been delayed until her brothers return from the continent when he might be her protector it was now therefore resolved that the next drawing room which was fast approaching should be the epoch of her entry into the busy scene upon this gay occasion the crowd was excessive and as aubrey heedless and distracted is watching the gay throng a voice which he recognizes only too well whispers in this ear remember

p 288

your oath turning he sees lord ruthven standing near him a few nights later at the assembly of a near relation among the crowd of admirers by whom his sister is surroundedthe most prominent of the thronghe again perceives the mysterious and horrible figure hurrying forward he seizes his sisters arm and requests her immediately to accompany him home however before they have had time to retire again does the voice whisper close to him remember your oath

aubrey now becomes almost distracted he sees no remedy against a monster who has already once mocked at death even if he were to declare all that he knew it is probable that he would hardly be believed whenever he attends a social gathering his looks as he scans the company become so suspicious and strange that he soon acquires a reputation for great eccentricity as the months go on his loathing and his fears drive him wellnigh to madness so that eventually a physician is engaged to reside in the house and take charge of him he is a little consoled by the thought that when the year and the day have passed he will at least be able to unburden his mind and be at any rate freed from his terrible oath it so happens that he overhears a conversation between the doctor and one of his guardians who enlarges upon the melancholy circumstance of her brother being in so critical a state when miss aubrey is to be married on the following day he instantly demands the name of the bridegroom and is told the earl of marsden he requests to see his sister and in an hour or two she visits him as they are conversing she opens a locket and shows him a miniature of the man who has won her affections to his horror he perceives that it is a portrait of lord ruthven and falling into convulsions of rage he tramples it under foot in twentyfour hours the period of his oath will have expired and he implores them to delay the wedding at least for that time since there seems no good reason for doing this the request is disregarded upon which aubrey falls into so sad a state of utter depression succeeded by an outburst of fury that the physician concludes him to be not far removed from lunacy and doubles the restraint during the night the busy preparations for the nuptial are ceaselessly continued it appears that upon the pretext of being her brothers dearest friend and travelling

companion lord ruthven had visited the house to inquire after aubrey during his supposed derangement and from the character of a visitor gradually insinuated himself into that of an accepted suitor when the bridal party has assembled aubrey neglected by the servants contrives to make his way into the public apartments which are decorated for the nuptials ere he can utter a cry he is however at once perceived by lord ruthven who with more than human strength thrusts him speechless with rage from the room at the same time whispering in his ear remember your oath and know if not my bride today your sister is dishonoured women are frail the attendants at once secure the unhappy man but he can no longer support his distress in his agonies a blood vessel breaks and he is incontinently conveyed to bed this sad accident is kept from his sister the marriage was solemnized and the bride and bridegroom left london

aubreys weakness increased the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death he desired his sisters guardians might be called and when the midnight hour had struck he related composedly what the reader has perusedhe died immediately after

the guardians hastened to protect miss aubrey but when they arrived it was too late lord ruthven had disappeared and aubreys sister had glutted the thirst of a vampyre

it were not easy to overestimate the astounding sensation which was caused by this story and the narrative is certainly not without considerable merit for in places the eerie atmosphere is well conveyed nor is it difficult to understand the extraordinary influence of the tale since it introduced a tradition which had been long forgotten and which promised infinite possibilities in the way of that sensation and melodramatic calentures which the period craved the first separate edition of the vampyre appeared in 1819 and was published by sherwood the first issue of this which is now very rare contains a certain amount of preliminary matter concerning the shelleys byron and godwin this was omitted in later issues and accordingly one often finds that copies of the vampyre are described as first edition which is strictly quite correct although they are the second issue

p 290

and naturally of far less value in a bibliographers eyes a large number of reprints increased with amazing rapidity and in the same year the novel was translated into french by henri faber le vampire nouvelle traduite de langlais de lord byron paris 1819 in february 1820 there followed under the aegis of charles nodier a very obvious imitation or rather continuation by cyprien bérard lord ruthwen ou les vampires roman de c b publié par lauteur de jean sbogar et de thérèse aubert34 paris 1820 in 1825 a new translation of polidoris story was given by eusèbe de salles nor was germany behind hand for the vampyre was first translated in 1819 der vampyr eine erzahlung aus dem englischen des lord byron nebst einer schilderung seines aufenthaltes in mytilene leipzig 1819 in the following year there appeared at frankfort a version by j v adrian of byrons poems and prose wherein was included der blutsuger in a collection of byrons work the first volume of which was published at zwickau in 1821 the vampyre again found a place in volume v 1821 translated by christian karl meifsner as der vampyr the tale has also been included in various other continental collections and translations of byrons work even until a recent date

yet it was wellknown all the while that polidori was the author of the story but as byrons was by far the greater name so this sensational novella must be attributed to the cavaliero whose romantic adventures and the scandal of whose amours were thrilling the whole of europe writing in the same year as the great poets death amédée pichot of the university of marseilles in his essai sur le génie et le caractère de lord byron35 declared that this spurious issue a autant contribué à faire connaître le nom de lord byron en france que ses poëmes les plus estimés publishers insisted upon le vampire nouvelle being included among byrons works and it is said that ladvocat was furious when it was represented to him that since it was openly acknowledged that polidori had written the vampire the translation should properly be no longer given among the poets work nor put forth under his name

as might have been expected it was not long before the vampire appeared upon the stage and the first play of this kind would seem to be the famous melodrama by charles

the dialogue of this melodrama is spirited the situations striking and well managed and even in reading the play one can clearly visualize that upon the stage it must have been extraordinarily effective especially when set off with all the attractions of the scene painters glowing perspectives the magic craft of the subtle machinist and the richest adornment of romantic costume37 even before he had introduced the vampire on to the boards nodier had prophesied that this macabre monster would win a veritable triumph and his prediction was amply fulfilled le vampire épouvantera de son horrible amour les songes de toutes les femmes et bientôt sans doute ce monstre encore exhumé prêtera son masque immobile sa voix sépulcrale son oeil dun gris mort    tout cet attirail de mélodrame à la melpomène des boulevards et quel succès alors ne lui est pas réservé38 on 1st july 1819 writing in the drapeau blanc he was far more serious and far more emphatic la fable du vampire est peutêtre la plus universelle de nos superstitions   elle a partout lautorité de la tradition elle ne manque ni de celle de la théologie ni do celle de la médicine la philosophie même en a parlé

all paris flocked to see le vampire and nightly the portesaintmartin was packed to the doors philippe and madame dorval were applauded to the echo by enthusiastic audiences who recalled them again and again after the final tableau even the book of the play had an immense circulation and every morning barbas counter was freshly stocked with huge piles of the duodecimo which rapidly diminished during the day

not a few critics however adopted a very uncompromising attitude and were unsparing in their condemnation of so popular a melodrama in les lettres normandes 1820 tome xi p 93 le vampire was thus noticed le mélodrame du vampire dans lequel on voit paraître un monstre

p 294

qui suce le sang des petites filles et qui offre des tableaux quune honnête femme ne pout voir sans rougir est louvrage de mm ch nodier rédacteur du drapeau blanc achille jouffroy rédacteur de la gazette et auteur des festes de lanarchie et carmouche autre rédacteur du drapeau blanc this censure is however wholly inspired by political feeling which thus inveighed against the royalist nodier and which not unmingled with green jealousy we also find prominent in the conservateur littéraire of april 1820 tome ii p 245 where we had pour balancer le succès du vampire mélodrame dégoûtant et si monstreux que les auteurs mm ch nodier et carmouche mont pas osé se faire connaître le théâtre de la portesaintmartin se prépare à représenter la traduction littérale en prose de la marie stuart de schiller

yet another critic is even more trenchant and severe le vampire ruthwen veut violer ou sucer dans les coulisses une jeune fiancée qui fuit devant lui sur le théâtre cette situation estelle morale    toute la pièce représente indirectement dieu comme un être faible ou odieux qui abandonne le monde aux génies de lenfer39

yet all these attacks served but to enhance the attraction and it is remarkable for how many years this continued undiminished in 1823 a revival of le vampire with philippe and madame dorval again thronged the portesaintmartin to excess alexandre dumas who was present at this production has recorded how vast was his delight how ineffable his thrills during the sombre scenes of this sepulchral melodrame how the theatre applauded the lean livid mask of the vampire how it shuddered at his stealthy steps there are perhaps to be found throughout the whole of the many works of alexandre dumas few pages more entertaining than those chapters in his memoires which relate with rarest humour and not a few flashes of brilliant wit his adventures at a performance of le vampire at the portesaintmartin in 1823 it would be difficult to find a livelier and yet at the same time entirely serious and even critical account of a theatrical performance unfortunately it is too long to give in full in the edition of mes mémoires troisième série michel lévy paris 1863 it occupies no less than five chapters lxxiiilxxvii and these are none of the shortest pp 136193 one is tempted to quote some delicious passages but the

p 295

account might lose thereby it must be read as a delightful whole yet there is one extract which may certainly be made without impertinence the story of the vampire which was related to dumas by his neighbour le monsieur poli qui lisait un elzévir they have discussed the tradition at some length and incidentally the good bibliophile refers his young acquaintance to the work of dom calmet from whom he gives ample citations he further remarks that he has resided in illyria for three years and he very sharply animadverts upon certain details on nodiers melodrama which are foreign to the vampire tradition you speak of vampires as though they really existed remarks dumas of course they exist said his neighbour dryly have you ever seen one then most certainly i have that was whilst you were in illyria yes

nearly thirty years after dumas in collaboration with maquet utilized the theme of le vampire for his own drama of the same name which was given at the ambigucomique 20th december 1851 and which may conveniently be considered here

le vampire is described as a drame fantastique en cinq actes en dix tableaux and there are very many characters in this remarkable play the principal parts were taken as follows lord ruthwen m arnault gilbert de tiffauges m goujet juan rozo a spanish innkeeper m coquet

p 298

botaro his soninlaw m curcy lazare m laurent lahennée m thierry jarwick m lavergne the ghoul mme lucie mabire hélène de tiffauges mile jane essler juana mile marie clarisse antonia mlle daroux petra rozos daughter mile heloïse and the mystic fairy mélusine mlle isabelle constant lazare is a capital character but the intrusion from oriental legend of the ghoul cannot be considered happy on the other hand the appearance of mélusine whose legend was collected about the end of the fourteenth century by jean darras is certainly effective and entirely in keeping with the history since according to paracelsus she was an occult power and in folk lore she is often represented as protecting ancient housesin belgium she is the guardian of the old family de gavrewhilst one of her four sons became king of brittany

it is hardly necessary to do more than give the very briefest outline of the story as dumas tells it the play opens with a crowded scene of merrymakers in the patio of juan rozos inn they are celebrating the nuptials of his daughter with young botaro and every room is occupied by his friends and acquaintance in festive mood juana who is staying at the hostlery seeks for a guide to the castle of tormenar which lies at some little distance for there she is to meet don luis de figuerroa whom she will wed upon the following day she has secretly left the convent of annunciades where she was a boarder since her father has other designs for her hand and accordingly it is necessary that she should meet her betrothed in some lonely spot but nobody not even the goodnatured lazare the servant of the inn will conduct her to the haunted castle un château qui est en ruine un château qui ne loge que des reptiles et qui nhéberge que des fantômes however a numerous company amongst whom is gilbert de tiffauges arrives at the inn and these travellers on being told that they cannot be accommodated in spite of the fact that night is falling incontinently resolve to take up their quarters in tormenar so in spite of the warnings about ghosts and goblins having once well stocked themselves with wine and food they merrily set forth gilbert taking charge of juana who has confided to him her story however a mysterious figure a lady apparently of rank who has been staying at the inn watches them as they take

p 299

their departure and mutters to herself as she fixes her gaze upon juana il te faut deux heures pour aller retrouver ton beau fiancé    je laurai joint dans trois minutes she is in fact the ghoul a female vampire and with the speed of lightning she has gone to destroy the unfortunate don luis

in the second act we see the huge gothic hall of the old castle a door opens and from an inner chamber the ghoul rushes out exclaiming il était jeune il était beau    me voilà redevenue jeune et belle the voice of gilbert is now heard and with the cry à lan prochain gilbert she disappears from sight it will be remarked that in his treatment of the vampire tradition dumas has adopted the legend that the vampire must year by year rejuvenate his waning forces by absorbing the life of another and sucking from anothers veins fresh blood a detail which although it may recommend itself to and legitimately be used by the dramatist and the writer of romances is actually inexact and but rarely to be met with and only then in folklore not of the first value the travellers no small party spread their provisions upon the huge tables in the old hall and laughing at the stories of ghosts and apparitions are soon in convivial mood the conversation however eventually turns on the supernatural and gilbert tells of his old home in brittany where one room in the castle is hung with the tapestry of the fairy mélusine representing this lady and all her attendants the story goes that if any of the family sleeps in that room she will descend from the tapestry and reveal his fortune warning him of danger should such threaten another companion who has sojourned in epirus speaks of the vampires the women who will attack men and leave them dead and sapless the men who will attack women to drink their blood just as the words are uttered lord ruthwen enters and announces himself as a belated traveller who finding no room at rozos inn down in the village has made his way thitherhe has even taken lazare into his service presently the company disperse to their several rooms to make themselves as comfortable as may be for the night in such difficult circumstances to his horror gilbert discovers in the chamber he is to occupy the body of a young man strangely pale with a slight wound in the throat by a letter he finds near upon the body it is plain that this can be none other

p 300

than the unfortunate don luis at the same moment a piercing cry is heard and juana ghostly pale and dying totters from her room gilbert rushes to her assistance just in time to see lord ruthwen dart out after her as she falls dead at his feet in a moment he has drawn his sword and strikes ruthwen to the heart before he recognizes who it may be in faltering accents ruthwen explains that hearing a cry he has gone to the assistance of the lady and with his last breath he implores gilbert who is wellnigh distracted at the unhappy accident to bear his body to the hillside where it may be bathed in the earliest rays of the new moon this gilbert promises and in the final tableau we see the body of lord ruthwen laid upon the mountain the moon slowly issues from the clouds and as its silver light falls upon the corpse it seems as though the eyes opened and the mouth smiled a moment more and the vampire leaps to his feet revitalized and with fresh energy for some new demoniac enterprise

in act iii we find ourselves in brittany about a year later at the château de tiffauges where hélène awaits her brothers return after an affectionate greeting he confides to her the secret of his love for antonia a lady of spalatro in dalmatia and she in her turn informs him that she is about to give her hand to the baron de marsden this latter proves to be none other than lord ruthwen who informs gilbert that he was sore wounded indeed at tormenar but that certain kindly shepherds finding him on the mountain side nursed him back to life moreover he explains his change of name by informing them that his elder brother having recently died he has succeeded to the title and estates visiting tiffauges in the hope of meeting gilbert once more he has fallen a victim to the charms of hélène the explanation is cleverly contrived but at the same time gilbert is hardly convinced he feels that there is some mysterious and terrible secret lurking in the background a happy idea strikes him he will sleep that night in the tapestry chamber of the lady mélusine the scene that follows must have been extraordinarily effective upon the stage gilbert is slumbering and from their places in the tapestry step forth mélusine and her court to warn the scion of her house that danger is near from the framed canvas and the panels descend with stately stride

p 301

the old barons to tell their descendant of the horror that encompasses him mélusine reveals the secret

prions pour qu à gilbert dieu toutpuissant inspire un généreux effort
ruthwen est un démon ruthwen est un vampire son amour cest la mort

one cannot but recall the famous scene in gilbert and sullivans ruddigore with its subtle admixture of beauty fantasy and humour

in act iv of le vampire we are shown the accomplishment of ruthwens designs against hélène gilberts frenzied warnings and denunciations are heard with alarm but with unbelief they whisper that he is a lunatic and when ruthwen relates a cunning story of a mischance in spain which temporarily unsettled gilberts reason a story that seems borne out in every detail by the unhappy brothers horror and despair the attendants for his own safety seek to restrain their young master ruthwen triumphs but now the ghoul appears and bids him take heed how he seeks gilberts life for that is hers and she will not likely relinquish her prey ruthwen defies her and the two vampires part in horrid enmity lazare cautions hélène that her brothers story is no figment but it is too late the vampire seizes his victim and as midnight strikes he destroys his hapless bride and quaffs his fill from her veins too late gilbert succeeds in forcing an entrance there is a terrific struggle and ruthwen is hurled from the window into the depths of a tremendous valley

in the last act we find that in order to escape the pursuit of ruthwen who has extricated himself unhurt but filled with designs of even more malignant vengeance gilbert has transported antonia to circassia here however we meet the ghoul who disguising herself under the name of ziska obtained admittance to the castle in the quality of an attendant upon antonia she informs gilbert that she alone can save his betrothed from the vampire and at that moment the ghastly face of ruthwen is actually seen peering through the window she demands that he shall relinquish antonias hand and accept her love though it be to death he refuses to betray antonia and at length by a supreme act of renunciation she divulges the secret whereby the vampire may be annihilated although this revelation must put an end to her own

p 302

existence ziska explains how gilberts sword is to be blessed by a priest with a certain occult formula and if the weapon thus consecrated be driven through the vampires heart it will once and for all rid the world of this infernal pest yet as she speaks she seems to vanish in flames and they hear her last sad sigh adieu pour ce monde adieu pour lautre adieu pour léternité

the final scene is a deserted cemetery tombes cyprès fond sombre et fantastique neige sur la terre lune rouge au ciel the vampire lies half in and half out of his grave grinning hideously gilbert is standing near pour la dernière fois adore dieu he adjures non yells the monster alors desespère et meurs cries gilbert and plunges the hallowed sword into the monsters heart the vampire falls back into the grave howling fearfully and a heavy stone closing him in fast seals him there in the womb of the earth for ever and ever au nom du seigneur ruthwen je to scelle dans cette tombe pour léternité et gilbert trace sur la pierre une croix que devient lumineuse a great aureola fills the sky and multitudes of rejoicing angels are seen among them are hélène and juana smiling in happiest benison whilst there rises from the earth the body of ziska radiant and beautiful to join the glorious throng among whose immortal ranks she is enrolled by the merits of her great act of renunciation and unselfish love

this drama of dumas is infinitely more elaborate than the play of nodier but i am not altogether certain whether it is in some respects so good a work the first two acts attain a high level the scene in the tapestry chamber would be most picturesque upon the stage there are several other telling situations and effective speeches but as a whole it is too prolix and we feel that the episode of antonia in particular is an anticlimax nor as i have remarked before although material use is made of the character can one consider the figure of the ghoul entirely in keeping with the rest had the level of the opening scenes been maintained we should possess an excellent piece of work but without concentration and compression that was hardly possible and here we have the secret of nodiers success although he has an occasional crudity it may be which dumas might not have tolerated so swift is his action as is essential to

p 303

melodrama so cleverly does he engage the interest of his audience that we have no time to criticize a roughness here and there but are rather intent to follow the next turn of the tale

immediately upon the furore created by nodiers le vampire at the portesaintmartin in 1819 vampire plays of every kind from the most luridly sensational to the most farcically ridiculous pressed on to the boards a contemporary critic cries there is not a theatre in paris without its vampire at the portesaintmartin we have le vampire at the vaudeville le vampire again at the variétés les trois vampires ou le clair de la lune

jean larat41 further mentions a play by paul féval le fils vampire the version by john wilson ross of the loves of paris a romance published by g vickers 3 catherine street strand 1846 is said to be translated from the french of paul féval author of the vampire the loves of the palaisroyal the receipt at midnight stella the son of the devil etc etc but it does not appear whether the vampire mentioned here is a play or a romance probably it is the latter but no such translation is known

le vampire which was produced at the vaudeville 15 june 182042 is a comédicvaudeville in one act by scribe and mélesville the scene is laid hungary une salle dun chateau gothique and the characters are as follows le comte de valberg feldmaréchal m guillemin adolphe de valberg son néveu m isambert le baron do lourdorff m fontenay saussmann concierge du chateau m hippolyte charles valet du comte m fichet un notaire m justin hermance de mansfred madame rivière nancy sa soeur madame lucie péters filleul de saussmann madame minette with attendance of domestics and wedding guests this elegant little piece opens with nuptials of hermance de mansfred at the castle of the baron de lourdorff to whom she is betrothed it appears that she has something trifled with the affections of adolphe de valberg now supposed dead her sister nancy acknowledges that she loved adolphe but kept silence owing to his courtship of hermance adolphes uncle the count de valberg who knows nothing of the two ladies fearing his nephew is unworthily entangled has had him held in military detention at temesvar whence

p 304

however he has disappeared the intrigue of the seventeen scenes although clearly unravelled in the play is a little complicated and it must suffice to relate by an accident adolphe appears at the castle upon being asked his name he answers lord ruthwen an englishman whereupon he is immediately taken to be a vampire and the servants are thrown into a state of panic eventually he is reconciled to his uncle who recognizes him as the brave young hero by whom his life was saved on a recent battlefield nancys fidelity is rewarded with the hand of the man she loves and who now realizes that hermances heart was never his so that the curtain falls upon a double wedding

several pretty lyrics are interwoven with the dialogue and nancys first song to the air de sommeiller encor ma chère from fanchon la vielleuse is as follows

oui ces paysans respectables
nous rapellent le bon vieux temps
chez eux on croit encore au diable
aux vampires au revenants
on croit à toutes les magies
aux amours aux soins assidus
aux grands sorciers aux grands genies   
bref à tout ce quon ne voit plus

les trois vampires ou le clair de la lune43 which was being played at the variétés is a thoroughly amusing farce in one act by brazier gabriel and armand it shows the adventures of a bon bourgeois m gobetout who has so distracted his brain by reading stories of vampires and ghosts that when one night he sees in his garden three shadowy figures he is well nigh beside himself with terror as he supposes they can be no other than three vampires infesting his house a little later he catches sight of his two daughters and their abigail who appear actually to be eating with the mysterious strangers les vampires qui soupent avec mes filles he groans in accents of despair however it proves that the supper is very material cold chicken and a glass of good wine whilst the rendezvous is of an amorous nature since the visitors are two young sparks and their valet so the play ends with a triple marriage one remark of the worthy m gobetout was it is said nightly greeted with a hurricane of applause he was wont to murmur in pensive accents les vampires

another farce encore un vampire which when produced in 1820 at paris met with considerable success was published as by emile b l and yet another vampire burlesque was contributed by a rousseau les etrennes dun vampire at a minor theatre was billed as from a manuscript trouvé au cimitière de pèrelachaise

more amusing is the work of désaugiers who in august 1820 gave cadet buteux vampire avec relation véridique du prologue et des trois actes de cet épouvantable mélodrame écrit sous la dictée de ce passeux du gros caillou par son secretaire désaugiers when published by rosa 1820 this libretto bore the motto vivent les morts

yet another burlesque published by martinet 1820 is le vampire mélodrame en trois actes paroles de pierre de la fosse de la rue des morts44 a few verses from this vaudeville may be interesting to quote particularly as showing the long continued popularity of nodiers melodrama

the vampire is described as déchappé de corbillard one sees everywhere

there was even a polichinel vampire which when performed at the circus maurice in 1822 attracted all who had a mind

p 306

for a hearty laugh and a contemporary visitor45 to paris merrily wrote that polichinel is the very jolliest fellow in the world46

a comic operetta in one act le vampire by martin joseph mengals which was produced at ghent 1 march 1826 deserves no more than passing mention

james robinson planché speedily adapted nodiers le vampire as the vampire or the bride of the isles and his version with music by joseph binns hart47 was brought out at the english opera house 9th august 1820 with t p cooke48 as ruthven earl of marsden the vampire owing to his fine acting in the part and perhaps a little to the scenic effectsthe scene is laid in the caverns of staffathe play was given nightly to packed houses it is interesting to remark that for this piece the celebrated vampire trap was invented of this i quote the following simple description a vampire trap consists of two or more flaps usually indiarubber through which the sprite can disappear almost instantly where he falls into a blanket fixed to the under surface of the stage as with the star trap this trap is secured against accidents by placing another piece or slide fitting close beneath when not required and removed when the prompters bell gives the signal to make ready

the following account of the production of the vampire is given by planché in his recollections and reflections chapter iii49 having just spoken of an easter piece with which he had furnished drury lane abudah or the talisman of oromanes50 founded upon one of the tales of the genii51 and which although it had a run of nine nights planché calls a very poor piece miserably put on the stage he continues to speak of a subsequent success and tells us a more fortunate melodrama of mine the vampire or the bride of the isles was produced at the lyceum or english opera house as it was then called 9th august 1820 mr samuel james arnold the proprietor and manager had placed in my hands for adaptation a french melodrama entitled le vampire the scene of which was laid with the usual recklessness of french dramatists in scotland where the superstition never existed i vainly endeavoured to induce mr arnold to let me change it to some place in the east of europe he had set his heart on scotch music and dresses

p 307

the latter by the way were in stocklaughed at my scruples assured me that the public would neither know nor careand in those days they certainly did notand therefore there was nothing left for me but to do my best with it the result was most satisfactory to the management the situations were novel and effective the music lively and popular the cast strong comprising t p cooke who made a great hit in the principal character harley bartley pearman mrs chatterley and miss love the trap now so well known as the vampire trap was invented for this piece and the final disappearance of the vampire caused quite a sensation the melodrama had a long run was often revived and is to this day a stock piece in the country i had an opportunity many years afterwards however to treat the same subject in a manner much more satisfactory to myself and as it happened in the same theatre under the same management but of that anon

the full cast of the vampire or the bride of the isles was originally as follows in the introductory vision unda spirit of the flood miss love ariel spirit of the air miss worgman the vampire mr t p cooke lady margaret mrs chatterly in the drama  ruthven earl of marsden the vampire mr t p cooke ronald baron of the isles mr bartley robert an english attendant on the baron mr pearman mswill the barons henchman mr harley andrew steward to ruthven mr minton father francis mr shaw lady margaret daughter of ronald mrs chatterly effie daughter of andrew miss carew bridget lord ronalds housekeeper mrs grove with regard to the costumes of which planché speaks it is interesting to remark that the principal characters ruthven and lady margaret are described as follows ruthven silver breast plate studded with steel buttons plaid kilt philibeg flesh arms and leggings sandals scotch hat and feathers sword and dagger lady margaret white satin dress trimmed with plaid and silver plaid silk sash scotch hat and feather this is in the true transpontine tradition of ossianic attire the play is timed to take one hour and thirty minutes in representationand planché has done his work of adaptation very well although i doubt whether his few slight departures from the original are improvements nevertheless he has

p 308

given the dialogue a native turn and an ease which were at this period too often lacking in similar versions from the french

in 1825 t p cooke visited paris and appeared as le monstre at the portesaintmartin in planchés melodrama which proved a remarkable success running for no less than eighty nights

the vampire or the bride of the isles has its place among the repertory of hodgsons juvenile drama and this in itself is an indication of no small popularity

in the second maidens tragedy52 a globe play of 1611 licensed for the stage by sir george buc on 31st october of that year a macabre drama now generally attributed to tourneur53 there are some remarkable scenes which culminate in something very like necrophilia and a perverse illomened melancholy pervades the whole action in act iv the tyrant a usurper ordering soldiers to attend him with lanthornes and a pickax makes his way at midnight to the cathedral crying

death nor the marble prison my love sleeps in

that ever lay so cold

as if deaths palaces were all massy silver

and steal to this hard lodging was that wisdom
                        since thy life has left me
ill clasp the body for the spirit that dwelt int
and love the house still for the mistress sake
thou art mine now spite of destruction
and govianus and i will possess thee
i once read of a herod whose affection
pursued a virgins love as i did thine
who for the hate she owed him killed herself
as thou too rashly didst without all pity
yet he preserved her body dead in honey
and kept her long after her funeral
but ill unlock the treasure house of art
with keys of gold and bestow all on thee
here slaves receive her humbly from our arms
                        so reverently
bear her before us gently to our palace
place you the stone again where we first found it

after a while the scene is in the palace they bringe the body in a chaire drest up in black veluet which setts out the pailenes of the handes and face and a faire chayne of pearle crosse her brest and the crucyfex aboue it he standes silent awhile letting the musique play beeknyng the soldiers that bringe her in to make obeisaunce to her and he hym self makes a lowe honour to the body and kisses the hande a song within in voyces

and that ill have in spite ont

accordingly an artist in painting and perfumery is summoned to adorn the face of the corpse and give it a fresh lively red colour however this merchant of cosmetics is none other than govianus the rightful heir disguised and he fucuses the dead cheeks and lips with a peter which is confected with a strong poison so that when the tyrant lustfully kisses the cold flesh he is blasted with the venom and falls in the agonies of death the incident is extremely powerful if extremely horrible as the tyrant expires govianus taunts him thus

o thou sacrilegious villain
thou thief of rest robber of monuments
cannot the body after funeral
sleep in the grave for thee must it be raised
only to please the wickedness of thine eye
does all things end with death and not thy lust
hast thou devised a new way to damnation
more dreadful than the soul of any sin
did ever pass yet between earth and hell

it may be convenient here briefly to review the progress of the vampire in the theatre at least in his most important appearances

an italian opera i vampiri the work of the much applauded neapolitian composer silvestro di palma which was performed at the teatro san carlo54 in 1800 did not of course take anything from the novel by polidori which indeed it preceded by nearly twenty years but was rather inspired by the famous treatise of guiseppe davanzati dissertazione sopra i vampiri di gioseppe davanzati patrizio fiorentino e tranese cavaliere gerosolimitano arcivescovo di trani e patriarca dalessandria seconda edizione nalopi mdcclxxxix presso filippo raimondi con licenzi de superiori

on 28th march 182865 at leipzig was produced an opera grosse romantische oper der vampyr founded on the original french melodrama the scene being changed from scotland to hungary the libretto is by wilhelm august wohlbrück and the music by his yet more famous brotherinlaw heinrich august marschner der vampyr was an enormous success a free adaptation of this being made by j r planché and produced at the lyceum 25th august 1829 it ran for sixty nights in his recollections and reflections which have before been quoted planché commences chapter x by some account of this in the summer of 1829 i had the opportunity of treating the subject of the vampire in accordance with my own ideas of propriety the french melodrama had been converted into an opera for the german stage and the music composed by marschner

mr hawes who had obtained a score of it having induced mr arnold to produce it at the lyceum i was engaged to write the libretto and consequently laid the scene of action in hungary where the superstition exists to this day substituted for a scotch chieftain a wallachian boyard and in many other respects improved upon my earlier version the opera was extremely well sung and the costumes novel as well as correct thanks to the kindness of dr walsh the traveller66 who gave me some valuable information respecting the national dresses of the magyars and the wallachians

p 312

i am surprised that marschners most dramatic and melodious works der vampyr die judin c have not been introduced to our more advanced musical audiences at one or other of our great operatic establishments

the production of der vampyr was followed by that of the brigand at drury lane

polidoris tale formed the basis of a romantic opera in three acts the libretto of which was from the pen of c m heigel and the music by p von lindpaintner this was seen at stuttgart on 2 ist september 1828 and it proved a remarkable success it was announced as being from byrons famous tale although at this date such an attribution can hardly have deceived any

on 25th may 1857 there was produced in berlin a komischen zauberballet morgano by paul taglioni with music by j hertzel the scene is laid in hungary during the seventeenth century and in the sixth tableau elsa dances an infernal lavolta with the vampires in their haunted castle but she is rescued by her lover retzka who slays the vampire morgano with a consecrated poniard in 1861 at milan appeared a ballet by rotta il vampiro with music by paolo giorza guten abend herr fischer oder der vampyr is a light vaudeville in one act by g belly and g löffler with music by w telle which had some success in its day ein vampyr by ulrich franks ulla wolf given at vienna in 1877 is a farce taken from scribe

in england dion boucicaults57 the vampire in three acts was produced at the princesss theatre london 19th june 1852 when the author made his first appearance before a metropolitan audience of this drama the following criticism if criticism it may be called was given by henry morley in his journal of a london playgoer it must be remembered that morley continually shows himself extremely prejudiced and his censure must not be taken any more seriously than we regard the illword of many critics today for example the shrill petulant piping and the childish miffs of st john ervine in the sullens under 19th june morley writes if there be any truth in the old adage that when things are at the worst they must mend the bettering of spectral melodrama is not distant for it has reached the extreme point of inanity in the new piece which was produced on

p 313

monday at the princesss theatre under the attractive title of the vampire

its plot is chiefly copied from a piece which some years ago turned the lyceum into a chamber of horrors but it has been spun out into three parts facetiously described as three dramas the little period of a century has been interposed between each part and in order that the outrage on the possible shall be complete the third part is projected forward into the year that will be 1860 by this ingenious arrangement the resuscitation of the original vampire has been enabled to supply the lovers of the revolting at the princesss with three acts of murderthat is two consumated and one attempted but as the delicate process of vampirical killing is exactly after the same pattern in each case the horror is quite worn out before the career of the creature terminates nothing but tedious trash remains

to an honest ghost one has no objection but an animated corpse which goes about in christian attire and although never known to eat or drink or shake hands is allowed to sit at good mens feasts which renews its odious life every hundred years by sucking a young ladys blood after fascinating her by motions which resemble mesmerism burlesqued and which notwithstanding its wellpurchased longevity is capable of being killed during its term in order that it may be revived by moonbeamssuch a ghost as this passes all bounds of toleration

the monster of absurdity was personated by its reviver mr boucicault with due paleness of visage stealthiness of pace and solemnity of tone the scenery especially a moonlit ridge amidst the heights of snowdon was beautiful and the costumes were prettily diversified but the dreary repetition of fantastical horror almost exhausted even the patience which a benefit enjoins unfortunately the mischief of such a piece produced at a respectable theatre does not end with the weariness of the spectators who come to shudder and remain to yawn for it is not only beside the purpose of playing but directly contravenes it and though it may be too dull to pervert the tastes of those who witness its vapid extravagances it has power to bring discredit on the most genial of arts

it may be pointed out that this account probably through ignorance possibly of intent is deliberately inaccurate p 314 although confessedly a poorer play than planchés the vampire dion boucicaults drama is not derived from the earlier piece but both are taken from the same source polidoris romance seeing that henry morley was emeritus professor of english literature in university college london it were reasonable to suppose that he should have been acquainted with polidoris novella or perhaps i rather ought to say that therefor it was not to be expected he should have known of this famous work

boucicault afterwards revived the vampire as the phantom and this was given in london with good applause the american cast of the characters of the phantom as produced at wallacks theatre new york city is as follows in act i 1645 the phantom dion boucicault lord albert clavering mr j b howe sir hugh neville of graystock mr ralton sir guy musgrave mr etynge ralph gwynne mr levere davy mr t b johnstone lucy peveryl miss agnes robertson ellen miss alleyne maud miss ada clare janet mrs h p grattan in act ii 1750 alan raby dion boucicault colonel raby mr ralton edgar his nephew mr j b howe dr rees mr burnett curate mr paul corporal stump mr peters ada raby miss agnes robertson jenny mrs l h allen

subsequently i presume when the phantom was given in london some modifications were made which seem to me most decidedly to be improvements the first act was placed in the latter part of the reign of charles ii and two hundred years were supposed to elapse between the first and the second acts this necessitated trifling changes in the dialogue at certain points and naturally a complete alteration of costume to a modern style for act ii in fact the script of the play which is printed in dicks standard plays no 697 c 1887 under costume gives the following direction the costumes in the first act are of the period of the latter part of the reign of charles the second in the second art the respective characters are dressed in the provincial costume of wales at the middle of the present century the following description of alan rabys costume for each act will show the necessity of a complete change in the style of dress which this drama requires

i notice that boucicault has in certain scenes borrowed his situations pretty freely from le vampire of dumas and occasionally he has even conveyed actual dialogue from the french play

at the commencement of the phantom we are shown a room in a welsh inn and it appears that davy and janet the hostess have just been married a sudden storm sends lucy peveryl thither for shelter and she confides to janet that she is on her way to meet at sundown her cousin roland peveryl who is a fugitive and proscribed on this account he dare not openly seek her hand but the lovers are secretly betrothed he has promised to meet her in order to bid her farewell for a time in the most unfrequented spot the ruins of raby castle no sooner does janet hear that name than she cries out with horror and speaks of a fearful story connected with the place they are interrupted by the arrival of lord clavering with a party of guests amongst whom are friends of lucy she frankly informs them of her rendezvous and they decide to accompany her more especially as the inn has not sufficient accommodation for the travellers who resolve to take provisions and wine and spend the night in the deserted chambers of the old castle davy endeavours to prevent them nor are his efforts altogether selfish he tells them no one ever sought a nights shelter in the ruins of raby castle that ever lived to see the morning    within the ruins of raby dwells some terrible thingman or fiend    no traveller that knows the road will ever venture near that spot after nightfall but strange wayfarers benighted in the storm have wandered to this place of shelter and the next morning they are founddeadeach with a wound in his throat in the right side from which they

p 316

have evidently bled to deathbut no blood is spilt around the face is white and fixed as if it had died of horror and he my betrothed cries lucy roland is there nevertheless the company laugh at these old stories and determine to make their way to the old castle this they actually find in far better state than they have been led to expect and their servants who have insisted upon davy showing them the way soon get a very fair supper from the provisions they have purchased at his inn roland peveryl is not to be found but whilst they are eating a stranger enters a puritan and announces himself as gervase rookwood a traveller who has lost his way in the mountains davy however almost collapses with terror he recollects that many years before the castle belonged to sir owen raby a noble cavalier while alan raby his younger brother had joined the forces of cromwell taking advantage of this difference the traitor one midnight with a band of puritan soldiers surprises the castle and butchers the sleeping garrison killing his brother with his own hand about a year later however the tables are turned the royalists recapture the place alan raby is seized and in their rage they hurl the fratricide from a window which hung shudderingly over a fearful precipice curiously enough no trace of the body could ever be recovered but davy recognizes that gervase rookwood is none other than alan raby here we have the old belief that a man guilty of some monstrous crime in this case rebellion against the king and the murder of a brother is compelled to return as a vampire when the company disperse to their various apartments for the night lord clavering is horrified to discover in his room the dead body of young roland peveryl a wound deep in his throat but bloodless at the same moment a piercing scream is heard and lucy peveryl rushing from her chamber with her hands wildly clasping her neck falls dead in lord claverings arms seeing as he thinks a shadowy form that steals from her room he draws a pistol and fires when the company hurry in with lights they discover alan raby has been shot in faltering accents the dying man explains that hearing a cry for help he hastened to the ladys assistance he will only forgive lord clavering on one condition when i have breathed my last let my body be conveyed amongst the peaks of snowdon and there exposed to the first rays of the rising

p 317

moon which touch the earth this is done and the first act concludes with a tableau of the peaks of snowdon whilst from behind the clouds there sails high in the heaven a silver sickle that strikes the corpse with her argent shaft of mystic light the vampire wakes and leaps to his feet crying in exultant tones fountain of my life once more thy rays restore me death i defy thee

it cannot escape notice that in this act there are many parallels with le vampire of dumas raby castle is the castle of tormenar lucy peveryl is juana roland peveryl don luis de figuerroa lord clavering gilbert de tiffauges and davy the gracioso lazare

two centuries have flown raby castle is now inhabited in possession of colonel raby whose daughter is betrothed to her cousin edgar it has been falsely reported that this latter fell in battle but the scene opens with his return when the sad news first arrived ada raby was stricken almost to death and as they believed actually died but she was recalled to life by a mysterious stranger since which hour she seems to have fallen completely under his influence and in some extraordinary way only to respond to his power this is none other than gervase rookwood who now appears and informs colonel raby that he and none other is the lawful lord of raby castle the colonels claim lies in the fact that when years before the last of the old raby family sir alan raby died or rather was killed and no will could be found the estate reverted to a distant branch of the rabys now represented by the colonel however a document is produced in the handwriting of alan raby his will wherein he bequeaths the estate to gervase rookwood and the rookwood successors it seemed as though such a title cannot be resisted but doctor rees a scholar of occultism is filled with the gravest suspicions of the stranger in a dictionary of necromancy a rare work by dr dee he has read of vampires and he divines the demoniac nature of the pretended rookwood in a trancelike state ada raby has rejected edgar and is to be given to the stranger when dr rees examining the documents discovers that the will of sir alan raby which must be some two hundred years old although the hand is doubtless that of raby as the archives prove is written upon paper which has a watermark of 1850 scarcely five years old the vampire who

p 318

endeavours to assassinate edgar is killed by a charmed bullet whilst his limbs relax in death the hypnotic spell vanishes from adas mind and she is united to her lover but to their horror they notice that as the moonlight touches the body of alan raby where he has fallen his members begin to twitch anew with life dr rees seizes the vampire and hurls the body into the darkest chasm of the mountain side where no beam nor ray can ever penetrate or find the smallest chink of entrance

the phantom is of course somewhat oldfashioned and a little stilted as was the mode in its diction no doubt some of the situations could be revised and far more neatly turned yet on the whole i conceive that it should prove of its kind excellent fare in the theatre and some scenes at least in capable hands were not without emotional appeal i had almost said a certain impressiveness far worse dramas have not undeservedly earned their meed of approbation and applause

on 15th august 1872 was advertised royal strand theatre production of a bit of moonshine in three rays entitled the vampire written by r reece there was indeed a bounteous bill of fare at seven was given a farce the married bachelor at 730 byrons not such a fool as he looks at half past nine the new and original burlesque a little bit of moonshine in three rays called the vampire written by r reece the new music by john fitzgerald the new scenery painted by h p hall dresses by may mrs richardson and assistants machinery by wood properties by ball the piece produced under the direction of mrs swanborough mr j wallace and mr reece the house says the era 18th august 1872 was crowded for this satirical burlesque his play the author wrote was founded upon a german legend lord byrons story and a boucicaultian drama the vampire according to reece is a plagiarist who lives on other peoples brains the title rôle was acted by edward terry who kept the audience in roars of laughter mr terrys makeup as the vampire was something extraordinary and he worked with unflagging energy to add go to the novelty during a picnic in the ruins of raby castle the vampire endeavours to steal the note books of ada raby miss emily pitt and lady audley moonstone mrs raymond two lady novelists so that he may utilize their efforts for his weekly instalment of the penny dreadful and other fiction

the vampire a tragedy in five acts by st john dorset the rev hugo john belfour second edition 182160 does not appear to have been acted it was dedicated to w g macready esq whose kindness the author acknowledges in most grateful terms the story is oriental the same being laid in alexandria and it is a moral vampire that is shown by the poet in his advertisement he quotes a passage

p 320

from the examiner when noticing planchés melodrama wrote there are vampires who waste the heart and happiness of those they are connected with vampires of avarice vampires of spleen vampires of debauchery vampires in all the shapes of selfishness and domestic tyranny this is his theme and although his pages have considerable merit i do not conceive that his scenes would have been entirely successful on the stage since they are poetical and reflective rather than dramatic

in germany sensational fiction was long largely influenced by polidori and we have such romances as zschokkes der tote gast spindlers der vampyr und seine braut theodor hildebrands der vampyr oder die totenbraut edwin bauers roman à clef the clever der baron vampyr which was published at leipzig in 1846 hardly concerns as here whilst ewald august königs sensational ein moderner vampyr62 which appeared in 1883 or franz hirschs moderne vampyr63 1873 productions which only use in their titles the word vampire to attractone might say to ensnare attention are in this connexion no more deserving of consideration than mere chapbooks and pedlars pennyware such as morellis der vampyr and dr seltzams pornographic die vampyre der residenz

undoubtedly the vampire tradition has never been treated with such consummate skill as by théophile gautier in his exquisite prose poem la morte amoureuse which first appeared in the chronique de paris on 23rd and 26th june 1836 when the young author was not quite twentyfive although the theme is not original yet perhaps nowhere beside has it been so ingeniously moulded with such delicacy of style with such rich and vivid colouring with such emotion and such repression the darker shadows of the tradition are suggested rather than portrayed yet none can deny that there is an atmosphere of sombre mystery even a touch of morbid horror which with complete artistry the writer allows us to suspect rather than to comprehend the very vagueness of the relation adds to the illusion we hardly know whether romuald is the young country priest occupied in prayer and good works or whether he is the renaissance seignior living a life of passion and hot extravagance as he himself cries sometimes i thought i was a priest who dreamed every night that be was a nobleman sometimes that i was a nobleman who dreamed that he was a

p 321

priest i could no longer distinguish dreams from real life i did not know where reality began and illusion ended the dissolute supercilious young lord jeered at the priest and the priest abhorred the dissipations of the young lord but were he humble priest or were he profligate patrician one emotion remained eternally the same his love for clarimonde at length the abbé serapion dissolves the glamour sternly he bids young romuald accompany him to the deserted cemetery where clarimonde lies buried he exhumes the body and as he sprinkles it with holy water it crumbles into dust then also has the lord romuald gone for ever there only remains the poor priest of god broken and alone who grows old in an obscure parish in the depths of a wood and who wellnigh half a century after scarcely dares to stir the ashes of that memory

there are in english not a few stories which deal with the vampire tradition and many of these are well imagined and cleverly contrived the morbid horror of the thing has often been conveyed with considerable power but yet it will i think be universally allowed that no author has written pages comparable to this story of gautier it is hardly to be disputed that the best of the english vampire stories is sheridan le fanus carmilla which the authorities upon the bibliography of this author64 have not traced further back than its appearance in the collection entitled in a glass darkly 187265 carmilla which is a story of some length containing sixteen chapters is exceedingly well told and it certainly exhibits that note of haunting dread which is peculiar to le fanus work the castle in styria and the family who inhabit it are excellently done nor will the arrival of carmilla and the mysterious coach wherein sat a hideous black woman with a sort of coloured turban on her head who was gazing all the time from the carriage window nodding and grinning derisively towards the ladies with gleaming eyes and large white eyeballs and her teeth set as if in fury easily be forgotten

it must suffice to mention very briefly but a few short stories in english where the vampire element is present e f benson has evoked real horror in his the boom in the tower and the horrible creature tangled in her rotting shroud all foul with mould and damp who returns from her accursed grave is loathly to the last degree

the flowering of the strange orchid by h g wells introduces a botanical vampire an orchid collector is found dead in a jungle in the andaman islands with a strange bulb lying near him this is brought to england and carefully tended by a botanist until it comes to flower but when at last the blossoms burst open great tendrils suddenly reach out to grasp the man sucking his blood with hideous gusts the unfortunate wretch has to be violently torn away from the plant which drips with blood scare e in time to save his life

this idea closely resembles fred m whites story the purple terror which appeared in the strand magazine september 1899 vol xviii no 105 here lieutenant will scarlett an american officer and a number of his men have to make their way across a certain tract of cuban territory spending the night in a country posada they are attracted by a pretty dancing girl who is wearing twined round her shoulders a garland of purple orchids larger than any known variety the blossoms which a bloodred centre exhale a strange exotic perfume scarlett is fired with the enthusiasm of giving a new orchid to the horticultural world and on the following morning a native named tito undertakes to guide him to the spot he learns that the natives call them the devils poppies and that the flowers grow in the high trees where their blossoms cling to long green tendrils as night falls the little company arrives at a plateau ringed by tall trees whose branches are crowned with great wreaths of the purple flower nestling amid coils of long green ropery to their alarm they note that the ground is covered with bleaching bones the skeletons of men animals and birds alike yet perforce they must camp there rather than risk the miasma of the lower valley scarlett keeps watch in the darkness there is a rustling sound and suddenly a long green tendril furnished at the end with a sucker armed with sharp spines like teeth descends and snatches one of the men from the ground as it is about to withdraw scarlett with inconceivable swiftness slashes it through with his knife but the mans clothing has even in that moment been cut through by the razor spines and his body is marked by a number of punctures where his blood is oozing in great drops immediately halfadozen and more lithe living cords with fanged mouths fall groping for their prey the men are hurriedly awakened and with

p 323

difficulty they extricate themselves by sending their whingers ripping and tearing in every direction it appears that the vampire poppies at night send down these tendrils to gather moisture anything which the fearful suckers can catch they drain dry be it man or beast or bird lieutenant scarlett and his men have been deliberately led into this trap by tito who is madly jealous of their compliments to zara the dancinggirl they hold him prisoner and threaten him with condign punishment at headquarters

algernon blackwood brings together two types of vampires in his story the transfer one is a human being the psychic sponge who absorbs and seems to live upon the vitality of others he is thus described by the governess i watched his hard bleak face i noticed how thin he was and the curious oily brightness of his steady eyes and everything he said or did announced what i may dare to call the suction of his presence there is also a yet more horrible monster if one may term it so the forbidden corner an arid barren spot in the midst of the rose garden naked and bald amid luxuriant growth a child who knows its evil secret says its bad its hungry its dying because it cant get the food it wants but i know what would make it feel right when the human vampire ventures near this spot it exerts its secret strength and draws him to itself he falls into the middle of the patch and it drinks his energy he lives on but he seems to be nothing more than a physical husk or shell without vitality as for the forbidden corner it lay untouched full of great luscious driving weeds and creepers very strong full fed and bursting thick with life

sir arthur conan doyle in his little story the parasite has depicted a human vampire or psychic sponge in the person of miss penelosa who is described as being a small frail creature with a pale peaky face an insignificant presence and retiring manner nevertheless she is able to obsess professor gilroy who says she has a parasite soul yes she is a parasite a monster parasite she creeps into my form as the hermit crab creeps into the whelks shell to his horror he realizes that under her influence his will becomes weaker and weaker and he is bound to seek her presence he resists for a while but the force becomes so overmastering that he is compelled to yield loathing himself as he does so when he visits her

p 324

with a terrific effort he breaks the spell and denounces her unhallowed fascination in burning words however his victory is short indeed she persecutes him most bitterly and when he unburdens his troubles to his college professor the only result is a prescription of chloral and bromide which promptly goes into the gutter with devilish craft the vampire destroys his reputation as a scholar and brings about illnatured gossip and comment she is able to confuse his brain during his lectures so that he talks unintelligible nonsense and his classes become the laughingstock of the university until at length the authorities are obliged to suspend him from his position almost in despair he cries and the most dreadful part of it all is my loneliness here i sit in a commonplace english bowwindow looking out upon a commonplace english street with its garish buses and its lounging policemen and behind me there hangs a shadow which is out of all keeping with the age and place in the home of knowledge i am weighed down and tortured by a power of which science knows nothing no magistrate would listen to me no paper would discuss my case no doctor would believe my symptoms my own most intimate friends would only look upon it as a sign of brain derangement i am out of all touch with my kind

the unfortunate victim is driven even deeper still by this unhallowed influence which causes him to rob a bank violently assault a friend and finally to come within an ace of mutilating the features of his betrothed at length the persecution ceases with the sudden death of the vampire miss penelosa

the true story of a vampire is a pathetic little story very exquisitely told in studies of death by stanislaus eric count stenbock who wrote some verses of extraordinary charm in love sleep and dreams myrtle rue and cypress the shadow of death and who at least once in the other side told a macabre legend with most powerful and haunting effect a mysterious count vardaleh visits the remote styrian castle of old baron wronski and before long attains an occult influence over the boy heir gabriel the lad wastes away and count vardaleh is heard to murmur my darling i fain would spare thee but thy life is my life and i must live i who would rather die will god not have any mercy on me oh oh life oh the torture of life    o gabriel my beloved my life yes lifeoh my life i am sure this is

p 325

but a little i demand of thee surely the superabundance of life can spare a little to one who is already dead as the boy lies wan and ill the count enters the room and presses a long feverish kiss upon his lips vardaleh rushes forth and can never be traced again gabriel has expired in the agony of that embrace

in a novel the vampire by reginald hodder a woman who is the leader of an occult society is forced to exercise her powers as a vampire to prevent the ebbing of her vitality here her ravages are psychic rather than physical albeit in fact the two so closely commingled that they are not to be separated a curious feature in the tale is that this woman is represented as putting forth her energies through the medium of a metallic talisman and various struggles to gain possession of the object form the theme of the story it falls into the hands of persons who would employ it for evil purposes when it constitutes a very formidable menace but at the last after a number of extraordinary happenings it is happily recovered

the traditional but yet more horrible vampire is presented to us by f marion crawford in for the blood is the life here a young man who has been loved by a girl whose affection he was unable to return is after her death vampirised by her and when his friends suspect the truth they determine to rescue him they find him upon her grave a thin stream of blood trickling from his throat and the flickering light of the lantern played upon another face that looked up from the feastupon two deep dead eyes that saw in spite of deathupon parted lips redder than life itselfupon gleaming teeth on which glistened a rosy drop the situation is effectively dealt with according to the good old tradition a hawthorn stake is driven through the heart of the vampire who emits a quantity of blood and with a despairing shriek dies the last death

almost equally vivid in its details must be accounted the tale four wooden stakes by victor roman the ghastly events in the lonely old house with its little grey crypt some ten miles from the small town of charing a place of not more than fifteen hundred souls are most vividly described there lived the holroyds the grandfather the father and three brothers whilst in south america the grandfather was

p 326

attacked while asleep by one of those huge bats next morning he was so weak be couldnt walk that awful thing had sucked his life blood away he arrived here but was sickly until his death a few weeks later so says remson holroyd who is left the sole survivor of the family and who has summoned his old college friend to help him solve the secret of the hideous doom which is taking toll one by one the grandfather was not buried in the usual way but as his will directed his remains were interred in the vault built near the house remson holroyd continues then my dad began failing and just pined away until he died what puzzled the doctors was the fact that right up until the end he consumed enough food to sustain three men yet he was so weak he lacked the strength to drag his legs over the floor he was buried or rather interred with granddad the same symptoms were in evidence in the cases of george and fred they are both lying in the vault and now jack im going too for of late my appetite has increased to alarming proportions yet i am as weak as a kitten the next morning the visitor finds himself so weak that he is hardly able to rise and he feels a slight pain in the neck i rushed to examine it in the mirror two tiny dots rimmed with bloodmy bloodand on my neck no longer did i chuckle at remsons fears for it the thing had attacked meas i slept the host himself is in a state of utter exhaustion that night watch is kept by the friend and as from his concealment he is gazing into remsons room he notices a faint reddish glow outside one of the windows it apparently emanated from nowhere hundreds of little specks danced and whirled in the spot of light and as i watched them fascinated they seemed to take oil the form of a human face the features were masculine as was also the arrangement of the hair then the mysterious glow disappeared after a few moments there appears a vague form of which the watcher is able to distinguish the head and to his horror he sees that the features are the same as those of a portrait of the grandfather which is hanging in the picture gallery of the house but oh the difference in expression the lips were drawn back in a snarl disclosing two sets of pearly white teeth the canines over developed and remarkably sharp the eyes an emerald green in colour stared in a look of consuming hate the horror is revealed the house is infested by a vampire in the morning

p 327

the two friends visit the vault as if by mutual understanding we both turned toward the coffin on our left it belonged to the grandfather we unplaced the lid and there lay the old holroyd he appeared to be sleeping his face was full of colour and he had none of the stiffness of death the hair was matted the moustache untrimmed and on the beard were matted stains of a dull brownish hue but it was his eyes that attracted me they were greenish and they glowed with an expression of fiendish malevolence such as i had never seen before the look of baffled rage on the face might well have adorned the features of the devil in hell they drive a stake through the living corpse which shrieks and writhes whilst the gushing blood drenches coffins and floor spurting out in great jets over the very walls the head is severed from the body and as the final stroke of the knife cut the connexion a scream issued from the mouth and the whole corpse fell away into dust leaving nothing but a wooden stake lying in a bed of bones the remaining three bodies are treated in the same way and thus the thrall of the curse is lifted from the old house ten miles from the little town of charing

although the genius of charles baudelaire when his art required it shrank from no extremity of physical horror yet in his exquisite poem le vampire he has rather portrayed the darkness and desolation of the soul

toi qui comme un coup de couteau
dans mon coeur plaintif est entrée
toi qui forte comme un troupeau
de démons vins folle et parée

de mon esprit humilié
faire ton lit et ton domaine
infâme a qui je suis lié
comme le forcat a la chaîne

comme au jeu le joueur têtu
comme à la bouteille livrogne
comme aux vermines la charogne
maudite maudite soistu

jai prié le glaive rapide
de conquerir ma liberté
et jai dit au poison perfide
de secourir ma lâcheté

p 328

helas le poison et le glaive
mont pris en dédain et mont dit
tu nes pas digne quon tenlève
a ton esclavage maudit

imbécilede son empire
si nos efforts te délivraient
tes baisers ressusciteraient
le cadavre de ton vampire

in england there is a poemtruly of a very different kindwhich appears in the life of the famous scientist james clerk maxwell by lewis campbell and william garnett verses written by maxwell in 1845 when he was fourteen years of age the verses should not perhaps because of the youth of the author be criticized too sharply and although they show wardour street fustian and gimcrack since the piece is of no great length it may pardonably be quoted here it is not entirely without a certain feeling after the right atmosphere and much will be forgiven on account of the precocity it is grandiosely entitled the vampyre compylt into meeter by james clerk maxwell

thair is a knichte rydis through the wood
and a douchty knichte is hee
and sure bee is on a message sent
he rydis sae hastilie
he passit the aik and hee passit the birk
and bee passit monie a tre
bot plesant to him was the saugh sae slim
for beneath it hee did see

they goed through the wood and through the wood
to the end of the wood they came
and when they came to the end of the wood
they saw the salt sea faem

and first got in the ladye fair
and then the knichte sae brave
they got into the wee wee boat

the vampire bride a ballad by the hon henry liddell has considerable merit it may be found in the wizard of the north the vampire bride and other poems blackwood edinburgh and cadell london 1833 these stanzas are founded upon the old tale of the knight who having placed a ringsome say his weddingringaround the finger of the statue of venus whilst he is a quoiting when he would reclaim it

p 330

finds that the finger is crooked so that the jewel may not be withdrawn whilst that night a phantom claims him as her spouse with difficulty is he freed from the thrall of the succubus

in 1845 there was published at the columbian press westonsupermare a little book entitled the last of the vampires by smyth upton the chief some critics might say the only merit of this tale is its excessive rarity the narrative is somewhat curiously divided into epochs the first of which takes place in 1769 the second in 1777 the third and last in 1780 chapter i opens in an english village named frampton but in chapter ii we find ourselves upon the borders of bohemia in the castle von oberfels four chapters of no great length and somewhat disconnected in their sequence comprise the first epoch a little later we meet with the mysterious lord de montfort and apparently he has just committed a murder since he is one of the two men who stand in a dreary outhouse adjoining montfort abbey red blood yet warm stains their murderous hands and is seen also in pools upon the floor the same marks are observable also on their clothes the scene is a fearful one it is one of those of which the mere recital makes the blood run cold and the writer wisely does not attempt the task in the penultimate chapter of this extraordinary production we are introduced to a certain young german the baron von oberfels who weds mary learmont the elder daughter of sir james learmont who being a baronet was moreover a knight of the bath and mp unfortunately the baron was one of that horrible class the vampires he had sold his soul to the evil one for the enjoyment of perpetual youth being bound besides to what are understood to be the penalties of that wretched and accursed race every tenth year a female was sacrificed to his infernal master mary learmont was to be the next victim may she escape the threatened doom but apparently so far as i can gather she is not so lucky for we are vaguely told the baron and his bride departed on his wedding tour her father and mother never hear of her more a page or two later there is a midnight wedding at the castle von oberfels of the bride we are told nothing save that she had a fair presence the baron von oberfels was there once more arrayed in the

p 331

garments of a bridegroom the ceremony proceeds the grand organ peals the heavenly voices of whiterobed choristers added greatly to the beauty of the scene but hark another noise is heard sulphureous smoke half fills the sacred building the floor opens for an instant and mocking shrieks are audible as the spirit of the last of the vampires descended into perdition

i am bound to acknowledge that after a somewhat careful reading of this curious and most disjointed little piece of seventysix pages the only impression with which i am met is that mr smyth upton knew nothing whatsoever of what the word vampire connotes the idea of the victims who are sacrificed for the sake of eternal youth is of course fairly common and was very effectively utilized by g w m reynolds in his romance the necromancer which ran in reynoldss miscellany from saturday 27th december 1851 to saturday 31st july 185266 incidentally it maybe remarked as a somewhat curious fact that this prolific novelist never availed himself of the vampire tradition in his melodramatic chapters

the vampyre by the wife of a medical man 1858 is a violent teetotal tract of twentyseven short chapters presented in the guise of fiction the villain of the piece is the vampyre inn and the dipsomaniac heroif it be allowable to use the term in such a contextis given to ravings such as these they flythey bitethey suck my bloodi die that hideous vampyre its eyes pierce me throthey are redthey are bloodshot tear it from my pillow i dare not lie down it bitesi die give me brandybrandymore brandy

a vampire of souls by h m p published in 1904 is a book of little value the hero george ventnor when aged twenty is killed in a railway accident and the narrative consists of his after experiences which are singularly material and crude there is perhaps a good touch here and there but the thing certainly does not deserve to be rescued from oblivion

it will have been noticed that beyond the titles these two last works have really little or nothing to do with vampires at all but we may now consider a romance which may at least be ranked as a very serious rival toin my opinion it is far ghostlier thanits famous successor dracula varney the vampire or the feast of blood is undoubtedly the best novel

p 332

of thomas preskett prest a prolific writer of the fourth and fifth decades of the nineteenth century it is true that his productions published by the wellknown edward lloyd of 231 shoreditch67 may be classed as simple shockers but none the less he has considerable power in this kind and he had at any rate the craft of telling his story with skill and address there is a certain quality in his work which appeared during the years from 1839 to the earlier fifties that is entirely lacking in the productions of his fellows to him have been ascribed doubtless with some exaggeration well nigh two hundred titles but the following list comprises i believe his principal romances ela the outcast or the gipsy of rosemary dell angelina or the mystery of s marks abbey a tale of other days  the death grasp or a fathers curse ernnestine de lacy or the robbers foundling gallant tom or the perils of a sailor ashore and afloat an original nautical romance of deep and pathetic interest  sweeney todd the demon barber of fleet street the most famous of prests novels newgate which has some capital episodes emily fitzormond mary clifford the maniac father or the victim of seduction gertrude of the rock rosalie or the vagrants daughter the millers maid jane brightwell blanche or the mystery of the doomed house the blighted heart or the priory ruins sawney bean the maneater of midlothian the skeleton clutch or the goblet of gore the black monk or the secret of the grey turret68 the miller and his men or the secret robbers of bohemia to prest also has been attributed but i conceive without foundation susan hoply an audacious piracy upon the famous novel by mrs crowe susan hopley

varney the vampire or the feast of blood was first published in 1847 it contains no less than ccxx chapters and runs to 868 pages the many incidents succeed each other with such breathless rapidity that it were wellnigh impossible to attempt any conspectus of the whole romance the very length would make this analysis a work of extreme difficulty and incidentally we may note the amazing copiousness of prest which must ever remain a matter for wonderment such a romance for example as newgate runs to no less than on hundred and fortynine chapters comprising 772 pages the maniac father has fiftyfour chapters each of considerable

p 333

length which total 604 pages and i have not selected these on account of their exceptional volume

varney the vampire was among the most popular of prests productions and on account of its unprecedented success it was reprinted in 1853 in penny parts today the book is unprocurable and considerable sums have been for many years in vain offered to secure a copy indeed it may be noted that all prests work is excessively scarce

it is hardly an exaggeration to affirm that of recent years there have been few books which have been more popular than brain stokers dracula a tale and certainly there is no sensational romance which in modern days has achieved so universal a reputation since it was first published in 1897 that is to say one and twenty years ago it has run into a great number of editions and the name has veritably become a household word it will prove interesting to inquire into the immediate causes which have brought this book such wide and enduring fame it has already been remarked that it is wellnigh impossible for a story which deals with the supernatural or the horrible to be sustained to any great length elements which at first are almost unendurable will lose their effect if they are continued for the readers mind insensibly becomes inured to fresh emotions of awe and horror and dracula is by no means briefly told in the ordinary reprints tenth edition 1913 it extends to more than four hundred pages nor does it escape the penalty of its prolixity the first part jonathan harkers journal which consists of four chapters is most admirably done and could the whole story have been sustained at so high a level we should have had a complete masterpiece but that were scarcely possible the description of the journey through transylvania is interesting to a degree and even has passages which attain to something like charm all day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of beauty of every kind sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the top of steep hills such as we see in old missals sometimes we ran by rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side of them to be subject to great floods it takes a lot of water and running strong to sweep the outside edge of a river clear very effective is the arrival of the english traveller at the vast ruined castle from whose tall black windows came no ray of light and whose

p 334

broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit sky very adroitly are the various incidents managed in their quick succession those mysterious happenings which at last convince the matteroffact commonplace young solicitor of exeter that he is a helpless prisoner in the power of a relentless and fearful being the continual contrasts between business conversations the most ordinary events of the dull listless days and all the while the mantling of dark shadows in the background and the onrushing of some monstrous doom are in these opening chapters most excellently managed

so tense a strain could not be preserved and consequently when we are abruptly transported to whitby and the rather tedious courtships of lucy westenra who is a lay figure at best we feel that a good deal of the interest has already begun to evaporate i would hasten to add that before long it is again picked up but it is never sustained in the same degree and good sound sensational fare as we have set before us fare which i have myself more than once thoroughly enjoyed yet it is difficult not to feel that ones palate has been a little spoiled by the nonpareil of an antipast this is not to say that the various complications are not sufficiently thrilling but because of their very bounty now and again they most palpably fail of effect and it can hardly escape notice that the author begins to avail himself of those more extravagant details of vampirism which frankly have no place outside the stories told round a winters hearth it would have been better had he confined himself to those particulars which are known and accepted which indeed have been officially certified and definitely proved but to have limited himself thus would have meant the shortening of his narrative and here we return to the point which was made above

if we review dracula from a purely literary point of approach it must be acknowledged that there is much careless writing and many pages could have been compressed and something revised with considerable profit it is hardly possible to feel any great interest in the characters they are labels rather than individuals as i have said there are passages of graphic beauty passages of graphic horror but these again almost entirely occur within the first sixty pages there are some capital incidents for example the method by which lord p 335 godalming and his friend obtain admittance to no 347 piccadilly nor does this by any means stand alone

however when we havequite fairly i hopethus criticized dracula the fact remains that it is a book of unwonted interest and fascination accordingly we are bound to acknowledge that the reason for the immense popularity of this romance the reason why in spite of obvious faults it is read and rereadlies in the choice of subject and for this the author deserves all praise

it might not have seemed that dracula would have been a very promising subject for the stage but nevertheless it was dramatized by hamilton deans and produced at the wimbledon theatre on 9th march 1925 this version was performed in london at the little theatre 14th february 1927 on the preceding thursday the daily mirror published a photograph of the late mr brain stoker accompanied by the following paragraphs herewith one of the very few photographs of the late brain stoker who besides being sir henry irvings manager for years was an industrious novelist as i have already said a dramatic version of his most famous book dracula is to be done at the little on monday and the scene of the grand guignol plays is appropriate for the new piece i hear is so full of gruesome thrills that in the provinces women having been carried fainting from the auditorium truly we take our pleasures sadly

the dramatic adaptation is by hamilton deans whose grandfather colonel deans and the rev abraham stoker brams father lived on adjoining estates in county dublin young bram and hamilton deanes mother then a young girl were great friends stoker had the book dracula in his mind and the young people used to discuss its possibilities strange that it should be young hamilton deane who has dramatized the book and brought the play to london

at the little theatre the cast of dracula was as follows count dracula raymond huntley abraham van helsing hamilton deane dr seward stuart lomath jonathan harker bernard guest quincey p morris frieda hearn lord godalming peter jackson r m renfield bernard jukes the warden jack howarth the parlourmaid hilda macleod the housemaid betty murgatroyd mina harker dora mary patrick

p 336

by no stretch could it be called a good play whilst the presentation at the best can hardly be described as more than reasonably adequate in one or two instances the effects upon which so much depends and which obviously demanded the most scrupulous care were so clumsily contrived as to excite an involuntary smile it was only a step from the devilish to the ridiculous on monday night said the era 16th february 1927 very remarkable was a lady dressed in the uniform of a hospital nurse who sat in the vestibule of the theatre and it was bruited that her services were required by members of the audience who were overcome owing to the horrors of the drama i can only say that i find this canard impossible to believe quodcumque ostendis mihi sic incredulus odi as an advertisement and it can surely have been nothing else the attendance of a nurse was in deplorable taste i am informed that after the first few weeks a kind of epilogue was spoken when all the characters were assembled upon the stage and it was explained that the audience must not be distressed at what they had seen that it was comically intended for their entertainment so gross a lapse of good manners not to speak of the artistic indecorum is hardly credible69

confessedly the play was extremely weak and yet such is the fascination of this subject that it had an exceptional success and triumphantly made its way from theatre to theatre on 25th july 1927 dracula was transferred to the duke of yorks on the 29th august following to the prince of wales on 10th october to the garrick and all the while it was given to thronging houses it has also toured and at the present moment is still touring the provincial theatres with the most marked success the drama being given with more spirit and vigour than originally was the case at the little and wilfrid fletcher in particular playing the lunatic renfield with a real touch of wistful pathos and uncanny horror this is is extremely instructive and it is curious that the vogue of the vampire play in london should be repeated almost exactly after the interval of a century on 5th november 1927 a new version of dracula by charles morrel was presented at the court theatre warrington

in america the dramatization of dracula was produced at the shubert new haven 19th september 1927 this was given at the fulton new york upon the following 5th october

p 337

jonathan harker was acted by terence neil abraham van helsing by edward van sloan renfield by bernard jukes and count dracula by bela lugoni 

as i have before remarked the striking fact that an indifferent play should prove so successful can i think only be attributed to the fascination of the theme consciously or unconsciously it is realized that the vampire tradition contains far more truth than the ordinary individual cares to appreciate and acknowledge la fable du vampire est peutêtre la plus universelle de nos superstitions    elle a partout lautorité de la tradition elle ne manque ni de cello de la philosophic ni de celle de la médicine la théologie même en a parléembed"
