lets take a walk down on memory lane
when i was just a boy and i wasnt insane
back before the world got inside of my heart
before all the sickness almost tore me apart

corruption deception—a natural progression
denial was a drug that i couldnt refuse
now im just a puppet always singing for my supper
blame it on myself but i know it was you

prechorus
i know it was you

chorus
here we go again
life turns another corner
no way around it
i was born to fall behind

here i go again
life makes another loner
no way around it
you will never be my kind

youre not my kind

my dad was a killer a coldblooded guerrilla
something i could never perceive
mom was a survivor worked until it broke her
she always landed right on her feet

rejection infection—down the wrong direction
could never walk a day in their shoes
from a child to a leper feels like ive been severed
blame it on the world cause i know that its true

prechorus
i know its true

chorus
here we go again
life turns another corner
no way around it
i was born to fall behind

here i go again
life makes another loner
no way around it
you will never be my kind

youre not my kind
bridge
youre not my kind
youre not my kind
youre not my kind
youre not my kind

solo

chorus
here we go again
life turns another corner
no way around it
i was born to fall behind

here i go again
life makes another loner
no way around it
you will never be my kind

youre not my kind

outro
youre not my kindembed"
