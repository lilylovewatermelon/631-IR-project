i see you comb your hair and gimme that grin
its making me spin now spinnin within
before i melt like snow i say hello how do you do
how do you do
i love the way you undress now baby begin
do your caress honey my hearts in a mess
i love your blueeyed voice like tiny tim shines through
how do you do how do you do

chorus
how do you do do you do the things that you do
no one i know could ever keep up with you
how do you do did it ever make sense to you to say bye bye bye
how do you do do you do the things that you do
no one i know could ever keep up with you
how do you do did it ever make sense to you to say bye bye bye

postchorus

i see you in that chair with the perfect skin
well how have you been baby livin in sin
hey i gotta know did you say hello how do you do
how do you do

well here we are spending time in the louder part of town
and it feels like everythings surreal
when i get old i will wait outside your house
cause your hands have got the power meant to heal

chorus
how do you do do you do the things that you do
no one i know could ever keep up with you

no one i know could ever keep up with you
how do you do did it ever make sense to you to say bye bye bye
