threw you the obvious
and you flew with it on your back
a name in your recollection
down among a million same

prechorus
difficult not to feel a little bit
disappointed and passed over
when i look right through
to see you naked but oblivious
and you dont see me

verse 2
but i threw you the obvious
just to see if theres more behind
the eyes of a fallen angel
eyes of a tragedy

prechorus
here i am expecting just a little bit
too much from the wounded
but i see see through it all
see through see you
you might also likechorus
cause i threw you the obvious
to see what occurs behind
the eyes of a fallen angel
eyes of a tragedy oh well

bridge
oh well apparently nothing
apparently nothing at all

outro
you dont you dont you dont see me
you dont you dont you dont see me
you dont you dont you dont see me
you dont you dont you dont see me

you dont see me
you dont you dont you dont see me at all13embed"
