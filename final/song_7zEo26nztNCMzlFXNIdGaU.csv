your laugh
those eyes
your smile
your innocence
means everything to me
but you dont know baby

the way you hold me
when youre with your friends
you want me
means everything to me
but you dont know

we dont even talk no more
we dont even hold hands like we did before
we dont even know the reason why it came to be

that even though youre with me
you feel so far away
feel so far away
feel so far away
feel so far away
feel so far away
see jay sean liveget tickets as low as 61you might also likei kiss you intensly for some extasy
but somehow your lips feels so cold baby

were perfect arent we
in there eyes only
but you lie oh no
the spark as gone

we dont even talk no more
we dont even make love like we did before
we dont even know the reason why it came to be

that even though youre with me
you feel so far away
feel so far away
feel so far away baby girl i need you here baby girl i need you
feel so far away girl i need you
feel so far away

lets maybe take this like so we can see
how beautiful this love can be
and know we cant erase what we both feel
so lets fall back into what we had

that love just feels so far away
feel so far away
feel so far away come a little bit oh come a little bit oh
feel so far away
feel so far awayembed"
