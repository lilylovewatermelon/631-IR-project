im feeling sexy and free
like glitters raining on me
youre like a shot of pure gold
i think im bout to explode

refrain
i can taste the tension like a cloud of smoke in the air
now im breathing like im running cause youre taking me there
dont you know
you spin me out of control

prechorus
oohoohoohooh
we can do this all night
damn this love is skin tight
baby come on
oohoohoohooh
boom me like a bass drum
sparking up a rhythm
baby come on
oohoohoohooh

chorus
rock my world until the sunlight
make this dream the best ive ever known
dirty dancing in the moonlight
take me down like im a domino
every second is a highlight
when we touch dont ever let me go
dirty dancing in the moonlight
take me down like im a domino
