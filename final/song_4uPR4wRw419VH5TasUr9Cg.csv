cause id heard some song i used to hear back then a long time ago
i remember when even further back in another town
cause i saw something written i used to say back then hard to comprehend
and the question is was i more alive then than i am now
i happily have to disagree i laugh more often now
i cry more often now i am more me
but of course some days i just lie around and hardly exist
and cant tell apart what im eating from my hand or my wrist
cause flesh is flesh flesh as flesh as flesh the difference is thin
but life has a certain ability of breathing new life into me so i breathe it in
it tells me here we are and we all are here
and it still can make sense
if you just show up and present an honest face
instead of that grin
and the question is was i more alive then than i am now
i happily have to disagree i laugh more often now
i cry more often now i am more me
and the other day this new friend of mine said something to me
just because something starts differently doesnt mean its worth less
and i soaked it in how i soaked it in how i soaked it in
and just as to prove how right he was then you came
so im gonna give yes im gonna give im gonna give you a try
so im gonna give yes im gonna give im gonna give you a try

i happily have to disagree i laugh more often now
i cry more often now i am more meembed"
