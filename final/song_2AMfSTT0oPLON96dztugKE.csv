whoa girl
i wanna pull away from you
its been too long
i wanna walk away right now
i thought that our love was true
but all along i was wrong

chorus
my pillow bears a tear of a man in pain
our love i thought i could sustain
dont worry about me anymore
cause ill be gone by the morning time

verse 2
whoa girl
i poured out my heart to you
despite
you put a knife in my back straight through
i thought that our love was true
but all along i was wrong

chorus
my pillow bears a tear of a man in pain
our love i thought i could sustain
dont worry about me anymore
cause ill be gone by the morning time
