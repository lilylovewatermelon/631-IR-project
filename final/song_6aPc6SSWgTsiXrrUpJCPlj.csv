eightynine cents in the ashtray
halfempty bottle of gatorade rollin in the floorboard
that dirty braves cap on the dash
dog tags hangin from the rearview
old skoal can and cowboy boots
and a go army shirt folded in the back

prechorus
this thing burns gas like crazy but thats alright
people got their ways of copin oh and ive got mine

chorus
i drive your truck
i roll every window down
and i burn up
every back road in this town
i find a field i tear it up
til all the pains a cloud of dust
yeah sometimes
i drive your truck

verse 2
i leave that radio playin
that same ol country station where ya left it
yeah man i crank it up
and youd probably punch my arm right now
if you saw this tear rollin down on my face
hey man im tryin to be tough
prechorus
and momma asked me this mornin if id been by your grave
but that flag and stone aint where i feel you anyway

chorus
i drive your truck
i roll every window down
and i burn up
every back road in this town
i find a field i tear it up
til all the pains a cloud of dust
yeah sometimes
i drive your truck

bridge
ive cussed ive prayed ive said goodbye
shook my fist and asked god why
these days when im missin you this much

chorus
i drive your truck
i roll every window down
and i burn up
every back road in this town
i find a field i tear it up
til all the pains a cloud of dust
yeah sometimes brother sometimes
