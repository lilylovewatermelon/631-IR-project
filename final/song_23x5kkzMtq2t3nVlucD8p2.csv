twelve dollars an hour it dont really get too far
when a damned ole bottle of coke costs two and a dime
i know what ill do crawl up the holler in an hour or two
mix me up a big batch of mash start making my own moonshine

chorus
i mix my corn into the water when it gets a little hotter
not quite boiling but hot enough to scald
190 proof baby thats the truth
if the law tries to catch me ill run
flying down the road with a pickup bed full of alkyhaul

verse 2
well they say you can sell a jar of corn liquor
when a bushel of taters wont sell
and thats a good thing cause my crop went to pieces
when i spent the last eight months locked in jail
what i did is neither here nor there i never done nobody no harm
but a mans gotta do what a mans gotta do
when everything costs a leg and an arm

chorus
i mix my corn into the water when it gets a little hotter
not quite boiling but hot enough to scald
190 proof baby thats the truth
if the law tries to catch me ill run
flying down the road with a pickup bed full of alkyhaul
flying down the road with a pickup bed full of alkyhaulyou might also likeembed"
