so you showed me round your town
to hell again and back
our love has served to alienate all the friends that you depend on
i know it might seem odd
kid youre not the only one
i remember myself as a lonely child so i was
and you got me wrong
you got me wrong

chorus
wrong just seems so right
til the spark of morning light
and all those searching eyes
do they scald your tender hide

verse 2
remember what they said
theres no shortcut to a dream
its all blood and sweat
and life is what you manage in between
oh what you dont know
is youre too young and eager to love
this evening i see youre about to get into the ditch
that your old man dug
you might also likechorus
wrong just seems so right
til the spark of morning light
and all those searching eyes
do they scald your tender hide

bridge
see the stars align
ooh
and leave you behind
ooh
you want it so and i
ooh
i come by light of an autumn moon
ooh
sister you know enough
ooh
but for now just let it go
ooh
dont run dont rush
ooh
just flow
ooh

verse 3
through the give and take youve had to learn
how to cross the coals and not get burned
but youre really just a little girl
playing in the park til the sun goes down
outro
so twentyone arrives
one day and your time is up
no doubt you think you braided your own hair
so youre all grown up
should you wanna cross the line
which way do you wanna fight
pretend that love could help you find your way
but you got me wrong
yeah you got me wrong1embed"
