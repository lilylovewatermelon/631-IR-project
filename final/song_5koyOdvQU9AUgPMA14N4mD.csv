we are young but we have heart
born in this world as it all falls apart
we are strong but we dont belong
born in this world as it all falls apart

verse 1 johnny 3 tears
i see the children in the rain like the parade before the pain
i see the love i see the hate i see this world that we can make
i see the life i see the sky id give it all to see you fly
yes we wave this flag of hatred but youre the ones who made it
i watch the beauty of all our lives passing right before my eyes
i hear the hate in all your words all the words to make us hurt
we get so sick were so sick we never wanted all this
medication for the kids with no reason to live

prechorus johnny 3 tears
so we march to the drums of the damned as we come
watch it burn in the sun we are numb

chorus deuce
we are young but we have heart
born in this world as it all falls apart
we are strong but we dont belong
born in this world as it all falls apart

as we walk among these shadows in these streets these fields of battle
take it up we wear the mantle raise your hands with burning candles
hear us whisper in the dark in the rain you see the spark
feel the beating of our hearts fleeting hope as we depart
all together walk alone against all weve ever known
all weve ever really wanted was a place to call our home
but you take all we are the innocence of our hearts
made to kneel before the altar as you tear us apart

prechorus johnny 3 tears  deuce 
so we march to the drums of the damned as we come
watch it burn in the sun we are numb

chorus deuce
we are young but we have heart
born in this world as it all falls apart
we are strong but we dont belong
born in this world as it all falls apart
