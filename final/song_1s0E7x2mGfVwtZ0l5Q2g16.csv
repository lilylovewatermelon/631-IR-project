i was smiling like a boy that just stole shit
when you told me youd hold it
my late mamas ring
and id sneak away at the end of each day
to write sonnets for you i could sing
it was cold in october
when you rolled yourself over
to pull on my shoulder to say
“it took a mighty long time and too much wasted wine
to find a man who looks at me this way”

chorus
but id fight any roughneck id stop any river
if it meant that i could just lie here forever
in the grips of a woman that sends shivers down spines
makes you recall your forgotten good times

verse 2
when you wake in the mornin
to the sound of me snorin
my ragged face by your side
i pray that you know
all my dreams and my hopes
have you holding me the day that i die
and i know im nothin but i am not bluffin
when i say youre meant for the sky
cause beauty that holy and a heart so kind
deserves a place it can fly

but id fight any roughneck id stop any river
if it meant that i could just lie here forever
in the grips of a woman
sends shivers down spines
it makes you recall your forgotten good times
yeah id fight any roughneck id stop any river
if it meant that i could just lie here forever
in the grips of a woman that sends shivers down spines
it makes you recall your forgotten good times

outro
i was smiling like a boy that just stole shit
when you told me youd hold it
my late mamas ring
and id sneak away at the end of each day
to write sonnets for you i could singembed"
