the girl who always says yes wants to scream no
takes over everyones stress huh ignores her own
the life and soul of the party but loves to stay home
she says shes not brokenhearted but cries on her own

prechorus
playin pretend i shouldnt hide it
it isnt right bein a liar
im crossin the line dancin with fire
when im not fine should i deny it

chorus
cause im goin crazy when im not okay
i keep prayin that the cracks dont show my pain huh
cause even when im fallin i say my life is like a dream huh
but im fightin through a nightmare
cause im not really being me ohohohohoh
so you dont really know me huh ohohohohoh

verse 2
the girl who starts all the jokes just make her laugh
preaches the dos and the donts but loves to be bad
smiles when they guess who shes lovin what they say makes her mad
she says im fine i need nothing but she hopes for your hand
