the snow and wind has frozen the hearts of man
but we ride
we ride

many days ago we left our home
with swords to ride into the night
fighting side by side to destroy our foes
and leave them without life

we stop consider the land that we travelled
our maps at home direction unravelled
but we ride
we ride

many days ago we left our homes
with swords to ride into the night
fighting side by side to destroy our foes
and leave them without life

so much time has passed since we left our land
that weve become concerned
and well never find the battle
that we should have fought and won

but we wont stop searching
see dethklok liveget tickets as low as 47you might also likelost but still we ride
search until we die

we ride
we ride

hungry and tired the frigid plain yields little
we trudge on further eating pride and snow thats brittle

we ride
we ride

we come upon a witch who takes us in
to let us share her mighty fire
she asks of us our story and we lie and say
we ride around for hire
she asks us if wed like to have her map
and points us in some direction
but we are far too proud and strong so we keep silent
and ignore her suggestion

lost but still we ride
search until we die
all the fault of pride
the gods weep in the night
lost but still we ride
search until we die
all the fault of pride
the gods weep in the night

we ride
we rideembed"
