i see you in the morning feel your fingers in my hair
sometimes i still pretend youre there
it hits me without warning your reflection walking by
but i know its only in my mind

prechorus yebba  sam smith both
will you show me the piece of my heart ive been missin
wont you give me the part of myself that i cant give back
will you show me the piece of my heart ive been missin
cause id kill for you and darlin you know that

chorus yebba sam smith both
so ill light up a cigarette
ill drink it down til theres nothin left
cause i sure cant get no sleep
and lord knows theres no relief
you held my heart in your fingertips
so now i drown in my bitterness
oh i cant get no sleep
and i sure wont i sure wont find no peace
no peace
