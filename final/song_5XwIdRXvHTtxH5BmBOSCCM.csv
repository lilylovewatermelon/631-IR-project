verse 1 michael calum calum  michael
shes a good girl shes daddys favorite
hes saved for harvard he knows shell make it
shes good at school shes never truant
she can speak french i think shes fluent
cause every night she studies hard in her room
at least thats what her parents assume
but she sneaks out the window to meet with her boyfriend
heres what she told me the time that i caught em

chorus all
she said to me forget what you thought
cause good girls are bad girls that havent been caught
so just turn around and forget what you saw
cause good girls are bad girls that havent been caught

verse 2 calum michael luke luke  michael
well shes a good girl a straight astudent
shes really into all that selfimprovement
i swear she lives in that library
but if you ask her shell say thats where youll find me
but if you look then you wont find her there
she may be clever but she just acts too square
cause in the back of the room where nobody looks nobody looks
shell be with her boyfriend shes not reading books
