i grew up an only child in the suburb of the city
i spent my days alone my only friend was a stray kitty
called sardine

ogie
yeah i thought it was hilarious to call a cat a kind of fish
she played hard to get hissin while she scratched me
what she was tryin to say was ogie come and catch me
i learned quickly
that perseverance stood between a cat and her new best friend me

oh im gonna do this right
show you im not movin
wherever you go i wont be far to follow
oh im gonna love you so
youll learn what i already know
i love you means youre never ever ever gettin rid of me
