at night i lie awake and this man isis burning
every waking moment he haunts me
i think hes coming
i know hes coming
i see someone elsein the fogby the lake
and hes holding something
who is he

ted smooth straight face you remember

verse 1 fabolous
yeah its gettin spooky out here
all the nino browns done turned pookie out here
no cool niggas its just goofies out here
i mean niggas is eating pork wearing kufis out here
through it all stood tall doofy out here
ten toes down im on two feet out here
truthfully out here ill be too flee out here
getting fly no bullshit im the 23 out here
from jordans you aint see shoutout to carolina
to all baby mes i see all you harold miners
mixtape threepeats i fadeaway at the gogo
with girls thatll spread they legs open for a logo ay
check out the swag yo i walk like a ball player
to the locker room im back to cock it to em
toast to all you niggas that was talkin caca to em
we on a different fl≈çh we aint sendin vodka to em
the shots that we giving make you send a doctor to em
bet he say aah when it blockablocka to em
now he in a awkward room tryna lock a goon
like the shooter had a hood on mighta been dr doom
sounded like a fifth or a nine couldnt tell though
all a sudden thunder it mighta been hoodie melo
you soft as pudding jello well come to your hood and hello
wave it at everybody aint tryna be put in jail though
all i know is that the lambo look good in yellow
and i be swervin potholes in every hood and ghetto
lame nigga swerve i lame nigga swerve
its been ten years and you the same nigga swerve
i just gotta keep on keepin on
but im not gon be the one you keep on sleepin on

i just laugh at you niggas then come after you niggas

hahaaah you remember
im dead wrong you wanna live i cant let you
you at full speed im walking i still catch you
mr voorhees good looking i destroy these
these niggas aint bosses they workers and employees
i came out of the lake but i be in the boondocks
flannel or overall work boots tube socks
ill put something right through your face from out the toolbox
niggas get hot and make the news i make the news hot
you can be as hard as whoever i crack craniums
you know all my killings are brutal and spontaneous
i like this pop out soon as you hit the light switch
run and then all a sudden you fall like the white chicks
might have to crush your adams apple with the vice grips
you never see me during the day i play the night shift
cartilage flesh and bone damp gristle
be my guest go ahead and hide i cant miss you
you already know i reside at camp crystal
lake dismantle your face revamp tissue
power from the hockey mask james st patrick
three bodies in one night thats a hat trick
pay the plug soon as you finish thats a backflip
spend six make 12 back thats a crack flip
sad part about it you boys aint even ready
preferably my weapon of choice is the machete
screaming at the top of your lungs before i mangle you
zip you up in your sleeping bag before i strangle you
yeah i had it in me since a youngin
when you hear that kill kill kill you dont see me but im comin
everybody gotta die every man every woman
kill kill kill yeah it aint even no sense in runnin
kill kill kill nah my name ring around the nation
how the crime scene was left they could tell that it was jason3embed"
