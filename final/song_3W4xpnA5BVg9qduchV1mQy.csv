youve seen so many faces that i never seen before
i left an unrewarding message telling you to come on
overdramatic automatically assume ill stay the same

chorus
cause theres a change in pressure
were never gonna lie to you
change in pressure
my broken veins say that if my heart stops beating
change in pressure
well bleed the same way
change in pressure
oh my broken veins say

verse 2
well i stay tuned and listen to the news
and try to fall asleep at night
because im living in a house with just three walls
so im always getting recognised

chorus
cause theres a change in pressure
were never gonna lie to you
change in pressure
my broken veins say that if my heart stops beating
change in pressure
well bleed the same way
change in pressure
oh my broken veins say

chorus
cause theres a change in pressure
