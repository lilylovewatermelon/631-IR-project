im talking to the mirror again but its not listening
im cleaning my dirty mind like a toilet but it wont give in
im drinking spirits in the hopes that i will find myself one
but all i can rectify is that the partys just begun

chorus
partys just begun
partys just begun
partys just begun
partys just begun

verse 2
i feel like falling asleep and never waking up
its not that my glass is empty but i need another cup
when all of the doors around me just shut one by one
i feel like falling asleep but the partys just begun

chorus
partys just begun
partys just begun
partys just begun
partys just begun

verse 3
shaky shaky steps in the middle of the day
a fire in my path and a cool decay
of limbs and tooth under my skin
oh freedom where do i begin
im changing my inflection and how i say the words
maybe it will sound like something theyve never heard
oh death of the party
i picked up the chalice of malice
and drank till i was full i drank till i was full
i was thirsty but i drank till i was full
i drank til i til i til i was full
see nelly furtado liveget tickets as low as 1538you might also likebridge
theres a fever in my bones that i know so well
i keep my head low low low to avoid the swell
but itll be cold in hell itll be cold in hell
before they put me in that chamber
so im cleaning up as fast as i can
im cleaning up as fast as i can
cause you cant unbreak what you break you cant unfake the very fake
you cannot fuel without a tank
no you cant unbreak what you break what you break

chorus
partys just begun
partys just begun
partys just begun
partys just begun
partys just begun
partys just begun
partys just begun
partys just begunembed"
