well i want you to notice
to notice when im not around
i know that your eyes see straight through me
and speak to me without a sound

chorus
and i want to hold you
protect you from all of the things ive already endured
and i want to show you
show you all the things that this life has in store for you
and ill always love you
the way that a father should love his daughter

verse 2
when i walked out this morning
i cried as i walked to the door
i cried about how long id be away for
i cried about leaving you all alone

chorus
and i want to hold you
protect you from all of the things ive already endured
and i want to show you
show you all the things that this life has in store for you
and ill always love you
the way that a father should love his daughter

verse 3
so i wanted to say this
cause i wouldnt know where to begin
to explain to you what i have been through
to explain where your daddy has been

chorus
so i want to hold you
protect you from all of the things ive already endured
and i want to show you
show you all the things that this life has in store for you
and ill always love you
the way that a father should love his daughter
