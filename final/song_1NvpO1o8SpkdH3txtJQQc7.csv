couldnt fall asleep all night
i tried with all my might
i thought i knew what you want
it isnt all that nice
but i guess it will suffice
its hard to know what you want

prechorus
could you be
a little less sour were rottin by the hour
and my hearts rotten too
in every film i watch im on the side of the bad guy
so turn around and show me that im better

chorus
some people got an apple some people got a tangerine
look around and all i see is people happy with what theyre given
life is pretty sweet im told
i guess im just shit outta luck growing a lemon tree
im gonna burn it down and grow me somethin bettеr
heyah heyah

verse 2
blood on my hands im on the fеnce i double down
a swing and a miss a kick in the ribs in trouble now
came from the dirt back in the ground when i die
but ima survive i got my ways
oh oh
