damn

verse 1
she looks so good in that white dress
at the far end of the aisle
standing where i should be standing
some other man on his face theres a smile
i just walked in sat down silent
i stood outside for awhile
wondering why did i come here
face it you messed up and now
shes with somebody else
yeah yeah

chorus
and now all i can do is smile and fade into the background
ohoh ohoh ohoh oh
ill say congratulations and ill fade into the background

verse 2
such a lovely reception
i sat here sipping ros√©
then we catch eyes for a second
both of us smile then quickly look away
its funny you dont know what you got its funny you dont
til you aint got it no more
put down my glass grab the bottle
i throw it back and i shout she with somebody else mm
