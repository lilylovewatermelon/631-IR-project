smash the brook to the pipe and smoke it to the pipe and smoke it
its strictly knights or nuthin
black knights black knights
west coast wutang killa bees knights or nuthin
its like disease in the breeze
its strictly knights or nuthin
now we gonna rock it

warcloud
eh eh
nowhere man a scorpion in the hour glass
crows pickin at flesh they got devoured fast
power blast lyrics that knock you through thirty walls
now stalk through the pitchblack forest with dirty claws
war in the brickyard clouds in the sky
a grasshopper has five eyes family ties
moses in the hole great day in the morning
old man minerva battles with the muffin man
i rule the fuckin lands zombie at the drivein
lonely vision a snake eating a pony
lyrics may cause vomiting even death
eighty men lay in the lot with broke necks
swell em like rappers jaws got a sponsor
wutang niggas move like classic monsters
i weigh more than all of iceland
a toy monkey playin the cymbols in an antique shop
ima stampede pop
cold beer and wont sleep
standin on the terror smoke signal with verbal gold leaf
big warcloud creator of all things
lord of lords king of kings
diamond in the sling one world to wash
saturdays room be mars on the frost
you might also likesinger
its knights of nuthin

crisis
who could fuck with black knights
the type to snatch mics
when its goin down its goin down
you aint knowin you goin out
how my style control the crowd
breed niggas expose the style
of a red nigga dead niggas aint nann now
fuckin with the flow let you cats know we swarm digital
how we bring the punishment still runnin shit
still never love a bitch give em nothin but nut and dick
cuz bitches aint shit but hos and tricks
but most niggas aint shit but hos with dicks
we real you bitch probly the type to sip where you piss
you wish you could step to this mic specialist
you got no win im like that weed you cant hold in
that increase ya heart beat and leave ya lungs swollen
you didnt step into some shit ya silly ass dove in
head first my click let lead burst we network
state to state we make the fake migrate
annihiliate those that violate we play for high stakes

chorus x2 all singer
knights or nuthin is the law that we live by knights or nuthin
die by from the home of the driveby
walk by take a trip on the darkside knights or nuthin
underground hiphop we got this shit ziplocked
knights or nuthin is the law that we live by knights or nuthin
die by from the home of the driveby
walk by take a trip on the darkside knights or nuthin
underground hiphop we got this shit ziplocked
knights or nuthin
doc doom
knights or nuthin nigga
im cold blooded the type that like to get high in public
doc dooms the shit when i spit it niggas love it
cant get enough of these rough rhymes or these raw beats
break the best rappers ass down like a stalled jeep
keep flow for all you socalled rap pros
you act bolo niggas is the ones that brought the gat foe
asshole what should i give you a pass fo
first you was tough now you dont want no hassle
see big guns make big niggas turn bashful
whip out heat they give you everything you ask fo
everything from diamond rings to cash flow
hand the shit over gradual then slide off casual
we mash fo cream and respect im mean with a tec
west coast style take you off of yo set
cuz now yall niggas fuckin wit vets
knights or nuthin is the motto kill you off if you aint comin correct

rugged monk
clean sweep took the first pitch knocked the homerun
black knights known to grab mics leave the spots full blown
you know motto the knights or nothin so stop frontin
like you aint heard this high pitch through your twelveinch
kenwood alpines i keep those sixbynines thumpin
jumpin jumpin like destiny i laced it with the rugged recipe
you know my technique on or off beat
speak wit ah digi slurred speech but aggressive with the mic
on mine its strictly black knights
steal the spotlight show niggas how to rock mics
the right way spit like ah k monk
the conqueror smash your sponsor
learn the lesson from the black knight lethal silent weapon
