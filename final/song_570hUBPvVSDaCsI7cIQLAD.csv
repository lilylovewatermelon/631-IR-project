ive been trying hard to keep the static low
drown out the trouble you know its gonna come
every day away our distance oh it grows
further and farther so close to letting go

prechorus
reach out a hand to me
its not over
keep all our memories
bring them closer

chorus
and i wonder how you sleep at night
you know that its not just alright
your static is so far from me

verse 2
ive been trying hard to get you all alone
seems like the good days are never gonna come
everything you say i hear that awful tone
youre just so tired those words are not your own

bridge
dont let them catch you
those fans that you wear
they cling all around you
and never could care
you might also likechorus
and i wonder how you sleep at night
you know that its not just alright
your static is so far from me

and i wonder how you sleep at night
you know that its not just alright
your static is so far from me1embed"
