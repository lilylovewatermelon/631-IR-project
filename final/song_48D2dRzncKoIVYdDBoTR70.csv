i wait around for that still small center
from saint to sinner
well which one is it
just who do you think you are
just who do you think you are
well who did you call to get this
well is it who i think it is
i swear to god im gonna kill him
well is it who i think it is
you always knew it was on purpose
yeah whats the point if it dont serve its purpose
splintered but focused youre as good as gold
youre built from distraction so brilliantly dull
i had a better friend in my worst of plans
i had a better friend
than i ever had in either one of you

chorus adam lazzara fred mascherino
well i never made a scene
well they came to me
i never made a scene
i didnt have to
well they came to me
i didnt have to i didnt have to
well i never made a scene
i didnt have to i didnt have to
well i never made a scene

i always hoped to avoid the issues
all the time
got me alone so i couldnt address you
it will still speak for it itself
home is where you make it love dont get yourself confused
besides whats it to you
i traded in my conscience for your
for your confidence
conscience for your confidence
attacked my lungs with lies to pass the time
lungs with lies
i made states move like regular days
states move more like days

chorus adam lazzara fred mascherino
i didnt have to i didnt have to
well i never made a scene
i didnt have to i didnt have to
well i never made a scene
i didnt have to i didnt have to
well i never made a scene
i didnt have to i didnt have to
well i never made a scene

bridge adam lazzara
i never made a scene
well they came to me
i never made a scene
well they came to me
chorus adam lazzara fred mascherino
i didnt have to i didnt have to
well i never made a scene
i didnt have to i didnt have to
well i never made a scene
i didnt have to i didnt have to
well i never made a scene

well i never made a sceneembed"
