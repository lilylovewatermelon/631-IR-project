some children died the other day
we fed machines and then we prayed
puked up and down in morbid faith
you should have seen the ratings that day

2005 against all gods mix
i dont know love i never cared to and im not sure if i ever will
im a student of hate i know now that god is a medium
whatever i expected to save me from this life is no longer the one i can hate
it is the people that made me it is the people i wanted so much to be
i may only find love in their destruction
