i’m on the train that’s pullin the sick and twisted
makin the most of the ride before we get arrested
we’re all wasted
and we’re not going home tonight

verse 2
covered in black we lack the social graces
just like an animal we crawl out of our cages
they can’t tame us
so if you’re one of us get on the bus

chorus 1
if you’re a freak like me
wave your flag
if you’re a freak like me
get off your ass
it’s our time now
to let it all hang out
so shout if you’re a freak like me
you were born to burn
this aint no disease you don’t need a cure
it’s our time now to come out
if you’re a freak like me
if you’re a freak like me

so write your name in gasoline
and set that shit on fire
