i was born across the river
in the mountains where i call home
lord times were good there
dont know why i ever roamed

chorus
oh tennessee river and a mountain man
we get together anytime we can
oh tennessee river and a mountain man
we play together in mother natures band

verse 2
this mountain king done left his throne
on the tennessee river and his mountain home
but im going back leaving today
for my homeland so far away
driving to dixie wasting no time
back to the good life i left behind
going down to the river with my fishing line
climb back up the mountain by supper time

chorus
oh tennessee river and a mountain man
we get together anytime we can
oh tennessee river and a mountain man
we play together in mother natures band

on the tennessee river walking hand in hand
going to raise a family lord settle down
where peace and love can still be found

chorus
oh tennessee river and a mountain man
we get together anytime we can
oh tennessee river and a mountain man
we play together in mother natures band

oh tennessee river and a mountain man
we get together anytime we can
oh tennessee river and a mountain man
we play together in mother natures band

oh tennessee river and a mountain man
