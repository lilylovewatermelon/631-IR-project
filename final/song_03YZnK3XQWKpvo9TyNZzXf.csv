shadows fill my mind up
zeroes tell me my times up
i lost count so long ago
maybe my hearts numb
dont hold my hands accountable
theyre young and theyre dumb

verse 2
drive through the timezones
escape out of my minds own hold love
i lost you not long ago
heaven knows im miserable
hell takes all the credit though till the day is done

chorus
the emotion is suddenly out of me
the emotion is buildin up inside of me
and what youre looking for is suddenly out of reach
the emotion the emotion

verse 3
islands under eyelids
swimmin through the silence
you were all that all that all that i needed
and were fallin fallin into the deep end now

the emotion is suddenly out of me
the emotion is buildin up inside of me
and what youre looking for is suddenly out of reach

bridge
rolling through the dark
carved into the light of day
both eyes are open now im runnin
i wont turn around for you

chorus
the emotion is suddenly out of me
the emotion is building up inside of me
and what youre looking for is suddenly out of reach
