the how i cant recall
but im staring at what once was the wall
separating east and west
now they meet amidst the broad daylight

chorus
so this is where you are and this is where i am
somewhere between unsure and a hundred

verse 2

im banking on the rest to clear away
cause we have spoken everything
everything short of i love you

chorus
you right where you are from right where i am
somewhere between unsure and a hundred
somewhere between unsure and a hundred

bridge
and whos to say its wrong
and whos to say that its not right
where we should be for now
