would it be true to say that i ordered you
or is it you that ordered me
i could say you are the only one i see
but i cant stop at two or three

chorus
and i am afraid to need you so
and i am too sober not to know
that you may be my problem not my love

verse 2
would i be lying if i said you were too sweet
though im quite sure youve got a bite
i could say that you were just a special treat
though we both know thats not right

chorus
and i am afraid to need you so
and i am too sober not to know
that you may be my problem not my love
cause you go down smooth

verse 3
would it be true to say you go to my head
or is that sentiment too frank
oh i could say you make it sweet to go to bed
but then its you that breaks the bank
see lake street dive liveget tickets as low as 41you might also likechorus
and i am afraid to need you so
and i am too sober not to know
that you may be my problem not my love

cause you go down smooth
cause you go down smooth
cause you go down smooth—
cause you go down smooth

outro

would it be true yeah
