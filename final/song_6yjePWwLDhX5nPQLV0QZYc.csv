verse 1
their power’s fear and it surrounds me
their signs you can see
one day we will wake the walking zombies
‘til then we pray ooh

the king and his ghost are laughing at me
these signs you can see
one day we will listen for the sirens
til then we pray

verse 2
skeletons
marching army
guns
drop your feet
im scared
im duke ellington
my mother said thered be days like this
but one of the fires lit made her piss
calling all zombies all up inside me
transforming vampires right beside me
and you cant run
‘cause you did youd be dead
and the walls cant roll from the side of my head
i beat the drool my beats are cool
but here’s last kiss all suckers they will cease to exist
i cant entertain what itd be to be human
lay waste to cities leave towns in ruin
i am a robot

whole arsenal stock ready to blow
lastly you see me be 3 by 3
firing these things called tnt

these things called tnt
these things called tnt
fire
they call me tnt
these things called tnt

so we ran home like a base hit
safe
life is whatever you think it is
so what you think this is

verse 4 curtn

hop on this white horse
ride to the sunset
