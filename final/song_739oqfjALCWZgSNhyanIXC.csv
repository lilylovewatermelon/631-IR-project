she went out for cigarettes and never came home
and i swallowed the sun and screamed and wailed
straight down to the dirt so i could find her trail
spread out across the great divide
well i just came to talk saint valentine
i never pictured you living here with the rats and the vines
aint that my old heart hanging out on your lines
youre all fucked up saint valentine
now i circle the bars on the promenade
while the girls in the glass theyre just throwing me shade
and im saving my coins up for jingling jane
shes out plucking strings in the pouring pouring
shes out plucking strings in the pouring rain

see im all crooked feet saint valentine
ive circled this map til it caught on fire
now grace shes left you just skin and bone
well you hang up your hat but you cant call it home
oh youve tried and youve tried but you cant call it home
youre the loneliest one saint valentine
youre the loneliest one saint valentine
well youre all fucked up saint valentinesee gregory alan isakov liveget tickets as low as 40you might also like4embed"
