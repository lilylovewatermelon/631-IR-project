damn kai you goin crazy

verse 1
i be in the loop she be in a group yeah
brodie want her friend throw em alleyoop yeah
turned somethin to nothin bruh im livin proof
how can i lose when we the whos whos
still runnin round with mohawk jet ready pack the goyard
people probably think i show off i aint even give it yet
runnin up a silly check stayin off the internet
share the stage with billie eilish turnt at any given time
personal partners pillow talkin cause i got rich without em
only thing they should be sayin is baby keep it solid
we aint even deep as we used to be this shit slick divided
bruh aint got no hustle or nothin so he gon stick to violence
i be known to run down im dialed in so i cant speak about it
she know im a gangster she love me i bring the freak up out her
cant play with me you know i come trim im in a different league
im tired of showin what i can get done what you gon do for me
fortythousand miles up in the air only time i get some zs
fullcourt press foot on they neck and i cant let em breathe
blood sweat and tears come with this check it aint nowhere near easy
had to fall back you know how that go we only speakin briefly
hope im not too much to handle city nigga from atlanta
i spent my last check on ammo this is not a regular lambo
hundred thousand dollars kit couldve put down on another lambo
dont be in the mix i built this shit forever havin say so
this shit gon get serious about my money this aint no fuckin playdoh
brodie down for double homicide i try to tell him lay low
c dont like to drive but he spin good im on the way to clayco
ak47s in the spots before they made the draco

verse 2
overbuying cars i snatch the brabus just for motivation
shootout at the spot today tomorrow we in a new location
free all of the guys i hope yall beat the case or get probation
stash it at my mama house four hundred bands in the ventilation
now look how im living i bought a house for the money to stay at
right when niggas think that i got soft ima pull up and spray at
living like a don might smoke a blunt in the back of the maybach
pull up like your mama with the switch why the fuck would you say that”
you can do it first ima do it worst gotta double the pay back never take it personal show no mercy bruh taught me that way back
condo to get off i was always taught dont tell hoes where you stay at
keep a stash house you cant take nothing to the spot where you lay at
never be a bother if you off me no problem just say that
never runnin off so if i owe you i got you ill pay that
give this shit my all so when im old i can chill and just lay back
really from the bottom so the trenches is where i feel safe at
chorus
im just tryna ball and live hundred mill im calling dibs
im the boss pay all the bills im the golden child for real
go off in this bitch i will i been on my grind for years
and im out here grinding still i need equity to sign the deal
im just tryna ball and live hundred mill im calling dibs
im the boss pay all the bills im the golden child for real
go off in this bitch i will i been on my grind for years
and im out here grinding still i need equity to sign the deal9embed"
