verse
yeah my life is wonderful but that dont mean im comfortable
you might see it black and white but he might see it colorful
believin anything they tell you you so gullible
and yeah i got some cheese im crunchin on the side like lunchables
when brodie tote that 38 he feel untouchable
yellow tape him put his family on the tv like the huxtables
im feelin indestructible the juice got me dysfunctional
and bein down dont last forever that shit its adjustable
arpll turn his hairstyle to the doodie lo
trdee my dookie bro we played with cards since yugioh swear
brodie ate him with the chopstick it aint xushi ko
when the score go up i do the foolio like julio
you be sippin champagne i be rosin at the jewelry store
the way these bitches acting you would think they playing movie roles
acting like he had exotic and pulled up with pookie bow
voyage was fantastic off the shrooms i feel like coolio
wake up bathing ape
hit the road and face an eighth
8am im making plays
get up go cant take a break
you aint tryna race for chicken ricky bobby shake n bake
spot dont never close pull up whenever its like steak n shake
only reason that you dripping got your fit off klarna
guarantee she still gon catch you if you dip on karma
brodie said he ever fall off he gon have to hit the garda
delta one im flying in a bed from la to laguardia
super smacked i just poured two fours miguel cabrera
all that capping that you doing might as well go sell new era
yeah my arms im finna bear em run up got the right to air em
said you payin what for jacks let me go run it by my arabs
the flower that im rollin up alludes to a cardoon
i can guess his outfit fore i see him he a cartoon
thinking he got golden vs1s he rocking jargoon
think he swimming round the deep untouched i got a harpoon
you cant see my bitch she in the lead like angel reese
brother turned to cain but thats alright wont let him abel me
nope im the undertaker
boy im with the troublemakers
ill pop out like im kylo ren stick got a double laser
if i ever finished college wouldve got the hustle major
bet we get to chewin like some gum these fullies bubble breakers
everybody asking me for one im trying to juggle favors
tryna stack it to the ozone told her we can cuddle later
why you tryna solve a puzzle you aint got the pieces for
all this shit thats floatin through my mind come on just keep recording
yeah im eating mortons not to mention what i drink a fortune
yeah i might catch em out of town i might catch em here
tryna catch up to this whip gon need an extra gear
tryna catch up to the kid gon need some extra years
you cant even hide it pussy i can smell the fear
