i just stood there in the cold
i just stood there in the cold
i know i won’t see you again
i won’t see you again
and i just stood there in the cold
i just stood there in the cold
i know i won’t see you again
i won’t see you again

verse 1
and i don’t really understand
what you’re after
cause i was looking for you
only looking for you

verse 2
we used to feel
like the world was passing us by
but now it’s only you that’s passing me by
it’s only you that’s passing me by
its only you thats passing me by
its only you thats passing me by

chorus
i just stood there in the cold
i just stood there in the cold
i know i won’t see you again
i won’t see you again
and i just stood there in the cold
i just stood there in the cold
i know i won’t see you again
i won’t see you againyou might also likeembed"
