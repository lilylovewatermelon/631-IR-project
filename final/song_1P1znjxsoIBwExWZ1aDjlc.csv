get ready for the big revival
get ready for the big revival

verse 1
get ready for the big revival
cmon everybody get in the van
theres a little church on eagle mountain
its called the blood of the blessed lamb

chorus
if your faith aint strong enough child you might wind up dead
praise the lord and pass me a copperhead

verse 2
reverend jones he struts and dances
while the guitar plays amazing grace
he testifies in tongues of fire
with tears of joy runnin down his face

chorus
he aint sure and we aint sure what exactly he said
praise the lord and pass me a copperhead

bridge
you wont find many hypocrites
thatll take a chance on gettin bit
but a true believer can survive
rattlesnakes and cyanide
see kenny chesney liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likeverse 3
when you hold that deadly viper
keep the holy spirit in your mind
do not lose your concentration
or that serpents bound to strike

chorus
either way you wont forget the first time that you said
praise the lord and pass me a copperhead
praise the lord and pass me a copperhead

outro
oh thats right
praise the lord and pass me a copperhead1embed"
