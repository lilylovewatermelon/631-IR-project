verse 1
yeah used to wanna be a superhero
flyin round with a cape catchin bad guys

young motherfucker with a mad mind
made a couple million off of rap lines

came from the basement under that floor floor
you dont come close you dont even know im the goat hmm
you dont need to know how i go
cause i know what you want
