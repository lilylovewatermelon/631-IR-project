the beat did nothing but accentuate this concept by incorporating the isley brothers classic song whos that lady rahki brought in a crew of live musicians to replay parts of the song threw in a vintagesounding drum loop and added in a bass solo from frequent kendrick collaborator thundercat to complete the anthem of positivity7 hudson mohawke  chimes produced by hudson mohawkethis cut from hudson mohawke was the 2014 version of “blood on the leaves” after the success of its apple commercial apple decided to make the default ringtone in the iphone 6 but this caused the phones to bend and was never included in the final design the blaring horns and bass make this the perfect song to do just about anything to skydive take illicit substances fall in love  whatever tickles your fancy6 prhyme  wishin produced by dj premierfour different beats god knows how many samples and unlike the recent emergence of kanye  20 other people tracks the legendary dj premier holds the production down on his own  although primo is known for sampling an abundance of artists “wishin’” and the rest of prhyme only samples music from the catalogue of adrian younge aka the guy who does crazy film soundtracks and records with ghostface killah this track is full of old school boom bap drums guitar riffs scratches and works its way from fast to slow and back to full throttle with royce  common flowing over every inch it’s the type of beat to hype you up and make you ready to catch a body on a tuesday night5 ras kass  h20 produced by apollo brownsimply put apollo brown is one of the best samplers out there on “h20” he effortlessly chopped freda payne’s “the way we were” splicing vocals and combining the soulful bliss with deep kicks and a distinct snare although all of blasphemy was constructed in a similar manner “h20” was our favorite solely because it blends with the song content flawlessly creating a quenching elixir if you’re thirsty for soulful hiphop this beat will leave you refreshed4 flying lotus  never catch me produced by flying lotusthe comeback of king kendrick lamar occurs here with a perfect mesh from a flurry of genres one that can only be executed from the unique flying lotus the eerie synths give us a touch of the afterlife and coupled with the delicate piano keys it aligns perfectly with the music video a set of heart racing drums is flawlessly added to keep the tempo up for kendrick while providing a callback for fans to the good old section80 days if kendrick’s rhymes don’t melt your mind midway through the track you’ll make it to thundercat’s jawdropping bass solo which should take you on a psychedelic out of body experience between the sun and the moon before gracefully hitting the repeat button a thousand times3 pusha t  lunch money produced by kanye west and charlie heatas of recent king push and good music founder kanye west have whipped up a unique sound that’s sure to inspire generations to come ye in particular has displayed a hunger to reinvent himself continuously displaying that he can continue to set trends in hiphop

unlike typical instrumentals this one is carried solely by the sample   jeanjacques perreys eva this clears the way for pushas flawless cadence leading to a dope track overall in the words of hova “kanyeezy you did it again you a genius”2 drake  0 to 100the catch up produced by boi1da frank dukes 40 and nineteen85drake got a hit out of this beat in more than one way  he reportedly stole the beat from diddy which led to a brawl that ended up sending drizzy to the er can we really blame him for using it though this beat is dope once the song took the internet by storm it was obvious that the beat was primarily responsible for its success in fact several notable artists such as joel ortiz meek mill and juicy j released their own remixes

as far as the production goes the main portion was sampled from composer frank dukes’ “vibez” a song that was featured one of his clearancefree sample packs although boi1da’s contributions were minimal the banging drum pattern perfectly offsets the smooth melody young producers should heed this  you can find a hit sample anywhere1 rick ross  sanctified produced by dj mustard kanye west and mike deanwith the stellar year that la native dj mustard has had its only fitting that his collaboration with kanye west and mike dean sanctified would be 1 on our list

the part that had everybody talking was betty wrights prayer hands emojievoking intro  a bit that nearly everyone thought had been sampled contrary to popular belief mike dean composed her parts and brought her in to record specifically for this song  no samples were used

another fun fact  kanyes only role in the production was slowing the instrumental down however this would prove crucial to its success  the track originated an entirely new sound that would later be replicated in the two producers second collaboration big seans i dont fuck with you92embed"
