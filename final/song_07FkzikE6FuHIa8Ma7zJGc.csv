i heard you told your friends that im just not your type
if thats how you really feel then whyd you call last night
you say all i ever do is just control your life
but how you gonna lie like that
how you gonna lie like that

verse 1
yeah i heard you said i aint the type for you
i dont regret it though i learned from it
they should have you locked up for all the time you stole from us woo
took you out when i had no money
only person that you ever cared about was you thats why its so funny
you want somebody thatll keep you warm at night
then tell me why you actin cold to me
you aint the only one to blame no im the one that made you rich
when i bought every lie you sold to me
yeah heard you threw away the pictures
but you still got the memories of us
so i guess that dont really make a difference
flippin through em in your head
got you textin me all hours of the night
yeah you told me that you needed distance
whats the deal with you
you say you want a man that keeps it real
then why you mad when i get real with you
you want someone to pay the bills for you
went from failin you now i feel for you liar
