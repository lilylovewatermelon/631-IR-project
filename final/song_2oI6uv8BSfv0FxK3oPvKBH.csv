uhh gotta get ituhhhhmmmget it get it

verse 1
stab through the neighborhood these spinnin
wes winnin scrap with the john lennon
headrests tvs in em
best in the nation on this playstation
the don dada gotta get you hotter
than a buck naked nigga smokin water
on a friday the get high day
blowin at a hot date findin shade
black and bicantay with ass everwhere how you do that there
a sight to behold break the mold
just tryin to get some before the world explode
i see you tryin to get caught
well shake what your mama gave ya plus what you bought
we fuck and we fought we laugh and we cry
told the truth and we lie

chorus
you be good to me ill be good to you
anything you want anything you do
i got my eyes on you and im into you
give it all i got and to keep it hot
now what a freak like you doin with a fool like me
explain it to your family
its got to be insanity because i like what youre doing to me
see ice cube liveget tickets as low as 61you might also likeverse 2
you know you aint right standin at the light
think its chocolate with that shit too tight
and if i fuck around and get you in the car with me
motherfuckers would think i had a star with me
now see the haterism increase
they hate when you got a dime piece
and i got one shotgun and i might catch a hot one
when im lookin for love and niggas got none uhh
if you let me handcuff your wrist
bonnie and clyde aint got shit on this
cuz bonnie and clyde had to take a risk
but most of my money see its all legit baby
its all about your state of mind
now what would you do if i handed you a tec9
are you feelin me
would you stay down like hillary
even if you thought about killin me

chorus
you be good to me ill be good to you
anything you want anything you do
i got my eyes on you and im into you
give it all i got and to keep it hot
now what a freak like you doin with a fool like me
explain it to your family
its got to be insanity because i like what youre doing to me
verse 3
are you the type of girl that would call them folks
have your man leave the house in chains and ropes
dont need the kind of girl thatll have me in court
on lawsuits lyin about domestic abuse
have a bitch like judge judy cussin me out
garnish my checks repossess my lex
cuz i come from a place in southern californi
where hoes rake niggas for tons of alimony
but fuck the world dont aks me for shit
unless you my boo and im fuckin you
the rest of these broads aint knowin
that ima have you bumpin lauryn in somethin foreign
come through blow the horn
stick your wrists out the window
and wave to your kinfolks
let em know who you with
and to your crazyass daddy let him know who to get

chorus
you be good to me ill be good to you
anything you want anything you do
i got my eyes on you and im into you
give it all i got and to keep it hot
now what a freak like you doin with a fool like me
explain it to your family
its got to be insanity because i like what youre doing to meembed"
