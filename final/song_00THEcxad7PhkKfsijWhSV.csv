i been thinkin bout you all day cant even hide it
ima hop up in the truck and i65 it
eightyfive goin straight to your drive
and im divin in your neon eyes
crazy you get me when nobody can get me
baby you fix me when nobody can fix me
do that thing that you always do
mm and it feels brand new

chorus
when you say that you want me
without sayin you want me
baby say that you need me make it look easy
dont just lead me on i hate when you tease me
when were kissin on a twolane road
tell me all the things that i already know
im addicted to the way that you crush me
whenever you touch me cant get enough of me
i love how you love me without sayin you love me
sayin you love me

verse 2
418 on the dashboard ticktock
suns about to show up soon

whenever you touch me cant get enough of me
i love how you love me without sayin you love me

bridge
its the way your shadow moves on the wall
and you let your long hair fall

chorus

whenever you touch me cant get enough of me
i love how you love me without sayin you love me
