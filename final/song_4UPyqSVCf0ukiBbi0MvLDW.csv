geah whassup
to all my street niggas project niggas

we all ghetto b heres mine
geah

verse 1 jayz
see i was born in sewage born to make bomb music
flow tight like i was born jewish
used the streets as a conduit
i kept arms 38 longs inside my moms buick
at any given moment shawn could lose it be on the news
iron cuffs  arms through it or stuffed with embalming fluid
shit im going through it  mom dukes too
tears streaming down her pretty face she got her palms to it
my life is getting too wild
i need to bring some sort calm to it
bout to lose it voices screaming dont do it
its like 93 94 bout the year
that big and mack dropped and illmatic rocked
outta every rag drop and the west had it locked
everybody doing them im still stretching on the block
like damn ima be a failure
surrounded by thugs drugs and drug paraphernalia
cops courts and their thoughts is to derail us
threetime felons in shorts with jealous thoughts
trying to figure where your mail is
guesstimate the weight you selling
so they can send shots straight to your melon wait
it gets worse baby momma water burst
baby came out stillborn still i gotta move on
though my heart still torn life gone from her womb
dont worry if it was meant to be itll be soon

verse 2 beanie sigel
chill dog
second oldest born from michelle brown my mother
hell bound grew with two sisters and one brother
pop wasnt around so many stories thats another
im thinking damn how my older sister gon make me tougher
when steel sharpens steel ima keep it real
im tired of trying to hide my pain behind the syrups and pills
dead to the world stretched out like a corpse for real
yall niggas thinking what yall reading in the source is real
what my life like you looking at the source its real
what your life like mine dog of course its real
passing judgment you niggas secondguessing beans
cause you dont eat swine dont make you mumin
dog you know a couple suras out the quran
i guess you all on your din and i aint on mine
stop that akki fore i send shots through your body
make em feel hell on earth before allah drop me
i feel the lines drawn here nutting more can stop me
til them feds pick me up or them boys pop me
theres only three things that make mack not act like beans
amatullah tisha po aldin samir amin
my seeds dog gotta teach em that before i leave dog
shit i know that ima see em when i leave dog
i come back in the afterlife
like fuck it i done touched hell twice whats the meaning
chorus jayz
this cant be life this cant be love
this cant be right theres gotta be more this cant be us
this cant be life this cant be love
this cant be right theres gotta be more this cant be us
verse 3 scarface
life yeah uhh
now as i walk into the studio to do this with jig
i got a phone call from one of my nigs
said my homeboy reek he just lost one of his kids
and when i heard that i just broke into tears
and see in the second hand you dont really know how this is
but when it hits that close to home you feel the pain at the crib
so i called mine and saddened my wife with the bad news
now we both depressed counting our blessings cause brads two
praying for young souls to laugh at life through the stars
loving your kids just like you was ours
and im hurting for you dog but aint nobody pain is like yours
i just know that heavenll open these doors
and aint no bright side to losing life but you can view it like this
gods got open hands homie he in the midst of good company
who loves all and hates not one
and one day you gon be with your son
i couldve rapped about my hard times on this song
but heaven knows i woulda been wrong
i wouldnta been right it wouldnta been love
it wouldnta been life it wouldnta been us
this cant be life
chorus jayz
this cant be life this cant be love
this cant be right theres gotta be more this cant be us
this cant be life this cant be love
this cant be right theres gotta be more this cant be us
