she was part of the air force i was part of the band
i always used to bust into her hand
in my my my imagination
i was living my best life living with my parents
way before the paying penance and verbal propellants
and my my my cancellations hm yeah

verse 2 matthew healy
and i fell in love with a boy it was kinda lame
i was rimbaud and he was paul verlaine
in my my my imagination
so many cringes in the heroin binges
i was coming off the hinges living on the fringes
of my my my imagination oh yeah

prechorus matthew healy
enough about me now
you gotta talk about the people baby
but thats kind of the idea

chorus matthew healy
at home somewhere i dont like
eating stuff off of motorbikes
cumming to her lookalikes
i cant get the language right
just tell me whats unladylike

i know some vaccinista tote bag chic baristas
sitting in east on their communista keisters
writing about their ejaculations
i like my men like i like my coffee
full of soy milk and so sweet it wont offend anybody
while staining the pages of the nation oh yeah

prechorus matthew healy
a xanax and a newport
well i take care of my kids she said

chorus matthew healy  jack antonoff
the worst inside of us begets
that feeling on the internet
its like someone intended it
like advertising cigarettes
a diamond in the rough begets
the diamond with a scruff you get

interlude

outro matthew healy

or am i just some postcoke average skinny bloke
calling his ego imagination

and nine hours and sixteen minutes babe
its kind of my daily iteration7embed"
