i know my uses i have my pride
but my heart is still untamed
i learn my lessons ive conquered death
i go on and im unashamed
ill paint your bones to match my eyes
theyre the darkest i have ever seen
until im lucid i cant be told
i know my voices they tell me to believe

verse 2 corey taylor
another fuckin accident out of control
all the attitudes will never change
my imitations are leading the way
i cant accept that i still dont find this strange
in light of my ability to feel denial
i walk away from everything with just a smile
the agony of coming home has gone away
its everywhere its everyone its every day

chorus corey taylor chris fehn paul gray  clown

i beg your pardon im out of the way
a new conspiracy has taken my place
so over and over i smell the decay
believe what you want to the cycle stays the same
in light of my ability to undermine
i walk away from apathy im feeling fine
the agony of cynicism beckons me
its everywhere its everyone its everything
