verse 1
when the gold becomes dough and the magic starts to fade
when it all comes to an end
when theres nothing left to say
it is what it is
i tried to make it work
my best just wasnt enough
it couldnt be helped the end
the things i would do for you

verse 2
after all is said and done
and im all alone
when i sit back and reflect
from a broken heart
sometimes theres regret
it is what it is
it couldnt be helped the end
so many things i wanna say
this is the end
