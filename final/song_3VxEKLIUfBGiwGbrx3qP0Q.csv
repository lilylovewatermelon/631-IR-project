here she comes again
shes feeling like shes already won
i believe its gonna end again
all for naught
my philosophy is things are just as wrong as they seem
i believe its gonna end this way
atrocity

prechorus
do you believe in love
like i believe in pain
nobody died for you
somebody pray for me

chorus
when you see me cut me down
and i will force it underground
theres no one left to hurt but me
and its because of me
right

verse 2
there he walks away
hes feeling like hes having them on
i believe hes gonna bend again
and all for naught
my philosophy is things are just as wrong as they seem
ive gotta get you off of me
its an oddity

chorus
when you see me cut me down
and i will force it underground
theres no one left to hurt but me
and its because of me
