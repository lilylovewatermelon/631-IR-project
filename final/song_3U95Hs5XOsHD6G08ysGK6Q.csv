i know you think im afraid
to take a chance
and go to the deep end
usher baby
turn the lights on

verse 1
these waters can get a little busy
but i got experience yeah
dont mind trekking through the storm
long as i know that youre here with me babe
shedding all your innocence

prechorus
i see the walls are looking like they might precipitate
until im in so deep its up to my waist
but i promise girl i aint afraid

chorus
its raining inside your bed
no parts are dry
loving makes you so wet
your legs your thighs
and ever since we first met i knew that i
and i knew i was ready baby uh
