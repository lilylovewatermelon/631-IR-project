got my education in prison
got my education like from the trenches from the—
from the block im sayin
being involved and all that yeah

verse
i got my education in prison but i cant go to college
i run with all the older boys but i dont pay no homage
i cant forget this shit i did i hope it dont come and haunt me
cause if i die ill probably fry and i dont wanna be no omelette
i see the reaper when i lay down im sleepin when im walkin
nightmares be comin easy sweet dreams dont come too often
i remember shit the other day
i remember i was talkin to my shawty i say
i dont remember gettin your mama pregnant but you came from my loins
i cant even bring you to chuckecheese she be takin my coin
she be puttin them people in my face she say i dont be supporting
i was masked up runnin in verizon and tmobile stores
cause all of my homeboys were robbin and wanting me to join
now i be thinkin bout catching bodies when i be gettin borin
i was stealin cars and i aint know why when i had my own foreign
i be thuggin hard and i dont know why when all of my niggas be goin
if i was in the state i might be straight i woulda had at least supporting
but now im dead im in the feds then people got no remorse
the judge be givin me this look but he dont think im gorgeous
he gon try to hit me with the book but he dont know my story
shit been gettin weird lately i just play my part
slidin in a demon with some demons tryna catch a corpse
this aint a 550
in the middle of valentine i had another bitch here
i been tryna stop the perkies but it aint workin
i dont need nobody ridin with me
i was thinkin bout the hood my mama say dont go there
if it dont go my way this relationship aint goin nowhere
i be standin on the bitch she say im too controllin
i be standin on the bitch she say im too controllin
standing on niggas i be steppin on them
i aint comin home until they fix that ac
i been on the road breakin in vehicles lately
you got murder for hire i need a job on the spot
ayo pass me a lighter im tryna smoke me a opp
thats a rollie skydweller a fly lil fella you are
follow up with berettas i send some shells through your car
im back in that mode back on that business
i tell em go and crash at the show and book a ticket
ima be the one and they know the one thats killin
i keep tryna look for a drop to get em dropped
better make it count on this mission cause slippers count
so what you finna do if he slippin get a mop
you might also likeoutro
fuck you thought know im sayin
fuck you mean what ima do when i see emembed"
