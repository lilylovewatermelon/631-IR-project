my life is like a video game trying hard to beat the stage
all while i am still collecting coins
trying hard to save the girl obstacles im jumping hurdles
im growing up to be a big boy
i battle with the evil ways i travel far and try and save
sorry but your princess isnt here
i take a rest i push the pause level up and move along
in hopes that the next stage i will clear i fucking passed asshole
prechorus
im just trying to keep from dying

chorus
its just a game that we play and for heavens sakes
looking for a better way to play it
life is for keeping score and forevermore
stop complaining and start changing it

verse 2
today i went to therapy told him my embarrassing
issues that im having with my life
he told me that i need to change life is not a video game
so stop playing and open up your eyes

prechorus
im just trying to keep from dying

its just a game that we play and for heavens sakes
looking for a better way to play it
life is for keeping score and forevermore
stop complaining and start changing it

dont talk about it just be about it
dont ever doubt it even when your brain is clouded
i may be crazy but lifes amazing
and through it all and even with your problems facing
so just know that its okay

interlude
my life is like a video game trying hard to beat the stage
all while i am still collecting coins
