just about the time the shadows call
i undress my mind and dare you to follow
paint a portrait of my mystery
only close my eyes and you are here with me

prechorus
a nameless face to think i see
to sit and watch the waves with me until theyre gone
a heart id swear id recognize is made out of
my own devices
could i be wrong

chorus
the time that ive taken
i pray is not wasted
have i already tasted my piece of one sweet love

verse 2
sleepless nights you creep inside of me
paint your shadows on the breath that we share
you take more than just my sanity
you take my reason not to care

prechorus
no ordinary wings ill need
the sky itself will carry me back to you
the things i dream that i can do
id open up the moon for you
just come down soon
you might also likechorus
the time that ive taken
i pray is not wasted
have i already tasted my piece of one sweet love
ready and waiting
for a heart worth the breaking
but id settle for an honest mistake in the name of one sweet love

bridge
savor the sorrow to soften the pain
sip on the southern rain
as i do i dont look dont touch dont do anything
but hope that there is a you

prechorus
the earth that is the space between
id banish it from under me to get to you
your unexpected love provides my solitarys
suicide oh i wish i knew

prechorus
the time that ive taken
i pray is not wasted
have i already tasted my piece of one sweet love
ready and waiting
for a heart worth the breaking
but id settle for an honest mistake in the name of one sweet love1embed"
