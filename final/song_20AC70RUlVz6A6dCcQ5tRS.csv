this my excavation and to–
–day is kumran
everything that happens is from now on
this is pouring rain this is paralyzed

verse 2
i keep throwing it down two–
–hundred at a time
and its hard to find it when you knew it
when your moneys gone and youre drunk as hell

chorus
on your back with the racks as the stacks of your load
in the back with the racks and the stacks are your load
in the back with the racks and youre unstacking your load

verse 3
ive been twisting to the sun
i needed to replace
and the fountain in the front yard is rusted out
all my love was down in a frozen ground

verse 4
theres a black crow sitting across from me
his wiry legs are crossed
and hes dangling my keys he even fakes a toss
whatever could it be that has brought me to this loss

on your back with your racks as the stacks of your load
in the back with the racks and the stacks of your load
in the back with your racks and youre unstacking your load

verse 5
this is not the sound of a new man
or crispy realization
its the sound of the unlocking and the lift away
your love will be safe with me57embed"
