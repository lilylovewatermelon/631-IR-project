fuck

refrain
i just spent too many minutes watchin little videos of shitty wannabe rappers dissing me
i just spent the winter livin after someone tried to send a kill shot missin me
young blonde don and the doublex mob got a gang out in sicily
why you think they call me the gunner
im poppin off on anybody if they trigger me

verse 1
black and yellow jacket on like im kill bill
grew up scrappin and i still will
we can take it back to 2012
i was trappin on the tour bus with meek mill
take it back to cleveland when they gave chase 17 years no plea deal
2014 when the people tried to rob me in the lobby
i bet they can feel the feet still
point out my enemies soon as they mention me
call an assembly pick up a pen and put you out your misery
written in history it was gonna happen eventually
i just cant wait til the day that i run into you physically
for everything that i went through mentally
when it felt like everybody in the world was against me
when all the critics and every article tried to offend me
my daughter slapped a kid for talkin bout me in elementary
we aint playin its deeper than the fame
people gettin checked for disrespectin the family name
two chopsticks no lo mein
hollow tips got no name
bust them shits with no aim
like its bird box
but the blindfold is a black flag this time to cover my face
the dash cam just saw me killin everybody
see ​mgk liveget tickets as low as 149you might also likechorus
i got off on floor 13 no in between
i roll my weed with fronto leaf
i chop my coke on hotel keys
i chopped his face like constantine
constantly get déjà vu
i see me when i look at you
i never die i multiply
so dont cry at my funeral

refrain

verse 2
what would this generation of hiphop be
without me here to piss yall off
i see the blogs i read the comments
im confused i need to pause
look at yall waitin on me to fall off
while im lookin at yall from a suite in the waldorf
i sold 40 million records i aint even 30
give me 20 seconds ill list 10 movies that ive been in
one legend that tried to fuck with me and then got the venom
one publication that said that i would never be in it
one agent that told me without her my career is finished
and i couldnt give a single fuck inside my cerebellum
yall award shows suck go tell em
we aint suckin no dick in the 216
brought os to the land like beckham
on the 13th floor with a weapon
i heard that they coming yeah let em in
i got somethin for em yeah please forgive my sins
blood on my ralph lauren yeah i cant wash this shit
wake up say good morning yeah like i forgot
chorus
got off on floor 13 no in between
i roll my weed with fronto leaf
i chop my coke on hotel keys
i chopped his face like constantine
constantly get déjà vu
i see me when i look at you
i never die i multiply
so dont cry at my funeral
