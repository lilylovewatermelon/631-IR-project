oh a whole new way of looking at things
the way you react to phone rings
the way it feels when you just let it flow
sometimes i wonder just how it could be
you take every bit before we see it off the rails
i think that you should know

verse 2
you never cease to amaze me
you keep me from going crazy
and thats one thing i know for sure
sometimes i see just how it all will be
take every bit its so easy
the first straw
and this i know for sure

the first straw
so small it seemed impossible
