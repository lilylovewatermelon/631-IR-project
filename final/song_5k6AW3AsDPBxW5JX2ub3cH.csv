skies are crying i am watching
catching tear drops in my hands
only silence as its ending
like we never had a chance
do you have to make me feel like theres nothing left of me

chorus
you can take everything i have
you can break everything i am
like im made of glass
like im made of paper
go on and try to tear me down
i will be rising from the ground
like a skyscraper
like a skyscraper

verse 2
as the smoke clears
i awaken and untangle you from me
would it make you feel better to watch me while i bleed
all my windows still are broken but im standing on my feet

chorus
you can take everything i have
you can break everything i am
like im made of glass
like im made of paper
go on and try to tear me down
i will be rising from the ground
like a skyscraper
like a skyscraper

go run run run
im gonna stay right here
watch you disappear
yeah oh
go run run run
yeah its a long way down
but i am closer to the clouds up here

chorus
you can take everything i have
you can break everything i am
like im made of glass
like im made of paper oh oh
go on and try to tear me down
i will be rising from the ground
like a skyscraper
like a skyscraper
like a skyscraper
like a skyscraper
like a skyscraperembed"
