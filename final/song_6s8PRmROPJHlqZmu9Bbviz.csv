do you remember the taste of my lips that night
i stole a bit of my mothers perfume
cause i remember when my father put his fist through the wall
that separated the dining room
and i remember the fear in your eyes
the very first time we snuck into the city pool
late december with my heart in my chest
and the clouds of my breath
didnt know where we were running to
but dont look back

chorus
oh well be looking for sunlight or the headlights
til our wide eyes burn blind
well be lacing the same shoes that weve worn through
to the bottom of the line
and we know that were headstrong
and our hearts gone
and the timings never right
but for now lets get away
on a roman holiday

verse 2
could you imagine the taste of your lips if we never tried to kiss on the drive to queens
cause i imagine the weight of your ribs if you lied between my hips in the backseat
i imagine the tears in your eyes
the very first night ill sleep without you
and when it happens ill be miles away
and a few months late
didnt know where i was running to
but i wont look back
you might also likechorus
oh well be looking for sunlight or the headlights
til our wide eyes burn blind
well be lacing the same shoes that weve worn through
to the bottom of the line
and we know that were headstrong
and our hearts gone
and the timings never right
so for now lets get away
on a roman holiday

bridge
feet first dont fall
or well be running again
keep close stand tall

chorus
oh well be looking for sunlight or the headlights
til our wide eyes burn blind
well be lacing the same shoes that weve worn through
to the bottom of the line
and we know that were headstrong
and our hearts gone
and the timings never right
but for now lets get away
on a roman holiday35embed"
