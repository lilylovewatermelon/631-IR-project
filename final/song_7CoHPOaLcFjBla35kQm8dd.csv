i wanna live in a land of lakes
where the great waves break
and the night runs right into the day
wanna be with ones i left
but i’m way out west
and the years keep on slipping away

wanna run on the sacred dunes
through the ancient ruins
where the fires of my ancestors burned
i remember that fateful day
when i ran away
and you told me i couldn’t return

chorus
you made me swear i’d never forget
i made a vow i’d see you again
i will be back one day
and i’ll find you there by the great big lake

instrumental

verse 2
ive been running a long long time
trying to flee that life
but i can’t seem to leave it behind
wanna visit the windswept shores
of a time before
when the moon and the stars were aligned
see lord huron liveget tickets as low as 52you might also likei remember the bright spring day
when you sparked that flame
and a fire that continues to burn
i remember the day i left
headin’ way out west
when you told me to never return

chorus
you made me swear i’d never forget
i made a vow i’d see you again
i will be back one day
and i’ll find you there by the great big lake

outro
i will be back one day
and i’ll find you there by the great big lake1embed"
