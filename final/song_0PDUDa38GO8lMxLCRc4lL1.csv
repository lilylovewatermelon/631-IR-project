climb on board
well go slow and high tempo
light and dark
hold me hard and mellow

prechorus
im seeing the pain seeing the pleasure
nobody but you body but me
body but us bodies together
i i love to hold you close tonight and always
i love to wake up next to you
i love to hold you close tonight and always
i love to wake up next to you

chorus
so well piss off the neighbours
in the place that feels the tears
the place you lose your fears
yeah reckless behaviour
a place that is so pure so dirty and raw
in the bed all day bed all day bed all day
fuckin and fightin on
its our paradise and its our war zone
its our paradise and its our war zone
