told you i made dinner plans
for you and me and no one else
that dont include your crazy friends
well im done im done
with awkward situations empty conversations

chorus joe jonas
ooh this is an sos
dont wanna second guess

i gave my all for you
now my hearts in two
and i cant find the other half
its like im walking on broken glass
better believe i bled
its a call ill never get
