got these xans on me ima do em
got these prescriptions that need to be filled
poppin these pills till im buried in fields
percocets heron the oxy and dills
got a rig on me imma shoot it
drugs in my veins have it no other way
bitches keep asking if licky okay
he a zombie he the walking decay
disgrace they say to my family name
learned behavior yet im to blame
pills ingested got me runnin late
i cant move an inch i cant feel my face
got bitches that want me to put down the drugs
but id rather be loaded than fallin in love
rather be duckin than in your bitch fuckin
slumped with the drugs aint got time for no cuffin

verse 2 norman atomic
pop a perc yeah to stop the hurt
i got a problem now got to work it out
got a lot of loud never heard a sound
but they heard the pow from the glock im down
dialing up 911
they dont know whether to pump my stomach
or stitch the hole in the back of my head
emt said time of death right at 7
ruby get up like he walkin to heaven
my body dont move but my soul shows its presence
dig me a hole i dont need no remembrance
im heading back home yeah the place where the devil lives
ruby so devilish
looks like my penance is finding a plug at the bottom of hell
i been looking for pks been looking for three days
i woke up and then heard the priest say the devil lives
