diamonds are forever
they are all i need to please me
they can stimulate and tease me
they wont leave in the night
ive no fear that they might desert me

diamonds are forever
forever forever throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe

forever forever the roc is still alive every time i rhyme

verse 1 kanye west
good mornin this aint vietnam still
people lose hands legs arms for real
little was known of sierra leone
and how it connect to the diamonds we own
when i speak of diamonds in this song
i aint talkin about the ones that be glowin im talkin about rocafella my home
my chain these aint conflict diamonds
is they jacob dont lie to me mane
see a part of me sayin keep shinin
how when i know what a blood diamond is
though its thousands of miles away
sierra leone connect to what we go through today
over here its a drug trade we die from drugs
over there they die from what we buy from drugs
the diamonds the chains the bracelets the charmses
i thought my jesus piece was so harmless
til i seen a picture of a shorty armless
and heres the conflict
its in a black person soul to rock that gold
spend your whole life tryna get that ice
on a polo rugby it look so nice
how can somethin so wrong make me feel so right
right fore i beat myself up like ike
you can still throw your rocafella diamond tonight because

verse 2 kanye west  jayz

verse 3 jayz
yup
i got it from here ye damn
the chain remains the gang is intact uhhuh
the name is mine ill take blame for that
the pressures on but guess who aint gon crack
haha pardon me i had to laugh at that
how could you falter when youre the rock of gibraltar
i had to get off the boat so i could walk on water
this aint no tall order this is nothin to me
difficult takes a day impossible takes a week
i do this in my sleep i sold kilos of coke so
im guessin i can sell cds
im not a businessman im a business man
let me handle my business damn
kanyeez you got me freeway then foxy
ygs teairra mari peedi watch me
bleek could be one hit away his whole career
as long as im alive hes a millionaire
and even if i die hes in my will somewhere
so he could just kick back and chill somewhere oh yeah
he dont even have to write rhymes
the dynasty like my money last three lifetimes
shirley basseys in the rear sayin exactly
what i been sayin practically my whole career
the diamond is forever ive been minin this forever
now the louis vuitton dons timin couldnt be better
people lined up to see the titanic sinkin
instead we rose up from the ash like a phoenix
if youre waitin for the end of the dynasty sign
it would seem like forever is a mighty long time ha
outro jayz
im young bitches
hahahahaha
good night
