verse 1
truth is that it was always going to end
the symphony buzzing in my head
took a market of filth and sold like summer
true all of the good girls act so good
til one of them doesnt wait their turn
turn the memory to stone and carve your shoulder
hey holy roller

prechorus
if you wanna start a fight
you better throw the first punch
make it a good one
and if ya wanna make it through the night
you better say my name like
the good the bad and the dirty

chorus
oh whoa whoa ohoh whoa ohoh

i know what its like to have to trade
the ones that you love for the ones you hate
dont think ive ever used a day of my education
theres only two ways that these things can go
good or bad and how was i to know
that all your friends wont hold any grudges
i got the final judgement

prechorus
if you wanna start a fight
you better throw the first punch
make it a good one
and if ya wanna make it through the night
you better say my name like
the good the bad and the dirty

and all our friends want us to fall in love
