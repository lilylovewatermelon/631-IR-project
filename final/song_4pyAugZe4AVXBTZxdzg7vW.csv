hey break the walls
hey break the walls
hey break the walls
hey break the walls

verse 1
through the epic unconsciousness
through the valley of beatinâ€™ chests
turn the sound down still hear the roar
let the beast out what did you come for

interlude noelle scaggs
give me a sledgehammer and give me strength
watch the world come crumbling down
cut me loose i seek the truth
i bet the freedom the freedom will carry me

hook
hey break the walls
hey break the walls
hey break the walls
hey break the walls

verse 2
to the wild i travel the unknown
the fathers pray out to be overthrown
turn the lights down oh to be blind at peace
let the beast out and watch it bare its teeth
you might also likeinterlude noelle scaggs
give me a sledgehammer and give me strength
watch the world come crumbling down
cut me loose i seek the truth
i bet the freedom the freedom will carry me

hook
hey break the walls
hey break the walls
hey break the walls
hey break the walls

bridge
kick and scream fight for the unseen
fight for harmony fight for you and me
kick and scream fight for the unseen
fight for harmony fight for you and me
kick and scream fight for the unseen
fight for harmony fight for you and me
kick and scream fight for the unseen
fight for harmony fight for you and me

hook
hey break the walls
hey break the walls
hey break the walls
hey break the walls
hey break the walls
hey break the walls
hey break the walls
hey break the wallsembed"
