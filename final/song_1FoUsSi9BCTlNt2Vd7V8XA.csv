flies are buzzing round my head
vultures circling the dead
picking up every last crumb
the big fish eat the little ones
big fish eat the little ones
not my problem give me some

chorus
you can try the best you can
you can try the best you can
the best you can is good enough
you can try the best you can
you can try the best you can
the best you can is good enough

verse 2
this ones optimistic
this one went to market
this one just came out of the swamp
this one drops a payload
fodder for the animals
living on an animal farm

chorus
you can try the best you can
you can try the best you can
the best you can is good enough
you can try the best you can
you can try the best you can
the best you can is good enough

id really like to help you man
id really like to help you man
nervous messed up marionette
floating round on a prison ship

chorus
you can try the best you can
you can try the best you can
the best you can is good enough
you can try the best you can
you can try the best you can
