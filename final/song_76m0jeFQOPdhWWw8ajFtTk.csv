verse 1
you think you know but you have no idea
this the diary of a breathing onomatopoeia
now heres another broken link for anyone who thinks my lifes together
i rock a raincoat despite the pleasant weather
god placed a permanent dark cloud above my head
but he was nice enough to loan me a holy umbrella
thank ya fella how considerate
im the illegitimate son of accidentprone degenerates
todays forecast partly cloudy with a good chance of rain
so i wear my sarcasm badge proudly
and flash a devilish grin
thatll make the most masculine of men skeptical of his existence
and when the rain begins ill take a seat to retire
and admire the spectacle from a distance
for instance there was this cat the other day
shooting me ice grills but when i looked he looked the other way
now any other day i wouldnt let this type of shit bother me
today it was enough to make my lucky charms soggy
so finally i stepped to him kindly disrespected him
looked him dead in the eyes and analyzed how it effected him
he broke down in tears talkin bout how god neglected him

hook
make this rain go away
things would be much better i swear i swear
if that sun can come out today
life would be more worthwhile worthwhile
see gym class heroes liveget tickets as low as 97you might also likeverse two
and all it took was a sewin needle to deflate my swollen ego
then pop pop went my god complex
i never thought nineteen years after my first breath
id be in art school surrounded by corny fucks debatin whos more depressed
im twentytwo now and still cant deal with whats real
but ill be damned if i give up and settle for pills
shit my daddy taught me better mommy taught me how to crack 40s
and jack sixpacks in oversized sweaters
over time weather changes so im in the rain waitin
for the flood gates to open impersonatin
my favorite vh1 behind the music tragedy
catastrophe never tasted so acidic before
im ph balanced for the floor but strong enough to stay afloat
and doggy paddle long enough to catch that life preserver rope
and then ill be on a parallel ladder laughin like
damn my man for the love of pete what happened
finally ill step to you kindly disrespect you
look you dead in the eyes and analyze how it affects you
watch you break down in tears talkin bout how god neglected you

hook

repeat 2x
you ever watch a whole day wash away
like your very last match that got wet the second you struck it
well go ahead relieve your stress kick that bucket all you want
a cigarette that never mattereds what youre stuck with
hook

repeat the 2x above with hook overlapping1embed"
