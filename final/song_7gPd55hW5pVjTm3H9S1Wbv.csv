this house is a circus berserk as fuck
we tend to see that as a perk though
look what its done to your friends
their memories are pretend
and the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end
this house is a circus berserk as fuck
we tend to see that as a perk though
look what its done to your friends
their memories are pretend
and the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end

verse 2
theres a room full of trouble and theres lovers to be had
those ones who make sinners out of such lovely lads
scaling the corridors for maidens in the maze
and the anomaly is slipping into familiar ways

chorus
and were forever unfulfilled and cant think why
like a search for murder clues in dead mens eyes
forever unfulfilled and cant think why
like a search for murder clues in dead mens eyes

bridge
the more you open your mouth the more youre forcing performance
and all the attention is leading me to feel important
give me obnoxious give me obnoxious now
now that were here we may as well go too far

wriggling around in incidents you wont forget
theres certainly some venom in the looks that you collect
aimlessly gazing at the faces in the kiln
and were struggling with the notion that its life not film

verse 4
this house is a circus berserk as fuck were forever unfulfilled
we tend to see that as a perk though cant think why
look what its done to your friends
their memories are pretend like a search for murder clues
and the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end14embed"
