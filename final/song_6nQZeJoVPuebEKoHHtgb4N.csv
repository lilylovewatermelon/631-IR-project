endless mornings cut by the dawn razor
whipping the nightmares to a froth
endless questions with no answers
no replacement for whats been lost
lost

verse 1
everything suffocates in the dust
of past fortunes squandered
the empire of lies
to whom you pandered
suffer a selfimposed exile
the bitter fruits of denial
in the presence of greatness
the humble can only bow

chorus
frost on the breath of life
empty of warmth or light
full of nothing but deprivation
frost on the breath of life
empty of warmth or light
for an eternal winter

verse 2
tell me a lie
with the best of intentions
mute in the age
of mass communication
dark days lead to darker nights
frozen out of time
id dies for blessed ego
the once mighty laid low
see lamb of god liveget tickets as low as 14you might also likechorus
frost on the breath of life
empty of warmth or light
full of nothing but deprivation

postchorus
full of nothing but deprivation
eternal winter
full of nothing but deprivation
eternal winter

outro
you taught me hate ill teach you fear fear fear fear fear
open the eyes kill despair
you tried to squeeze the life from me from me from me
son of a bitch im going to break you
son of a bitch im going to break you
break you im going to break you
