give me summer
give me summer
give me summer
give me summer

verse 1 moby
broken darkness my cold end
i look for places ive never seen
nothing moves but the quiet on the street
now i open my eyes to this
isolated walking long hard hours
winter cold just brings me winter showers
its so brutal with the cold sky
wrapped in cold late at night

refrain willie hutch
give me summer
give me summer

verse 2 moby
come clean theres no sun yet
the only lights here are made
i cant speak i cant hear but i know im real
theres no warm here anyway
the darkest lights before the dawn
you remember the sun but it sank
in the water that eats the light
wrapped in cold late at night
you might also likerefrain willie hutch
give me summer
give me summer

verse 3 moby
i open my eyes its cold
the only souls go by
lift the bridge out of the water
the stone black light
living is easy when its night
the cold has covered the rain
i can see forever to the deep
wrapped in cold late at night

refrain willie hutch
give me summer
give me summer
give me summer
give me summerembed"
