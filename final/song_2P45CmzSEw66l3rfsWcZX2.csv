i leave your coupe this lil fourdoor go to space
she wanna run my way bring my problems to her space
i thought we was cool you just tryna find your way
i was just in school that shit felt like yesterday

amg i race inside look like outer space
she just want a picture that shit there gon make her day
she wanna make a video cause the roof look like its space
niggas plan on killin you and you actin like its okay
she watch all my interviews she know what not to say
