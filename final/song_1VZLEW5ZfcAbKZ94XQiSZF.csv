ill be honest i wasnt devastated
but you couldve held my hand through this baby
let my mind run underneath warm jets
i run my hands through whats left
but were getting older baby
dont have much longer baby
why am i preaching
to this choir to this atheist
just like mine versions of these belong to you
after a while theyre keeping me close to you
outro stevie wonder
just like me they long to be close to youyou might also like53embed"
