ladies and gentlemen and nonbinary folks of the class of 155 wear dude ranch if i could offer you only one tip for the future dude ranch would be it the long term benefits of dude ranch have been proven by vice articles from the early 2000s whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable  than my own meandering experience i will dispense this advice now enjoy the powеr and beauty of your nation never mind you will not undеrstand the power and beauty of your nation until they’ve faded but trust me in another 161 episodes you’ll look back at all the memes and recall in a way you can’t grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous sam really looked with a man bun you are not as punk as you imagine dont worry about the future or worry and know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by asking nate ruess for help the real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind the kind that blindside you while you’re skateboarding all alone at night through the streets of montreal do one thing every day that scares you sing don’t be reckless with other people’s pods don’t put up with people who are reckless with yours floss dont waste your time on jealousy sometimes you’re celebrated in canadian media journalism  sometimes youre not the race is long and in the end it’s only with the ringer remember the good sclusies forget the bad ones if you succeed in doing this tell me how keep your old fan accounts throw away your archives but trust me on the dude ranch

and if you think this song is bad my friends it gets a lot worse
we’re all in on fallen we fall in we’ve all been

verse 2 s reidy
s reidy blink155 nation blink155
josiah sam yo i see you yeah

crowds scatter planes crashin’ when the storm hits
dark matter’s just a cymbal that we all miss
trace back to the line count all your steps
place bets on your legs ‘cause you rub necks
it gets dark when you’re hidin’ from the sunshine
creep to the bone draw a sword at the same time
knowin’ they about to miss me like a tom song
gettin’ risky like josiah with the long johns
yeah i’m a beast and im feeling ya i’ma take it there
when i see you ima beat you just like a ring snare
i can take you to the places you never saw
but beating me’s impossible like gettin’ tom on the pod 155

the science that i politic you might not like

these bars that im spittin’ aint ever gonna stop
my rappin’ game like baby yoda gettin’ that top
put chicken wings on bone and dip ‘em in some honey
then they drip drip drip just like me i’m so money
my dealing with the pod has been a broad spectrum
from my boxing day cover to my prolapsed rectum
but the pod’s end is nigh i gotta give respect
and since i am from utah i’ll add a flippin’ heck
so lets drop this posse cut it’s lowkey litty
then i’ll pet josiah’s woody relax i mean his kitty meow

verse 13 ivo ouden

a laundry list of list of reasons all the people wanna be him
a longer list of men and women slidin’ in my dms
yeah battin’ 500 for both teams
gonna need 3 hands so i can hold rings
i’m the champ kyle lowry runnin’ pick and roll
came through in my umbro just to kick it shoutin’ “goooooooal” ha ha

verse 15 polar popz
polar popz poppin’ off on this track
pod punk representing from halifax
i’m a shoegaze queen i’m a waifu meme
and yeah i’ll see you in your wet dreams
hit the bong smoke a j vapor with some concentrate
just gotta keep the high its the only way
once was a tom girl and now im all about mark
but scott on the drums makes my heart really spark
been a pop punker since day one
green day blink good charlotte and sum 41
sparkle like a soda and i’m sweet to the taste
but when this pop goes flat you better be braced

josiah

josiah

verse 16 nate155
if youre coming for nate then youre coming for me
got me hotter than boiling water its 161 degrees
celsius your jealousy is amazing
i promise all this money from patreon doesn’t change me
got all the smoke for you pod mass i’m cig mark
too busy talking ‘bout dog ass and joan of arc
fuck rules fuck books i’m not playing the part
can’t read your context clues just like i’m david parke
i’m feelin’ gaudy today like i’m rocking gold chains
“thank god for punk rock” tatted and i got a lip ring
it’s me and billy b riding caddies by stt
‘cause the logo looks backward
when you stare right through the window pane
talkin’ to joz about funko collections
when im with sam its goodie like grocery store perfection
indie 88 ‘bout to teach them boys a lesson
dont be comin’ for the pod the whole gang is chin checkin’

verse 17 contextclues155
context clues in the mutha fuckin’ house
with a dick pill for the mutha fuckin’ mouth
rip sally let me be your peggy sue
sammy and josiah are two stand up dudes
and i’m down down down to wear some long johns on a jog
posse cut verse got my mind all in a fog
free punk lyrics and i just don’t give a fuck
68 a lamp and with a genie and some luck
tom delonge will come join us on the pod
we’ll treat him like a king no cap and on god

verse 18 fiona schick
its just one of those days
where you dont wanna wake up
everything is fucked
everybody sucks
you dont really know why
but you wanna justify
rippin someones head off
no human contact
and if you interact
your life is on contract
your best bet is to stay away motherfucker
its just one of those days
blink155
just drew show
saturday streamers
globe hell warning

verse 19 b155aus
ok cunts it’s b155 aus here with a psa about spring time in australia

magpies black and white demon

it’ll fuck up your day
start of september only one aim dismember

and dont even think of disrespecting their nesting zone
swoopy boys swoopy boys
protect ya neck from them swoopy boys
swoopy boys swoopy boys

verse 20 rt155
gotta punker on the mic
that shit don’t sound right
end your shit in 13 seconds conor mcgregor fight
while im sipping on a mix of jolly ranchers and sprite
“hey man why’d ya write a rap” i fuckin’ did it out of spite yeah
so hold up for a second got ya spinnin’ round like these vinyls that im pressin’
sick inside from ‘rona got me feelin my depression
at least sam can still go to his online harvard lessons
reppin blink155 thats sam joz and bill
black and white together like a simple creatures pill
retweet 155 i take it you ain’t ever heard of me
i’m gonna end this shit now this rap is fuckin’ absurdity

bill billingsley
sam e and joz
bill billingsley here

verse 21 contributor 23
yo it’s the posse cut
that means i got the guts to just drop a rup that’s a rap with a u
a blink no 82
i’m talking 55 that’s high fives to my guys and bill billingsley
hes still filling these cadillacs from travis that’s dishwasher money
i spit on tha dummy
youre not feeling this then youre not feelin’ my posse
josiah hughes he flows fire to
sam sutherland he’s shuddering a dammits the last episode i guess
but dont get depressed
because theyll still be friends
they’ll still keep in touchdown boy
so many tom songs are problematic

verse 22 dombarker211
pass the mic to your boy dombarker’s the handle
lookin for a pod normy i’m at least one example
i may not be from tucson but i wear my hat backward
so don’t expect me to know what band you’re talking about
now with that out the way let’s cut quick to the meat
this interlude is fuckin sick with a helluva beat
i admit some songs ring like a dishwasher rack
call it dated dog shit but travis barked on this track
yes and joking aside i’d be lost without you
when sam cooked up the pod i’m so thankful he thought to
find josiah a venue to park
5600 hours of his playful snark
and was gracious enough not to edit it down
birth a nation to laugh with while driving around
that’s it just like mom and dad now i’m thru
drop the mic save and export to dru

verse 23 bringerofmydad
y’all dont even wanna fuck with 155
all you other dumb pop punk podcasts best be stayin’ in line
we are shining new rhymes all the way from cheshire to nine
josiah and sam climb to the stars one song at a time
our podcast cums dude ranch while you long john yourself from fear
we woke as fuck get your god damn weak takes the fuck outta here
your identity politics are shit
go consensually suck a dick you pricks uhhhh

verse 24 will for thrill
will for thrill on the cut and we kickin’ it raw
when i catheterize beats they suck my dick through a straw
lyrically it’s just a fact that no one else can do it better
yeah my rhymes are blazing hot like texas weather in a sweater
yo my flow is so cold they had to bundle it up
it’s like a dairy queen blizzard when they flip the cup
sure maybe i can’t sing a ballad quite like nate ruess
or pick at a guitar like stevie playin’ the blues
‘stead i had to settle for the world’s greatest rapper
and and your girl callin’ me the worlds best ass clapper
it’s not enough to be the best i’m trying to get better
if you had a top 5 list im umbc the upsetter
whats good for the goose is even better for the gander
now i don’t wanna hear no slander ‘cause you know im droppin’ hammers
now we got a lot of verses so i’ll keep things short
155 against everybody we are here to save the world

verse 25 cooper kalamat
ive been down with the naysh since 074
way before vampy weekend was considered hardcore
who knew what fate had in store
when the boys bagged the man who scott raynor 155
yeah they got scott raynor
i would die for this pod and all it stands for
like sally and matty and teen prez 24
i just wish i was more punk and liked star wars
but the end is near man times are weird
the void is much larger than it may appear
and what we gonna do when our fridays are clear
lets just pray for more songs and 3 more years

death is the enemy erase my memory
death is the enemy erase my memory
death is the enemy erase my memories
get tom on the pod you can do it for bill billingsley

verse 26 split hairs
split hairs here
one half free punk lyrics here we go
155
friday
thats when i listen to my favorite guys
josiah sam nate from fun
there’s room in the naysh for everyone
spend a lotta time talkin’ youtube clips
makin’ mouth noises farts and sips
never thought we’d make it 156
now the pod’s almost over but we stay together for the bits

verse 27 mc laminiergerät
blink155 represent in germany
this shit goes worldwide like this virus emergency
its your bilingual genius on the fucking mic yall
du weißt yall tom mark travis sie sind einsa
rappin’ in two languages
es gibt echt nichts besseres
ich blinzel hundertzweiundachtzig mal und ich
denk mir youre whack as shit
josiah und sam haben keine ahnung was ich texte
doch ich schwöre es ist das fucking beste
oh and one more thing fuck leo dehoe
fuck your band fuck your videos fuck everything you stand for
you dont belong in this fanbase cest la vie arrivederci
rest in peace sally

verse 28 christian sam from the future
fast forward 12 years later
you wake up in the isogenic chamber
you ask me what year is this and who are you hurr
i said it’s 2032 blur i’m christian sam from the future
the youth pastor
coming at cha
josiah was right all along
so now i’m taking no more hits from the bong
just strictly tips from the bible
i went to a dark place after the libel
hashtag sutherlandiscanceled did explode
in the debris front the controversial dammit episode
shawn mendes’ lawyer couldnt save me
but jesus forgave me
i went to church and got my life right
junior battles covered “heaven is a halfpipe”
and once the pod was through
it was less blink182
more sam 211
ecclesians chapter 4 verse 7
our judgement night will all come thats a given
i just hope the nation gets to join me and sally in heaven

blink155

verse 29 andrew dine
i was small fry new to pods i was scrolling once
found this gem you know the rocks how
dumpweed i was hooked like a fish from the first word
two dorks talking bink on tip toes around the aged slurs
the next three months zoomed woo hoo like a blur
met bill said bye to sally cig mark bean tea
free punk lyrics fuck money wait what was 155
i caught the pack at 140 going away to college
all the sclusies ate em up patreon take my dollars
then came the streams i put faces to your words
the lips of all these angels spreading peace with the birds
cash for the cause fuck you to old chauvin
with a nation like ours i get patriotism
so heres my call to arms 16 bars posse cut
for better or for worse i guess this is growing up

verse 30 buttermuffin161
mic check 161 butermuffin here gettin it done
we got toronto salt lake calgary and sac town

la london all the way to wodonga
the nation’s huge and it keeps getting stronger
montreal new york indonesian
the bunny squad’s in your menchies all season
1 2 155 where’s old bill i wanna go for a drive
tom needs a dog and it’s gotta be trained
get back to the dude ranch and off the black rain
tom for real get on the pod
it has to happen  no cap on god
i’ll be listenin’ on bone like rod
fuck your grass no lawns no sod
this goes out to the pod and its disciples
f’s in the chat rip fatrick michaels

verse 31 luke irving
first shout out goes out to my man drew
and kyle from all the small things who said “i’ll learn you”
bill b drives us around in travis’ cadillac
while rachel’s on board to stop our hair looking wack
down under theres smelly chops matty nick joel and jason
reppin the south of the equator nation
and if you need some philosophy
look no further than our girl fifi
now it’s time to have fun with our boy nate ruess ruech
we spend every friday tweetin’ with the fentooz
of course i’m gonna mention georgia on this track
the geordie of the pod let’s have some g’s in the chat g g’s in the chat
shout out to the pod wives sara and ashley
see the pod take over our lives
now the time has come for me to stop spittin’ this fire
show some love to sam and josiah

verse 32 teen jazz
well heres a little rhyme that i made for a podcast
yeah that’s right i made something for a podcast
think thats weird have you ever heard of hinder
yeah never mind forget i even went there
now what’s this pod even all about
after 3 years still havent figured it out
it’s got stories of sketchy air bbs
and a cautionary tale of drinking slurpees
dishwasher sounds and backyard dentistry
tv repairs and snakes in purgatory
man buns and the sinner’s prayer
lemme grab a sap sucker from the dep downstairs
memers and a few guests named chris
runescape felon and mark hoppus
tim heidecker dan reynolds and nate ruess
and last but not least blink182

verse 33 matthew ohanian
where are you and i’m so sorry
delonge you missed your chance to get in on this party tom delonge’s a wanker
see you don’t give the nation the mark hoppus treatment tom delonge’s a wanker
so sit down and shut up for once and i’ll learn you this sequence tom delonge’s a wanker
you know you’re pathetic your ford tough aesthetic
as fake as the punk cred you had after scott left
you really can’t sing you used to be charming
but this ava shit is just embarrassing
this isn’t star wars no you don’t have the force
you’re doing busy work for some cia dorks
you’re a poser you’re delusional you’re a fuck boy you’re a jerk
i think it’s about time for the boys to file for divorce
you’ve got a lot of time to do your mistress on the side
but i guess you’re just too busy to do blink155
you’ve got a lot to say to your teenage girl fans
but not a single word for the sutherland stans
you fucked with the naysh and the bonds broke for good
break up with us once and we’re never doing neighborhoods tom delonge’s a wanker
fish tracks
tom delonge’s a wanker
gotta face facts youll never come on the pod
i guess you’re too fucking busy fucking cumming in your dog
we tried to be civil and talk aliens exist
but time’s run out you fucked around the nation’s fucking pissed
you think you can come crawling back it’s not gonna be like that
the posse will stand arminarm you’re gonna hear us spit back
“hell na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na”

verse 34 toesexe
toesexe

they didnt really drop bombs on 911
uh they did a lot after and before though
shit’s fucked up

verse 35 fuzzy eric
travis barker plays with such machismo
siento que un problemo eso capitalismo
i’m recording a verse ya gotta call me later
i’m as coherent as a facebook post from paul schrader
i only rap on beats that sound like a select screen
if i say something offensive feel free to correct me
i feel like i’m in the lords song we’re on each other’s team
i just want josiah to be happy by any means
this beat is so zesty
it’s gonna test me
like oooo you gonna make me do somethin’
my lyrical inspiration
good gracious its gotta be joanna newsom
read political theory
and then you hear me
and then youll be enlightened
if i get invited to your show im not gonna go if the bill is all white men

verse 36 big cum
hi my name is uh big cum and i’m here i’m here uh to rap for you
here we go

it’s big cum rubbin’ at ya ya better jerk faster
when it comes to ‘bating your mom says you’re a master
cum shots they just don’t miss
stick to your body like the morning mist
if you’re kind maybe i’ll blow a little kiss
‘cause i know you cant get enough of this
yo big cum
we got the posse cut straight from the naysh
coming to spread dude ranch on your face
making a mess all over the place

so my timing was a little off at a point um i’m sure you can edit it or you can keep it i dont really care my name is big cum have a good day

verse 38 dustin bromley

mark hoppus og he’s the last of us
posi dad tweets are set to maximum

tom tom tom you been gone gone delonge

matt who just a sheep in tom’s clothes

verse 39 sam sutherland
here’s a little story i’ve got to tell
about a gold prospector we all know so well
it started way back in the yukon rush
when sam mcgee from tennessee led his dogs to mush
shit got very cold by christmas day
so we decided lake lebarge was the place to stay
sam was feeling bad so we swore an oath
i’d cremate his remains unless death came for us both
at the same time
but it didnt sam died
and now i have to find a way to cremate him with pride
then i found a boat called the alice may
and i burned that mother fucker in that old boat grave
but wouldnt you know sam had other plans
when i walked back in he was alive as any man
there’s that sam lookin calm in the roar
with a smile as wide as the alice may’s door
he said “please close the door or you’ll let in the storms
since i left tennessee it’s the first ive been warm”
there are strange things done under the midnight sun
but the strangest i ever did see
was a 3 hour podcast
about jizz and bombast
but also the cremation of sam mcggee

clip from hamilton performed by linmanuel miranda clip provided by emma from punkgoespod
ima get a scholarship to kings college
i probly shouldnt brag but dag i amaze and astonish
the problem is i got a lot of brains but no polish
i gotta holler just to be heard
with every word i drop knowledge
i  record scratch

blink155

outro 2 time grammy winner nate ruess and sick jacken
