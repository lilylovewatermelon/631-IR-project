boy ill teach you how to hunt
how to take a hit when you wanna run
ill teach you how to drink a beer drive a stick
throw a fastball and catch a fish
ill teach you how to be tough

chorus
but when she walks in shell mess you up
shell make you wanna learn to dance and go clean out your truck
youre gonna think youre strong enough
but when she looks you in the eyes and tells you shes in love
well good luck being tough

verse 2
when it gets late drive her home
youll wanna stay the night but its better if you dont
and boy youre gonna have your first fight
and you wont sleep at all
shell stay at her best friends
and wont pick up your calls

chorus
but when she walks in shell mess you up
boy say youre sorry first cause thats what a real man does
youre gonna think youre strong enough
but when you almost lose the woman that you love
oh good luck being tough
yeah good luck being tough

when she walks in and they say all rise
and shes standing with her daddy in all white

but hold your breath boy cause here she comes
good luck being tough
good luck being toughembed"
