melon and the coconut are sittin on the floor
coco said to melly i cant do this anymore
everything were doin just feels fuckin cold
everything were shootin thats just fake broll
bsides killing time filler thats all
how did things happen when we were so close
how did this all go so pete tong
when it all started i thought we would grow old
living in the city with a baby and a dog
doing school runs in a four by four
i make pancakes and waffles
i could be a stay at home gi joe

interlude

verse 2
melly said to coco you cant do this anymore
one day youll see youre fuckin wrong
sometimes bsides are the best songs
sometimes killing times very fruitful
i know i cant make you younger
i cant stop life movin onwards
i cant hide you from lifes horrors
im not makin you like your father
too much quinoa and online shopping
offwhite air force ones in boxes
youre a fucking coconut cant even put em on
even if you could you couldnt even pull em offyou might also like7embed"
