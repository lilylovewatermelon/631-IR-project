you say you dont know what you were thinking
well neither do i
and after the time we spent together
you think you deserve another try

well girl i dont know what it is
that youre expecting
just because you looked me in the eye

chorus
and say youre sorry
oh youre sorry
you want it back the way it was
well im sorry
but sometimes sorry
just aren’t good enough

verse 2
you say you never meant to hurt me
well that might be true
but do you really think i should forgive you
for what you put me through

oh i remember every time you said you loved me
but i know now your love was just a lie

verse 3
oh girl i dont know what it is
that youre expecting
just because you looked me in the eye

and say youre sorry

chorus
oh youre sorry
so sorry
and you want it back the way it was
well im sorry
but sometimes sorry
just aren’t good enough1embed"
