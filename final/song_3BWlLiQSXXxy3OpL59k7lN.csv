i saw you smile
i knew you had spirit
oh wont you let your colors run
and isnt it odd the way we try to tell ourselves we got limits
youre beautiful but you just dont see it sometimes
and i dont know why

prechorus
oh youre the shape of my days
oh youre my holy place
and i know

chorus
everything is good
everythings just as it should be
when youre alone with me
everything is good
everythings just as it should be
when were alone
when i fall im fine
all i wanted was your time
everything is good
everythings just as it should be
when youre alone alone with me

ill sit right here ‘til you start talking
ill wait it out ‘til you come round
it pays to look up in the big city
everything moves so fast
it pays to look up
cause you dont know what you might see
when you look around

prechorus
oh youre the shape of my days
oh youre my holy place
and i know

chorus
everything is good
everythings just as it should be
when youre alone with me
everything is good
everythings just as it should be
when were alone

here i am saying things to you

im doing things with you i never thought wed do
im seeing into you
prechorus
oh youre the shape of all my days
oh youre my holy place
and i know

chorus
everything is good
everythings just as it should be
when youre alone with me
everything is good
everything’s just as it should be
when were alone
when i fall im fine
all i wanted was your time
everything is good
everythings just as it should be
when youre alone alone with me
