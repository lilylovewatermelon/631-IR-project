it came to the end
it seems you had heard
as we walked the city streets
you never said a word
when we finally sat down
your eyes were full of spite
i was desperate i was weak
i could not put up a fight

chorus
but where are you now
where are you now
do you ever think of me
in the quiet in the crowd

verse 2
you were strangely less in pain
than you were cold
triumphant in your mind
of the logic that you hold
you said no one would ever know
the love that we had shared
as i took my leave to go
it was clear you didnt care
you might also likechorus
but where are you now
where are you now
do you ever think of me
in the quiet in the crowd
where are you now
where are you now
do you ever think of me
in the quiet in the crowd

verse 3
and i hear of your coming
and your going in the town
i hear stories of your smile
i hear stories of your frown
and the darkness can descend
we can relish all the pain
but i know thats what you love
cause you know i love the same

chorus
but where are you now
where are you now
do you ever think of me
in the quiet in the crowd
where are you now
where are you now
do you ever think of me
in the quiet in the crowd
but where are you now
where are you now
do you ever think of me
in the quiet in the crowd5embed"
