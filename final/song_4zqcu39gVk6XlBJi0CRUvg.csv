this is a strange life with the people i know
all have the same life everywhere that i go
so i say fuck life ill try to be alone
this is a strange night with the people i know
the people i know
the people i know
the people i know

verse 2
this is a strange night i feel really weird
someone pulled out a knife put it up to my ear
i cant see anything where do i start
dont cut my eyeballs cut into my heart
cut into my heart
cut into my heart
cut into my heart
cut into my heart

outro
cut into my heart
cut into my heart
cut into my heart
cut into my heart
cut into my heart
cut into my heartsee current joys liveget tickets as low as 248you might also likeembed"
