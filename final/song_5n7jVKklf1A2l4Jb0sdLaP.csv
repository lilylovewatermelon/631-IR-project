so we got geechi gotti versus
i  heard you like to hit girls you hoeass nigga
so  maybe it’s time i give this bitch a beatin’
head shot blow his brains on his mama tell this trick to clean it
i’ll make sure your dome’ll stick on a bitch got a different meaning
dome’ll  stick domestic what a nigga reachin’
so  what the pole dump
and i kept a grip for this pussy like the old trump
every  bar man
now hold up
what your words ain’t work on her so you had to use your fists
i already heard what happened
you  hit her she ate it ptoo
looked at you and said “nigga you’se a bitch”
every fuckin’ bar
you’se a fag and it’s plain to see
think about his multiple choices
his answer’s always
see you’se a queer bro
topoftheline weirdo
you threw a nigga chain in the crowd like “go and get it”
bitch throw my chain in the crowd you goin’ wit’ it
and bro i’m trippin’
they said you gotta get personal to beat him
he one of the scariest vets
for real “every battle you had before him was barely a threat”
the homies like “so did you find any dirt on john john”
i’m like “nah cuz we ain’t buried him yet”
yeah on the set
i’ll show up to your house catch ya lil’ man and slump him it’s bedtime
then i’ll throw the gun on the pillow
y’all gon’ realize why i’m mr disrespectful wit’ the next line
when he come in the house and find his baby laid in bed next to a tec9 tech 9
the west mine
bitch i run that region
soon as they booked this y’all know he fucked like he left wit’ her and he come back cheesin’
what are you smilin’ fo’
just ‘cause my gun lil john jon don’t mean shit sweet my boy
the bullet’ll enter south and come out ya eastside boy boyz
this ain’t crunk music
you jump stupid and i’mma shoot ‘til there ain’t no more shells in the shotgun
i’m dumb ruthless
i’m still on top of this bitch after i’m done bustin’but the pump’s useless
what what
i’ve been on some cool shit but now i’m finna change on him
he don’t gotta be in a gang  guns still finna bang on him
let my nuts hang on him
he ain’t gon’ do shit
he was already leakin’ from the head shot
this chest shot gave him some new drip
ooh shit
lookmotherfucker i will beat this nigga ass
i’m talkin’ ‘bout pistolwhippin’
yeah ‘til both his eyes both swell
and you gon’ see the skull crack and bone hangin’ out his top like sideshow mel
this ain’t a cartoon i’m a grownass man
i’ll blow your brains on avocado and the crew
so whatever they don’t see in the building i guarantee they’ll catch it on cam’
nigga my gun go “blam” get his toe tagged up
then he goin’ in a tight box like the first nigga jaz let fuck
this nigga suck
he mad that i battled surf ‘cause he wanna battle surf so bad
he be on twitter ravin’ and rantin’ ‘til his face all red
bad barber he steady askin’ for the wave i just gave him a bald head
aw yeah the face shot dent his grill
he gon’ need insurance for them damages
what the fuck is multiple choices now he got multiple bandages
nigga we savages
this nigga jj ain’t really built like that
bruh’ll get popped
the 40 shootin’ or i could have the 50 poppin’ like when “wanksta” just dropped
you ain’t a gangsta just stop
nigga these is all facts
niggas like you and dna be happy y’all can talk crazy to niggas like me ‘cause y’all can disguise it as “all rap”
but see i’m wit’ all that
y’all niggas internet gangstas
if y’all ain’t ‘in’ and taggin’ a nigga it don’t feel right
me i’d rather get at  and tag a nigga in real life
and i feel like vada fly gon’ recap this and say gotti caught a 30 on the don bro
headshot watch him die slow
the coroner said the victim was nameless but somehow his mama still knew it was john tho’ doe
and when it’s real y’all can tell
y’all can see it in his eyes
yo’ turn  see if you can make niggas believe them lies
nigga time
you might also likeround 1 john john da don
let’s give it up for geechi gotti
give this man his credit while he’s still here
i figured if crip been on a roll i guess i will cheer wheelchair
how many of y’all got geechi winnin’ tonight
quite a few people in the crowd raise their hands
damni never felt so destroyed
see how easy it was for you to get my number in tampa bay
i feel like gerald mccoy
but you know my name clown
ain’t no need to run my accolades down
just think of prep wavy jakk’ and every other act i laid down
i didn’t need to battle a show host to begin my run
but since your streak got started by a tech tec it’s ‘bout to end by one
champion
but you been gassed ever since the day they made him champ
head still in the clouds bow
now you the reigning raining champ
yeah you took the title last year  thank blac for that
‘til i come off the belt and ring again on a champ he goin’ backtoback
geechi got bundles and geechi got shot
that’s what you tellin’ me
well damn i ain’t know the hair business was this deadly sheesh
you sellin’ weave i can help you triple your units
geechi got bundles i got a bald head business is boomin’
i heard some niggas caught him slippin’ in the whip like “what you got in there”
boxed in like that ‘70s show
you know tried to mash mash open and seen a chopper air
so danny i gotta believe in a parallel universe and it’s kinda weird
‘cause y’all told me geechi got bundles but couldn’t weave the extensions that almost got him outta here hair
but wait bro
you mean to tell me your gangsta name is bay loc
is it me or don’t that sound like the butt of a gay joke
stay woke
double d’s like pamela anderson the way they poppin’ out
that just mean i’ll give him what i owed surf will old surfer show why they shoulda told bay watch baywatch his mouth
they put a nigga wit’ this gangsta rep vers’ a dangerous vet
it’s on you to bring me comp’ then compton crip
nigga bang your set
i’ll aim the tec line him razorfresh  that mean the blade come next
so i can shoot him stab him at the same time
left so many holes i made bay a net bayonet
i’ll take a check
your name came wit’ a serious price
get it they gave john gotti so my fee’ll be right
that’s how the mafia be right
and i’m the don so i’m above ‘em all
you the capo no
get buried  now you the underboss
cuz or not they won’t be able to get the blood to stop
any uncool uncle feelings i’mma take it out on cuz and cousin pop
so cross the fine line
all the forces might find is your pupils and your heart
brought a new meaning to “organized crime”
i heard rumors about coffee and how sexin’ is good
all she known for is forest her throat ‘round her neck of the woods
gotti hated on the last nigga the best that he could
you could ask him ‘bout that nut he block nutty bloc
let him tell it he just reppin’ his ‘hood
but would it fold ya folger’s if i had some of coffee
now i got sleepin’ problems
i could keep it sweet n’ low as long as makin’ her cream a creamer option
you mad
even if you was nigga too bad
i’ll come to your set trippin’ and put blood on that blue flag
but what kinda nut are you i’m just askin’ bro
‘cause all men almond worry about is the cash used cashews to keep a ratchet ho
even if i mack a dame he’ll macadamia know ‘cause she’ll be glad to go
and be immune so for what i make her puss stash she owe pistachio
i’m gladly though
i’m only here ‘cause i’m gettin’ that cash
it’s a body and it’s time for you to get in that bag
so just know when you get done spittin’ that trash
you know
there’s still one more round of me whippin’ that ass
round 1
round 2 geechi gotti
i know it sounded cool y’feel me
but he still up to his old tricks and y’all niggas let it work
he said “bay loc gay joke stay woke”
nome 9  we already heard that from surf
you still stealin’
he wanted me to let that shit slide
he said “organized crime”
smack volume 3  i heard that from shine
you still stealin’
fuck is he talkin’ about
aye but good shit john john clapclap
but now i’m finna snap on him
y’all didn’t even catch that i told johnny “bravo” johnny bravo then let it clap on him
the mac on him
they told me “don’t slack on him”
it’s too late  he already in the casket wit’ the slacks on him
you fuckin’ bar thief
you really is a clown
it’s crazy y’all fans be hopin’ that he ain’t steal a round
then it’s “bow”  now y’all hopin’ that he still around

john john da don
i said that

geechi gotti
drive slow let the window down i’m finna spray
headshot  fuck a multiple choice
he dead  he can’t answer shit anyway
the semi spray on a fraud bitch
face shot from the fo’fo’ watch his jaws rip
yeah i brought a bulldog to the vet my dog sick
aw shit
they say “why’d you shoot him again”
i say “why bother”
pistolwhip the don ‘til his jaws swell up like the godfather
nigga mafia shit
when they see me and my niggas they be like “i know them guys”
the gun propped up look how the shoulder ride
that bitch be s
brbrrbrbrr
y’all see how the chopper was stutterin’ on the stand like korey wise
nigga stop them mothafuckin’ lies
you a vet in battle rap i’m a vet in the streets
that’s a totally different energy
whenever i had problems wit’ a nigga i brought the beef to his front do’
that’s how i showed i had delivery
y’all wanna talk about chemistry
me and my partna done laid plenty niggas down befo’
everybody in the room followin’ my commands during the robbery that’s crowd control
nigga i done really been down them roads
trials and tribulations they was great lessons
my head held high in the courtroomthat’s stage presence
but i ain’t flexin’ i’m just proud to be reppin’ mine
i’m an intricate shooter so if a round ever went over a nigga head i made sure he caught it the second time
you a vet in battle rapi’m a vet in the streets
i know it’s a gang of shit you usually teach them other niggas but it ain’t gon’ be wit’ me tonight
niggas know you for stealin’but i guaranteed he never had to take a life
now i ain’t sayin’ it’s right but bro i’m a demon
you done made niggas stop rappin’ i done made niggas stop breathin’
bro you not a goon
all of a sudden you this vocal
you used to be humble
what are you tryin’ to prove
weirdass nigga barely comin’ out of his shell…
let’s see how long it take for a shell to come out of you
every
look they can’t react ‘cause they gotta listen to this shit
yo’ shit simple
yo’ shit simple they know when it’s comin’
“geechi did this and that then it was flat”
nigga shut the fuck up
i can do it too ‘cause look
you not a fool but you was dumb enough to hit ya lady
what was wrong you couldn’t use your voice
she didn’t respect you
wait hold up  let’s just use a multiple choice
was it a you beat that bitch ass just for fun
was it b you tripped her soon as she tried to run
was it c you hit her wit’ a bare hand and not a glove
y’all know the answer  it’s d
all of the above
see how stupid that shit is
and i got sons to raise so beatin’ on bitches to me is a lame example
the difference between me and you
if i gotta put my hands on a bitch it’s to aim it at you
the banger clap you
this an easy death
blow his brains on his fit since he think he fresh
i think he stressed ‘cause they told him he couldn’t hang wit’ them hood rhymes
they gave me jj in florida
they knew it was gon’ be some good times
he couldn’t handle a “bigga 9”
imagine how this tommy feel
face shot open his cheeks
my my my i done gave johnny gills
i’ve been poppin’ pills might get to trippin’
i grip the biscuit aim it at his top and i peel it appellate like a prison sentence
i’m wit’ the business like this a job
hand over the grip feel like you gettin’ robbed
nigga the pistol cocked no hesitatin’
‘cause where i’m from niggas like that they never made it
yeah i was gon’ use the 40 but i know i bet he hate it
that’s why i’mma use the nina ‘cause the 9 don’t play wit’ these niggas she segregated
aye but look he ain’t on that top god
look he really on that nobodytier
nobody likes him
the reason that you like to catch niggas in between battles now that’s what gotti fear
‘cause you wasn’t doin’ shit ‘til you start becomin’ the owner of the bullpen that’s kinda clear
‘cause his writin’ basic
cassidy voice the bullpen boul pen ain’t what got him here
and when it’s real y’all can tell
y’all can see it in his eyes
now go ‘head see if you can make niggas believe them stealin’ass lines
nigga time
round 2 john john da don
what you say
“when it’s real you can tell  y’all can see it in they eyes
yo’ turn  see if you can make niggas believe them lies”
well when you rap how could you see anything when your eyes are down
if i cap it’ll put him on his back like “who lyin’ now”
but y’all believe geechi gotti right yeah yessir
shit i do too
and that makes us and shit everybody else that watches him on youtube
with that said i got a couple questions that i won’t let you dodge
everything you ever said in a battle is the truth the whole truth and nothin’ but the truth so help you god
so you really shot niggas wit’ ya eyes squinted to avoid the blood splatter
or killed a nigga went to the funeral gave his mother a hug after
what a thug rapper…
but he’d been showin’ other signs y’all just couldn’t read ‘em
‘cause if he’ll tell on himself for views imagine what he’d do for f
nigga you’se a snitch
wasn’t you supposed to do a year and made a post about it
came home in a week talkin’ ‘bout the jail was “overcrowded”
how you beat a case without goin’ to court
yeah this dude wild
always talk about crip initiationsfunny how he never blew blue trial
that’s too foul
i blame your ogs for settin’ bad examples
pistolwhip him  y’all don’t remember white chocolate  ‘til i crack a cracker handle
nigga you wouldn’t kill a vibe or wax a candle
whoever act mysterious meet meat in the can i don’t have to spam you
we ain’t gotta do no online beefin’
‘cause in real life you let your crip homie get jumped in houston during nome 9 weekend
am i lyin’ geechi
see they should just remove you from the set
colin kaepernick ‘cause he ain’t really stand for the flag  he just do it for the check
but you got some nerve tellin’ niggas “you’se a bitch” when you’se a bitch
your crew look sick
aren’t orange you blue or wh now you hoover crip
i don’t wanna talk just shoot the shit
shawshank been through some shit
get john mad and madden intercept a bullet  that’s a user pick
we movin’ this culture in the wrong direction
puttin’ these smalltime peasants versus alltime legends
y’all know what happened to mr wavy
when you see that boy ask him
y’all even told me jakkboy was offthechain and you see how far that went
wit’ all of these chain of events it’s mindbogglin’
i wouldn’t dare throw geechi bigass chain i might drop it
good thing i snuck this lil’ deucedeuce in my side pocket
so i ain’t gotta tell him “go get it” ‘cause i got it
nigga all you do is brag about a life that you had to live
you ain’t choose to grow up in the grandees but lemme guess you glad you did
nigga you ain’t have no other options  time tickin’
so i guess i gotta give him the multiple choices god didn’t
like a fly in his mouth since he talkin’ like he bug
or b open his heart  now he finally showin’ love
no c rip  you know what it is cuz
no d start from his feet and shoot all of the above
but like i said you only became crip because they forced you to
bay loc don’t let me hear you brought in any more recruits
or i’mma bury him on his feet while he leakin’ from a cross or two
ain’t that what nipsey always wanted
to have a crip and blood under standin’  it’s time to call a truce
this all for you
i’m only here ‘cause i’m gettin’ that cash
this a body and it’s time for you to get in that bag
so just know when you get done gettin’ that gassed
there’s still one more round of me whippin’ that ass

round 3 geechi gotti
yo you made up a story knowin’ the truth
my partna did have a fight at an event in houston when i wasn’t there and i couldn’t show up
i seen the footage though  cuh beat ‘em both up
aye but makin’ up lies on stage that’s somethin’ that a lame’ll do
talk about north carolina when niggas pressed pc and he came wit’ you
yeah “tell the truth bang ya tool”
nothin’ happened to him you better be lucky nothin’ happened to you
nigga shut the fuck up…
but aye what’s up wit’ loso man
sometimes i just be wantin’ to headshot him…
and stomp a christian out in some j’s ‘til they redbottoms
nigga what’s your problem
he treat you like you god ‘cause on bullpen you be bookin’ him the matches
but then you gave that nigga brizz and he got his ass kicked
ain’t it crazy how he put him in the water befo’ he was ready
oh you john the baptist
that shit tragic
him and his boy be talkin’ ‘bout the lord and what jesus do
nigga we watched he got game
to us jesus was a shooter too
every fuckin’
aye listen though man  back to you
against twork you ain’t even wanna let jakk’ rap
that’s how i knew that you was a clown dawg
when i was a kid a nigga pulled the gun out on me
i said “bitch bust” he ain’t even let it sound off
that’s the difference between me and cuh
i ain’t never been afraid to let a nigga get his rounds off
being a sucka is what’s gon’ be your downfall
and you don’t even see that shit
even wit’ them glasses  idolizin’ real niggas knowin’ you could never be that shit
and on me that’s it
‘cause since a kid i been poppin’ like land mines
my first guns was a 38 and a 30 too like my pants size
so when the opps came through blastin’
it was no surprise
even my granny told me to raise ‘em up like my pants were saggin’
now nigga there you have it no lies told
y’all gon’ see a headshot turn john john to steve austin
that’s just how it goes
when his fam’ walk up stunned and realize the body was stone cold
i done traveled down the wrong roads
we all got dead homies
it’s a difference when you really gotta bury shit
it’s just a difference when you really gotta bury shit
bein’ a pallbearer lookin’ at a mother nigga that’s really some scary shit
knowin’ that you gotta carry the kid for her like you a surrogate
but see me i done really had to air the fif’
i done caught niggas slippin’ on the backstreet
you right i took a year
the judge offered me seven  i said “that’s weak week”
but see he like to put his pen to the pad
they wanted to make the pen’ my pad
we got different rap sheets
make him rap
please just make him rap
tell him to rap please and then i’ll let y’all say he did good
but ask him
what have you really been through john
the shit that i rap about is true i done really lived through john
you not one of us
battle rap is the only time you got a gun to bust
so when you do your hand like this real shooters take it like you makin’ fun of us
‘cause i know you ain’t never shot a nigga
and i ain’t sayin’ that you wouldn’t if you had to
but dawg look at me  i done shot niggas when i ain’t even have to
and it’s facts fool
lame shit
how is it snitchin’ when the next round he gon’ be sayin’ the same shit
i ain’t even have to and it’s facts fool
we was kids puttin’ in work
shit we was eager and we was glad to
shootouts  them pops came to see us more than our real dads do
and it’s facts too
i’m talkin’ ‘bout i was doin’ this before i even joined wit’ the gang
in and out of jail bringin’ my family the shame
it’s nobody’s fault though
i put myself in the system like i created my player on the game
you see how we not the samehuh
‘cause you portray to be a gangsta but you really a ho though john
30clip aim it at his glasses and squeeze in the frame lastminute like a photobomb
there’s somethin’ i wanna know though john
is you from new york or the ahuh
aye nigga for real like make your mind up
fuck that  time’s up
i don’t mess wit’ the fakes
it ain’t where you from  it’s where you at
bah now he in a vegetable state
you wanna know the shit that i hate
niggas like you tryin’ to be cool dyin’ to fit in
where i’m from we literally had to kill to fit in
you’se a weirdo
be at the club standin’ outside tryna see if he still can get in
bitch i ain’t goin’ in the club unless the steel can get in
aye but i’m at my wit’s end wit’ this shit ‘cause i’m too real for itfor real
‘cause a nigga know that i’m tryna make it wit’ this rap shit ‘cause the streets don’t love me
family don’t even wanna invest in you ‘til a nigga dead and all of a sudden it’s gofundme
but when it’s real y’all can tell
y’all can see it in they eyes
it’s yo’ turn  see if you can make niggas believe them lies
nigga time

round 3 john john da don
what’s thatatlanta houston tampa
i’m just happy that y’all merged down south
but hold ony’all finally gon’ let me get my third round out
‘cause this battle coulda ended like my last one
why change the script
when i could put his lights out and get him jacked jakk’ in the crowd since we the main event
every fuckin’ bar
you say that all the time like it’s somethin’ new
you don’t think i could punch every other line if i wanted to
nigga i’d rather punch scheme angle build u
shit everything helps
and that’s what happens when mr every fuckin’ bar meets mr everything else
‘cause you be turnin’ up with leeches
that’s a party full of suckas
‘cause you always wit’cha niggas but you hardly wit’cha brothas
i’m a menace ii society  no not like that chauncy mu’fucka
i’ll get the drop  wit’ this 40 i feel sorry for ya motha
but i wonder how he managed to stay safe in the trenches
speakin’ on shit you seen your homies do that only makes you a witness
get it that’s how i know you scared and would tell
let’s make the truth clear
‘cause if all of your homies dead or in jail then why are you here
let’s stop glorifyin’ this gang life  this shit blows me
‘cause y’all be deep in the streets but when you locked in that cell it gets lonely
and it ain’t like you hold any kind of rank  at least that’s what one of your crips told me
‘cause since june your junior mafia look like little c’s lil cease
so now he think he the big big homie
shit phony
have any of y’all seen him let it fly
so y’all believin’ what y’all hearin’ when it could even be a lie
you can ask god about me when you meet him in the sky
and when it’s real you can tell  you can see it in his eyes
b magic rum nitty now you  probably get tsu next
that should verify how i got all these niggas in blue checked
who’s left
i know crippin’ come from your home
difference is somebody put you down wit’ the crips
i blew blue up on my own
so how dare you call me a “bar thief” when that’s not right
think about it ‘cause when you a bar thief you do not write
and all i do is try to kill every nigga they put in my sight
so the only thing i stole from anybody was the spotlight
but y’all don’t fuck wit’ me  why
is it ‘cause my confidence
or ask yourself if my claims are backed by my accomplishments
it’s hard to not say i’m a winner
kawhi leonard i took it beyond rap to raptor make a way wit’ them clippers
fuck it since i’m bringin’ war to la
wait  water la i’mma lake a laker nigga
lakers clippers  bow either way you get a stapled center
i knew this would wood get under your skin prick it ain’t a splinter
before the flash you ‘posed to keep still
aye can you take this picture
that’s wack
and vers’ hollow i brought out the mirror
yeah y’all was watchin’ me
then vers’ ored i brought out the robe the gold versace beast
jakkboy black wealth chain i showed the timerelease
but guess what i brought for geechi gotti what
nothin’ ‘cause he gon’ have to earn them props from me
‘cause honestly your name shouldn’t be mentioned wit’ greats
feel like i’m battlin’ a nigga wit’ a lisp  this was a thpit in the face
aye but you on your way
let’s show some black power and it’s beautiful…
no fuck it then
i can save those flowers for his funeral
tell surf stop being gay and come fight
from smokin’ you from the ocean view i got the wave in my sight
but please don’t say the “john” if you ain’t sayin’ it twice
and if you don’t add the “don” you ain’t sayin’ it right
stop fuckin’ playin’ wit’ me1embed"
