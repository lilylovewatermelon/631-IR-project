target on my back
lone survivor lasts
they got me in their sights
no surrender no
trigger fingers go
living the dangerous life
hey hey hey
everyday when i wake
im trying to get up theyre knocking me down
chewing me up spitting me out
hey hey hey
when i need to be saved
youre making me strong youre making me stand
never will fall never will end

prechorus john cooper
shot like a rocket up into the sky
nothing can stop me tonight

chorus john cooper  jen ledger
you make me feel invincible
earthquake powerful
just like a tidal wave
you make me brave
youre my titanium
fight song raising up
like a roar of victory in a stadium
who can touch me cause im
im made of fire
who can stop me tonight
im hard wired
you make me feel invincible
