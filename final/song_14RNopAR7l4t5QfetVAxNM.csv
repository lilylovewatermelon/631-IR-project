and the fevered chase of a tiny star
its a hotel room and a lonely wife
from what ive seen of a showmans life

nobody told me about this part
they told me all about the pretty girls and the wine
and the money and the good times
theres no mention of
all the wear and tear on an old honkytonkers heart
well i might have known it but nobody told me about this part

a boy will dream
as children do
of a great white way
til the dream comes true
and a phony smile and a colored light
is all there is
to a showmans life

nobody told me about this part
they told me all about the pretty girls and the wine
and the money and the good times
theres no mention of
all the wear and tear on an old honkytonkers heart
well i might have known it but nobody told me about this part

they told me all about the pretty girls and the wine
and the money and the good times
theres no mention of
all the wear and tear on an old honkytonkers heart
well i might have known it but nobody told me about this part

well i might have known it but nobody told me about this partembed"
