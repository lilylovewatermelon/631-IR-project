verse 1 john legend
the first time i met you
you were so quiet and cool you
never thought that you would kiss my heart the way you did
all of the sadness in passing
making me feel like im past it
but you really end in the sweetest way

prechorus john legend
oh im so commended by you
all in my music all you
do you keeps me surfing on the hook that we can be together are you
i hope you listen to this
i hope you get to feel this because everything is you
