run that back turbo

verse 1 lil baby
tryna make a change
tryna make a dollar when i only had some change
sittin inside a one man cell i tightened up my brain
i cant fuck with all of yall im tightenin up my game
im too far for me to complain
no one came as hard as i done came fasho
i couldve kept going but i made a lane for bro
thats what you posed to do
if any nigga overstep they boundaries you supposed to shoot
and its enough money in it for all of us ill post your music
i know that this shit is a façade i aint gon let em fool me
i cant put my trust inside no broad i aint gon let em use me
i done put her hеart inside my pocket i aint gon nevеr lose it
i done had to stand in front of the judge and tell her im a user
damn go to sleep we fucking
wake up then we fussing
baby we cant force it
love will run its course
ill make you call my name until you lose your voice
me and money married we fuck off as a couple
taking uppers cause i dont like to be down too much
but i sip syrup and i dont play around too much
take my word you cant just be down with us
we put in work
half a ticket on a phantom just to ride around atlanta
my lil boys gon make the forbes list
dress my mom up for these award shows
im just happy it aint court dates
i ride raris i dont horseplay
im a grown ass man gotta have a blicky when i land
you keepin your business clean everyone trying to endorse you
i will never stick my dick in no one i pay child support to
ive been tryna build a fortune got millions for my niece and nephew
ive been playing in a trampoline whoever falling ima catch you
if you wanna play that shit so sour you know i wouldve helped you
how the fuck you leaving without me it aint no going in
all a nigga told me it was free but i still gave him ten
we do what we want it aint no asking
you might also likechorus lil baby
take your rollie off when you sliding they say time will tell
you gon die get you some money or you go to jail
all these choppers will turn this city to a living hell
it was crowded on the elevator i took the stairs
lost some people on the way up but i dont even care
i cant keep you but for the night i want to please your body
i want to please your body i

verse 2 lil durk
if it aint no wock then i drink tris
cant no promoter book my bitch
cant name a nigga from chicago ever said they took my shit
i cant post up like a killer knowing them niggas killed my twin
we gon spin til we get dizzy we gon spin til we see him
child support did me wrong tried to get me out a m
only time i hear from them when i post money on my gram
when to herman i need a big kit on my lamb
she a ifa so she keeping on her beads when she praying
my lawyers dogs when i call they get richer by the case
i got niggas fuck with dogfood and get richer by the day
i know watches your shit fake i could tell a richard by its face
real nigga when im around yall i be feeling out of place
the industry aint let me in the judge aint let me travel then
aint no solid percs i might go check one of them capsules in
and i know some hoes that run they mouth thats why i dont never see em
all my diamonds gia certified them
no cap got a top tier bitch she my side bitch
bitches from the trenches claim they kids on they taxes
how you dressing better than your kids you need your ass kicked
a laugh he wasnt matching now he matching with his casket
chorus lil baby
take your rollie off when you sliding they say time will tell
you gon die get you some money or you go to jail
all these choppers will turn this city to a living hell
it was crowded on the elevator i took the stairs
lost some people on the way up but i dont even care
i cant keep you but for the night i want to please your body
i want to please your body i3embed"
