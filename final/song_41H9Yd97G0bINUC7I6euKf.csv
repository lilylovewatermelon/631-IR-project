till them chains come undone
fighting a battle that you’ve already won
singing “hey hey mama
look at me
standing down on twelfth street
pocket full of misery”
boxcars and bad luck
well they never were your friends
the whiskey and the lightning
well it brought you round again
you were singing “hey hey mama
look at me
standing down on twelfth street
pocket full of misery”
back down in texas
where they all new your name
seven come eleven
you could hear them angels sing
they were singing “hey hey mama
look at me
standing down on twelfth street
pocket full of misery”
they were singing “hey hey mama
take a look at me
standing down on twelfth street
pocket full of misery”you might also likeembed"
