ever carried the weight of another
for how long
i walk as far as they need to recover
for how long ha

verse 1
i want to carry a piece of who i was before
so when i hit the wall i really hit the wall
i want to tear away the death again
a whiter shade of fucking meth again
i want to stick to clues i want to come unglued
i want to shape the world to fit the way you move
oh should i listen for a dress size
i owned up ive grown up do you remember me
i showed up and so what if im the used to be
im here to tell you that im sorry i was sorry
but im happy that youre happy
this is no longer about me
trade roles switch sides for your beautiful eyes
let him be there through your beautiful cries
let him hold you up so you can touch affordable skies
live your life just like a dream without the pain of goodbyes
goodbye

chorus
ever carried the weight of another
for how long
i walk as far as they need to recover
for how long
see blue october liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likeverse 2
i been a drunk disrespectful little street punk
unlock the back of my trunk
you see you take this bat
and bash my head into the street again
no ones around so i keep beating it
i pull my hair back look me in the eye
theres a selfdestructive meaning in the bleeding of a guy
its the guilt of what reality has given me
making sense of all mistakes and my stupidity
and when youre sick you seem to think you failed eternally
and that the people you let in are only crumbling
when youre sick of faking life in this recovery
when my decision paved the road that lies in front of me
so to the friends that even call but i dont call back
i want you deep inside my heart upon a hill
it seems to hide sometimes and run away and wonder
im really sick of saying sorry but i will

chorus
ever carried the weight of another
for how long
i walk as far as they need to recover
for how long

bridge
but are we scared to take the ride
or dare to look inside
im floating far away far away
im floating far away leaving home
im floating far away so far away
im floating far away
outro
i want to learn to walk with others as an equal
i want to treat the ones who love me with respect
i want to tell the world ill give them all a piggyback
and try to take away my negative effect
i want to kiss a girl and know ill never lie again
i want to call my dad and tell him that i care
i want to let my brother know he saved my life a thousand times
throughout the years hes been my friend whos always there

ever carried the weight of another
for how longembed"
