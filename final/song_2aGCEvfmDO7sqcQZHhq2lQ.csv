how high are the stakes
how much fortune can you make
how high are the stakes
how much fortune can you make

verse 1
its funny
i spent my whole life wanting to be talked about
i did it
just about everything to see my name in lights

prechorus
was it all worth it
and how did i earn it
nobodys perfect
i guess i deserve this

chorus
how high are the stakes how much fortune can you make
does this get any better
should i carry on will it matter when im gone
will any of this matter

verse 2
its funny
how everybody mentions my name but theyre never very nice
i took it
just about everything except my own advice
