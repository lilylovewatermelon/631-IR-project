im giving you a night call to tell you how i feel
well go all all all night long
i want to drive you through the night down the hills
well go all all all night long
im gonna tell you something you dont want to hear
well go all all all night long
im gonna show you where its dark but have no fear
well go all all all night long

chorus lovefoxxx
theres something inside you
its hard to explain
theyre talking about you boy
but youre still the same
theres something inside you
its hard to explain
theyre talking about you boy
but youre still the same
