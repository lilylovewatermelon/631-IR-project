why you such an asshole
why you gotta act up
why you gotta try so hard every day though
i dont fuck with you in that way though
why you such an asshole

verse 1 lil yachty
you woke up on the wrong side of the bed
blamin me for shit i didnt do thats incorrect
ima tippytoe right out your life you do me wrong
aint finna keep puttin up with all that disrespect
you took the top off of the rolls
on the wind fightin sun let your hair blow
thats with me before you had me you was nothin
so why you actin like its beef when its not though
bags i bought the trunk we stuffed you love it
understand no other man gon love you
spoiled brat you super spoiled
actin like you came from oil
you was broke before you met me
i was broke before i had this
need to stop with all the madness
actin like you got a damn chance

chorus oliver tree  lil yachty
why you such an asshole oh oh lil boat

asshole
but if you go broke dont you dare go call me
i tried so hard just to make you love me
smile in my face when i know youre phony
play it so cool but you got me anxious
skin like gold but your heart so dangerous
if i am not him why dont you just tell me
tried to pay for your love but you just wont sell me
lost in love
i shouldnt wanna chase you no more
i cant really take it no more
honestly your energy is poor
piss poor piss poor
its like you dont care anymore
how did i not notice this before

chorus oliver tree  lil yachty
why you such an asshole
why you gotta act up
why you gotta try so hard every day though every day
i dont fuck with you in that way though no
