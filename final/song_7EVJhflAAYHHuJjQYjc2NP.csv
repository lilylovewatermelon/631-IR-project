watch what you say on the stand
youre running in circles
i know more than you think
and your words are empty
of all the heavenly hosts
thisll all make sense when the records gold
whats a few more units for your soul

chorus
youre wasting my time
while theyre wasting away
youll never youll never save me
youve dropped every line
but they dont mean a thing
youll never youll never save me

bridge
oh

refrain
you live your life in the saddest way ive ever seen
you are the reason i dont believe

outro
im not denying the worth of things unseen
and this isnt a part of the next big thing
im just dying to show them all that you are
you are nothingsee a day to remember liveget tickets as low as 108you might also like4embed"
