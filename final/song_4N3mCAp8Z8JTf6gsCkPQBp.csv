lookin back through the memories in my mind
takes me back to a distant time
it was me and it was you
and love was still brand new
on a beach with all my friends
lead to a wild weekend

chorus
love was in the air stars were up in the sky
fireworks was lit burnin up the fourth of july
the breeze through our soul
champagne and rocky road
west coast dancin with you
in santa cruz

verse 2
sent a post card to a friend
wishin summer would never end
with that roller coaster high
aint it funny how time flies by

chorus
love was in the air stars were up in the sky
fireworks was lit burnin up the fourth of july
the breezе through our soul
champagne and rocky road
west coast dancin with you
in santa cruz
