hey now darling you thought it was all fun and games
running around telling everyone why were not together
i guess you just had to feel important
and im sure you thought i was just going to sit back and take it on the chin
but honey im a songwriter
and that darling is where you end and this song begins

chorus
i found someone new who treats me better
she dont bitch about things we havent got
when i sing this tune it dont upset her
shes half your age and twice as hot

verse 2
oh she wakes up every morning and she folds my clothes
doesnt care about the strippers dancing at my shows
she knows that i love her so i just wanted you to know

chorusx2

verse 3
oh she dont start trouble because she dont need drama
she likes it in the morning and she loves my momma
im her big poppa an shes my little rock and roll
