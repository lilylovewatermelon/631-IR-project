i heard life is what passes when youre too busy livin
and love is at its finest when times are hard
and may your lady always keep you from the vices youve been after
may the lord always love you where you are

chorus
im headin down the road i guess
another good time ill regret
but i wish that i was coming home to you
late july oh my all in good time
prayin that my girl is fine
sleepin in while rain falls on the roof

verse 2
i hope your sunsets always bleed red
and your familys always well fed
and the song stuck in your head plays all night

chorus
im headin down the road i guess
another good time ill regret
but i wish that i was coming home to you
late july oh my all in good time
prayin that my girl is fine
sleepin in while rain falls on the roof
