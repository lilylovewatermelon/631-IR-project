i hear the voices echoing around me
angered eyes that dont even know who i am
looking to kill again they will kill again
as the unknown enemies surround me
wicked laughter resonates inside my head
and i am filled with dread and adrenaline
what did i do why do i deserve this
so were different why do i deserve to die now
give me a reason why

prechorus 1
then it all goes a blur
let instinct take flight
find my hands on his throat
yet hear myself say

chorus 1
tell me now who taught you how to hate
cause it isnt in your blood
not a part of what youre made
so let this be understood
somebody taught you how to hate
when you live this way you become
dead to everyone
see disturbed liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likeverse 2
a fathers pride my son walking beside me
i look around and marvel how the children play
in perfect disarray so innocent
no judgement pure exhilaration
black to white the colors arent on their minds
nothing predefined all different
theres always one who plants an evil seed and
preaches fear to pull you to the other side
into a world of lies

prechorus 2
everything is unsure
when youve lost your sight lost your sight
can there still be a cure
what made you this way

chorus 1
tell me now who taught you how to hate
cause it isnt in your blood
not a part of what youre made
so let this be understood
somebody taught you how to hate
when you live this way you become
dead to everyone
youre not anyone
bridge
oh
lost all innocence
infected and arrogant
you burn all your life theres no telling you
no deliverance
consumed by the pestilence of hate youre denied
deep in your heart does it still remain
do you think you can bring it
back to life again
is it still in your soul no saving you
wheres the deviant
the unholy revenant
that has made you this way
made you fall for this hate

chorus 2
tell me now who taught you how to hate
because it isnt in your blood
not a part of what youre made
so let this be understood
somebody taught you how to hate
when you live this way you become
you become

outrochorus
tell me now who taught you how to hate
because it isnt in your blood
not a part of what youre made
so let this be understood
somebody taught you how to hate
when you live this way you become you become
you become dead to everyone
youre not anyone4embed"
