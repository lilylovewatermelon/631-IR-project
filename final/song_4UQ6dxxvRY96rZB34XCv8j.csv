ooh this a mac beat
ayy yeah

chorus
see its a lot of shit left me scarred
i need chains to protect my heart
its a lot of shit left me scarred
but pain makes us who we are
and they say true love never dies
but i felt that way when deja left
even though they say i cant blame myself
still aint forgave myself

verse
from the jects to a private jet reminiscing and wishing
i could take back the past and i could do it somethin different
way before the rapping the record labels and bitches
way before my homies was dead and goin to prison
but the good go young them other niggas they dont last yeah
chaz caught 20 at 18 and it was last year
one down 19 more to go
mama told me that karma real son slow your roll
go ask them niggas we never spoke
so many fake friends and smiling faces
i try to smile to hide the pain but i cant seem to shake it
its like that shit be on my brain on a daily basis
remember deja died i cried just like a baby that pain shit made me
see rod wave liveget tickets as low as 85you might also likechorus
its a lot of shit left me scarred
i need chains to protect my heart
its a lot of shit left me scarred
but pain makes us who we are
and they say true love never dies
but i felt that way when deja left
even though they say i cant blame myself
still aint forgave myself yeah6embed"
