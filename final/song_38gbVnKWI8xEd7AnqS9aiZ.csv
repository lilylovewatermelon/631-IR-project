im on this redeye rolling down a runway
window seat nonstop oneway
2 pm gate b10 it cant come soon enough
ive got a midflight magazine and a mixed drink
i wish time would fly right with me
damn the days that baggage claims in another taxi town
but they always bring me back to you

chorus
ive seen california and the fields of oklahoma
from thirty thousand feet cant beat the view
crossed the mississippi watched the mountains over tennessee
become a carolina sky that was so blue
and still aint seen nothing like nothing like you

verse 2
ive spent every mile missing you baby
its enough to drive me crazy
i love yous from hotel rooms
they sure do make it tough
but they always bring me back to you

chorus
ive seen california and the fields of oklahoma
from thirty thousand feet cant beat the view
crossed the mississippi watched the mountains over tennessee
become a carolina sky that was so blue
and still aint seen nothing like nothing like you
see luke combs liveget tickets as low as 33you might also likebridge
in all these nothing towns
you in this whole world around
youre the only place i wanna get back to

chorus
cause ive seen california and the fields of oklahoma
from thirty thousand feet cant beat the view
crossed the mississippi watched the mountains over tennessee
become a carolina sky that was so blue
and still aint seen nothing like
and still aint seen nothing like
and still aint seen nothing like
nothing like you
nothing like youembed"
