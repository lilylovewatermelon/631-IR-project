verse 1 kanye west
how much they hate it very
kiss girls like katy perry
i am never sprung but i spring er jerry
don’t try this at home results may vary
king like ti but in the chi larry

verse 2 jayz
hoover hova
both are american gangsters
you choose whos colder
rappers get nasty in the booth but im grosser
i can’t even stomach myself ulcer
more realer cause im closer
had girlies in girdles weighing more than they supposed to
poser no sir
my hustle so russell
i stretch work yoga

and these mcs praying for my downfall
