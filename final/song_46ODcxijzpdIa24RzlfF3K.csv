whats on your mind
cause ive been thinking bout last night
whats the time
feels like ive sat here all my life

prechorus
your ship rolls in im here waiting
i dont know why im paralysed
oh what id do to be with you
oh what id give

chorus
to hear you say that i love you
but say it the way i do
theres nowhere to run tonight
its just you and i in this hotel room
and say that i miss you
but say it the way i do
theres nowhere to hide tonight
my eyes cant lie the way i feel for you
just give me a moment its all i ask of you
while im dying in this hotel room
