ive always dreamt of travel
why should we die where we were born born
some roads are laid with gravel
sometimes you gotta build your own own

prechorus
i wanna tear down boundaries
i wanna greet my enemies
i wanna see what i havent seen
cause i know theres more

chorus
i take the world by storm storm storm storm
i take the world by storm storm storm storm

verse 2
i dont have any answers
the more i know the more i grow grow
i dont know where im going
but ima search cause i see hope hope

prechorus
i wanna tear down boundaries
i wanna greet my enemies
i wanna see what i havent seen
cause i know theres more

theres got to be more than this
gotta figure out how to jump the wall

i know i might return
at least i know ill be walking tall
im not afraid

cause i take the world by storm storm storm storm
i take the world by storm storm storm storm20embed"
