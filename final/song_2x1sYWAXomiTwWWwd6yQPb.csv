ben the two of us need look no more
we both found what we were looking for
with a friend to call my own
ill never be alone
and you my friend will see
youve got a friend in me
youve got a friend in me

verse 2
ben youre always running here and there
here and there
you feel youre not wanted anywhere
anywhere
if you ever look behind
and dont like what you find
theres something you should know
youve got a place to go
youve got a place to go
