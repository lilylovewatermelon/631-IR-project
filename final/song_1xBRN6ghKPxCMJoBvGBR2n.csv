gone separate me from this loss ive known
tolerate these stitches i have sewn
we bare scars of our lives
a love affair as sharp as a knife
i only cut myself to feel like im alive
to feel like im alive

chorus
better than the devil that you said it
but you never wanna give a nigga credit dead it
better to the devil youd forget it
what you didnt know you going to regret it dead it
better than the devil that you said it
but you never wanna give a nigga credit dead it
better to the devil youd forget it
what you didnt know you going to regret it dead it

verse 2
lost desperately were searching for a cause
warriors rebels without applause
bare scars of our lives
a love affair as sharp as a knife
i only cut myself to feel like im alive
to feel like im alive
