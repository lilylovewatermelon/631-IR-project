and every day when i pray i still thank god for you
even though my friends all tell me that youre long gone
im gonna keep hangin on to you
when my heart aint hurtin when ive got you off my mind
when i know that i can make it through one day without tryin
when i convince myself that i am really all alone
baby thats when ill believe that youre gone
here i am makin plans for forever
me and you what to do weve done everything together
my imaginations workin overtime
the pain has made me blind to the truth
but when my heart aint hurtin when ive got you off my mind
when i know that i can make it through one day without tryin
when i convince myself that i am really all alone
baby thats when ill believe that youre gone
on my own terms
in my own time
soon enough ill admit
youre no longer mine
when my heart aint hurtin when ive got you off my mind
when i know that i can make it through one day without cryin
when i convince myself that i am really all alone
baby thats when ill believe that youre gone
baby thats when ill believe that youre gone youre gonesee craig morgan liveget tickets as low as 54you might also likeembed"
