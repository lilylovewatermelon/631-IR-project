get some sleep at night

didnt get you a present this year
its because im broke
miss my mom and my dad
and our house and my little bro
i always got you in my mind
you would do the same for me
if you had it too
littler brothers been working so hard
im so proud of you
you dont gotta pay me back
its all good
i tried my best for you
i got some making up to do
to do

im trying to get my shit together
im trying to get my shit together

im trying
still trying
im trying to get my shit together
