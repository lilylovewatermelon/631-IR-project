let me know that ive done wrong
when ive known this all along
i go around a time or two
just to waste my time with you

prechorus
tell me all that youve thrown away
find out games you dont wanna play
you are the only one
that needs to know

chorus
ill keep you my dirty little secret dirty little secret
dont tell anyone or youll be just another regret
just another regret hope that you can keep it
my dirty little secret who has to know

verse 2
when we live such fragile lives
its the best way we survive
i go around a time or two
just to waste my time with you

prechorus
tell me all that youve thrown away
find out games you dont wanna play
you are the only one
that needs to know

these sleeping dogs wont lie wont lie
and all ive tried to hide
its eating me apart
