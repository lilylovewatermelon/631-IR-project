despite the lies that youre making
your love is mine for the taking
my love is just waiting
to turn your tears to roses

verse 1
despite the lies that youre making
your love is mine for the taking
my love is just waiting
to turn your tears to roses
i will be the one thats gonna hold you
i will be the one that you run to
my love is a burning consuming fire

chorus
no youll never be alone
when darkness comes
ill light the night with stars
hear my whispers in the dark
no youll never be alone
when darkness comes
you know im never far
hear my whispers in the dark
whispers in the dark

you feel so lonely and ragged
you lay here broken and naked
my love is just waiting
to clothe you in crimson roses
i will be the one thats gonna find you
i will be the one thats gonna guide you
my love is a burning consuming fire

chorus
no youll never be alone
when darkness comes
ill light the night with stars
hear my whispers in the dark
no youll never be alone
when darkness comes
you know im never far
hear the whispers in the dark

chorus
no youll never be alone
when darkness comes
ill light the night with stars

no youll never be alone
when darkness comes
you know im never far

whispers in the dark
whispers in the dark
