i dont run from guilt you see my conscience lets me know at least a thousand times or better every day
things ive done mistakes ive made raised feelings ill lay in some grave if ever i am finally laid to rest

verse 2
if theres time to pray before i die i pray dear lord you know that i was a righteous man that somehow lost his way
face me down when i shall pass so the world can kiss my ass and hell cant come and get me from behind

chorus
ive danced in the flames and ive been burned ive walked on the harder side of life ive takin all the wrong turns
ive been around ive been down and ive been wasted
i fight with myself sometimes i lose i got me an angel on my shoulder but ive got the devil too i get down i get around i get wasted

verse 3
twentyseven years along ive tried to make them right all wrong and ive nearly died a few times on my way
well ive seen the face of god first hand and ive danced with the devil man ive needed help and grab for both of their hands

chorus
ive danced in the flames and ive been burned ive walked on the harder side of life ive takin all the wrong turns
ive been around ive been down ive been wasted
i fight with myself sometimes i lose i got me an angel on my shoulder but ive got the devil too i get down i get around i get wasted

i fight with myself sometimes i lose i got me an angel on my shoulder but ive got the devil too i get down i get around i get wasted

i dont run from guilt you see my conscience lets me know at least a thousand times or better every daysee cody jinks liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likeembed"
