its the cruelest joke to play

its all ive got when youre in my head
and youre in my head so i need it

verse 2
youre the only thing ive got
but i cant seem to get enough
we collide for one embrace so

i keep on playin our favorite song
i turn it up while youre gone
its all ive got when youre in my head
and youre in my head so i need it
i keep on playin our favorite song
i turn it up while youre gone
its all ive got when youre in my head
and youre in my head so i need it
