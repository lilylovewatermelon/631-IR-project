verse 1
reject are you no one feel you nothing
you know ill bet you think you have a good
reason to be living in the limelight
of the fortunate ones
youre too weakened by the poison that they feed you
in the living lie they dont believe you
call to no one trust in nothing little impotent one

chorus
i dont wanna be i dont wanna be
i dont wanna be i dont wanna be innocent you know
i dont wanna be i dont wanna be
i dont wanna be i dont want to let them hypnotize me

verse 2
punkass are you listening can you hear me
or are you deaf and dumb to my language
do the real words seem to hurt you
well put em up motherfucker
youre gonna feel it when i stamp it on your forehead
so you will never forget that youre a reject
and youre no one and youre nothing
little impotent one

go with it now and let it overcome you
fear awaken
your mind is racing

bridge
i dont understand why you dont like me
why dont you like me am i so different from you
now does it scare you that im able to discern
what to love and what to burn
ill add your fuel to the fire now
stand back brother take your hand back
leave it and i might crack
more than a smile or two you see
you dont judge what you dont understand
you cant deny what has been given to me

i dont wanna be i dont want to let them hypnotize me
