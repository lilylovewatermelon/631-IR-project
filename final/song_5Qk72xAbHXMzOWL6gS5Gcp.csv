i dont smoke except for when im missing you
to remember your mouth how it tasted true
and i dont smoke except for after ive held you baby
being with you makes the flame burn good

chorus
so if you need to be mean be mean to me
i can take it and put it inside of me
if your hands need to break more than trinkets in your room
you can lean on my arm as you break my heart

verse 2
im whats left of when we swam under the moon
now the rest of my days are just waiting for when
youve calmed down and tell me i was meant for you
baby being with you makes the flame burn good

chorus
if you need to be mean be mean to me
i can take it and put it inside of me
if your hands need to break more than trinkets in your room
you can lean on my arm as you break my heart

bridge
just dont leave me alone wondering where you are
i am stronger than you give me credit for

if your hands need to break more than trinkets in your room
you can lean on my arm as you break my heart12embed"
