follow through
make your dreams come true
dont give up the fight
you will be alright
cause theres no one like you
in the universe

verse 2
and dont be afraid
of what your mind conceives
you should make a stand
stand up for what you believe
and tonight we can truly say
together were invincible

chorus
and during the struggle they will pull us down
but please please lets use this chance to turn things around
and tonight we can truly say
together were invincible

verse 3
do it on your own
it makes no difference to me
what you leave behind
what you choose to be
and whatever they say
your souls unbreakable

and during the struggle they will pull us down
but please please lets use this chance to turn things around
and tonight we can truly say
together were invincible
together were invincible
