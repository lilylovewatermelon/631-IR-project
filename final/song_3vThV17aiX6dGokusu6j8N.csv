im holding my breath holding so tight
nothing is wrong nothing is right
im in the dark looking for light
wont someone please save my life
inside im a mess but i dont let it show
im just hanging on but youd never know
i smile all day and cry through the night
wont someone please save my
life is fleeting

chorus
dull knives taking my life
a slow burn fire from the inside
dull knives twisting my spine
theyre taking their time time
til i lose my mind

verse 2
a smoldering flame deep in my heart
barely a sign its barely a spark
holding on through every night
wont someonе please save my lifе
im crying for help its such a cliché
invisible pain its filling each day
i open my mouth and feed you a lie
wont someone please save
my life is fleeting no repeating

dull knives taking my life
a slow burn fire from the inside
dull knives twisting my spine
theyre taking their time time
til i lose my mind

bridge
dull knives ripping from the inside
spare me the ride

guitar solo

outro
from the inside
dull knives twisting my spine
theyre taking their time time
til i lose my mind
