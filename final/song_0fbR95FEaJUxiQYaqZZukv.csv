early in the mornin when the sun does rise
layin in the bed with bloodshot eyes
late in the evenin when the sun sinks low
thats about time my rooster crows
i got women up and down this creek
and they keep me goin and my engine clean
run me ragged but i dont fret
cause there aint been one slow me down none yet

chorus
get me drinkin that moonshine
get me higher than the grocery bill
take my troubles to the highwall
throw em in the river and get your fill
weve been sniffin that cocaine
aint nothin better when the wind cuts cold
lord its a mighty hard livin
but a damn good feelin to run these roads

verse 2
i got people try to tell me red
keep this livin and youll wind up dead
cast your troubles on the lord of lords
or wind up layin on a coolin board
but i got buddies up white house road
and they keep me strutting when my feet hang low
rotgut whiskey gonna ease my pain
an all this runnins gonna keep me sane
see tyler childers liveget tickets as low as 39you might also likechorus
get me drinkin that moonshine
get me higher than the grocery bill
take my troubles to the highwall
throw em in the river and get your fill
weve been sniffin that cocaine
aint nothin better when the wind cuts cold
lord its a mighty hard livin
but a damn good feelin to run these roads
its a damn good feelin to run these roads

verse 3
when you lay me in the cold hard clay
wont you sing them hymns while the banjo plays
you can tell them ladies that they ought not frown
cause there aint been nothin ever held me down

prechorus
lawmen women or a shallow grave
same ol blues just a different day

chorus
get me drinkin that moonshine
get me higher than the grocery bill
take my troubles to the highwall
throw em in the river and get your fill
weve been sniffin that cocaine
aint nothin better when the wind cuts cold
lord its a mighty hard livin
but a damn good feelin to run these roads
its a damn good feelin to run these roads
its a damn good feelin to run these roads4embed"
