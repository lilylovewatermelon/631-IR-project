father i stretch
stretch my hands to you

verse
lifelike this is what your life like try to live your life right
people really know you push your buttons like typewrite
this is like a movie but its really very lifelike
every single night right every single fight right
i was looking at the gram and i dont even like likes
i was screamin at my dad he told me it aint christlike
i was screamin at the referee just like mike
lookin for a bright light sigel what your life like
riding on a white bike feeling like excitebike stretch my hands to you
pressin on the gas supernova for a night light
screamin at my dad and he told me it aint christlike
but nobody never tell you when youre being like christ
only ever seein me only when they needin me
like if tyler perry made a movie for bet
searchin for a deity now you wanna see it free
now you wanna see if we lets just see if three apiece
tell me what your life like turn it down a bright light
drivin with my dad and he told me it aint christlike stretch my hands to you
im just tryna find lve been lookin for a new way
im just really tryin not to really do the fool way
i dont have a cool way bein on my best though
block em on the text though nothin else next though
not another word letter picture or a decimal father i stretch
wrestlin with god i dont really want to wrestle
man its really lifelike everything in my life stretch my hands to you
arguing with my dad and he said it aint christlike
see kanye west liveget tickets as low as 118you might also likeoutro

somebody only close who can get you like off your
