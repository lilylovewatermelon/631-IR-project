im going under and this time i fear theres no one to save me
this all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
i need somebody to hear  somebody to know
somebody to have somebody to hold
its easy to say but its never the same
i guess i kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

chorus
now the day bleeds into nightfall
and youre not here to get me through it all
i let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
i was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

verse 2
im going under and this time i fear theres no one to turn to
this all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
now i need somebody to know somebody to hear
somebody to have just to know how it feels
its easy to say but its never the same
i guess i kinda like the way you help me escape

chorus
now the day bleeds into nightfall
and youre not here to get me through it all
i let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
i was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
you might also likebridge
and i tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
i fall into your arms
ill be safe in your sound till i come back around

chorus
for now the day bleeds into nightfall
and youre not here to get me through it all
i let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
i was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
but now the day bleeds into nightfall
and youre not here to get me through it all
i let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
i was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
i let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
i was getting kinda used to being someone you loved168embed"
