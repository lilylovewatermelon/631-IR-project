verse 1 drake
dont link me
dont hit me when you hear this and tell me your favorite song
dont tell me how you knew it would be like this all along
i know the truth is you wont love me until im gone
and even then the thing that comes after is movin on
i cant even capture the feeling i had at first
meetin all my heroes like seein how magic works
the people i look up to are goin from bad to worse
their actions out of character even when they rehearse
workin in the land of the free the home of the brave
i gotta bring my brothers or else i feel out of place
breakin speed records on roads that these niggas paved
and they dont like that its written all on they face
i dont know how ima make it out of here clean
cant even keep track of who plays for the other team
iconic duos rip and split at the seams
goodhearted people are takin it to extremes
leavin me in limbo to question what i believe
leavin me to ask whats their motive in makin peace
leavin me to not trust anybody i meet
leavin me to ask is there anybody like me

verse 2 drake
missin out on my years
theres times when i wish i was where i was
back when i used to wish i was here
missin out on my days
scrollin through life and fishin for praise
opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
i try and see whos there on the other end of the shade
most times its just somebody thats underaged
thats probably just alone and afraid
and lashin out so that someone else can feel they pain
i always hear people complain about the place that they live
that all the people here are fake and they got nothin to give
cause they been starin at somebody elses version of shit
that makes another city seem more excitin than it is
i know a girl whose one goal was to visit rome
then she finally got to rome
and all she did was post pictures for people at home
cause all that mattered was impressin everybody shes known
i know another girl thats cryin out for help
but her latest caption is leave me alone
i know a girl happily married til she puts down her phone
i know a girl that saves pictures from places shes flown
to post later and make it look like she still on the go
look at the way we live
i wasnt hidin my kid from the world
i was hidin the world from my kid
from empty souls who just wake up and look to debate
until you starin at your seed you can never relate
breakin news in my life i dont run to the blogs
the only ones i wanna tell are the ones i can call
they always ask why let the story run if its false
you know a wise man once said nothin at all
im exhausted and drained i cant even pretend
all these people takin miles when you give em an inch
all these followers but who gon follow me to the end
i guess ill make it to the end and ima find out then
