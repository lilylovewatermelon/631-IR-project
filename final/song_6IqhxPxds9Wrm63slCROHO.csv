pretty baby you are the soul snaps my control
such a funny thing but everytime your near me
i never can behave
you give me a smile and im wrapped up in your magic
theres music all around me
crazy music music that keeps calling me so
baby close to you turns me into your slave
come on and do with me any little thing that you want to
anything baby just let me get next to you

so am i insane or do i really see heaven in your eyes
bright as stars that shine up above you
in the clear blue sky how i worry bout you
just cant live my life without you
baby come here dont have no fear
oh is there wonder why
im really feeling in the mood for love

so tell me why stop to think about this weather my dear
this little dream might fade away
there i go talking out of my head again baby wont you
come and put our two hearts together
that would make me strong and brave
oh when we are one im not afraid im not afraid
if theres a cloud up above us
go on and let in rain
im sure our love together would endure a hurricane
oh my baby wont you please let me love you
and get a release from this awful misery
you might also likewhat is all this talk about loving me my sweet
i am not afraid not anymore not like before
dont you understand me now baby please
pull yourself together do it very soon
my hearts on fire come on and take
ill be what you make me my darling

oh baby you make me feel so good
let me take you by the hand
come let us visit out there
in that new promised land

maybe there we can find
a good place to keep a lovin state of mind
im so tired of being without it
and never knew what love was all about
james moody would you come on hit me
you can blow now if you want to im throughembed"
