subjected to my system
reflecting on the days
when we used to be just friends
protected both our interest
our trust was in a bank
thats where our hearts were safe

prechorus
and then we got closer
separated from my ex
so we got closer
oh in every visit
feelings got stronger
now this is out our hands
our love is here to stay

chorus
so get used to me checking in
all day
get used to me falling through
just to see your face
there aint a moment
i wont need your brace
get used to me touching you
get used to me loving you
oh get used to it eh
oh get used to it eh
oh get used to it oh and oh
get used to me holding you
get used to me woeing you
oh get used to it

oh seven days shy of new years eve
