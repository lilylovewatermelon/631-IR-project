oohyeah

verse 1
started with phone conversation and i
flew out to see you its rainin outside
we sat by the water and talked about life oh
said you lost your dad girl i know how that feels
i lost my mom tryna deal with that still
i guess we connect on our hatred for pills
its real

im not the phone type id rather be with you
