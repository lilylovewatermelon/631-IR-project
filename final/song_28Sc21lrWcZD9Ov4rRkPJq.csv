tuxedo waiters black tie
white table cloths and red wine
weve been plannin this night
lookin forward to it for some time

prechorus
now honey i know you love gettin dressed up
and you know i love showin you off
but watchin your baby blue eyes dancin in the candlelight glow
all i can think about is gettin you home

chorus
walkin through the front door
seein your black dress hit the floor
uh honey there sure aint nothin like you lovin me all night long
and all i can think about is gettin you home

verse 2
i dont need this menu no i dont
i already know just what i want
did i hear you right did you tell me
go pay the waiter and lets leave

prechorus
now honey i know by that look in your eyes
and your hand drawin hearts on mine
that our night out of the house aint gonna last too long
when all you can think about is gettin me home
