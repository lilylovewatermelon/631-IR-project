youre a fraud and you know it
but its too good to throw it all away
anyone would do the same
youve got em going
and youre careful not to show it
sometimes you even fool yourself a bit
its like magic
but its always been a smoke and mirrors game
anyone would do the same

verse 2
so now that youve arrived well you wonder
what is it that youve done to make the grade
and should you do the same
is that too easy
are you only trying to please them
will they see then
youre desperate to deliver
anything that could give you
a sense of reassurance
when you look in the mirror

chorus
such highs and lows
you put on quite a show
all these highs and lows
and youre never really sure what you do it for
and do you even want to know
you put on quite a show
you might also likebridge
mother are you watching
are you watching
mother are you watching
mother mother

verse 3
youre a fraud and you know it
and every night and day you take the stage
and it always entertains
youre giving pleasure
and thats admirable you tell yourself
and so youd gladly sell yourself to others

bridge
mother are you watching
mother are you watching
mother are you watching
mother are you watching
are you watching

chorus
such highs and lows
you put on quite a show
all these highs and lows
and youre never really sure what you do it for
well do you even want to know
yeah you put on quite a show
