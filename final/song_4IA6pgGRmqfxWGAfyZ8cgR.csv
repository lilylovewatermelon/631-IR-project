verse 1
i wear womens underwear
and then i go to strike a pose in my fulllength mirror
i cross my legs just like a queer
but my libido is strong when a lady is near yeah
what defines a straight mans straight
is it the boxer in the brief or a twelveounce steak
nah ill tell you what a woman loves most
its a man you can slap but can also stroke

chorus
going in the wind is an eddy of the truth and its naked
its verbatim and its shakin
no no no no no no no no no
no more getting elated
no more listless invitations

postchorus
ugh

verse 2
i live by a hospital
and every day i go out walking past its sickly windows
i see people dying there
but my tender age makes it hard to care
the incinerator and a big smokestack
its a phallic symbol and it makes me laugh ha
all i need is a heart attack cmon
humble my bones with a cardiac humble my bones with a cardiac
see mother mother liveget tickets as low as 27you might also likechorus
going in the wind is an eddy of the truth and its naked
its verbatim and its shakin
no no no no no no no no no
no more getting elated
no more listless invitations
