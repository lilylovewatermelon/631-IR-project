im a stitch away from making it
and a scar away from falling apart apart
blood cells pixelate and eyes dilate
and the full moon pills got me out on the street at night

chorus
cut it loose watch you work the room
cut it loose watch you work the room
cut it loose watch you work the room
cut it loose watch you work the room

verse 2
oh put love on hold young hollywood
is on the other line
her nose runs ruby red deaths in a double bed
singing songs that could only catch the ear of the desperate

chorus
cut it loose watch you work the room
cut it loose watch you work the room
cut it loose watch you work the room
cut it loose

bridge
im a stitch away from making it
and a scar away from falling apart apart
blood cells pixelate and eyes dilate
kiss away young thrills and kills on the mouths of all my friends
see fall out boy liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likechorus
cut it loose watch you work the room
loose watch you work the room
cut it loose watch you work the room
