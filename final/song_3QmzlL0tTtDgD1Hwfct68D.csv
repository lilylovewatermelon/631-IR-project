you can get lost in the music for hours honey
you can get lost in a room
we can play music for hours and hours
but the sun will still be coming up soon

chorus
the worlds just spinning
a little too fast
if things dont slow down soon we might not last
so just for the moment lets be still

verse
you can get lost in the music for hours honey
you can get lost in a room
we can play music for hours and hours
but the sun will still be coming up soon

chorus
the worlds not forgiving
of everyones fears
the days turn into months the months turn into years
so just for the moment lets be still

bridge
theyre tearing down
so we can rebuild
and all this time
is just circles in my mind
so just for a moment
just one moment
just for a moment lets be still
just for a moment lets be still
just for a moment lets be still
just for a moment lets be still
