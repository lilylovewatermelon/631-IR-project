driving through ghosttown
metal horses a thousand feet high
orange sky
pulling your top down
in the back of some prettyboys ride
you get high

prechorus 1 kevin parker
avenues
empty as 44 clips
cargo ships teen zombies ghostriding their whips
see how they play

chorus kevin parker
youre always summer breaking
running wild in the street after dark
youre always summer breaking
hanging out with the boys in the park
summer is gone
youre gonna need someone
to break your fall

verse 2 kevin parker
give him a haircut
in the old kitchen chair in your yard
saint delilah
he thinks you care
does he know youre too bright and too hard
like a diamond
you might also likeprechorus 2 kevin parker
play your game
play him the way you played me
be the girl you pretend to pretend not to be
see how they play

chorus kevin parker
youre always summer breaking
running wild in the street after dark
youre always summer breaking
hanging out with the boys in the park
summer is gone youre gonna need someone
summer is gone youre gonna need someone
summer is gone
youre gonna need someone
to break your fall6embed"
