and ill wait here a while
just long enough to be sure
that you didnt make a wrong turn

and ill wait long enough
maybe an hour or two
before i decide it wasnt me it was you
it wasnt me it was you

and i would like you to know
although it seems sad to say
this was only the worst hour of my day
the worst hour of my day

bridge
how long has it been on your mind
do you think about it when we laugh
i think that its a big mistake
because i think that we could make it last

verse 2
even if its just for a while
ill wait here for now
just long enough to be
sure that you
really want to go through with this
because i dont really want to go through with this
do you really want to go through with thissee jack johnson liveget tickets as low as 95you might also likeembed"
