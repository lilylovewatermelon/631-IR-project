your heart is hard to carry after dark
youre to blame for what we could have been
cause look at what we are
your friends are scared to tell you you went too far
funny that its always been all about you from the start
i met someone new last night and we kicked it
and im going back there tonight
and you know whats on my mind this time
going back there tonight
and you know whats on my mind so
chorus jennifer lopez
if you had my love
and i gave you all my trust
would you comfort me
and if somehow you knew
that your love would be untrue
would you lie to me
if you had my love
and i gave you all my trust
would you comfort me
and if somehow you knew
that your love would be untrue
would you lie to me

out of body
thats just how i feel when im around you shawty
last night we didnt say it
but girl we both thought it
why second guess i should have stayed
you say the word im on the way
this shit feels like teenage fever
im not scared of it she aint either
why second guess i should have stayed
cause you know whats on my mind so
chorus jennifer lopez
if you had my love
and i gave you all my trust
would you comfort me
and if somehow you knew
that your love would be untrue
would you lie to me
if you had my love
and i gave you all my trust
would you comfort me
and if somehow you knew
that your love would be untrue
would you lie to me
