the sun going down on a little beach town out west
a wide open highway a window seat on a jet
the sound of a train pulling out of the station
a man like me should find inspiration in anything
but here i am in this hotel room

chorus
still writing songs about
you on the sunny santa monica freeway
you on a bed and a mini bar three day haze
with your hair and my heart all a mess in the morning
ive gotten drunk on whiskey and women
woke up in places that weve never been in
spending all night and all day trying to say something new
but its no use
im still writing songs about you

verse 2
a pawn shop in dallas cut me a deal on a six string
it doesnt know how you look how you laugh how you kiss me
well im on the edge of the bed and its way past two
im stuck on a line cause i know what rhymes with blue

chorus
you on the sunny santa monica freeway
you on a bed and a mini bar three day haze
with your hair and my heart all a mess in the morning
ive gotten drunk on whiskey and women
woke up in places that weve never been in
spending all night and all day trying to say something new
but im still writing songs about you

chorus
you on the sunny santa monica freeway
you on a bed and a mini bar three day haze
with your hair and my heart all a mess in the morning

but its no use
