i remember walkin round the court square sidewalks
lookin in windows at things i couldnt want
theres johnsons hardware and morgans jewelry
and the old lee kings apothecary
they were the little man the little man

verse 2
i go back now and the stores are empty
except an old coke sign dated 1950
boarded up like they never existed
or renovated and called historic districts
there goes the little man there goes the little man

chorus
now the court squares just a set of streets
that people go round but they seldom think
bout the little man that built this town
before the big money shut em down and killed the little man
oh the little man

verse 3
he pumped your gas and he cleaned your glass
one cold rainy night he fixed your flat
then a new store came where you do it yourself
you buy a lotto ticket and food off the shelf
forget the little man forget about that little man
see alan jackson liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likeverse 4
he hung on there for a few more years
but he couldnt sell slurpees and he wouldnt sell beer
now the bank rents the station to a man down the road
and they sell velvet elvis and secondhand clothes
there goes little man there goes another little man

chorus
now the court squares just a set of streets
that people go round but they seldom think
bout the little man that built this town
before the big money shut em down and killed the little man
oh the little man

verse 5
now the stores are lined up in a concrete strip
you can buy the whole world in just one trip
and save a penny because its jumbo size
they dont even realize
theyre killing the little man oh the little man

chorus
now the court squares just a set of streets
that the people go round but they seldom think
bout the little man that built this town
before the big money shut em down and killed the little man
oh the little man
verse 6
it wasnt long ago when i was a child
an old black man came with his mule and his plow
he broke the ground where we grew our garden
back before wed all forgotten
about the little man the little man

outro
long live the little man
god bless the little manembed"
