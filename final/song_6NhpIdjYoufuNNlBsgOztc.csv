she was in the backyard
they say it was a little past nine
when her prince pulled up
a white pickup truck
her folks shoulda seen it coming
it was only just a matter of time
plenty old enough
and you cant stop love
she stuck a note on the screen door
sorry but i got to go
that was all she wrote
her mamas heart was broke
that was all she wrote
or so the story goes

chorus 1
now her daddys in the kitchen
staring out the window
scratching and aracking his brains
how could 18 years just up and walk away
our little ponytailed girl
grown up to be a woman
now shes gone in the blink of an eye
she left the suds in the bucket
and the clothes hanging out on the line
see sara evans liveget tickets as low as 99you might also likeverse 2
now dont you wonder
what the preachers gonna preach about sunday morning
nothing quite like this has happened here before
well he must have been a looker
a smooth talking son of a gun
for such a grounded girl to just up and run
course you cant fence time
and you cant stop love

chorus 2
now all the biddies in the beauty shop gossip
going nonstop
sipping on pink lemonade
how could 18 years just up and walk away
our little ponytailed girl
grown up to be a woman
now shes gone in the blink of an eye
she left the suds in the bucket
and the clothes hangin out on the line
yeehoo

instrumental break

chorus 3
shes got her pretty little bare feet
hanging out the window
and theyre heading up to vegas tonight
how could eighteen years just up and walk away
our little ponytailed girl
grown up to be a woman
now shes gone in the blink of an eye
she left the suds in the bucket
and the clothes hanging out on the line
she left the suds in the bucket
and the clothes hanging out on the line
outro
she was in the backyard
they say it was a little past nine
when her prince pulled up
a white pickup truck
plenty old enough
and you cant stop love
no you cant fence time
and you cant stop loveembed"
