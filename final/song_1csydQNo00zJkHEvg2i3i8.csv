helpless she lies across the stairs
haunting your days consuming your prayers
there will be healing but dont force this girl to stand
as shes counting the ceilings with pale voice and trembling hands

chorus
you told me life was long but now that its gone
you find yourself on top as the leader of a flock
called to be around for those below

verse 2
whispered notes from the piano in the corner of the room
hold your throat is that healing that youre hearing in my tune
wanting change but loving her just as she lies
is the burden of a man whos built his life on love

chorus
you told me life was long but now that its gone
you find yourself on top as the leader of a flock
called to be around for those below

bridge
ill be locked up and stored
in a lavender ward
cause my mind is just like hers
just as broken just as crippled just as burned
you might also likeoutro
and then i find myself on top as the leader of the flock
called to be around for those below2embed"
