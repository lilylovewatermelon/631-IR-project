its empty in the valley of your heart
the sun it rises slowly as you walk
away from all the fears
and all the faults youve left behind
the harvest left no food for you to eat
you cannibal you meateater you see
but i have seen the same
i know the shame in your defeat

chorus
but i will hold on hope
and i wont let you choke
on the noose around your neck
and ill find strength in pain
and i will change my ways
ill know my name as its called again

verse 2
cause i have other things to fill my time
you take what is yours and ill take mine
now let me at the truth
which will refresh my broken mind
so tie me to a post and block my ears
i can see widows and orphans through my tears
i know my call despite my faults
and despite my growing fears
you might also likechorus
but i will hold on hope
and i wont let you choke
on the noose around your neck
and ill find strength in pain
and i will change my ways
ill know my name as its called again

verse 3
so come out of your cave walking on your hands
and see the world hanging upside down
you can understand dependence
when you know the makers land

bridge
so make your sirens call
and sing all you want
i will not hear what you have to say
cause i need freedom now
and i need to know how
to live my life as its meant to be

chorus
and i will hold on hope
and i wont let you choke
on the noose around your neck
and ill find strength in pain
and i will change my ways
ill know my name as its called again30embed"
