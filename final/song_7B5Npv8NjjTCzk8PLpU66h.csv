take your eyes off of me so i can leave
im far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
this is neverendin we have been here before
but i cant stay this time cause i dont love you anymore

prechorus
please stay where you are
dont come any closer
dont try to change my mind
im being cruel to be kind

chorus
i cant love you in the dark
it feels like were oceans apart
there is so much space between us
baby were already defeated
ahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah
everything changed me

verse 2
you have given me something that i cant live without
you mustnt underestimate that when you are in doubt
but i dont want to carry on like everything is fine
the longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight
see adele liveget tickets as low as 165you might also likeprechorus
please dont fall apart
i cant face your breaking heart
im trying to be brave
stop asking me to stay

chorus
i cant love you in the dark
it feels like were oceans apart
there is so much space between us
baby were already defeated
ahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah
everything changed me

bridge
were not the only ones i dont regret a thing
every word ive said you know ill always mean
it is the world to me that you are in my life
but i want to live and not just survive

chorus
thats why i cant love you in the dark
it feels like were oceans apart
there is so much space between us
baby were already defeated
cause ahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah
everything changed me
