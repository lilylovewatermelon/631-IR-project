introduction
on january 6 2011 aaron swartz was arrested by the mit police and an agent of the us secret service accused of breaking and entering for events that occurred on the mit campus in july 2011 he was charged in a federal indictment with multiple felony offenses specifically violations of the wire fraud act and the computer fraud and abuse act on january 11 2013 aaron swartz’s partner found him dead in their new york apartment a victim of suicide
at the time of his death aaron swartz was a 26yearold computer programmer and an internet celebrity—a former child prodigy who as a young teenager had worked alongside the leaders of the world wide web to create some of its basic technology for sharing information an entrepreneur whose startup company became a key piece in a major news and entertainment service an activist who cofounded an advocacy organization with more than a million members that organized petition drives for civil liberties and against censorship and a fellow at harvard university’s safra research lab on institutional corruption
only swartz knows why he committed suicide however for the final 24 months of his life he was the subject of a vigorous investigation and prosecution by the us department of justice with an indictment and then a superseding indictment that could have resulted in years in prison the charges stemmed from his actions starting in fall 2010 when he surreptitiously downloaded massive quantities of scholarly journal articles from the jstor digital library through mit’s computer network
two days after the suicide mit president rafael reif asked computer science professor hal abelson to lead the present review of mit’s involvement in the events beginning with those in september 2010 when mit first became aware of unusual download activity on its network and continuing until swartz’s death in january 2013 the purpose of this review is to describe mit’s actions and consider what can be learned from them in conducting the review abelson has been joined by mit economics professor and institute professor emeritus peter diamond and andrew grosso a washington dc attorney and former assistant us attorney with special expertise in computer law when this report refers below to “we” “the reviewers” or the “review panel” it is referring to the three of us mit assistant provost for administration douglas pfeiffer provided staff assistance the process we used to gather information for this report is detailed in appendix 41
1 the review panel realizes that there has been significant controversy surrounding the events described in this report we appreciate that many of the people involved have legitimate concerns about their privacy
11
￼
other than the announcement of the review on january 13 mit has issued no statements before this report in the interest of providing an account that is full accurate and fair since that time we have received no further instruction from the mit administration other than several public indicators that we should take as much time as we needed
news of aaron swartz’s death ignited a firestorm on the internet in the six months since our review began there have been memorial services honoring aaron swartz in several cities including one on capitol hill the american library association posthumously awarded him its 2013 james madison award and the internet society posthumously inducted him into the internet hall of fame a bill was introduced in congress “aaron’s law” to revise the computer fraud and abuse act under which he was indicted there has been a congressional investigation and a petition to the white house demanding the firing of the prosecutors involved there have also been several anonymous cyber attacks—three of them against mit—in protest of swartz’s prosecution hate mail directed towards mit employees and federal prosecutors involved in his case and a hoax report of a shooter on campus that shut down mit for a morning
there have also been thousands of news articles and commentaries many of them roundly critical of mit reactions range from puzzlement to headshaking disappointment to anger to dark hints of conspiracies we hope this report by laying out a full history of mit’s involvement will put people in a better position to judge for themselves the plausibility of the various comments and positions taken and to evaluate mit’s conduct
both the writing and the reading inevitably involve hindsight how does one maintain a perspective uncolored by the shock and tragedy of aaron swartz’s suicide or—knowing of him and his accomplishments—by the realization that he was the person who did the downloading and who was then arrested just as we have tried to limit the effects of hindsight in the writing we hope readers will do the same when interpreting our report
and their security and we know that some have even been personally threatened consequently our report generally does not identify individuals by name many of these individuals have already been identified in court filings and other public documents and we are fully aware that their names are readily discoverable on the internet even so we see no need to further erode their personal privacy so as a rule people in this report are identified by their role or position rather than by name there are a few exceptions in cases where including their names makes the narrative more understandable we’ve named public officials—such as prosecutors detectives federal agents judges or police officers whose role in the events has already been described in public court filings for some people actively involved in the events described such as defense counsels for aaron swartz we have used their names with their permission to do so we have also named some people whose connections are only tangential to the events described in the report without having sought permission
introduction  12
￼
in brief among our more significant findings are the following
1 until the arrest in january 2011 mit was unaware that the person who engaged in the downloading of jstor’s data beginning in september 2010 was aaron swartz until the arrest mit’s concern was to stop the use of its network by an unknown person to download massive numbers of articles from the jstor database which was in violation of mit’s licensing agreement with jstor and whose scale threatened the operation of the jstor network to the extent that jstor blocked mit’s access to jstor for three days when on the morning of january 4 2011 mit’s network personnel located a laptop—covered by a cardboard box and plugged into a router in a basement data closet in a campus building—they were not sure with whom or with what kind of situation they were dealing and they contacted the mit police for the same reasons the mit police sought forensic assistance from a detective in the cambridge police department who had expertise in computer crime and with whom they had worked repeatedly in the past the cambridge detective who was a member of the new england electronic crimes task force responded to the call accompanied by an agent of the us secret service while the inclusion of the secret service agent was not the intention of mit it was a recognized possibility it was not until a few days later when aaron swartz was arrested that mit learned the identity of the person involved in the jstor downloading thus we find that mit did not focus on aaron swartz at any time during its own investigation of the events that led to his arrest and that mit did not intentionally “call in the feds” to take over the investigation
2 mit never requested that a criminal prosecution be brought against aaron swartz early in the prosecution by the us attorney’s office in boston the “usao” mit adopted a position of remaining neutral with limited involvement mit hired outside counsel who had experience in criminal law and in the functioning of the boston us attorney’s office and mit requested and received subpoenas for the production of documents some documents were turned over to the usao prior to receiving a subpoena but for the reasons discussed in this report this production did not violate federal laws
3 in keeping with its stance of neutrality mit never issued a public statement about swartz’s prosecution or advocated publicly on his behalf even though doing this was urged by aaron swartz’s family and legal team and by two members of the faculty one of the reasons for mit’s silence was the good faith belief based on private conversations with the lead prosecutor that the institute’s opinion would have no effect on the prosecution and that public
introduction  13
statements might make circumstances worse for aaron swartz mit did inform the prosecution that it was not seeking punishment for swartz and it did inform the defense that it was not seeking any civil remedy from him
4 before aaron swartz’s suicide the mit community paid scant attention to the matter other than during the period immediately following his arrest few students faculty or alumni expressed concerns to the administration in preserving mit’s stance of neutrality and limited involvement mit decision makers did not inquire into the details of the charges until a year after the indictment and did not form an opinion about their merits mit took the position that us v swartz was simply a lawsuit to which it was not a party although it did inform the us attorney’s office that the prosecution should not be under the impression that mit wanted jail time for aaron swartz mit did not say it was actually opposed to jail time among the factors not considered were that the defendant was an accomplished and wellknown contributor to internet technology that the computer fraud and abuse act is a poorly drafted and questionable criminal law as applied to modern computing one that affects the internet community as a whole and is widely criticized and that the united states government was pursuing an overtly aggressive prosecution mit’s position may have been prudent but it did not duly take into account the wider background of information policy against which the prosecution played out and in which mit people have traditionally been passionate leaders
part i of this review recounts the actions mit took from the first discovery of the downloading up to the time of aaron swartz’s arrest part ii reviews actions after the arrest by those involved other than mit in order to set the context for part iii which describes mit’s own decisions and conduct between the arrest and the death of aaron swartz part iv highlights some of the options that mit faced throughout this history part v provides some questions for the mit community that the review panel believes should be starting points for discussion within mit
it was not part of our charge in this review to draw conclusions but rather to determine facts and to consider what can be learned from this tragedy part v accordingly poses questions not answers these questions are for everyone at mit not just the institute’s leadership they concern the kind of community that mit is and the kind of community it could become the questions reflect not only the particular events of the aaron swartz
introduction  14
case but also the overall institute circumstances and climate in which the events occurred the most difficult questions challenge us to become better at negotiating the tension between prudence and passion as great institutions must

ia downloading of jstor articles
the history of the events leading to the arrest of aaron swartz in january 2011 begins the
previous fall with the jstor journal storage digital library a service that licenses scholarly journals to numerous academic and research organizations including mit1
on the evening of saturday september 25 2010 jstor engineers noticed an extremely large number of requests for downloads originating from mit overall more than 450000 articles spanning 560 journals were downloaded between 500 pm saturday and 400 am sunday2 the volume of data transferred was enough to overload the affected jstor server in response jstor engineers temporarily blocked further downloads directed to the mit internet protocol ip address issuing the requests3 but the downloading continued from a different ip address
1 see appendix 6 for more information on jstor and the mit libraries

2 ordinarily when someone requests a download from jstor the system pops up a window that refers to jstor’s terms of use and requires the user to click to confirm before the download can proceed this not only notifies the user of jstor’s terms but also limits the rate at which automated downloads can be requested in this case however the download script included a flag accepttctrue that bypassed the acceptance step
3 in an effort to warn the person causing these downloads to stop jstor’s engineers caused a web page to be presented to the computer engaged in the downloading reading
access suspended—we noticed content downloading activity from your ip address 18556215 that appears to be in excess of what is allowed under our terms  conditions of use please review our terms for more information about allowable uses if you have additional questions or need other information please contact jstor support
￼
the next day sunday september 26 2010 jstor shut off access for the entire range of addresses class c network containing the two addresses4 it sent an email to the mit libraries5 “the libraries” notifying them of this fact and explaining that jstor “rarely takes this level of response to abusive activity but felt it necessary to maintain the stability of the web site for other institutions and users” jstor further noted in that email that the manner in which the download requests came into its system “clearly indicates robotic harvesting of pdfs articles which violates our terms  conditions of use” reflecting its contractual agreement with jstor the libraries began to work with jstor in an effort to determine the source of the downloading and stop it from continuing
jstor sought mit’s assistance to prevent the incident’s recurrence the libraries responded “we’re investigating this case and because the origin of the activity was a guest visiting mit we believe that it will not recur we hope that you will be able to restore the class c range that has been suspended on this information” in response jstor turned all of mit’s ip addresses back on and decided to watch
to provide some context for this event we note that the libraries handled 65 excessive use incidents during the 2010–2011 academic year typically when an excessive use case is reported that is determined to originate from within mit’s network the libraries report this to either the mit information services and technology ist network security team6 or mit’s “stopit” group which deals with inappropriate behavior that occurs electronically the stopit group’s general response is to send the offender a warning email message this is almost always all that is needed to get people’s attention and have them stop whatever it was they were doing that caused the problem in this case however the computer was registered to a visitor and the registrant used an anonymous
4 the first ip address was 18556215 and the second address was 18556216 the blocked range consisted of all ip addresses beginning with 18556 followed by a number from 0 through 255 such a range four numbers with the first three fixed and the last one taking on any value from 0 to 255 is called a class c network
ip internet protocol addresses specify the network port where the device is attached they are typically automatically assigned when the device is attached by a network service called a dhcp dynamic host configuration protocol server although people with sufficient computer skills can change the ip address as was done here in addition to the ip address each device has a mac media access control address which uniquely identifies the device’s hardware network interface itself essentially the device itself as opposed to where it is attached to the network mac addresses are typically assigned by the device manufacturer although these too can be changed under program control the network dhcp server maintains a log called a dhcp log which records the ip address assigned to a mac address as part of the dhcp process at mit an ip address will often identify the building where network device is located
5 email sent sunday september 26 2010 at 1231 pm
6 most cases of excessive downloading are due to misappropriation of mit credentials in which case the true mit user is asked to change hisher password
part i events leading to the arrest  17
￼
email address that could not be contacted7 as described in section ie1 guests may register to use the mit network by supplying a name and an email address as contact information and they obtain a registration that is valid for a limited time period ist therefore disabled the registration of the mac address used by the offending computer expecting that this would be a sufficient deterrent to further activity
two weeks later on saturday october 9 2010 during the columbus day weekend a second similar incident occurred a visitor downloaded more jstor articles using a slightly modified mac address8
this time the requests and downloads stimulated a cascade of failures that brought down multiple jstor servers half the servers in one data center failed and jstor engineers feared that the entire service might go down worldwide moreover the requests seemed to be coming from thousands of machines9
jstor’s response was to shut down service at approximately 1115 pm on october 9 2010 to all mit’s ip addresses that is the entire class a network10 doing so quickly enough that only about 8000 articles were downloaded during this incident jstor observed that the downloaded articles were not limited to a specific discipline but were sequential across jstor’s entire database to jstor this indicated “a concerted effort is being made to download the entirety of the jstor archive” jstor notified mit libraries of its findings by email and spoke directly with personnel at the libraries about its concerns
7 the addresses supplied with the registrations were generated by mailinator  a service that creates onthefly temporary email addresses
8 see footnote 4 for an explanation of mac addresses the initial mac address was 00235a735ffb registered on september 24 2010 to a “person” named “gary host” the second slightly modified mac address was 00235a735ffc registered on october 2 to “gary host” these were the same machine as evidenced by the similarity of mac addresses and the fact that they presented the same dchp client id “ghostlaptop” to the dhcp server the mac address provided is consistent with this being an acer laptop see appendix 7 for information on dhcp in addition there was a second machine registered on october 8 2010 to “grace host” with the mac address 0017f22cb074 this machine had the client id “ghostmacbook” and the mac address is consistent with this being an apple macbook there was also a third registration on october 22 2010 with user name “grace host” and client id “ghostlaptop” with mac address 004ce5a0c755 and again a registration on november 28 2010 with mac address 004ce5a0c756 these registrations are for the acer laptop that was discovered in the closet see section ib below the mac addresses used here are invalid they do not correspond to any manufacturer id this is apparently the same “ghostlaptop” machine as was registered on september 24 one can conjecture that the owner having seen the first mac address blocked and the second slightly modified address also blocked set the machine to a radically different mac address
9 in actuality there was only one machine it deleted its jstor cookie after each download disconnected and then reaccessed jstor resulting in a new cookie being placed on the machine each time this occurred and making it appear that this was a new machine for each access
10 that is the range of ip addresses starting with 18 and followed by three numbers ie 18xxx
part i events leading to the arrest  18
￼
both mit and jstor were anxious for service to mit to be restored jstor believed that it could monitor the system and stop further incidents because it had been able to notice and stop the latest one after only 8000 articles had been downloaded based on this jstor agreed to restore service to mit and did so on tuesday october 12 2010 after three days of the entire campus being blocked at the same time ist blocked access from the individual mac address most recently associated with the downloading meanwhile ist staff were able to determine that the downloading activity had originated from the dorrance building building 16 an academic building in the central campus11
also on october 12 the director of the mit libraries reported to mit’s academic council12 that a cyberattack of the jstor database had caused a weekend shutdown of jstor to the entire campus
following the suspension of service to the entire mit campus during october 9 through 12 jstor decided to monitor closely for additional downloading activity and be prepared to suspend access as necessary
on the evening of december 26 2010 jstor again noticed excessive downloading from mit originating from a new ip address significantly this most recent downloading had been going on for some time beginning in late november but jstor did not realize this fact until much later the manner of accessing downloads had been slowed and altered in such a way that jstor’s monitoring systems did not identify that the robotic harvesting had resumed13 this time jstor noted that the downloading activity originated from the same class c network that ist had identified earlier as being in building 1614 jstor promptly notified the mit libraries about the new incident by email on the same evening identifying building 16 as the apparent location of the ip address in this email jstor also made the following request to mit “we are
11 the september 25 2010 downloading was also from a wired connection in building 16 ist did not pinpoint the exact location in either september or october 2010
12 mit’s academic council consists of the institute’s senior leadership plus the elected chair of the faculty it is chaired by the president and meets weekly during the academic year to confer on matters of institute policy
13there were over 43 million downloads during the period from late november through swartz’s eventual arrest on january 6

14 beginning december 26 2010 jstor took several actions to stop or at least impede the downloading first it blocked an entire class c range of addresses for building 16 jstor also kept open the one ip address that it observed the machine using 18556240 and moved access for this address to a server separate from the rest of its network through this server jstor responded to the machine’s requests by downloading strings of zeros and meaningless articles in the expectation that 1 the machine would not notice and would continue to download worthless material and 2 this would slow any remaining downloading that might take place however the machine had also been registered with an ip address of 18557240 that is with a 7xxx instead of 6xxx and entirely outside of the class c range of ip address that jstor had blocked the downloading continued unimpeded without jstor realizing it

￼
requesting that every effort be made to identify the individuals responsible and to ensure that the content taken in this incident and those previously mentioned is secured and deleted” an email sent the following day from jstor to the libraries reemphasized the urgency of the situation “once again we are seeing extreme unauthorized activity from mit we really need to find out who is doing this it is malicious and intentional and as best we can tell is coming from inside of mit”
employees of the mit libraries had been furloughed for the winter holidays and thus they did not see the messages jstor sent on december 26 and 27 2010 until monday january 3 201115 on the morning of january 4 the libraries informed jstor that mit did not expect to be able to identify the individual involved in these incidents based on the information available at that point16
ib discovery of the laptop
at approximately 300 am on january 4 2011 ist staff sent an email to its network engineers requesting that they trace the exact location in building 16 of the computer using the ip address an ist network engineer began to search when he arrived for work in the morning going to building 16 and checking the basement closet containing the building’s network switches17 around 800 am he entered the closet and saw a cable connected to a network switch and leading to a cardboard box on the floor he lifted the box and saw a laptop computer he telephoned an ist network manager who quickly joined him at the closet

15 the mit libraries were closed for business from 600 pm wednesday december 22 2010 through sunday january 2 2011 the majority of these days were regular or special institute holidays however december 27 28 and 29 2010 were furlough days during which time the staff were required by the libraries’ administration to take involuntary unpaid leave as a costsaving measure to meet budget reductions furloughed staff were explicitly prohibited from working during furlough days two technical staff members were asked to defer their furlough days to another time so that basic technical support to the libraries’ networked resources could be provided their directives included that a access to licensed resources was to be kept available both on and off campus to the degree possible and b any outages caused by problems at mit’s end were to be resolved promptly in the unlikely event that a major aggregator or database should cut off service to mit during this time one of the two staff members was responsible for making best efforts to work with the vendor to resolve the outage this staff member was copied on jstor’s email of december 26 2010 to the libraries but did not respond the libraries wrote to jstor on january 3 explaining that people had been on furlough and had not seen the jstor’s prior messages this january 3 message was the libraries’ first response to jstor’s december 26 and 27 emails
16 the january 4 email also suggested to jstor that it block the entire 1855xxxxxx class b network since the downloading was coming from two different class c networks see footnote 14 at the time the email was sent the libraries did not know that that laptop had been discovered a few hours before

17 the closet had two doors connected in the middle by a common lock with both doors swinging outward when opened he used his key to enter the basement closet however he does not remember whether the doors were actually locked according to this network engineer even when locked the closet could be opened by pulling on both doors simultaneously because the locking mechanism had been damaged

over the next hour the two engineers contacted ist management and the ist security team the security team also consulted mit’s office of the general counsel ogc at 945 am ist management notified the mit police that a laptop connected to a network switch had been found in an electrical closet in building 16 two additional ist staff members arrived minutes later uniformed mit police officers arrived in building 16 and were posted in the basement hallway a network engineer then used an mit laptop to connect to the network switch in order to monitor the traffic packet stream to and from the suspect laptop18 through this monitoring the security team observed the downloading of data
another member of the mit police arrived accompanied by a photographer they took photographs of the closet including the box the laptop and a hard drive sitting under the laptop the mit police decided that the situation required expertise in computer crime and forensics which they did not have they therefore telephoned the cambridge police department detective who is their normal contact for assistance with computerrelated crime activity19
the cambridge detective they contacted was a member of the new england electronic crimes task force20 when he received the call for assistance from the mit police the detective was working at the task force field office in a federal building in boston together with other law enforcement officers whose agencies participate in the task force he responded to the call accompanied by two other task force members a special agent21 of the us secret service and a detective from the boston police department they arrived at the building 16 closet around 1100 am
we note that no one from mit called the secret service the mit police contacted the cambridge detective by calling him on his individual cell phone the special agent became involved because he accompanied the cambridge detective as a task force member the detective would sometimes respond to calls alone and sometimes respond in

18 this monitoring of the switch was accomplished by one of the engineers plugging a cable connected to his mit laptop into a port on the switch at no time did he or anyone else from mit in any way connect to the suspect laptop itself or to its cable with very small exceptions the only communications observed were those to and from the suspect laptop see appendix 7 the packet stream was preserved on the mit laptop and later made available to the secret service special agent who became involved in the investigation
19 the mit police typically make calls to the cambridge police for assistance in computerrelated matters about six times a year in none of these incidents were federal agents part of the response
20 the new england electronic crimes task force  is a bostonbased alliance organized by the secret service with participants from federal state and local law enforcement as well as private industry and academia to investigate electronic crimes including computer system intrusion
21 all federal agents who are authorized to carry firearms in the course of their normal duties are referred to as “special agents” agents of the secret service as well as most federal law enforcement agents have the title of “special agent”

the company of other members of the task force the mit police were aware that other members of the task force might accompany the detective and that task force members included secret service agents
when they arrived the suspect laptop was still downloading data also during the monitoring the mit network engineers had observed that the laptop was being queried from several sources including on one occasion an ip address located in china this information was communicated to the law enforcement officials the fact that someone or some entity in china could be involved initially raised concerns that this might have been part of an international matter22
the special agent attached a usb device to the suspect laptop in an attempt to copy the hard drive but this attempt was unsuccessful crime scene investigators from the cambridge police department arrived and took fingerprints from the laptop and hard drive23 the agencies and personnel worked together in a cooperative fashion with no law enforcement group taking orders from any other
the law enforcement group decided to leave the laptop and hard drive in place to see if the person who had set it up would return because it was not feasible to continuously post mit police officers in the basement corridor for an indefinite period of time and doing so would reveal the surveillance of the closet the decision was made to install a video camera in the closet that could be monitored from elsewhere within mit ist installed the camera at the request of the mit police at around 300 pm the basement closet was restored to the way it was found with the exception of the camera having been installed ist engineers relocated the mit laptop they were using to another room and reconnected it to the mit network to continue monitoring the network traffic to and from the suspect laptop and everyone left the closet area
half an hour later an individual was seen on the video camera entering the basement closet he changed the hard drive attached to the laptop and put the old one into a backpack some of the law enforcement officers went to the closet to try to apprehend him but he had left before they could arrive no one recognized the person in the video still photos showing the suspect were taken from the video and provided to the mit police
during the morning’s activities in the basement closet the special agent had asked for whatever electronic records mit might have on the matter as it is ist’s protocol to obtain approval from mit’s office of the general counsel ogc before releasing
22 ultimately mit concluded that the communication from the ip address located in china was a—not unusual—“pinging” attempt by someone or some entity in china to determine what computer systems at mit were available and accessible and unrelated to the activity of this laptop
23 mit police regularly rely on cambridge police for latent fingerprint collection

￼
information or materials to outside law enforcement agencies ist contacted the ogc which responded that it was appropriate to comply with the agent’s request in view of the fact that law enforcement was conducting an investigation into what was potentially ongoing criminal activity of unknown scope and it did not appear to ogc that such information would disclose personally identifiable information24
ist turned over the following information to the secret service at its request on the afternoon of january 4 2011
1 network flow data which is made up of logs showing which ip addresses communicated with which ip addresses when the communication took place and how much data was transferred
2 dhcp dynamic host configuration protocol logs which are records of requests from computer clients for the dhcp service to assign ip addresses these records contain mac addresses ip addresses and when clients acknowledge the receipt of addresses
3 radius remote authentication dial in user service logs which record requests to use various network services
in addition the following was made available to the secret service at its request and was provided to the special agent on january 25 2011
4 the packet stream captured by the mit network engineer using his laptop as described above this consisted of copies of the jstor downloads and associated control information—some 87 gigabytes in all
these categories of items nos 1 through 4 were provided by mit to the secret service without a subpoena having been issued to mit thereafter mit provided additional documents to the office of the us attorney in response to grand jury subpoenas25 a more detailed description of these items is available in appendix 7 appendix 10 addresses legal issues concerning production of the records
24 at this time ist knew about the jstor downloading but they also were concerned that the laptop might be performing other actions

25 one such item—consisting of six records from the network registration database showing registration for gary host and grace host in september and october 2010—was provided by mit in september 2011 under the impression that it was doing so in response to a grand jury subpoena however at the time those records were produced this subpoena issued on january 27 2011 was apparently no longer valid

ic events of january 6 2011 the arrest
at about 1230 pm on tuesday january 6 someone entered the closet as was recorded by the video camera as he entered he covered his face with a bicycle helmet removing it after he entered and the doors had closed the individual removed the laptop and hard drive and then left the closet 26 when the laptop was disconnected the port status of the switch changed and a monitoring script sent an email to the phone of one of the ist engineers who was not on campus at the time the ist engineer notified the mit police and other network engineers but no one was able to reach building 16 in time to stop or intercept the person who had entered the closet later the same afternoon the suspect computer’s mac address reappeared in mit’s network logs showing that it was connected first in mit building 4 then subsequently in the stratton student center building w2027 in the offices of mit’s student information processing board sipb— mit’s student computing group28
at approximately 200 pm an mit police officer was driving to the stata garage after his shift in an unmarked police cruiser he was familiar with the investigation and had been informed by radio that the laptop had been removed from the basement closet he had seen the january 4 video of the suspect as well as stills made from the video and he had a still with him in his cruiser on vassar street near massachusetts avenue he saw a cyclist pass him heading in the opposite direction based upon the stills and video and given the backpack and clothes the cyclist was wearing the officer observed that the cyclist matched the description of the suspect from the basement closet he made a uturn to follow the cyclist who turned onto massachusetts avenue and proceeded north towards harvard square when the officer reached the cyclist and pulled alongside he rechecked the still photos that he had in his car and concluded that the cyclist was in fact the person in the photos he immediately called his department for backup a second
26 a few minutes before this person entered the closet two mit employees were seen on camera standing in the opening of the closet doorway and then leaving it is possible that the person utilizing the laptop saw these persons leaving the closet and for that reason decided to obscure his face while he was in the hallway still walking to the closet to avoid being identified by them it is also possible that his observation of these employees is why he decided to move the laptop out of the closet and to another location we note that this is speculation on the part of the review panel
27 see the maps in the front matter

28 when the laptop was disconnected from the network and removed from the closet the ip address that it had been using was released by the network the dhcp server network reassigned this address to another user in another part of the building since the ip address was being monitored by ist this initially led to some confusion as to where the suspect initially went and where he initially reconnected his laptop

￼
mit police officer accompanied by the special agent responded by car from the mit police station29
when the cyclist reached the north side of central square the officer who was following him decided to pull ahead of him and stop him to ascertain his identity30 while exiting his car the officer held his credentials so that they could be seen and motioned for the bicyclist to stop the bicyclist complied the officer explained that he was an mit police officer and wanted to speak with him the cyclist first said that he didn’t speak with strangers the officer again displayed his badge as well as his photo id the cyclist then said that mit police were not “real cops” and refused to talk to the officer at that point the cyclist dropped the bicycle to the ground and started running back toward central square on massachusetts avenue the officer chased him briefly but the individual was outrunning him and the officer returned to his car made a uturn and followed maintaining visual contact the suspect slowed to a walk and the officer still in his car watched and followed him
the first mit police officer radioed the second and told him where the suspect was located once near the suspect both mit police officers and the special agent left their vehicles and chased the suspect around parked cars they apprehended and handcuffed him31
at this time the officers still did not know the suspect’s identity one of the officers called the cambridge police who arrived and took the suspect to the cambridge police department for booking there he was identified as aaron swartz aaron swartz refused to talk to the police he made a phone call to his friend quinn norton who arranged for another friend to rush to the police station with bail money shortly thereafter an attorney from the firm of good  cormier arrived at the cambridge police department completed the paperwork for aaron swartz’s bail and departed with him
id events of january 6 2011 seizure of the laptop
later on january 6 2011 after aaron swartz was apprehended members of ist accompanied by mit police and the special agent went to the sipb offices in the stratton student center to look for the laptop together they found the laptop with an external hard drive plugged into a network jack the special agent examined the laptop and the participants decided that there was no feasible way to collect evidence from the

ie access to the mit network
as it is relevant for the postarrest narrative we briefly describe mit’s procedures for network access and review how aaron swartz obtained access to the mit network and to jstor
ie1 connecting to the mit network
mit community members who want to use the wired network register by presenting an mit user name and password that were issued to them when they began employment or first registered as students or were given a formal appointment at mit and they obtain permanent registrations for their computers all other individuals—“guests”—who want to connect to mit’s wired network supply a personal name and an email address as contact information and they obtain a registration that is valid for up to 14 days a year of cumulative use as explained on ist’s information page32
ist offers shortterm network service to campus guests guests are allowed up to fourteen days of network service when they register on the wired mit network mitnet    
for wired connections plug the ethernet cable into the computer and to an mitnet network drop    
the machine needs to be configured for dhcp obtaining an ip address automatically    
once the equipment is ready to connect open a web browser and point it to any web page a page will appear prompting to select your registration option after selecting visitor registration the returned page will display the mitnet rules of use followed by a screen requesting the visitors contact information number of days of connectivity and the event for which they are on campus
visitors can register between one and five consecutive days at a time up to fourteen days per year
32 see network connectivity for mit guests 
part i events leading to the arrest  26
￼
more precisely the requirement to register is triggered when the computer asks mit’s dhcp server to issue it an ip address it is also possible to configure a computer to use a selfassigned “static ip address” in which case there will be no registration request provided that the static ip address is in an appropriate range and does not conflict with an address that has already been assigned mit’s procedure is that static ip addresses should be requested through ist so as to avoid conflicting address assignments which would result in disruption of service33
as noted above footnote 8 aaron swartz registered five times in 2010 september 24 october 2 8 and 22 and november 28 when the laptop was located in january 2011 it had a static ip address at some point34 swartz had switched from using dhcpprovided ip addresses to using a static selfassigned ip address35
ie2 jstor and econtrol
mit operates a very open network anyone can come onto campus and plug their computer into an mit network port or connect to the wireless network36 connecting to the wired network and getting connected automatically requires registering the computer the first time it is plugged in connecting to mit’s wireless network does not require registration
prior to january 2011 any computer connected to the mit network could access jstor in the wake of the october 2010 downloading incident and as a direct result of that incident the libraries and ist decided to deploy an authorization system for jstor called “econtrol” that had been designed by the mit libraries to more narrowly restrict access by the mit community to certain electronic databases under econtrol requests to access jstor would require a valid mit certificate and be verified against mit’s human resources directory and only mit faculty students or staff—not guests—would be granted access to jstor guests seeking access to jstor would now have to come to the mit libraries and use a library computer there
mit was prepared to implement econtrol as early as october 2010 jstor and mit were mindful that an abrupt change would diminish user convenience for the mit community jstor asked mit to delay deployment of econtrol to allow jstor to add an explanatory message to the jstor web page that would advise mit users of the change and redirect them through the econtrol process jstor informed mit that this
33 see “request an ip addresshost name” 
34 mit is not sure when as there is no mit system of record that would have indicated this
35 he used two different addresses 18556240 and 18557240
36 mit’s framework for network security follows the general principle that while access to individual
resources on the network could be restricted access to the underlying network should be as open as possible this reflects a general computer system design methodology called the endtoend principle
part i events leading to the arrest  27
￼
change would not be ready to implement until after december 18 effectively putting off the planned activation of econtrol until after mit’s winter holiday break
on the morning of january 3 mit and jstor agreed to expedite the implementation of econtrol and the system was activated on january 10 2011 since then guests at mit can access jstor only from certain workstations located in the libraries

￼part ii
part i of this review covered events from the start of the jstor downloading in september 2010 through the arrest of aaron swartz in january 2011 part iii will take up a discussion of mit’s actions after the arrest here in part ii we describe the background against which mit’s actions played out apart from providing information mit had little role in the events described in this part of the report but these events add important context for understanding mit’s decisions and actions described in part iii
we first provide some perspective on aaron swartz and his interactions with the mit and harvard communities we then review the legal proceedings in which he was involved as a result of his arrest which included multiple prosecutions multiple indictments and several different attorneys finally we describe the settlement agreement between aaron swartz and jstor negotiated and executed during the period leading up to the indictment handed up in july 2011
iia background on aaron swartz
aaron swartz was a computer programmer and activist well known in the internet civil liberties and technological–academic communities he was 24 at the time of his arrest by the age of 14 he had played an instrumental role in the development of the web publishing format rss the metadata schemes for creative commons and several other

cuttingedge internet technologies by the age of 19 he had started and sold a successful webpublishing company1 he was also the cofounder of demand progress an internet blog and activist group selfdescribed as focusing on civil liberties civil rights and government reform2
iia1 aaron swartz in cambridge
aaron swartz was neither a member of the mit staff nor an enrolled student nor alumnus nor a member of the faculty he was a regular visitor to the mit campus and interacted with mit people and groups both on campus and off his webpublishing startup was developed with the help of an entrepreneurship accelerator company “boot camp” that arranged for him to be housed on the mit campus for the summer of 20053 after a short period in san francisco he returned to cambridge in 2006 and lived in an apartment on massachusetts avenue in central square between harvard and mit he was a member of mit’s free culture group4 a regular visitor at mit’s student information processing board sipb and an active participant in the annual mit international puzzle mystery hunt competition5 aaron swartz’s father robert swartz was and is a consultant at the mit media lab aaron frequently visited his father there and his two younger brothers had been media lab interns
aaron swartz was a respected contributor to the world wide web consortium’s semantic web html and tag technical architecture group activities he attended gatherings of the semantic web working group that met at the mit computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory and he was an invited speaker at one of the gatherings in 2008
in 2010 aaron swartz became a research fellow at harvard university’s edmond j safra center for ethics6 invited to conduct experimental and ethnographic studies of the political system and to prepare a monograph on the mechanisms of political corruption

2 since the suicide there has been an enormous amount of information published about aaron swartz and speculation about why he downloaded the jstor material and about factors contributing to the suicide see for example larissa mcfarquhar “requiem for a dream” in the new yorker march 11 2013  wesley yang “the life and afterlife of aaron swartz” new york magazine february 8 2013  quinn norton “life inside the aaron swartz investigation” the atlantic march 3 2013  and many others

he had an office at the center and he was a regular contributor to discussions and activities there
after aaron swartz’s arrest harvard suspended his fellowship and banned him from the harvard campus pending the outcome of an investigation into whether he had also used harvard’s computers or network for similar activities7 mit took no action itself but at aaron swartz’s arraignment on january 7 2011 cambridge district court judge thomas ordered him to stay away from mit property as part of the conditions of release8 us magistrate judge dein imposed the same ban as a condition of aaron swartz’s release at his initial appearance and arraignment for the federal indictment on july 19 20119 at the time of the federal arraignment aaron swartz was residing at two locations one in brooklyn new york near his employment as an independent contractor in new york city and the other in cambridge massachusetts10
iia2 possible motives for downloading
as far as the review panel knows aaron swartz made no statement after his arrest regarding what he had planned to do with the downloaded documents the review panel views the question of what he intended to do with the information that he was downloading from jstor as remaining open11 speculations about his motives reference a statement about free information to which he contributed as well as two previous large download experiences
the federal indictment states that the downloading was “with the purpose of distributing a significant proportion of jstor’s archive through one or more filesharing sites” that is the alleged motive is that aaron swartz intended to place the material on the internet so that it could be freely distributed around the entire globe in support of this
7 although the investigation apparently did not find that he did this his fellowship expired before this finding was made and before the ban was lifted harvard’s ogc declined to comment for this review
8 recall from part i that aaron swartz was arrested under massachusetts law

9 the federal district court conditions of release are at  as far as the review panel has been able to determine the cambridge district court and federal court bans were imposed at the recommendations of the district attorney and the federal prosecutor respectively and no one in the mit administration asked for them or knew about them the federal conditions of release also included the requirement that aaron swartz “undergo medical or psychiatric treatment as directed”

11 also open is the question as to why aaron swartz used the mit network for the downloading as opposed to the harvard network to which he already had registered access lawrence lessig director of the safra center and professor of law harvard law school suggests that aaron swartz did the downloading at mit so as not to create trouble for lessig and the safra center lawrence lessig on “aaron’s laws—law and justice in a digital age”

interpretation of his purpose the government pointed12 to a “guerilla manifesto” he posted on the internet in 2008 this “manifesto” included the following
we need to take information wherever it is stored make our copies and share them with the world we need to take stuff that’s out of copyright and add it to the archive we need to buy secret databases and put them on the web we need to download scientific journals and upload them to file sharing networks we need to fight for guerilla open access13
federal law enforcement apparently took the first sentence “we need to take information wherever it is stored make our copies and share them with the world” as the motive and purpose behind his extensive downloading—some 48 million articles or 80 of jstor’s database of journals “it is alleged that swartz avoided mit’s and jstor’s security efforts in order to distribute a significant proportion of jstor’s archive through one or more filesharing sites”14
collecting the jstor articles through the mit network was not the first time aaron swartz had engaged in largescale downloading although it was the first time he was charged with a crime in 2008 he downloaded about 20 million pages of documents from the governmentrun pacer public access to court electronic records system unlike the jstor documents these were all in the public domain15 “he donated the 19856160 pages to httppublicresourceorg an open government initiative spearheaded by carl malamud as part of a broader project to make public as many government databases as malamud can find”16 the fbi opened an investigation but apparently concluded that no laws were violated and thus no charges were filed17

aaron swartz also participated in a study of downloaded articles concerning the payment by interested organizations to experts including law professors to publish papers in academic journals he wrote a script that downloaded articles from westlaw and a second script that extracted the relevant information about the funding sources from the footnotes of each article18 this has been cited as support for a different possible motive for his actions an intention to crossreference the entire jstor database by author publisher and funding source so as to demonstrate the extent to which jstor’s service and thus the fees it charged was enabled and funded by public money19 in support of this interpretation is aaron swartz’s selfdescription on the first page of his blog “he aaron swartz is a frequent television commentator and the author of numerous articles on a variety of topics especially the corrupting influence of big money on institutions including nonprofits the media politics and public opinion from 2010–2011 he researched these topics as a fellow at the harvard ethics center lab on institutional corruption”20
one can also speculate that aaron swartz had not decided what he would eventually do with the articles at the time of the downloading21

21 carl malamud in his memorial to aaron swartz writes “i’m convinced that aaron had not made a decision to release those articles and i am certain he would not have released them without a great deal of postdownload analysis” aaron’s army on crime and access to knowledge”  or as his friend quinn norton told the review panel “he liked to collect data sets” norton also told the review panel that swartz was shocked by the arrest he didn’t regard what he’d done as a big deal and was surprised that people were making so much of it his third attorney elliot peters also told the review panel that swartz had been shocked by the arrest

22 this firm had previously represented aaron swartz during a criminal investigation conducted by the fbi in boston regarding the downloading of court documents from the public access to court electronic records pacer system there are no copyrights in court records and the downloading took place during a period of time when and at a location where pacer was not charging for downloading the fbi investigation concluded with no prosecution of aaron swartz or of anyone else

federal case and was involved from the day of swartz’s arrest until the fall of 2011 after the first federal indictment was handed up but before the state indictment was issued and subsequently dismissed
the second firm was that of martin g weinberg esq also in boston mr weinberg assumed the representation from good  cormier beginning in the fall of 2011 and continued until the end of october 2012 after the federal superseding indictment was handed up it was during this time period that the state case was indicted and then dismissed
the third firm was keker  van nest llp in san francisco mr elliot peters was aaron swartz’s lead counsel this firm took over the representation from martin weinberg and continued until aaron swartz’s death on january 11 2013
william kettlewell of collora llp in boston was also involved in the defense during a period overlapping the involvement of good  cormier and martin weinberg neither mr kettlewell nor his law firm appeared in court in either the federal or state case23
iib1 the state prosecution
upon his arrest aaron swartz was charged in cambridge district court with two felonies of breaking and entering in the daytime one count each for january 4 and january 6 2011
on november 6 2011 after the initial federal indictment was handed up the da’s office obtained a state indictment against aaron swartz charging him with six felony counts two counts of breaking and entering a building at mit with the intent to commit a felony three counts of accessing a computer without authorization and one count of larceny—stealing the electronically processed or stored data of jstor—in an amount over 250 ≈ cost of ps3 gaming system 2011 this indictment was handed up not in cambridge district court but rather in a different court the superior court for middlesex county24
mit was not involved in the state prosecution it first learned of the prosecution on november 17 2011 through a cambridge da’s office press release25 mit was not
23 throughout the relevant period mit’s office of the general counsel was under the impression that mr kettlewell represented robert swartz rather than aaron swartz however mr kettlewell clarified this during his interview with the review panel
24 according to attorneys for aaron swartz prosecutions in superior court are normally used for more serious cases the sentences handed down in this court are typically harsher than those handed down in district court and it is more difficult to resolve a case in superior court without an adjudication or without jail time than in district court

asked to provide documents to produce witnesses to be interviewed or to testify mit did not seek to press charges and did not intervene or lobby to have the charges dismissed
after the state indictment martin weinberg filed demands for discovery in state prosecutions that involve joint investigations with outside law enforcement agencies or foreign jurisdictions massachusetts state law governing criminal discovery requires that the district attorney obtain from those agencies and jurisdictions certain evidence that may be relevant to the case some of this evidence was in the sole possession of the boston us attorney’s office and the us secret service mr weinberg demanded this material as discovery from the da’s office and the usao refused to produce it to that office as a result the da’s office could not comply with the massachusetts discovery laws so as to continue its prosecution and it dismissed its charges
iib2 the federal prosecution
the us attorney’s office opened its criminal investigation on january 5 201126 assistant us attorney ausa stephen heymann head of the internet and computer crimes unit within the usao directed the investigation and eventual prosecution stephen heymann is referred to as “the lead prosecutor” throughout the rest of this report shortly after aaron swartz’s arrest the lead prosecutor and the special agent who had been at mit on january 4 spoke with and interviewed personnel from ist and the mit police eventually two grand jury subpoenas for documents were served upon mit27 more will be said about these subpoenas and mit’s response to them in part iii
the initial indictment was handed up by a federal grand jury sitting in boston on july 14 2011 it charged aaron swartz on four felony counts these being one count of wire fraud and three counts of violating the computer fraud and abuse act cfaa28 each

26 on this day the secret service special agent sent an email to an assistant us attorney in boston inquiring about the statutes that might be used to prosecute the person involved the us department of justice can begin a criminal investigation without knowing the identity of the perpetrator who engaged in the conduct under investigation in such circumstances the matter is opened for an “unsub” indicating an unknown subject
27 an initial and then a superseding indictment were returned by grand juries sitting in boston separated in time by about fourteen months they were signed by different foremen for these reasons we assume that the indictments were considered and returned by different grand juries both subpoenas appear to have been issued by the first of these grand juries

28 18 usc §1030 criminalizes various forms of conduct pertaining to “protected computers” which include computers used in or affecting interstate commerce among these any computer connected to the internet the forms of conduct that are made illegal by this act include those involving accessing a computer without authorization or exceeding authorized access accessing a computer with intent to defraud and transmitting information that results in damage the first indictment charged aaron swartz count three with both a accessing protected computers the mit network and jstor’s computer system without authorization and b exceeding authorized access the superseding indictment although

of the three latter counts is based upon a different legal theory29 at no time had the us attorney’s office sought the permission opinion or support of mit for this prosecution before the indictment was handed up mit learned of the indictment for the first time on the day it was unsealed july 19 through a phone call from the prosecutor to an attorney in ogc
andrew good was notified by the us attorney’s office on july 18 monday about the indictment and he arranged to have aaron swartz voluntarily appear for his initial court appearance on the early morning of july 19 following the normal procedures of the us marshal’s service aaron swartz was arrested on the federal charges30 he was held in lockup pending his being interviewed by pretrial services and was otherwise processed including the taking of biographical information and fingerprints by the us marshals service
on the day of his arrest aaron swartz issued 11 tweets from his twitter account most referencing the website of demand progress which published an article about aaron swartz’s indictment and arrest and solicited statements of support for him31 demand
increasing the number of counts from four to 13 removed the accusation that aaron swartz exceeded authorized access while keeping the charge that he accessed the computers without authorization more detail as to the legal theories for each count in the initial complaint is provided in the next footnote

29 count one charged aaron swartz with defrauding jstor of property that is “journal articles digitized and distributed by jstor and copies thereof” by use of a wire transmission in violation of 18 usc § 1343 count two charged aaron swartz with accessing a protected computer on the mit and the jstor networks without authorization and also in excess of authorized access with the intent to defraud and obtain things of value these being “digitized journal articles from jstor’s archives” this was in violation of 18 usc § 1030a4 count three charged him with intentionally accessing a computer on the mit and the jstor network without authorization and in excess of authorized access and thereby obtaining information having a value in excess of 5000 this was in violation of 18 usc § 1030a2 c2biii count four charged aaron swartz with intentionally accessing without authorization a protected computer on the mit and the jstor network in a manner affecting at least 10 computers and as a result of such conduct causing damage in excess of 5000 this was in violation of 18 usc § 1030a5b c4aii and vi all counts were felony charges
the indictments also alleged that aaron swartz aided and abetted someone else in committing these criminal offenses however nowhere in the indictments is such other person identified described or otherwise alluded to and the review panel has learned of no basis for this allegation
30 the prior arrest in cambridge on january 6 was on the state charges
31 “federal government indicts former demand progress executive director for downloading too many journal articles”  the director of demand progress together with aaron swartz’s friend quinn norton wrote the article while swartz was in custody
￼
part ii background on aaron swartz and legal events following the arrest  38
progress also embarked on a petition drive in his support the demand progress website later indicated that more than 35000 people ≈ population of san marino nation had signed the petition32
a superseding indictment was returned by a second grand jury also sitting in boston on september 12 2012 14 months after the initial indictment it charged aaron swartz with 13 felony counts these being two counts of wire fraud and 11 counts of violating the cfaa essentially the superseding indictment took the four counts from the initial indictment and broke each of them into multiple counts by charging aaron swartz’s alleged conduct as related to each of the four legal theories of liability as discrete events in place of being merged into single allegations of liability also the theory of liability for the final count alleging damage to a protected computer was expanded33
iib3 plea discussions during the federal prosecution
the usao and aaron swartz’s defense team held plea discussions during 2011 and 2012 the key issues discussed were a whether aaron swartz would have to plead guilty to a felony b whether he would need to serve jail time and if so how much
32 “more than 35000 sign petition in support of aaron swartz” 

33 one effect of these charging decisions was to—theoretically—increase the maximum penalties to which aaron swartz might be subject from 35 years to 95 years imprisonment and from 1 million ≈ 1965 typical ceo pay to 3 million ≈ cost of 30second super bowl advertisement 2011 in fines we note that as a practical matter the us sentencing commission guidelines take into account the relevant conduct of a person convicted of a crime giving little regard to the number of counts for which that person is convicted a judge is not obligated to follow the sentencing guidelines—but must explain on a sentencing form—that is on the record—why the court has “departed” from the guidelines
it is legally proper to include or “bundle” two or more events as part of a single count in an initial indictment even where each event is chargeable as a separate crime as defined by a single criminal statute it is also proper to treat such separate events as separate crimes or counts in such an indictment thus while not legally required it is appropriate to charge multiple events in one count similarly although not legally required it is appropriate to charge such multiple events in multiple counts
we also note that the us attorneys’ manual usam published by the us department of justice and establishing policy for all us attorneys’ offices contains the following comment regarding charging decisions
comment it is important to the fair and efficient administration of justice in the federal system that the government bring as few charges as are necessary to ensure that justice is done the bringing of unnecessary charges not only complicates and prolongs trials it constitutes an excessive—and potentially unfair—exercise of power to ensure appropriately limited exercises of the charging power usam 9 27320 outlines three general situations in which additional charges may be brought 1 when necessary adequately to reflect the nature and extent of the criminal conduct involved 2 when necessary to provide the basis for an appropriate sentence under all the circumstances of the case and 3 when an additional charge or charges would significantly strengthen the case against the defendant or a codefendant “additional charges” usam 927320 b

part ii background on aaron swartz and legal events following the arrest  39
according to the usao the earliest plea offer made to aaron swartz was the following “a plea of guilty to a single felony count with a recommended sentence of three months imprisonment to be followed by a period of supervised release the conditions of which included a period in a halfway house a period of home confinement and—as is common in computer crime cases—restrictions on his use of computers during the period” of supervision34
according to andrew good the first plea offer made by the us attorney’s office came from the lead prosecutor before the initial indictment was returned it included the following aaron swartz would plead guilty to a felony he would serve 13 months imprisonment a period of supervisory release would follow the incarceration35 and restrictions would be placed on aaron swartz’s computer use during the supervisory release aaron swartz rejected this plea offer according to mr kettlewell during a pre indictment meeting with at the usao a plea offer of six months imprisonment was made it was rejected
during the negotiations that followed this rejection the usao offered periods of jail time of up to six months which included additional restrictions similar to the ones already discussed that is offers involved a “split sentence” under which a defendant serves a term of imprisonment followed by a period of community confinement or home detention
according to the us attorney’s office there was a period of time after the indictment when the government offered a plea along the following lines aaron swartz would plead guilty the government would retain the option to ask for jail time of up to six months and the defense would be free to argue for a nojail probationary sentence martin weinberg and robert swartz offered the following clarification of this offer for the review panel aaron swartz would have to plead guilty to all four felony counts of the initial indictment and a period of supervised release would follow any period of incarceration
according to mr weinberg an alternative plea offer extended about the same time would have required aaron swartz to waive his right to argue for no jail time but would have reduced the time sought by the government to four months or less both plea offers could have been subject to further negotiations36 however they were rejected by the
34 letter from the usao to the review panel
35 supervisory release is a form of probation that follows incarceration
36 according to mr weinberg items that might have been open to further negotiations included the
number of counts of the initial indictment to which aaron swartz would have been required to plead guilty
￼

defense because—under the scope for such negotiations permitted by the usao—under no circumstances could aaron swartz obtain a guarantee of no jail time37
according to aaron swartz’s attorneys at no time did federal prosecutors entertain a plea agreement for him that assured him no jail time38 and the prosecutors always insisted on a plea to a felony as opposed to a lesser charge that is to a misdemeanor39 it was during these discussions according to andrew good that he informed the lead prosecutor that aaron swartz was suicide risk and the prosecutor responded that the office could have him locked up presumably to prevent such an occurrence
all of these negotiations occurred against the backdrop of the us sentencing commission guidelines which—although not binding upon federal judges—provide a calculus for a judge to use in determining the appropriate sentence for a defendant among the more significant factors under the guidelines is the value of property sought to be taken by the perpetrator of a crime including crimes defined by the computer fraud and abuse act we note that this is the value of the property sought to be taken and not of property actually taken given the allegations in each of the two indictments and the evidence the government intended to introduce at trial concerning the value of the jstor articles aaron swartz sought to download he was realistically facing a sentence calculated under the guidelines of some seven years incarceration plus supervisory release and fines in the event of conviction at trial and in the absence of any plea agreement40
mit was never involved in any plea negotiation and was never asked—by either the prosecution or the defense—to approve or disapprove any plea agreement
￼37 rule 11c1c of the federal rules of criminal procedure provides that where the government and a defendant agree that a specific sentence or sentencing range is the appropriate disposition of the case such recommendation or request binds the court once the court accepts the plea agreement as the government never agreed to a guarantee of a disposition of this case with no jail time this rule was not available to aaron swartz for the purpose of withdrawing his plea of guilty in the event that the sentencing judge chose to impose jail time as part of the sentence
38 confirmation was provided by jstor’s outside counsel at debevoise  plimpton llp by robert swartz and by quinn norton
39 confirmation provided by robert swartz and quinn norton
40 at the time of aaron swartz’s indictment the usao stated “if convicted on these charges swartz faces up to 35 years in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release restitution forfeiture and a fine of up to 1 million ≈ 1965 typical ceo pay” see usao press release july 19 2011

iib4 motions to suppress
on october 5 2012 attorney weinberg on behalf of aaron swartz filed five motions to suppress evidence and one motion to dismiss the indictment41 among the arguments made in these motions to suppress was that the government and mit had violated the stored electronic communications act violated swartz’s constitutional right under the fourth amendment against unreasonable search and seizure and violated his expectation of privacy under mit’s policy concerning the maintenance and routine destruction of computer records specifically the dhcp logs the government filed its opposition on november 16 2012
iic aaron swartz’s settlement with jstor
early in 2011 shortly after the arrest of aaron swartz attorneys at good  cormier engaged in a strategy of trying to convince the usao that no prosecution should be pursued and failing this goal to convince it that an agreement with no felony conviction and no jail time was appropriate for resolving the matter as part of this strategy the firm sought to obtain jstor’s support for such a resolution
jstor had an inside general counsel it also used outside counsel from the new york law firm debevoise  plimpton llp when the usao began asking for information from jstor as part of the grand jury’s investigation jstor asked the usao to issue a subpoena for the information and the usao complied while collecting information necessary for complying with the subpoena it examined its internal records and determined the following the “third” episode of downloading which it discovered on december 26 2010 had actually begun in late november the stream of requests that instigated these downloads was structured in such a way that none of the triggers jstor had inserted into its systems to warn it of any such renewed downloading had reacted jstor finally determined that aaron swartz had obtained some 43 million articles these were in addition to the 450000 articles downloaded in the september and october incidents
jstor was extremely concerned about the status of the data that aaron swartz had downloaded the material might be placed on the internet and widely disseminated from there jstor felt that this might even damage its viability because the publishers and copyright holders of the articles it stored might no longer trust the organization42
41 under the court’s scheduling order this was the last permissible day for the filing of such motions of the five motions to suppress four referred to mit
42 this information was provided to the review panel by the president of jstor
￼
part ii background on aaron swartz and legal events following the arrest  42
good  cormier spoke with jstor’s outside counsel seeking a civil settlement that would resolve any civil liability that swartz might have with the company43 it also asked that jstor tell the usao directly that it was not interested in aaron swartz being prosecuted or jailed at this time jstor had not filed nor had it threated to file a civil lawsuit—although in theory it could have done so
a civil settlement agreement with jstor was achieved on june 3 2011 aaron swartz certified that he had not made any copies of the data that he had downloaded and good  cormier delivered the only disk containing this data to the usao this satisfied jstor as it now knew where the data was kept and that it was secure in addition aaron swartz paid over 26500 ≈ per capita income  germany 2005 to jstor composed of 1500 ≈ highend bicycle for damages and 25000 ≈ per capita income  united kingdom 2005 in attorneys’ fees and costs44
once this settlement agreement was signed two outside counsel for jstor spoke on several occasions with the lead prosecutor a second line prosecutor in boston involved in the case and a supervisory prosecutor in boston not the us attorney they told these prosecutors that although jstor recognized that any charging decision was entirely up to the government jstor was not pressing for criminal charges and preferred from its perspective that no charges be brought45
on july 19 2011 the day that the federal indictment was unsealed jstor issued a press release that included the following46
we have been subpoenaed by the united states attorney’s office in this case and are fully cooperating    
the criminal investigation and today’s indictment of mr swartz has been directed by the united states attorney’s office it was the government’s decision whether to prosecute not jstor’s as noted previously our interest was in securing the content once this was achieved we had no interest in this becoming an ongoing legal matter   
43 in addition to its criminal penalties the computer fraud and abuse act allows victims to seek compensation from persons who cause them harm through violations of the act by bringing civil actions against such persons see 18 usc § 1030g

44 we note that this 1500 ≈ highend bicycle of negotiated damages by itself is less than the 5000 minimum in damages required to escalate cfaa charges in the two indictments from misdemeanors to felonies more about the measurement of damages and its effect on the seriousness of the charges is discussed in appendix 11 comments on the computer fraud and abuse act charges against aaron swartz section iic losses exceeding five thousand dollars

with regard to jstor’s involvement in the criminal prosecution we note the following when on january 11 the secret service asked jstor about the value of its database jstor declined to answer later when the usao contacted jstor for information jstor insisted on being served with a subpoena multiple subpoenas were served and jstor tried to limit the information it provided to answering subpoenas the government did not ask jstor’s management whether there was unauthorized access fraud deception or damage47 its inquiries of jstor prior to the indictment were “superficial”48 no jstor employees were interviewed prior to the indictment49 although the prosecution had access to jstor’s documents through subpoenas50

48 this comment was provided to the review panel by jstor’s outside counsel

50 according to the uao four jstor employees participated in a conference call with “members of the
united states’ investigatory team” where one employee said that the jstor terms and conditions “clearly prohibited the kind of downloading” engaged in by aaron swartz and a jstor employee was in “regular contact” with the prosecution from the beginning of the investigation and “provided information prior to the indictment” according to jstor’s outside counsel the indictment was returned without benefit of interviews with jstor personnel the usao began to interview jstor employees in december 2012 and the questioning focused on the nature of swartz’s access of jstor’s network but it did not ask explicitly about gaining unauthorized access or exceeding authorized access

apart from providing information to the prosecution and responding to grand jury subpoenas matters remained quiet for mit during the period between the january 6 arrest of aaron swartz and midjune a month or so before his indictment initially mit’s office of the general counsel did not know the background of aaron swartz a few days after the arrest ogc did a search on his name on the internet and learned about him and his background
during the early postarrest period mit was involved in three matters concerning aaron swartz 1 responding to requests by the prosecution for documents and information about swartz’s conduct on the mit network 2 developing and implementing a position of neutrality and 3 discussing with jstor the possibility of making a joint public statement on the swartz matter significant communications between mit and aaron swartz’s attorneys and his father robert swartz did not begin until june 2011

mit cooperated with law enforcement beginning with their arrival on campus specifically there were interactions with a federal prosecutor a secret service special agent and a detective from the cambridge police department5 these officials acted as a team for the purposes of seeking information from mit and otherwise conducting the postarrest investigation the usao asked for the preservation of relevant evidence and consistent with its general practice in other cases ogc agreed to preserve it ogc helped to schedule interviews which took place in the ogc offices with employees from ist and the mit libraries brought to these meetings were additional relevant documents for the purpose of refreshing the memories of the persons interviewed ogc set ground rules stipulating that the investigators could continue to talk directly to the witnesses they had already interviewed without ogc involvement but for new witnesses or new areas of inquiry ogc would want to participate
on january 24 2011 the secret service agent asked ist for a copy of the packet data capture and the video surveillance file ist duplicated the hard drive it had used to capture the packet stream see section ib and the special agent picked up the copy at mit on january 266
as of january 25 the usao and the secret service continued to seek yet more information on january 27 mit was served with the first of two grand jury subpoenas the ogc would not have agreed to provide additional material without such a subpoena the first subpoena called for the following
with respect to actual and attempted excessive downloads from jstor between september 25 2010 and january 6 2011 from ip addresses assigned to buildings 16 4 and w20 provide the following

5 the first postarrest email between the lead prosecutor and an attorney in the office of mit’s general counsel occurred on january 7 2011 it asked for the preservation of certain evidence essentially the same evidence that was commanded by the first grand jury subpoena served on mit on january 27

1 all electronic logs and records mit has and can recover concerning the events
2 all nonprivileged electronic mail notes reports records documents correspondence and other materials regarding or referring to the events
3 all photographs videos and other images taken by surveillance cameras in the utility closet in building 16 utilized during the events
4 screen shots of mit’s guest login process and any associated terms of use and
5 all records of expenditures of time and money to respond to the events
in response to this subpoena mit made four separate productions of documents over the course of three months the first three productions on february 4 18 and 28 dealt with items 1 through 47 in addition to this document production an ist network engineer answered by email questions posed by the lead prosecutor concerning mit’s network and swartz’s conduct this began immediately after the arrest and continued throughout the prosecution8
with regard to item 5 requesting records of expenditures of time and money ogc informed the lead prosecutor shortly after receiving the subpoena that mit normally does not keep records related to time spent by individual staff on specific tasks and it did not believe that mit had incurred any outofpocket expenses with several trivial exceptions when asked by the usao mit provided by letter dated april 13 an estimate of the time spent by ist and libraries staff members on mit’s response to the downloading events both before aaron swartz’s arrest and afterwards as well as an

7 the requested items 1 through 4 were produced on the following dates a february 4 2011 collections of documents maintained by one employee each from ist and the mit libraries b february 18 2011 collections of documents maintained by three additional employees of ist and printouts of various screen shots relating to mit’s guest login process and c february 28 2011 a collection of documents maintained by yet another employee of ist

8 in addition in midfebruary the lead prosecutor wrote to ogc inquiring whether ogc could accept a subpoena demanding logs from a computer belonging to the student information processing board sipb a student organization ogc consulted with a student official of sipb and concluded that the logs were not likely to provide the information that the prosecutor desired in response to the written inquiry ogc and sipb provided some basic information about the machine no other additional information was provided and the subpoena was never served

iiia2 mitisinformedabouttheprosecutionmarch2011–june2011
sometime in midmarch the lead prosecutor informed ogc by telephone that the usao had taken investigative steps that would serve to put the primary suspect on notice that an investigation was ongoing this was how mit learned that the government was actively moving to prosecute aaron swartz10 during this conversation the lead prosecutor also said that proving the required “jurisdictional amount” for prosecution 5000 or more would not be difficult because of what had been done to jstor
on may 6 the lead prosecutor asked ogc for all of the data so far provided by mit in paper format to be reproduced in native digital format11 ogc refused because of the time and expense that would be required to comply instead as a compromise mit scanned all the documents and placed them on a cd
during the same conversation the lead prosecutor gave an update on the prosecution he stated that discussions with swartz had gone nowhere and that swartz was not interested in any deals he also stated that the prosecution was likely moving forward with seeking an indictment finally he communicated the terms of the plea deal he had offered if the jstor documents were not disseminated by swartz and swartz provided an affidavit to that effect then the prosecution would allow him to plead guilty to one felony count and “recommend a sentence below the guidelines”
on june 21 2011 the lead prosecutor called mit to request information on the journals and databases to which the mit libraries subscribed ogc did not consider the first subpoena to cover this material and requested a second subpoena12 mit received this second subpoena by facsimile on june 24 2011 asking for “documents sufficient to

9 mit applied hourly rates as follows a for the ist personnel it applied rates used to estimate software development costs and b for the personnel with mit libraries it used actual salary and benefits to calculate an hourly rate in this letter mit informed the prosecutor that for some of the individuals listed identified by name the relevant time expended by them occurred after law enforcement became involved although this calculation was not made in the letter applying the estimated hours to the hourly rates would have resulted in a figure of 1010475 ≈ average used car the portion of this amount incurred before the arrest was under 3500 ≈ typical annual cost of car ownership the remaining time and its estimated value was incurred responding to the prosecution’s requests for documents and information after the arrest of aaron swartz
10 about this time the us secret service executed several search warrants at locations frequented by aaron swartz seeking computer equipment and downloaded data
11 “native” format means the format used to encode data by a program or application without access to that program or application data may not be readable

12 the lead prosecutor called to ask for the journal and database information using the initial subpoena as the legal grounds for doing so the initial subpoena was very broad and the information sought by the lead prosecutor in this phone call could be read to fall within its scope ogc however read the subpoena conservatively and would not produce the additional material without the second subpoena

during the june 21 conversation the lead prosecutor also told ogc that essentially his work was done that the final decision about the prosecution was now in the hands of his supervisors and that a decision would be made soon the ogc attorney took the opportunity to suggest that some people at mit would be likely to view the prosecution negatively the lead prosecutor replied that he understood the complex dynamics at mit he said that he had also been in touch with jstor and understood their perspective and had taken both into account in moving forward with the prosecution and he would let mit know when the indictment came down from this ogc inferred that further presentations of mit’s opinions were unlikely to have an effect on the prosecution the views of both potential victims had already been taken into account jstor at that point was regarded as the primary victim and if jstor’s view didn’t have an impact then neither would mit’s view
iiia3 mitadoptsandmaintainsapostureofneutrality
very early in this postarrest period mit decided to “remain neutral” as between the government and aaron swartz in the investigation and eventual prosecution initially this meant simply that mit would not take a public position on the prosecution throughout the following almost two years mit’s decisions were mostly guided by this posture of neutrality to help readers better understand the reasons for mit’s actions and decisions we here describe the neutrality position and its evolution before returning to the chronology of events
in coming to assume the stance of neutrality ogc considered that aaron swartz was not and had never been an mit enrolled student nor was he ever a faculty member or employee if he had been a student there could have been involvement of additional mit personnel such as faculty advisers and deans and a possible referral to the mit committee on discipline the involvement of the disciplinary committee could have opened the way for mit to lobby against a prosecution in favor of its own internal resolution of an “internal” matter14

13 on december 12 2012 the lead prosecutor sought yet additional documentary information from mit indicating that he would follow up these requests with subpoenas at this stage of the prosecution such subpoenas could not be issued by a grand jury but only by the court essentially by the prosecutor as attorney for one of the parties and therefore as an officer of the court pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure 17c seeking documents for use at trial or another evidentiary hearing ancillary to trial such as a suppression hearing
14 mit might have adopted a neutral position even if swartz had been a member of the mit community the cases of david lamacchia and andrew huang described in appendix 9 show mit adopting a neutral position with respect to the legal troubles of enrolled students
part iii mit’s response to the prosecution  52
￼
mit’s neutrality position had two dimensions
1 with regard to substance mit would make no statements whether in support or in opposition about the government’s decision to prosecute aaron swartz the government’s decisions about charges in an indictment or any possible plea bargain stances of the prosecution or the defense15
2 with regard to legal procedure mit would treat both federal law enforcement and aaron swartz’s defense team similarly for the purpose of providing documents and making employees available for interviews
in adhering to neutrality with regard to substance mit made no public statements about the decision to prosecute about the charges in the federal indictments or about the state prosecution mit did make private statements conveying its “neutrality” position to both prosecution and defense these statements were meant to convey that mit took no stand on whether there should be prosecution similarly while mit was not seeking a felony charge neither was it opposing one and mit took no position on any proposed plea bargains mit maintained this neutrality position in its response to requests to make public statements or to intercede with the prosecution on behalf of aaron swartz see sections iiib1 iiib4 iiic4 iiic5 iiid1 in each case mit was willing to say that it was not advocating prosecution or jail
neutrality with regard to substance can be readily satisfied by making no statements neutrality with regard to legal procedure is more complex and the term may be interpreted in different ways by different observers16 the complexity arises substantially from the differences in legal powers of the prosecution and the defense at different stages of the investigation and prosecution see appendix 13 on the criminal process for example one can respond similarly to requests for information from prosecution and defense but in a situation where the prosecution has subpoena power and the defense does not responding similarly does not ensure similar outcomes in the information each side actually obtains ogc interpreted “neutrality” primarily in terms of similar responses to requests while mit did not conform precisely to this rule in this sense of similar responses mit—broadly speaking—did not side with the prosecution nor did it side with the defense in consequence of the differences in the powers timing and goals of the two parties in the case neutrality in responses was not consistent with neutrality in outcomes and mit was not neutral in outcomes
15 this position of neutrality would not have necessarily extended to the sentencing phase of the prosecution where mit might have been prepared to advocate on behalf of aaron swartz had he been convicted
16 such a difference in interpretation figured in robert swartz’s disagreement with mit’s chancellor and general counsel over whether mit was being “neutral” see section iiic4
part iii mit’s response to the prosecution  53
￼
in addition to adopting a position of neutrality mit limited its involvement being involved only to the extent needed to respond to prosecution and defense in accord with its neutrality position mit had not pressed for criminal charges against aaron swartz the usao had in fact not asked mit whether it wanted him to be prosecuted in the words of mit’s general counsel “mit viewed us v swartz as exactly what the case name implies a legal proceeding between the government and swartz     swartz was not an mit student alumnus or staff member mit was not a party to the case”17
limited involvement went beyond just avoiding public statements or being impartial with regard to the prosecution and the defense mit did not form an opinion about the nature of the charges against aaron swartz or the merits of the case brought against him mit first focused in august 2012 upon what the actual charges were see section iiid until the suicide of aaron swartz the mit administration treated the case as one of many issues it was addressing not as an issue of central importance similarly the mit community did little to draw the administration more deeply into the case
the ogc raised the issue of neutrality with administration and faculty personnel on several occasions each time receiving support specifically ogc advised mit’s chancellor and raised the matter at meetings with the senior administration of mit with members of the faculty policy committee and with selected faculty all indicated that they were in accord with this approach a few members of the faculty expressed the view that aaron swartz had harmed mit and a few members asked the administration to advocate for aaron swartz
viewing the initial choice of neutrality we note that this position was chosen despite the fact that aaron swartz had engaged in an activity that had inconvenienced mit both from the interruptions of jstor availability and from the efforts to limit and then end the downloading mit revisited the basic neutrality decision several times over the course of the prosecution each time considering being more supportive of aaron swartz rather than maintaining neutrality and coming to reaffirm neutrality part iv discusses some of the options that were available
there were several reasons communicated to the review panel for maintaining neutrality beyond the basic fact that aaron swartz was not formally affiliated with mit here are some of the reasons the review panel heard during our interviews with members of the ogc and the administration
17 transmittal from mit’s general counsel
part iii mit’s response to the prosecution  54
￼
• aaron swartz had used mit’s premises and network to allegedly commit crimes he had adversely affected mit’s relationship with jstor and he had seriously inconvenienced mit’s libraries mit researchers and students seeking to use jstor and mit’s ist personnel who repeatedly tried to stop his misuse of mit’s network mit felt no sense of obligation toward someone who had abused the open access privileges it had provided for the convenience of guests even if that abuse was carried out in the name of open access
• there seemed to be little interest in the case from students or faculty or the larger mit community18
• unlike jstor which wanted the return of the downloaded articles mit was not seeking anything from aaron swartz mit never filed a civil suit against him for any damages or sought restitution for the result of his actions using the mit network
• the criminal prosecution was a legal dispute between the united states and aaron swartz swartz had extremely competent defense counsel and “mit should not take any action unless swartz’s defense counsel asked us to do so     we did not presume to know what would benefit swartz’s defense”19
• mit faculty members had previously admonished the mit administration for a statement it had issued on a previous criminal matter that of star simpson and some faculty members had urged the administration not to make “public statements that characterize    the behavior and motives of members of the mit community whose actions are the subject    of pending criminal investigation”20
• while individual members of the mit community are encouraged to express their opinions on controversial topics mit itself as an institution only rarely takes a position in a lawsuit to which it is not a party “for mit to express a single opinion on behalf of the entire institution the subject must have significant bearing on mit’s institutional interests have been subject to discussion and debate within the mit community over time and have inspired the personal engagement of mit’s senior leadership     us v swartz did not fit that description”21
18 in all there were only a few approaches by faculty to ogc or the administration as described in section iiic5 and no approaches by students

20 this refers to one of the resolutions advanced during the star simpson matter it had failed on a close vote see appendix 9
21 transmittal from mit’s general counsel
part iii mit’s response to the prosecution  55
￼
• the ogc considered how its position might affect future interactions with the us attorney’s office concerning the prosecution of students and others in the mit community
• although the indictment asserted that aaron swartz intended to distribute the downloaded articles globally doing so though the internet this was not a view shared by everyone ogc commented that it did not know—and still does not know—what aaron swartz might have been planning to do with the articles and this lack of knowledge was another reason why it believed the posture of neutrality was correct
on june 6 2011 mit retained outside counsel with criminal law experience to advise and assist it in dealing with the usao and swartz’s attorneys by this time mit’s neutrality policy had been established and was not significantly affected by outside counsel but there was an additional factor concerning preserving neutrality where outside counsel did play a role mit’s outside counsel had conversations with the lead prosecutor on august 9 2012 and with swartz’s defense counsel william kettlewell on august 10 2012 both conversations confirmed the view held by ogc since at least june 2011 that mit’s opinions were unlikely to have an effect on the prosecution the august 9 conversation discussed in detail below in section iiic3 confirmed ogc’s concern that a public statement might backfire and could do harm to swartz compared with saying nothing publicly
in summary mit adopted its neutrality position soon after the arrest and maintained it basically unchanged until the fall of 2012 when the defense filed motions seeking to suppress evidence claiming illegal actions by mit mit decided that it would not be fully neutral with regard to defending anticipated possible attacks on mit’s employees or the institute’s integrity despite differences in alignment of the defense’s interests with mit’s interests mit continued some aspects of its neutrality toward prosecution and defense
iiia4 mitdiscussespossiblepublicstatementswithjstorjune2011
in the months after the arrest mit and jstor continued their discussions about the events that had led to the arrest mit’s side of this conversation was communicated mostly through the mit libraries on january 31 2011 jstor asked mit whether “we can have a conversation about the situation    which has taken on increasing importance” the reply from the libraries was “law enforcement has taken over the situation    i am strictly enjoined from discussing it with anyone other than counsel”
over the next months jstor engaged in negotiating a civil settlement with aaron swartz for the return of the materials which culminated in a settlement on june 3 2011
part iii mit’s response to the prosecution  56
as described in section iic mit was not involved in these discussions on june 8 2011 ogc informed the libraries that mit’s outside counsel had just been contacted by aaron swartz’s attorney this was william kettlewell who told the counsel that swartz had reached an agreement with jstor and asked whether mit “was looking for anything” from swartz eg restitution ogc said that mit was not seeking anything from aaron swartz and that its view was that mit should not take a position on the prosecution and should generally not comment to swartz’s attorney or to the press
also on june 8 2011 jstor notified the mit libraries that “the suspect in the case has surrendered the stolen records to the authorities” jstor felt that it had an obligation to send a letter to the publishers who provided content to reassure them that the records had been returned with no apparent harm jstor’s message to the libraries included a draft letter which did not name mit and which it was sending along for mit’s comment
the libraries reviewed the draft with ogc and the mit news office mit suggested two changes to the letter 1 that the statement should clarify that the responsible individual was not affiliated with the university where the incident occurred22 and 2 to eliminate a statement that it was the school that identified the suspect in fact it was law enforcement jstor’s final letter was released on june 10 the letter read in part23
i am writing to make you aware that jstor experienced a significant misuse of its database in which a substantial portion of the content was downloaded in an unauthorized fashion using the network at one of our participating universities the situation has been remedied and the data are secure though i wanted to alert you given the scale of the incident and to share additional steps we are taking to prevent these occurrences in the future
the content that was taken was systematically downloaded using an approach designed to avoid detection by our monitoring systems fortunately we were able to uncover the activity and worked with the institution to isolate the source on campus and to stop it an individual believed to be responsible for this activity was later identified we understand this person was not affiliated with the school
while preparing this letter jstor was also exploring possible “scenarios” for issuing a statement in the event aaron swartz was indicted one scenario was to issue a statement to academic libraries jointly with mit issued the day of the indictment on june 15 2011 jstor sent a proposed draft to mit clarifying in its transmittal email that “we are
22 as an ogc attorney commented to the libraries “if and when it comes out that this occurred at mit i don’t want people to think that this was an mit community member”
23 the complete letter is included in appendix 12
part iii mit’s response to the prosecution  57
￼
currently not planning to send out a message such as this we are trying to prepare in case we need to move quickly in various circumstances and i want to be in close communication with you to be prepared” the proposed draft gave a summary description of the downloading and it concluded
finally we believe it is important to emphasize that we have no specific interest in the criminal case announced today we have taken the steps we believed necessary to resolve the incident the current investigation is led by the united states department of justice and while we are cooperating in response to the subpoenas we have received we cannot comment on it
mit expressed concerns about the text of the letter and whether such a letter was advisable at all the libraries told jstor that “they ogc and the mit news office believe in general that the less mit says the better we can’t really discuss the details of the ongoing criminal investigation and possible indictment nor do we want to interfere with the processes and duties of the usao” and “in my opinion neither jstor nor mit should under any circumstances comment publicly on the details of the incident until the criminal justice system had completed its work and a formal determination of the facts had been made”24
this statement was never issued nor was it further discussed with mit but jstor did issue a press release on july 19 the day that the indictment naming swartz was unsealed25 see section iic mit was not notified of that statement in advance and did not issue a statement of its own26
iiib events around the time of the indictment april 2011–september 2011
at about the time of the jstor settlement the swartz defense team began to realize that getting jstor to settle would not be sufficient to “call off” or soften the prosecution early in june william kettlewell made attempts to talk to mit through its newly retained outside counsel wanting to know mit’s position on june 7 kettlewell sent an email to the outside counsel asking “what’s up on your front” outside counsel informed ogc of this inquiry and ogc responded by email explaining that “mit cooperates with law enforcement and it will do so as it concerns mr swartz however mit is not taking a position concerning whether he should be prosecuted”27
24 email from mit libraries to jstor june 15 2011 and june 16 2011 respectively
25
26 jstor told the review panel that one reason it did not give mit advance notice of its july 19
statement was its inference drawn from the june communications that mit did not want to be involved 27 ogc informed the mit libraries about the conversation as noted in section iiia4 the ogc email
to kettlewell was the first time that mit had publicly expressed that it would not take a position on the indictment
part iii mit’s response to the prosecution  58
￼
iiib1 early overtures to mit in support of aaron swartz april 2011–june 2011
prior to mid2011 the aaron swartz defense team focused its attention on persuading jstor to lobby the usao to forgo a prosecution beginning with negotiating with jstor for return of the downloaded documents see section iic mit had no involvement in this activity as early as june 6 2011 william kettlewell had spoken with mit’s outside counsel telling him that swartz had reached an agreement with jstor and asking whether mit “was looking for anything” from swartz this was taken by mit as kettlewell wanting to report back to the prosecutors that the “victims” named in the indictment were not seeking anything from swartz and were generally satisfied with his efforts to make amends
during these same weeks aaron swartz’s father robert swartz undertook to directly interact with the institute independently from his son’s lawyers robert swartz had done his undergraduate work at mit and attended mit both as a graduate student and a special student he had been a consultant at the mit media lab since 2000 he expressed frustration that the “human side of the story” was not getting through to mit and felt that he would be more productive at getting help for his son by appealing directly to mit leaders rather than working through attorneys
on june 13 robert swartz wrote to the incoming director of the media lab “the director” explaining that his son had been arrested by the mit police in january and was now under the threat of a federal indictment “i wondered if we could speak about how we could enter into a dialog with mit to help resolve this” he asked the director was new to mit and to the united states and thus his own contacts within mit and his knowledge of the american criminal justice system were limited nevertheless he made several efforts on robert swartz’s behalf to engage the institute
over the next week the director sent emails to several people at mit one sent to ogc on june 21 included
i’m not sure if youre aware of this incident but last year and into this year there was an incident where a computer was put into the basement of one of the mit buildings and was used to download the database of jstor this was investigated by the mit police and a young man named aaron swartz was arrested in january he is now on trial for a federal felony for unauthorized access to a computer system this is a prison sentence i gather   
the family have settled with jstor and returned all of the stolen materials and jstor has decided not to press charges   
part iii mit’s response to the prosecution  59
aarons brother noah is a student in the media lab and his father works for me in the ip department aaron himself works at harvard i wonder if there is any way that mit might consider this a “family matter” and consider helping to try to limit the extent of the punishment and at least prevent aaron from going to prison on a felony charge obviously it was a stupid thing to do but the weight of the possible sentence seems quite harsh in my personal opinion
apparently a grand jury is meeting to render an indictment on wednesday and there is really only one more day to provide any input into the process since it is a criminal case and the prosecutor needs to prove beyond reasonable doubt that it was unauthorized i think mit is in the position to “cast doubt” if it desires
ogc sent a short response to the director that it was generally aware of the situation with aaron swartz and in a followup phone conversation explained that mit was not pursuing criminal charges was not making a claim and had nothing to settle with swartz and that mit would possibly handle the matter differently if swartz had been an mit student no action resulted from these communications28
among robert swartz’s approaches was to try to get his son an appointment at mit so as to formally bring him in as part of the mit community however the director could not find a legitimate reason to bring him into the media lab and that approach did not succeed in generating an appointment another approach was to have mit “settle” with swartz similarly to how jstor had settled if mit thereafter would say that it suffered no harm then the prosecution’s case might be undermined this approach did not generate a settlement agreement see section iiib4
iiib2 the indictment unauthorized access
the indictment against aaron swartz was returned on july 14 2011 and unsealed on july 19 the lead prosecutor sent a copy to mit’s ogc on july 19 section iib2 footnote 29 lists the charges in detail mit was not given advance notice of the indictment or the charges nor was mit involved in formulating the charges as discussed in the next section mit was expressly named as one of two victims of aaron swartz’s conduct the other victim being jstor among the charges was that aaron swartz had violated section 18 of the united states code §1030 the computer fraud and abuse act or cfaa by “accessing the mit network without authorization” or by
28 ogc told the review panel that it had attached no particular significance to the director’s use of the phrase “unauthorized access” or considered that this might be referring to the computer fraud and abuse act nor did it consider that mit might in the director’s words be in a position to cast doubt on the charges
part iii mit’s response to the prosecution  60
￼
“exceeding authorized access” and that the damages to mit and jstor exceeded 5000 for the cfaa authorization of access to the mit network is based on the rules of access set down by mit just as authorization of access to jstor documents is based on the rules set down by jstor thus mit might be expected to play an important role in the interpretation of its access rules should there be a trial mit employees would likely be witnesses called to explain the rules moreover during the plea bargain process mit might be asked to comment on the rules and could take the opportunity to come forward with a statement about the rules
despite the importance to the legal proceedings of mit’s interpretation of its own rules the initial investigation paid little attention to how these rules applied to the authorization of people attempting to access the network according to the cambridge detective involved in the prosecution he asked repeatedly whether the laptop found in the closet was authorized to be there and to do what it was doing he was told “no” on the other hand the review panel spoke with personnel from ist and ogc and with mit’s outside counsel about their interviews and discussions with federal law enforcement during the entire period of the government’s prosecution from the date of swartz’s arrest until his suicide they reported uniformly that no one from the government’s investigatory team asked specifically whether swartz—the person as opposed to his laptop—was allowed to use mit’s network nor were they specifically asked whether this use constituted access without authorization or access that exceeded authorization this distinction between the person and the laptop and its significance for the cfaa is discussed in appendix 11 similarly until very late 2012 aaron swartz’s defense team did not raise any questions about this issue in their interviews with mit personnel or their discussions with ogc or with mit’s outside counsel nor did swartz’s defense raise this issue with mit prior to filing its motions to suppress see section iib2 which referenced the allegations of unauthorized access and mit’s policies with regard to those allegations
consistent with its neutrality posture see section iiia3 mit paid little attention to the details of the charges mit did not undertake its own analysis of whether the crime of gaining unauthorized access or exceeding authorized access of mit’s network had occurred29 nor did it bring to the attention of the usao or the defense the possibility that mit’s policies and practices cast doubt on this allegation in the indictment as the media lab director had noted that mit could consider doing see section iiib130
29 advising mit on the appropriateness of the prosecution’s conduct during the criminal case was within the scope of mit’s outside counsel’s function both ogc and outside counsel agree on this
30 this is in contrast to the case of united states v lamacchia a prosecution brought in 1994 by the same usao against an mit student where mit informed the usao during the preindictment investigation that david lamacchia’s use of the mit network was not unauthorized which led the usao
part iii mit’s response to the prosecution  61
￼
iiib3 mit as “victim”
mit was named in the indictment as a victim of aaron swartz’s alleged crime see appendix 13 on legal procedure consistent with the naming in the indictment the usao notified mit that it was a victim in 11 routine emails sent in late 2011 and throughout 201231
as a victim mit had standing to state a position about the prosecution and sentencing of swartz which was discussed within ogc and with outside counsel mit recognized that aaron swartz had harmed the institute with his downloading despite that with mit’s stance of neutrality this concept of “mit as victim” meant little to mit the institute simply did not view itself as a victim in anything other than the most technical sense32 indeed as noted in section iiia2 above and section iiib3 below mit had conveyed to the usao its lack of interest in prosecution neutrality well before the arrival of the first victim letter in december 2011 it placed no significance on getting the routine victim notification emails it sought nothing directly from aaron swartz and it did not initiate a civil suit
mit whether as a “victim” or otherwise hoped to avoid the expenditure of time and resources that it would incur if a trial took place and it wanted to protect its employees from having to testify and thus be exposed to crossexaminations designed to challenge their credibility for the purpose of advancing the interests of the defense thus it would be advantageous to mit if the parties achieved a resolution that would avoid trial although mit did not express a view on what that resolution should be mit explained to the lead prosecutor that it was not interested in the prosecution conversely mit sought to make clear to the defense that they should not anticipate that it would lobby the prosecution on behalf of aaron swartz
iiib4 robert swartz meets with mit’s chancellor september 2011
after the indictment robert swartz continued his efforts to persuade mit to influence the prosecution his primary thrust was to arrange a meeting with someone in mit’s senior administration in order to achieve a jstortype civil settlement with mit that
to pursue other charges but not to pursue a charge of unauthorized access appendix 9 provides details of the case as lamacchia was a student and swartz was a “guest” analysis of the rules for access would differ between the two cases

31 mit received routine victim notification statements from the department of justice by email on the following dates december 27 2011 january 23 2012 march 20 2012 april 30 2012 may 29 2012 august 13 2012 august 20 2012 september 21 2012 december 5 2012 december 17 2012 december 21 2012 these statements notified mit about scheduled status conferences and other court hearings
32 notably at least one seniorlevel person within mit libraries felt that swartz’s conduct had seriously interfered with the libraries’ operations

could then be used to lobby the usao on his son’s behalf he first asked for such a meeting on august 20 2011
a meeting was arranged between robert swartz and mit’s chancellor for september 14 2011 robert swartz met with the chancellor who was accompanied by an attorney from ogc33 during the meeting the chancellor told robert swartz that mit was not pressing charges that it was being neutral that the usao was prosecuting aaron swartz and that mit was providing information as required by the legal process34
robert swartz wanted mit to help his son to that end he proposed that mit make a “settlement” with his son similar to that with jstor for the defense to use to try to influence the usao however unlike jstor which wanted the download secured mit did not want anything from aaron swartz and had no intention of filing any lawsuit against him and saw no point in a settlement
the meeting was extremely disappointing to robert swartz it seemed to him that mit was not only denying his request it was denying the very basis of the help he was seeking in a manner that seemed to afford no way forward given his background at mit this seemed to him a shocking failure of compassion at one point in the meeting he reportedly asked “why are you destroying my son” the chancellor replied that this was not mit’s intention or desire
robert swartz also disputed the assertion that mit was acting in a neutral manner asserting that the defense could not get any assistance from mit particularly access to persons documents or answers to questions about the network or logs35 robert swartz

33 there is some confusion and dispute regarding why mit’s chancellor had an attorney present while robert swartz did not the chancellor wanted this particular ogc attorney present because this attorney had been actively involved in the oversight of the matter for mit the chancellor informed robert swartz of this when arranging the meeting and suggested that he “also invite a legal representative so we are on equal footing” when the meeting was scheduled by the chancellor’s assistant robert swartz responded “i have confirmed this with bill kettlewell aaron’s attorney and look forward to the meeting” as the meeting approached mit learned that kettlewell did not want to participate because he thought that the meeting would accomplish more if it occurred among principals rather than with attorneys present on september 12 the ogc attorney spoke with kettlewell and received express permission for him—an attorney—to participate in the meeting and speak directly with robert swartz despite robert swartz not being represented by counsel during the meeting at this time ogc was unclear whether kettlewell represented robert swartz or aaron swartz the rules of professional responsibility place significant restrictions on attorneys communicating with nonrepresented persons or persons who are represented by counsel when such counsel are not present

34 during this conversation the ogc attorney said that mit had not turned over anything to the government without a subpoena in fact this was not true as the attorney offered during his interviews with the review panel mit had turned over material prior to subpoena as explained in section ib given the time that had elapsed the attorney had not remembered the material produced during this period
35 at this point in time swartz’s defense counsel had not requested from mit any documents or interviews either informally or by subpoena also at this point in the prosecution the defense did not have the ability to issue a rule 17c subpoena whereas mit had produced and continued to produce
part iii mit’s response to the prosecution  63
￼
also accused mit of breaking its own rules and breaking the law by turning over various items to the government in violation of the rights of his son
the meeting did not change mit’s policies with regard to the swartz prosecution shortly thereafter due to a lifethreatening illness experienced by his wife aaron’s mother robert swartz was forced to curtail some of his lobbying efforts on behalf of his son
iiic mit’s contacts with prosecution and defense october 2011–september 2012
little happened from mit’s perspective in the months following september 2011 there were few communications between the prosecution and mit after the indictment except for occasional emails from the government seeking bits and pieces of information relevant to the government’s case36 mit’s outside counsel had no communications at all with the usao throughout 2011 with the exception of five routine victim status notifications sent between december 27 2011 and may 29 2012 there were no prosecution communications with ogc or its outside counsel after oct 5 2011 until they resumed with a phone call on august 9 2012 see section iiic3
contact with the defense was also limited william kettlewell made several phone calls to mit’s outside counsel during september 2011 both before and after mit’s meeting with robert swartz in september 201137 kettlewell also forwarded to mit’s outside counsel a copy of the jstor agreement that aaron swartz had signed andrew good withdrew as aaron swartz’s attorney in late october and was replaced by martin weinberg robert swartz was dealing with his wife’s illness for all practical purposes communications between swartz’s defense team and mit remained dormant until the spring of 2012
iiic1 responses to defense inquiries are slow may 2012–august 2012
in late april 2012 and then again in may william kettlewell and martin weinberg met with mit’s outside counsel seeking to enlist mit’s support in lobbying the usao to
documents and information to the government pursuant to the preindictment grand jury subpoenas with which it had been served see appendix 10
according to an email that william kettlewell sent to robert swartz before the meeting ogc had told kettlewell that mit “would feel bound to inform the lead prosecutor that they were meeting with us as well as what transpired at the meeting” when questioned about kettlewell’s email ogc explained that it did not in fact discuss the substance of this meeting with the prosecution
36 this information was provided by mit under what it believed to be the umbrella of the two previously served grand jury subpoenas mit’s outside counsel was not involved in these communications
37 some of these concerned a draft protective order then being considered by the usao and the defense to protect the confidentially of mit’s documents and the privacy of its employees during the discovery phase of the prosecution
part iii mit’s response to the prosecution  64
￼
drop its demand for jail time they also suggested that the packet stream capture see section ib item 4 might have been a privacy violation they asked that mit make a decision to take a position favorable to the defense with the usao concerning the prosecution and they asked for a meeting with mit to discuss this
the defense attorneys did not get a timely response to these requests kettlewell called and spoke with mit’s outside counsel five times during may seeking a meeting with mit in each of june and july he called twice in august he called four times and in september he called once more before finally obtaining a confirmatory email for such a meeting from mit’s outside counsel robert swartz and defense counsel for aaron swartz were uniform in their complaints to the review panel that mit failed to respond in a timely manner although varying in where they placed the blame among mit’s ogc its administration andor its outside counsel
for its part mit points to a variety of reasons why its responses were slow without denying that they were in fact slow some explanations are mundane during the period in question activities such as commencement corporation board meetings and vacations for senior officials took place also there is some uncertainty as to how many of kettlewell’s individual telephone calls to mit’s outside counsel were passed on to the ogc although the thrust of kettlewell’s continuing desire for a response was definitely transmitted ogc knew that it needed to get back to the defense in spring and mid summer 2012 but it wanted to get some information first on the status of the case most important ogc’s attorneys felt that they did not know what swartz’s defense team wanted from their perspective mit had already made clear that the institute would remain neutral they did not realize that the defense team was seeking a meeting about a specific proposal as opposed to continuing general discussions regarding aaron swartz perhaps in the hope that mit’s position might change
martin weinberg has provided for the review panel in writing his description of what the defense team sought from mit
for over 6 months bill kettlewell and myself had engaged in a joint effort which bill had begun in june of 2011 through telephone conversations with an attorney in ogc and a meeting between bob swartz the chancellor and the ogc attorney the joint initiative that i participated in with bill began in april of 2012 and included meetings and telephone conversations with mit’s outside counsel followed by a meeting with mit’s outside counsel the chancellor and mit’s general counsel the single focus of our initiative was to actively seek mits affirmative assistance in supporting a plea initiative with the usao that would resolve aaron’s federal case without a trial and without evidentiary hearings on contested pretrial issues involving the warrantless

interceptions of electronic communications and which would spare aaron the risk of a prison sentence
iiic2 robert swartz writes to mit’s president
towards the end of july 2012 robert swartz again contacted the media lab director asking him to help arrange a meeting with mit’s senior administration the director asked swartz to draft a letter which he then forwarded to mit’s president38 chancellor and general counsel the director forwarded the letter on august 10 under the following cover
i’m not sure if you’ve been tracking aaron’s case but this is an email from his father who works for us parttime at the media lab as an ip consultant would someone at mit be willing to meet with him i think you’ve met with him once in the past near the beginning of this process
robert swartz’s letter follows
as you know my son aaron is under federal indictment for alleged acts that occurred at mit although he settled with jstor the aggrieved party and they indicated that they did not want the prosecution to go forward the case has not been resolved we think there are both legal and nonlegal issues that you are not aware of and urgently ask for a meeting with mit’s executive vice president and mit’s president
it is the nonlegal issues in the context of the mit community and a possible trial that most urgently need to be considered in the meeting the urgency of the meeting is due to fact that the prosecutor has given us a deadline of wednesday to resolve the case or go to trial and we have a meeting monday with the head of the criminal division that requires hard decisions
i am willing to meet at any time even over the weekend please let me know the earliest time that we can meet
thanks in advance for all of your help
the president forwarded this letter to the provost the chancellor and the general counsel with a note saying that that they should contact him the president if necessary
on august 12 2012 the director informed robert swartz that he had heard from the chancellor and “they are now reaching out to you” this eventually resulted in swartz’s

second meeting with the chancellor on september 12 described below see section iiic4
iiic3 mit’s outside counsel speaks with the lead prosecutor august 9 2012
ogc knew that it needed to get back to the defense in spring and midsummer 2012 but it wanted to get some information first on the status of the case it also wanted to “deliver a message” to the usao that it was not advocating a jail sentence ogc asked its outside counsel to speak with the usao
on august 9 2012 mit’s outside counsel had a 45minute telephone conversation with the lead prosecutor they covered the following points39
• the prosecutor praised mit’s conduct before and after aaron swartz’s arrest he described mit’s approach in tracking down swartz and intercepting his communications as “reasoned” and “nowhere near cowboy conduct” and said that he had “the deepest of respect for their approach to the case”
• the prosecutor expected weinberg to file motions challenging the government’s and mit’s collection of electronic evidence he expected that hearings would be held and numerous mit witnesses some six to 10 would have to testify
• the prosecutor said that the government had been extremely reasonable in this case and has made its best offer the government believed that jail time was appropriate if this case had involved solely hacking into mit’s system the government might feel differently but the case also involves the unauthorized downloading of intellectual property that cost millions of dollars to create
• the government was willing to agree to a “very strong downward departure” from the sentencing guidelines but there were some lines below which the usao would not go
• mit’s counsel noted that no one at the institute was looking forward to the time disruption and stress involved in testifying at hearings and trial the prosecutor’s response was that it disturbed him whenever a defendant “systematically re victimized” the victim and that was what swartz was doing by dragging mit through hearings and a trial he analogized attacking mit’s conduct in the case to attacking a rape victim based on sleeping with other men
39 this material is taken from a memorandum provided by mit’s outside counsel to ogc dated august 10 2012 where phrases appear in quotes in this material the same phrases appear also in quotes in the memorandum
part iii mit’s response to the prosecution  67
￼
• mit’s counsel stated that while the government might believe that jail time was appropriate in this case the government should not be under the impression that mit wanted a jail sentence for aaron swartz the prosecutor responded that the government believed that some custody was appropriate he said the government had to consider not only the views of the immediate victims but also general deterrence of others
• mit’s counsel mentioned that mit viewed itself as an educational institution and that consistent with its overall mission it did not focus on punishment or retribution but rather education
• mit did not want to act as an intermediary between the parties
• the prosecutor said that preindictment he had wanted to approach the case on a human level not punitively to this extent he made an extremely reasonable proposal and was “dumbfounded” by swartz’s response
• the prosecutor said that the straw that broke the camel’s back was that when he indicted the case and allowed swartz to come to the courthouse as opposed to being arrested swartz used the time to post a “wild internet campaign” in an effort to drum up support this was a “foolish” move that moved the case “from a human oneonone level to an institutional level” the lead prosecutor said that on the institutional level cases are harder to manage both internally and externally40
this conversation supported the following conclusions consistent with ogc’s earlier views
first the lead prosecutor and the usao did not care what mit thought or said about the case and its ability to influence a resolution was slim to none
second the lead prosecutor’s comment about a “wild internet campaign” orchestrated by swartz to drum up support made mit concerned that any public statements that mit might make on swartz’s behalf could backfire
third it might be in aaron swartz’s interests to accept the government’s offer now before it became worse and ogc should make it clear to swartz’s attorneys that mit was remaining neutral ie that it would not advocate in his favor so as

40 the only internet campaign occurring during this period that has been identified by the review panel is the statement and petition drive conducted by demand progress referenced in section iib2 as noted there the statement was codrafted by the director of demand progress and quinn norton we do not know what the lead prosecutor meant by “institutionalizing” a prosecution and we do not comment on the implications of doing so based upon a public lobbying effort undertaken by or on behalf of a criminal defendant

to not mislead the defense into delay that might result in a less favorable plea offer being available at a later date
iiic4 robert swartz meets again with mit september 2012
on september 12 2012 robert swartz had another meeting at mit with mit’s chancellor and its general counsel robert swartz made four points
first he wanted mit to make a public statement this the chancellor and general counsel explained mit would not do although they did not explain about the outside counsel’s august 9 meeting with the lead prosecutor see section iiic3 or the conclusions mit drew from it41
second robert swartz connected the matter of his son to that of star simpson42 arguing that the star simpson matter was a precedent that would allow mit to make a statement the chancellor and the general counsel took a different view explaining that after mit had made those statements its administration had been justly reprimanded
third he argued that mit was assisting the government more than it was assisting his son the general counsel reiterated that mit’s policy was “neutrality” mr swartz disputed whether that was in fact the case citing among other examples that mit had turned material over to the secret service without subpoena43
fourth robert swartz claimed that in the past mit’s policy had been to turn off troublesome email connections rather than to call in the police the general counsel explained that mit had tried to terminate aaron’s access to mit’s network several times but he had managed to evade these attempts
robert swartz also accused mit of violating wiretap laws and its internal policies in its collection of electronic communications of his son and providing them to the prosecution and of violating his son’s privacy rights in doing so
41 as a general matter for a third party to convey information from one party to a lawsuit to the opposing party without permission would be very likely to cut off the flow of information if that conveyance of information were to be perceived
42 see appendix 9 for a discussion of the star simpson matter

43 mit did turn over material without subpoena in the first few days after the arrest see section ib and appendix 7 appendix 10 gives the review panel’s perspective on the legality of mit’s provision of this information after january 27 2011 there was no document provision to the prosecution without a subpoena but even had the material been turned over pursuant to subpoena it is likely there would have been disagreement about whether mit had acted “neutrally” as noted in section iiia3 ogc interpreted neutrality of legal process in terms of similar responses to similar requests rather than similar outcomes
part iii mit’s response to the prosecution  69
￼
overall the meeting produced the same result as the september 2011 meeting see section iiib4
iiic5 other contacts on behalf of aaron swartz
as discussed above and below aaron swartz’s father and defense team approached mit several times to ask that mit move away from its neutrality stance and advocate for aaron swartz as discussed in section iiib1 the mit media lab incoming director did so on june 21 2011 as part of supporting a request that mit meet with robert swartz “i wonder if there is any way that mit might consider this a ‘family matter’ and consider helping to try to limit the extent of the punishment and at least prevent aaron from going to prison on a felony charge obviously it was a stupid thing to do but the weight of the possible sentence seems quite harsh in my personal opinion”
otherwise there were very few direct contacts made with the mit administration to encourage a change on the part of mit from neutrality to advocacy mit’s student newspaper the tech reported regularly on the progress of the case but this did not prompt any editorials or opinion pieces before aaron swartz’s suicide nor did people who later criticized mit for not advocating for aaron swartz approach the mit administration making the case for mit to advocate for him before the suicide
the review panel is aware of only three further contacts requesting advocacy for aaron swartz one senior faculty member who had worked with aaron swartz tried to solicit mit’s support on swartz’s behalf from the last week in august through midseptember 2012 he met separately with mit’s chancellor provost general counsel and another ogc attorney he advocated for active mit support for aaron swartz raising several possible options including making a public statement of the kind jstor had made44 he told the review panel that he had sought support because he believed that an incredible miscarriage of justice was in the works that while aaron swartz was a tireless fighter for right he was also vulnerable that a felony could affect aaron swartz’s career that he liked and respected aaron swartz in many ways and that the law was being seriously abused he told the review panel that aaron swartz’s action was the sort of thing that historically would have prompted a certain pride not criticism at mit

44 there are differing recollections as to whether any of the discussions included phoning the prosecutor in support of aaron swartz according to the recollection of the faculty member his meeting with ogc included the suggestion that mit phone the prosecutor to say that mit would prefer them to drop the charge or that mit did not have any issue with aaron ogc reports that the overwhelming focus of this meeting was on a public statement and does not recall any mention of a private statement the faculty member later told the review panel that he left these meetings with the impression that mit would not make a public statement but that ogc would phone the prosecutor
part iii mit’s response to the prosecution  70
￼
the meetings with this faculty member did not result in a movement to advocacy mit’s responses included multiple reasons for supporting neutrality see section iiia3 for a full list of reasons the review panel heard ogc and other senior mit administrators said that they felt mit should not take any action on aaron swartz’s behalf unless swartz’s defense counsel asked it to do so members of the administration and ogc with whom this faculty member spoke did not tell him about the recent conversation between mit’s outside counsel and the lead prosecutor the outcome of that conversation supported ogc’s belief that making any statement to the usao would likely not help and making a public statement could actually harm aaron swartz’s defense45
in october 2012 a faculty member who was active in mit’s open access activities spoke with robert swartz and later contacted the director of libraries an ogc attorney and the chancellor asking if mit could do more for aaron swartz he told the review panel that his main contention was just that the response of the prosecutor was utterly disproportionate and mit should do whatever it could46
while the faculty members were reminded that they were free to make public statements or private statements to the prosecutors they did not do so
considerably earlier on november 13 2011 a leader in the global movement for open access to scientific publications not affiliated with mit emailed mit’s then president on behalf of aaron swartz whom he had known well for some time he wrote
i know that the case is in the hands of the public prosecutors that mit is not in the position—even if it wanted to—to halt the fearful procedure    for a person like aaron swartz time in prison would surely be fateful unbearable in the worst case deadly
i do not know the american legal system well enough but i think that the stand of your university—which has done so much with its open courseware for advancing access to the finest academic works—would have an impact on the outcome of the legal process a term in prison

45 the private statement mit had made to the lead prosecutor was similar to jstor’s pubic statement jstor wrote “once this returning the documents was achieved we had no interest in this becoming an ongoing legal matter” see  mit’s outside counsel did inform the lead prosecutor that mit as an educational institution did not focus on punishment for aaron swartz and that the government should not be under the impression that mit wanted a jail sentence for him see section iiic3 but note that jstor’s private statement to the usao was stronger and not neutral not only was jstor not pressing for prosecution it preferred that no charges be brought see section iic

46 another approach to the administration was by the lead author of this report who phoned an ogc attorney in april 2011 to ask if ogc was handling the case without advocating any particular action for mit robert swartz also spoke with this report’s lead author in august 2012 and told him of the defense’s contention that mit had violated the stored communications act as later alleged by martin weinberg see section iiid2 and the report’s lead author advised ogc of this

would not only deeply and perhaps irrecoverably harm aaron swartz but would be irrational compared to the possible public benefit of community work that aaron swartz would be capable of doing by using his unique and brilliant technical skills and surprising knowledge
in the hope of your understanding and with thanks for having read my letter”47
the president referred the email to the chancellor who consulted ogc and wrote back “thank you for expressing your concern about aarons future and sharing your perspective which we will certainly take into account” in response was written “thank you for your frank response despite the complexities of the situation allow me to hope that your university will try to make use of all available means and fora not to ruin the life of this extremely talented vulnerable naive and incautious unique young man”
iiid events in anticipation of trial august 2012–october 2012
toward the end of august 2012 the usao began asking for mit employees to be made available for witness interviews and preparation mit’s general counsel informed the senior administration at the end of august that there would likely be a trial and reminded them of mit’s neutrality position at the president’s request the general counsel consulted with selected faculty members including the chair of the faculty about whether a discussion of the swartz matter at mit’s faculty policy council might be appropriate the faculty chair consulted with the associate chair and the secretary of the faculty and they told the general counsel that such a discussion would not be necessary and that there was general support for mit’s neutrality posture
with talk of witness preparation it became clear that the swartz matter was probably not going to be resolved without a trial and that it would require a significant amount of time from some mit personnel this prompted ogc to make an inquiry into the government’s theory of the criminal prosecution in late august 2012 ogc asked mit’s outside counsel to brief them on laws alleged to have been violated and the facts pertaining specifically to mit upon which the criminal aspect of the swartz’s conduct might turn and outside counsel conducted what he characterized as a “thumbnail analysis” of the indictment
discussions among mit lawyers included recognizing that the government had the burden of proof in the prosecution and therefore would want to interview more personnel
47 the letter also reported that aaron swartz had attended a meeting that included a discussion of how much it would cost to get jstor to open up its archive for the public and how that exceeded the funds available to the group at the meeting he wrote “my fear is that our conversation at that meeting played a role in aaron swartz’s unfortunate decision”
part iii mit’s response to the prosecution  72
￼
than would the defense nonetheless ogc’s view here was that mit should give the defense some of the same assistance as was given to the government making witnesses available and recommending personnel who could educate the defense attorneys as to mit’s networks and its library policies and practices the guiding policy was to accommodate “reasonable requests” by the defense taking into account such things as where the interviews would take place and how long they would take
in midseptember the lead prosecutor asked to interview 11 mit employees who were made available both mit’s outside counsel and an ogc attorney were present for the interviews
on september 12 2012 the usao obtained a superseding indictment described in section iib2 mit’s ogc perceived this as an escalation by the usao in the prosecution it served to reinforce the view already well developed as a result of the august 9 conversation between mit’s outside counsel and the lead prosecutor see section iiic3 that mit had no influence over the usao in the matter
iiid1 thedefenseasksmittoopposejailtimeseptember2012–october2012
aaron swartz’s defense team met with mit on september 28 2012 present on behalf of swartz were martin weinberg and william kettlewell mit’s representatives were mit’s chancellor its general counsel and its outside counsel weinberg asked if mit representatives would accompany the defense to a meeting with the federal prosecutors and support their plea for no jail time as a condition of any guilty plea by swartz mit’s representatives responded that they would consider this
after this meeting ogc and mit’s outside counsel had several concerns about the defense’s request that they join a meeting with the federal prosecutors they discussed who should go and whether any faculty should be among those attending if such a meeting occurred there was serious concern that given mits neutrality position whatever mit was prepared to contribute would be of no value to aaron swartz and there was skepticism about whether the lead prosecutor would be interested in hearing mit’s position he had already made it clear that he would not be influenced by it weinberg told the review panel that he in fact agreed with this assessment of the lead prosecutor’s stance but his plan was not to hold the meeting with just the lead prosecutor or with other higherranking assistant us attorneys but instead to meet with the us attorney herself48
48 weinberg told the review panel that he informed mit of this plan but neither the two ogc attorneys who were involved nor the chancellor recall him explaining this
part iii mit’s response to the prosecution  73
￼
ultimately mit decided that it would be willing to participate in such a meeting the decision was made that the chancellor and the general counsel would attend the meeting and no other faculty would accompany them it was decided that mit would maintain the position of neutrality at such a meeting
mit’s outside counsel informed weinberg that mit representatives would be willing to attend a meeting at the usao if he weinberg arranged it and that mit would make the following points49
1 mit is not seeking any particular outcome such as aaron swartz’s conviction or if convicted that he receive any particular sentence
2 members of the mit community knew and admired aaron swartz and would consider it a great loss if he were deprived of the opportunity to continue his work
3 if asked by the usao the chancellor and general council would have to admit that some members of the mit community held views critical of aaron swartz’s conduct
this was communicated to weinberg on october 26 when it was received the defense team felt that mit’s stance would be of no value in advocating with the us attorney and decided not to go forward with such a meeting elliot peters who had replaced weinberg as swartz’s lead defense counsel at the end of october informed mit’s outside counsel of this decision in early november
iiid2 the defense moves to suppress evidence october 2012
at the time of the september 28 meeting the swartz legal team was facing an october 5 deadline for the filing of motions to dismiss and to suppress evidence during the meeting weinberg explained that he would soon have to file those motions and they would accuse mit of violating federal law the constitutional rights of aaron swartz and mit’s own internal policies as those policies would affect the privacy of swartz and they would accuse mit of acting in concert with federal law enforcement in furtherance of these violations
the review panel found that the views of those who attended this meeting differ on the nature of weinberg’s description of these motions some saw it as a threat that mit would be embarrassed if the case went to trial and so mit should act to resolve things in aaron swartz’s favor others saw it as a matteroffact discussion of what the legal defense had to do in order to zealously represent its client as required by the rules of

professional responsibility for attorneys50 ultimately ogc decided to ignore the possibility that weinberg might have wanted to pressure mit with his presentation and instead focus on what to do about the request to meet with the us attorney’s prosecutors
on october 5 martin weinberg filed six motions a motion to dismiss the indictment and five motions to suppress evidence that the government might otherwise use at trial these are the motions that mr weinberg described in his september 28 meeting at mit and to which robert swartz had referred during his september 12 meeting at mit section iiic4 four of these motions numbers 1 2 3 and 5 directly addressed conduct of mit and its employees51
motion to suppress no 1 motion to suppress all fruits of interceptions and
disclosures of electronic communications and other information by mit
personnel in violation of the fourth amendment and the stored communications act52
motion to suppress no 2 motion to suppress all fruits of warrantless searches conducted from january 4 2011 to january 6 201153
motion to suppress no 3 motion to suppress all fruits of unlawful arrests without probable cause and search of hp usb drive54
motion to suppress no 5 motion to suppress all fruits of searches of acer laptop hp usb drive and western digital hard drive55
taken together these motions accused mit and its employees of violating the fourth amendment rights of aaron swartz the electronic communications privacy act the stored communications act and mit’s internal policies as they applied to swartz’s expectations of privacy56

50 in the criminal context particularly it is appropriate to warn a third party of what is coming when what is coming is considered by all to be “unpleasant” but must be done to advance the cause of one’s client and where the continued cooperation of the third party is desired despite the filing or other conduct from the perspective of a defense counsel the purpose of this discussion was to put mit on notice as to what was coming so as to not surprise or unnecessarily offend mit

iiid3 effectofthesuppressionmotionsoctober2012–december2012
with the admissibility of the evidence against aaron swartz in dispute the suppression motions had the effect of aligning mit’s interests more with the prosecution than with the defense the government wanted to establish that mit’s conduct was entirely lawful and proper so as to defeat the various motions to suppress the defense wanted to show otherwise and thus achieve the suppression of evidence that the government had obtained from or through mit similarly the government would advance the conduct integrity and credibility of those mit employees who testified while it appeared to ogc that the defense would do the opposite attacking mit personnel in open court mit decided that it would not be neutral with regard to defending mit’s employees or attacks made on the institute’s integrity
that concern played out in the months that followed for example when the government’s investigation had begun in january 2011 ogc made the decision that the lead prosecutor the secret service agent and the cambridge police detective could directly telephone and email previously interviewed ist employees without first going through an mit attorney for followup questions provided no new topics were covered see section iiia1 in early september 2012 after consultation with outside counsel ogc decided to allow this direct conduct to continue during the government’s preparation for the suppression hearings and trial however this did not occur for the defense the defense was never given permission to interview or consult with any mit employee without the presence of an mit attorney nor did it ever ask for such permission
another example is that mit’s outside counsel conveyed to the government what mit wanted the government to consider in its arguments that mit had not violated law in gathering evidence
a third example concerns document production when mit provided documents in december 2012 to the defense pursuant to subpoena mit’s outside counsel later provided—without being asked—the same documents to the government this occurred in early january 2013 however mit did not reciprocally voluntarily provide to the defense the same documents that it provided to the government similarly mit did not produce to the defense even though requested by subpoena documents that the defense sought from mit but that mit had already provided to the government the explanation for this as offered by mit’s outside counsel is that under the local rules57 for the
57 all federal district courts are bound by the federal rules of criminal procedure in criminal matters and by the federal rules of civil procedure in civil matters although detailed these rules might be considered “broad brush” rules each district court in the nation also adopts its own local rules which may

united states district court for the district of massachusetts a defendant is entitled to obtain from the prosecution broad categories of documents in criminal discovery58 thus mit’s outside counsel operated under the assumption that if the government obtained discovery from mit then the defense could get it from the government and counsel did not want mit to engage in duplication of effort regarding document production
ogc’s explanation for not providing these documents is similar in that it did not want to engage in a duplication of effort but adds that ogc was always willing to produce to the defense documents already provided to the government if for whatever reason the government would not produce them to the defense as discussed above on may 6 2011 ogc spoke with the lead prosecutor see section iiia2 and during this conversation the prosecutor asked for copies in electronic format of the documents that had already been provided by mit the prosecutor explained this request by saying that he wanted these documents in such format in anticipation of providing them to the defense for this reason ogc operated under the assumption that whatever documents it had given to the government had been turned over to the defense59 as discussed below this was apparently not the case see section iiid4 ogc notes that as of january 10 2013 the day before aaron swartz took his life mit was in ongoing discussions with swartz’s defense counsel on this very topic
iiid4 finalweeksdecember2012–january2013
elliot peters replaced martin weinberg as counsel for aaron swartz at the end of october 2012 with this change william kettlewell’s involvement in the case essentially came to an end with the change in counsel the focus of the defense shifted somewhat from seeking to establish that mit’s conduct was in violation of law or policy to placing more emphasis on the specific allegation in the superseding indictment that swartz had accessed mit’s and jstor’s networks without authorization in the view of the defense mit’s policy of open access to its network provided a weak basis for charging violations of the computer fraud and abuse act
address gaps appearing in the federal rules or may expand or reduce the applicability of specific federal rules to the extent doing so is permitted
58 the applicable local rules of the district of massachusetts are lr 1161 and 1162 as an example lr 1161a1 provides
in all felony cases    unless a defendant waives automatic discovery    all discoverable material and information in the possession custody or control of the government and the defendant the existence of which is known or by the exercise of due diligence may become known to the attorneys for those parties must be disclosed to the opposing party without formal motion practice at the times and under the automatic procedures specified in these local rules
59 also the negotiations surrounding the protective order concerning documents produced to the defense which occurred in september 2011 led ogc to understand that all of the documents it produced to the government would be turned over to the defense
part iii mit’s response to the prosecution  77
￼
this shift in emphasis was noted by mit’s outside counsel
in december the lead prosecutor asked to “prep” mit witnesses for the suppression hearings he began to inquire about mit’s trespass signs posted on its campus and he asked “to be followed with a subpoena” for all material pertaining to “the swartz intrusion and data theft” prepared since mit’s last production of such information he notified mit’s outside counsel that the suppression hearings would be held on january 25 2013 and would include the following issues 1 the delay on the part of the government in obtaining search warrants 2 whether swartz was trespassing on the mit campus and 3 whether swartz had abandoned his computer on mit property he also indicated that he was concerned with the mit “open campus” concept and would issue a new subpoena for all pertinent policies and practices
when elliot peters entered the case discussions had been ongoing with mit concerning a meeting with the usao he learned from mit’s outside counsel that mit would be essentially neutral and he did not think that this would help thus he decided against having such a meeting as had martin weinberg
at this point the focus by the defense was to deal some setbacks to the prosecution at the suppression hearing scheduled for late january 2013 it believed that only after suffering such setbacks would the government be willing to be more lenient in its plea offers60 thus the defense plan during this period did not include trying to get mit to support or lobby for aaron swartz with the usao
mr peters says he held several discussions with mit’s outside counsel about 1 interviewing mit personnel to which he got no response and 2 getting documents to which he was told that he should get them from the government on november 23 2012 the defense subpoenaed mit for production of documents the scope of the subpoena as drafted by the defense was extremely broad they wanted to use its scope as leverage to obtain discovery from mit61

60 mr peters confirms mr weinberg’s description of the latter plea offers made by the prosecution to aaron swartz 1 he would have to plead guilty to all 13 felonies 2 he would have to agree to four months incarceration or 3 the government would be free to seek up to six months incarceration and the defense would be free to seek no jail time in addition aaron swartz would not be allowed to use a computer for some period of time after his conviction this latter condition was a problem for aaron swartz when considering the offer according to mr peters he advised the lead prosecutor that aaron swartz was “vulnerable” that this was a reason to resolve the matter without a trial and that he couldn’t see aaron swartz in federal prison
61 as explained by mr peters he disagreed with the view that the federal rules governing the production of discovery by the government to the defense in a criminal case meant that all documents produced by a third party to the government would subsequently be turned over by the government to the defense rather in his opinion the government would turn over only some of these materials
part iii mit’s response to the prosecution  78
￼
we noted above see section iiid that ogc had formed the view early in the fall that mit should give the defense some of the same assistance as was given to the government including making witnesses available and recommending personnel who could educate the defense attorneys as to mit’s networks and its library policies and practices the guiding policy was to accommodate “reasonable requests” by the defense taking into account such things as where the interviews would take place and how long they would take as explained by mr peters after this subpoena was served mit’s outside counsel and the defense negotiated a more limited document production plus the making available of two mit employees one from ist and one from mit libraries
the interviews of these two mit witnesses took place on december 11 2012 they were conducted by one of aaron swartz’s defense attorneys and an expert in network operations the defense found the witnesses to be very cooperative and helpful on the issue of what comprised authorized access at mit62 at the request of the defense the identity of the expert was kept confidential from the government63
mit’s initial response to the defense subpoena of november 23 2012 was made on december 21 mit’s initial response excluded material that it had already produced to the government due to the timeconsuming and burdensome nature of document production and mit’s expectation that the defense had or could receive from the prosecution everything that mit had provided to them
an email sent on january 9 2013 from a defense attorney to mit’s outside counsel indicates that there remained open questions about the scope and adequacy of mit’s response to the subpoena this email was forwarded to ogc included among the topics discussed is the defense’s request that mit provide all materials called for in the subpoena that it had previously provided to the government ogc has explained to the review panel that it was willing to provide any such documents that the defense had not obtained from the prosecution
these discussions were still under way when robert swartz notified mit by email on january 11 2013 that aaron swartz had taken his own life

62 mr peters confirmed that the defense—similar to the prosecution—did not focus on the specific question of whether mr swartz’s access to the mit network was or was not authorized the decision to not address this question directly was a result of the defense’s perception that the prosecution’s theory—as to why aaron swartz’s access to the network was unauthorized—was scattershot ranging from aaron swartz’s changing his computer names to his opening of locked doors thus a direct answer to this question even if favorable to the defense would be unlikely to change the prosecution’s determination to continue with the case
63 the witness later revealed his identity and wrote about his findings see alex stamos the truth about aaron swartz’s “crime” january 13 2013

decision points for mit
our charge in preparing this report is to “describe the options mit had and the decisions mit made in order to understand and to learn from the actions mit took”
in parts i through iii we have sought to describe mit’s actions and to place them in the context of events occurring outside of mit in part v we will present some questions for the mit community to consider which might help with learning from this experience this part part iv responds to that portion of our charge asking us to describe options available to mit during the investigation and prosecution of aaron swartz it serves as a bridge from the facts of parts i ii and iii to the discussion questions in part v
we start with the following words of caution the act of “describing options” potentially embarks upon a sea of “mighthavebeens” and considering alternatives inevitably involves hindsight how does one maintain a perspective uncolored by the shock and tragedy of aaron swartz’s suicide or—knowing of him and his accomplishments—by the realization that he was the person who did the downloading and who was then arrested we are also cognizant of a wide variety of assertions and conjectures that have appeared in public discussions of the events
in the sections below we identify some of the key decision points for mit for the purpose of understanding and learning and of helping to frame the questions raised in part v some options were available at specific times others were available at many times throughout the period of mit’s involvement to provide a context for examples widely available we have selected one or more specific times for considering such options choosing based on the salience of the particular moment for illustrating the issues involved
we have chosen to interpret the reference in our charge to “mit” as referring to actions by members of the community including actions by students and faculty as well as the decisions taken by mit officials we highlight some of mit’s actions at various points in parts i ii and iii and we note alternatives that might have been taken but we do not attempt to judge whether some alternatives might have been preferable we also indicate the questions in part v that arise from the options we have identified
iva the investigation and the immediate post­‐arrest period
mit’s involvement began with the observed september and october 2010 downloading events of which it learned through emails from jstor asking the institute to identify the perpetrator and stop the excessive downloading jstor initially approached this downloading by blocking ip addresses hoping that—as had been its previous experience—the incident would not recur mit was unable to use its “stopit” procedure as the perpetrator or perpetrators had registered with an anonymous email address shortly thereafter mit designed econtrol to prevent future anonymous downloading but—at the request of jstor—the mechanism was not implemented until january 2011—which as matters developed was too late
iva1 locating the laptop and performing a packet scan
given the scale of the downloading its recurrence the impact on jstor servers and the concern that a significant portion of the jstor library was being copied possibly for redistribution identifying the downloader became imperative both to mit and to jstor in order to stop the excessive downloading the fact that the laptop registration was anonymous—and thus the owner could not be contacted—made it necessary to physically locate the laptop in order to identify what was happening
ist could have simply unplugged the laptop and waited for someone to claim it rather than performing a packet scan which is an intrusive operation in this case the laptop was attached to the network in a nonstandard way hidden from view in a closet and performing possibly unknown operations for an unknown purpose it thus seems prudent for ist to have attempted to capture and identify the network traffic ist as a network provider is permitted to engage in such monitoring but ist policies do not
part iv decision points for mit  81
seem clear about when such monitoring can be done or how to treat the information that is collected part v question 2 suggests that these policies may be in need of review
in light of the potentially serious consequences of the downloading to jstor and thus to mit its licensee and the persistent means whereby the perpetrator avoided the september and october attempts to terminate the activity we find no other options to analyze that would enhance mit’s understanding and learning with regard to this stage of the investigation
iva2 informing the mit police and notifying the cambridge police
ist could have attempted to deal with the discovery of the laptop on its own without choosing to inform the mit police however a laptop attached to the network has the potential to perform a wide range of activities and the mit network has access to many services and databases that are critical for mit research and education some that involve sensitive information and government applications where an unknown individual or group has been actively engaged in accessing the network for several months evading mit’s attempts to stop their observed downloading activities and possibly engaging in other unobserved conduct it appears appropriate for ist to have asked for the mit police to become engaged immediately upon discovery of the foreign laptop attached to the network in a basement closet
the mit police do not have expertise in computer or internet crimes nor do they have the ability to collect fingerprints or engage in the detailed analysis of evidence it is standard practice for police departments to rely on other police departments when expertise is needed and not available and it is standard practice for the mit police to contact the cambridge police under such circumstances the fact that the mit police lacked the resources—and therefore lacked the option to conduct a more thorough investigation on its own—is an issue we raise in part v question 1
iva3 providing information to law enforcement pre­‐subpoena
as detailed in appendix 7 some information generated during the downloading episodes was held beyond the length of time that mit’s internal policies permitted absent specific authorization from ogc and some information was provided to the usao before a subpoena was issued initially ogc approved the production of information to law enforcement without a subpoena as part of a continuing investigation of an ongoing intrusion into mit’s network as well as of a possible crime being committed on the mit campus ist continued to provide information to the investigators pursuant to this initial approval until ogc was eventually served with a subpoena on january 27 2011
part iv decision points for mit  82
in motions filed to suppress evidence the defense claimed that some of mit’s actions in the gathering of information and its production to law enforcement violated federal law as discussed in appendix 10 our findings do not support such allegations
a cursory examination of the statement of mit policies on data retention and production indicates that they do not seem to be as clear or complete as they might be moreover the interpretation of these policies could even be the subject of legal disputes as was the case here in the motions to suppress evidence see section iiid2 thus a review of the institute’s data retention and provision policies seems desirable as we suggest in part v question 2 increased mit community awareness of these policies and an understanding of the challenges of balancing the preservation of privacy and the need to maintain appropriate use of mit’s network would serve as a learning opportunity for mit more broadly
with regard to the production of electronic data without a subpoena ist consulted with ogc before providing any information to law enforcement however this request was made on january 4 2011 when the laptop was first discovered and law enforcement was first called in thereafter ist continued to follow ogc’s initial guidance despite a change in circumstances this change was the result of law enforcement’s commencement of a postarrest investigation into swartz’s activities an investigation no longer focused on what an unknown perpetrator was doing on the mit network and what risk his conduct posed to that network but focused instead on collecting sufficient evidence to prosecute and convict him the laws concerning monitoring capturing and disclosing electronic communications for these two types of investigations are different mit’s choice of actions during the postarrest period complied with these laws in the review panel’s judgment—see appendix 10 but compliance appears to have occurred only incidentally as actions chosen without the benefit of expert advice to either ist or ogc early in the process ogc had not yet arranged for an outside counsel with expertise in criminal law and it never arranged for expertise regarding computer crime or electronic communications
part v question 1 asks whether and how that kind of legal and forensic expertise should be more readily available to ogc and to ist
ivb neutrality issuing statements providing information to prosecution and defense
mit chose to be neutral on the substance of the prosecution—it was neither in favor nor opposed as to whether aaron swartz should be prosecuted or whether if charged the charges should be felonies or misdemeanors it conveyed that stance privately to both prosecution and defense it chose not to issue public statements about the arrest the prosecution or the indictments overall mit sought to maintain the stance of a neutral
part iv decision points for mit  83
third party in a suit—us v swartz—in which it was not involved mit had the options of stating its position publicly of communicating different views either publicly or privately and of communicating its views more strongly and persistently the choice of substance and of method of its communications reflected multiple considerations including the fact that aaron swartz was not formally associated with mit mit’s appreciation of the significance of the allegations raised in its name against aaron swartz and the extent of consultation between and among ogc the institute’s administration and the institute’s faculty
mit’s stance on whether or not to issue statements and more generally its choice of limited involvement was reviewed on multiple occasions and could have been changed at any of several points in time for our discussion in this section we select occasions when the possibility of change was particularly salient
ivb1 issuingpublicstatementsaboutwhethertoprosecute
on july 19 2011 when the indictment was unsealed and after jstor had settled its civil suit with aaron swartz jstor issued a statement that included
the criminal investigation and today’s indictment of mr swartz has been directed by the united states attorney’s office it was the government’s decision whether to prosecute not jstor’s as noted previously our interest was in securing the content once this was achieved we had no interest in this becoming an ongoing legal matter
the wording “no interest in” is a little ambiguous interpretable as “not in favor of” but also as “being neither in favor of nor opposed to” mit did not issue a similar statement neither one expressing the neutrality that was its policy nor one opposing a prosecution nor was a statement issued clarifying that mit was not involved in the decision to prosecute the time of jstor’s statement was a particular opportunity for mit to issue its own statement
earlier in june 2011 mit had commented to jstor on earlier drafts of jstor statements including a possible joint statement see section iiia4 ultimately there was neither a joint statement nor a separate mit statement the time during which discussions with jstor about such statements were ongoing was also a time when it was apt for mit to consider in depth its limited involvement in addition to trying to influence the prosecutors which might have helped or hurt aaron swartz a public statement could have clarified mit’s position for both the mit community and the public at large even if it just presented the neutrality stance
public statements opposed to prosecution could have been issued at any time and not just institutionally but by individual members of the mit community as noted in the
part iv decision points for mit  84
discussion of previous events appendix 9 the actions of individual members of the mit community have made a difference in the past considerations that went into mit’s decisions to remain neutral relative to whether there should be a prosecution included a judgment of whether such statements would be helpful to aaron swartz or whether they risked making matters worse for him there was also a wide range of attitudes within the mit community toward aaron swartz’s actions on the mit network even among mit’s proponents of open access and among aaron swartz’s friends there was a general agreement that he had done something wrong a blanket statement opposing prosecution could have been perceived as extreme by many in the mit community beyond that a position opposed to any prosecution at all could have been interpreted by many people as saying that mit was uninterested in respecting its contractual agreements with licensors and was not serious about maintaining the integrity of its network
ivb2 issuingpublicstatementsaboutthecriminalcharges
separate from neutrality toward whether there should be a prosecution at all is the role of neutrality toward the particular charges aaron swartz was charged with felonies not misdemeanors plea bargains offered by the prosecution included admitting guilt to felonies and risking jail time an alternative option to a statement opposing prosecution per se see section ivb1 was one that opposed specifically felony prosecution as the felonies related to mit’s rules about access mit was intimately involved in the definition of the alleged crime and would eventually have been drawn into the discussion had there been a trial as with section ivb1 public statements could have been issued at any time and not just institutionally beyond the issues raised in section ivb1 this links also to the issue raised in question 5 in part v of mit’s institutional interests in the debate over reforming the computer fraud and abuse act
ivb3 makingprivatestatementstotheprosecutionaboutthecriminalcharges
mit communicated its view on the prosecution and punishment to the usao through ogc in the spring of 2011 and again through its outside counsel in august 2012 see section iiic3 the questions of further pursuing private statements to the usao and of altering the message being delivered arose particularly when two mit faculty lobbied for more support for aaron swartz see section iiic5 and when defense counsel approached mit about a joint meeting with usao see section iiid1 ogc was willing to participate in such a meeting but was not willing to significantly change its message to usao—a message that remained in substance essentially neutral
central to this option would be abandoning neutrality and choosing to argue that it would be better to pursue misdemeanor charges rather than felony charges and argue for dropping the demand for jail time and a felony record from plea negotiations the
part iv decision points for mit  85
statements the review panel solicited from the two faculty members who argued for change from neutrality provide some reasons for taking such a stance
we note that jstor made public statements and also private communications to the usao regarding its attitude toward the prosecution see part iic the private communication appears to have been worded more strongly in support of aaron swartz than was its public statement ogc was not aware of this private communication to the usao
as with the possibility of a public statement on the charges considerations that went into the decisions to remain neutral in private statements at these times included judgments about whether such statements would be helpful to aaron swartz given the lead prosecutor’s comments to mit’s outside counsel see section iiic3 mit statements would seemingly have had little impact and even risk making matters worse—although this information was not shared with swartz’s advocates
ivb4 providingprosecutionanddefensewithdocumentsandaccesstomit employees
section iiia3 pointed out that “neutrality” can be viewed differently by different observers a complication comes from the lack of symmetry in the abilities of prosecution and defense to obtain information for litigation purposes as spelled out in appendix 13 which reviews the legal structure of preparing for and proceeding with a trial thus neutrality in the discovery context can be thought of in terms of acting similarly in responses to requests from prosecution and defense or neutrality can be thought of in terms of acting to ensure equality of outcomes by offsetting the asymmetries in legal structure as mentioned at a time when the prosecution can produce a subpoena but the defense as yet cannot responding similarly to subpoenas from each side is not the same as giving both sides equal access to information
in the main mit acted neutrally in response to procedure rather than to outcome it could have done more for the defense for example it could have automatically supplied the defense with a copy of every document supplied to the prosecution rather than waiting for a defense subpoena similarly it could have offered a defense interview with every employee interviewed by the prosecution the choice not to do this was based on a judgment that the criminal process was sufficiently fair without the need for it to provide equality of outcome
with the filing of the motions to suppress in october 2012 the defense had placed itself in the position of alleging wrongdoing and illegal conduct on the part of mit and the role of the prosecution included rebutting any such allegations this further asymmetry
part iv decision points for mit  86
between the roles of the prosecution and the defense led to an alteration of mit’s general stance toward true procedural neutrality as described in section iiid3
questions 7 and 8 in part v situate these considerations on neutrality in making statements and providing information within a context of wider awareness of issues and attitudes as these issues affect much of the mit community there is reason for a wide ranging discussion
ivb5 takingnon­‐neutralpositionsforpeoplewithmitassociations
when the media lab director wrote to the administration in june 2011 see section iiib1 he asked whether mit could consider this a “family matter” others have suggested that aaron swartz could have been regarded as a member of the mit community based on the fact that he was a regular visitor to the mit campus interacted with mit people and groups both on campus and off and had made technical contributions to the world wide web consortium an organization hosted by mit the suggestion was that mit should mitigate its neutral stance and advocate that the prosecution should reduce the severity of the threatened punishment
in considering whether to maintain mit’s neutrality position ogc and the faculty members and others it questioned about this began by asking whether aaron swartz was an mit student upon learning that he was not most of the people consulted agreed that staying neutral was appropriate similarly aaron swartz’s arrest and prosecution sparked little reaction from the mit community including students which stands in marked contrast to previous incidents where students have gotten into legal trouble
the limited extent to which the “core” mit community engaged in discussion with the administration about the ongoing case and the range of perceptions of the mit community as to who is part of it for various purposes concern two of the questions in part v whether to hold a communitywide discussion of the role of hacking as a legitimate part of mit culture question 8 the nature of the obligation of mit to its “greater” community question 7 and the extent to which mit should intervene with law enforcement even in the case of registered students accused of illegal activity while we do not expect a consensus to arise from such discussions it should lead to greater awareness of the views held across the community
ivb6 becomingmoreinformedaboutthecharges
ogc asked mit’s outside counsel for background understanding of the details of the indictment and so of the role of the computer fraud and abuse act late in the summer of 2012 and received a brief sketch of issues members of the mit community who have been active in considering the cfaa did not draw the attention of ogc or the
part iv decision points for mit  87
administration to issues around cfaa during the prosecution mit had the option of exploring the charges earlier and considering the cfaa more broadly as part of formulating its responses to requests about statements one particularly pertinent moment was in june 2011 when the media lab director informed the administration that aaron swartz was charged with “unauthorized access” and suggested that mit would be in a position to cast doubt on this charge if so desired see section iiib1 other pertinent times were when the two federal indictments were issued although the review panel does not suggest that it was mit’s role to offer lines of argument for the defense or to point out issues with the indictment similarly members of the mit community who were following the prosecution could have explored and discussed this issue in more detail
a charge of “accessing the mit network without authorization or in excess of authorized access” deeply involves mit since mit provides the authorization and sets the rules of authorization thus mit set rules that played a key role in determining what constituted a felony in the aaron swartz case in the 1994 prosecution of david lamacchia mit communicated to the usao that as a student lamacchia was authorized to access the computer as he had done there was no reflection on the lamacchia case during swartz’s prosecution institutional memory had been lost part v question 1 in considering the need for greater expertise at mit relating to computer crime also asks about ways to help preserve institutional memory
ivb7 engagingmoredeeplywithissuesaroundthecomputerfraudandabuseact
as we are finishing this report a bill has been filed in congress to reform the cfaa and dubbed “aaron’s law” no doubt there will be extensive discussion before there is any legislation mit’s roles both in having chosen the rules and in interpreting their applicability to aaron swartz make it clear that mit has a real interest in contributing to the discussion as mit is a leading institution concerned with computers and network technology mit scholars and mit institutionally have a role to play in encouraging reform thus beyond the issue of exploring the charges against aaron swartz based on wire fraud as well as access rules earlier and in more detail question 5 in part v raises the issue of mit’s general institutional concern with the cfaa

part v questions for the mit community
question 1 should mit develop additional on­‐campus expertise for handling potential computer crime incidents thus giving the institute more flexibility in formulating its responses
question 2 should mit policies on the collection provision and retention of electronic records be reviewed
question 3 should an mit education address the personal ethics and legal obligations of technology empowerment
question 4 should mit increase its efforts to bring its considerable technical expertise and leadership to bear on the study of legal policy and societal impact of information and communications technology
question 5 what are mit’s institutional interests in the debate over reforming the computer fraud and abuse act
question 6 should mit strengthen its activities in support of open access to scholarly publications
question 7 what are mit’s obligations to members of our extended community
question 8 how can mit draw lessons for its hacker culture from this experience
part v questions for the mit community
we have described the events concerning aaron swartz and his prosecution and mit’s involvement in those events we now reach the portion of president reif’s charge that is perhaps the most important discussing how we might learn
here in part v we pose questions for the mit community and offer suggestions for how to address some of them in the hope that doing so will aid the process of learning from this heartbreaking history in selecting our questions we draw on past incidents at mit as well as the immediate one and focus on structural issues raised by these experiences
mit’s response to aaron swartz’s arrest and prosecution reflected the mit community’s overall sentiment—a limited interest as demonstrated by virtually the entire mit

part v questions for the mit community  90
community before aaron swartz’s suicide the community paid scant attention to the matter other than during the period immediately following his arrest few students faculty or alumni expressed concerns to the administration those most familiar with aaron swartz and the issues that greatly concerned him were divided in their views of the propriety of his action downloading jstor files and fearful of harming his situation by taking public or private stands1 as strongly as we now wish in hindsight that events had turned out differently and as we reflect on how mit might have behaved differently— how we might have behaved differently—we recognize that we cannot and never will know whether any different actions on the part of mit would have averted this tragedy however what we can do constructively now is to translate this tragedy into awareness and learning procedures and actions that will help mit become more like the community we strive to be
the review panel was not asked to make recommendations in our report but rather to suggest how mit might learn from this history in response we offer several questions for the community to reflect upon and some suggestions for a learning process some relate directly to the events described earlier in the report others are prompted by more general concerns that emerged in our interviews with faculty administration students alumni and knowledgeable outsiders and reflections on mit’s responses to previous analogous events2 some are mundane—significant although technical in nature others are more philosophical based on the morality a great institution must express and aspire to we pose these as questions for deliberation by the entire community not only by the administration and not only by the faculty because it is as a community that mit must answer them
question 1 should mit develop additional on­‐campus expertise for handling potential computer crime incidents thus giving the institute more flexibility in formulating its responses
we raise this question relative to two areas of expertise police expertise in computer issues and legal expertise in computer crime matters when outside law enforcement city state or federal is involved on campus mit may have a diminished flexibility in choosing actions and approaches the narrative in part i shows how a decision to seek help from local law enforcement can without any intent to do so summon federal investigators and invite federal prosecution in the swartz case had the downloader been found to be an mit student mit might well have wished to handle the incident internally as a disciplinary matter and not a criminal one here the secret service became involved before swartz’s identity and his studentnonstudent status were known

￼
part v questions for the mit community  91
one question is whether mit police capabilities should expand to include expertise in dealing with cybercrime there are many lawenforcement situations where the mit police must turn outside for help yet given mit’s exposure in the online world the wealth of technical expertise available within the mit community and the growth of cybercrime as a national concern it is arguable that law enforcement involving cybercrime incidents should be an area where mit has its own special capabilities if so where should those capabilities reside
there is also the question of legal expertise regarding cybercrime and related criminal matters the office of the general counsel addresses many legal issues that arise in the functioning of mit helping members of the mit community as well as mit itself complex criminal issues arise infrequently and issues involving computer crime the privacy of electronic data and requirements for the disclosure of electronic communications arise still less frequently in the aaron swartz case mit employed outside counsel with some of the relevant expertise to help with planning and managing interactions with usao and defense counsels however this did not occur until almost the time of the first indictment and the initial cooperation with law enforcement including the collection and production of electronic evidence took place well before such outside counsel was retained there was apparently no ready access to outside computer criminal law expertise in the rush of events the day the laptop was discovered would having outside counsel on retainer rather than employed on a casebycase basis be worthwhile in responding more quickly
another observation is that perhaps due to the passage of time there was no awareness within ogc of mit’s experience with the david lamacchia case in 1994 described briefly in appendix 9 with which the swartz case has important parallels would mit’s understanding of the significance of the charges filed be better served with the construction of an ongoing history of significant cases in which mit has been involved rather than relying solely on the institutional memory of its lawyers and administration officials could outside counsel on retainer rather than employed on a casebycase basis help preserve institutional memory
the review panel’s charge was to examine this particular case but we are well aware that some of the same issues could arise in other realms for example many mit people work at the intersection of computers and biology complex laws frame biological and medical care research and there are edges where researchers including students may be drawn to do things that may end badly while we do not attempt to extend our inferences for computer issues to other areas other people should address this as mit goes forward
continuing beyond the specific case of aaron swartz a discussion of the potential interactions between internal policing and external police is germane for other areas for example illegal drug use while the specific issues are very different perhaps mit can
part v questions for the mit community  92
review its experience in that realm and look for lessons that may help with other areas this includes considering the extent to which students ought to be protected from prosecution both with regard to fairness and with regard to the experience education and development of the students it also includes the feasibility of employing legal counsel as a “legal ombudsman” to advise students on issues concerning their research projects—both those authorized by their academic instructors and those “not”
question 2 should mit policies on the collection provision and retention of electronic records be reviewed
mit’s provision of records as recounted above reveals some gaps in its policies and practices around electronic records records were given to the secret service and the usao with the approval of ogc but there seems to have been incomplete clarity between ogc and ist over exactly what had been approved and how long that approval lasted some records were turned over prior to subpoenas being issued some records were retained longer than mit’s retention policy called for and for some kinds of records there seems to be no explicit retention policy at all in addition aaron swartz’s attorneys in a motion to suppress evidence involving the electronic records claimed that some of mit’s actions in information gathering and provision violated applicable law see section iiid3 given the issues and ambiguities a review of mit’s data retention and production policies for electronic records seems appropriate this is not only to improve the policies but also to make the community more aware of these rules and the tensions inherent in trying to set appropriate rules
question 3 should an mit education address the personal ethics and legal obligations of technology empowerment should it include understanding of the legal frameworks that govern technology innovation and exploratory behavior should it include awareness of the interest in policy questions that will arise in future work of many graduates
aaron swartz was not an mit student but he was like many mit students in that he was brilliant technologically empowered impassioned and willing to work at the frontier the very qualities that we celebrate in the mit culture and value as engendering innovation and entrepreneurship gifted young people can readily exploit the power of the internet to accomplish worldclass good—and also to get themselves into worldclass trouble aaron swartz did both as with question 1 these issues arise in a variety of settings not just computers and the internet
should an mit education include the opportunity to reflect on the personal choices to be made in exercising such technological brilliance and power does mit have a responsibility to better prepare our students to grapple with the ethics of the decisions they will face as they go on to design new technologies to be used in the world should
part v questions for the mit community  93
mit provide opportunities for students to better understand how to deal with the consequences of their decisions as part of their technology education should students learn about legal restrictions on and societal debates about conduct “at the edges” could this be another way for mit to demonstrate leadership as an educational institution how might mit make progress on realizing this opportunity
question 4 should mit increase its efforts to bring its considerable technical expertise and leadership to bear on the study of legal policy and societal impact of information and communications technology
the director of a leading computer research center commented to a member of the review panel that if mit had had a stronger academic program in internet policy then the institute might have addressed the aaron swartz case from a broader perspective be that as it may aaron swartz’s suicide has embroiled mit in an internet uproar that the institute did not anticipate and with which it is not well prepared to grapple as a legal policy or social phenomenon
as one faculty member commented
mit prides itself on innovation and orientation to the future but in defending a culture of ruledefiance it can sound highly traditionalist “this is the way we have always done it” but as society at large evolves traditionalist cultures have to adapt sooner or later in this case the complication is that mit itself has been the source of so many of the changes now washing back on it
a similar narrative applies here with regard to complex legal systems that attempt to regulate theft and misuse of information there may be a lot of libertarian types at mit and beyond who do not want these controls imposed by the politically and economically powerful but they are fantasizing if they think the world at large can operate indefinitely on the traditional cultural principles of the institute
we should create an mit law center resembling harvard’s berkman center or the oxford internet institute the lack of such a center at mit which prides itself on leadership in all things technological is astounding mit has no choice but to develop a much more robust capacity to study and teach such issues for its own good as well as for the greater good
if mit had had a locus of scholarly activity around issues of information access during swartz’s arrest and prosecution one can imagine that there would have been more active participation by the community as events were transpiring more appetite for engaging the larger issues the prosecution brought to light and more recognition of mit’s opportunity and responsibility to play a leadership role there are a number of options for
part v questions for the mit community  94
expanding such scholarly activity to be considered beyond the law center mentioned in the quote above emphasizing leadership positions might not itself have made a difference in mit’s specific actions involving aaron swartz but it very well might have highlighted the opportunity to make public statements about our position or encouraged individual members of the community to speak out
question 5 what are mit’s institutional interests in the debate over reforming the computer fraud and abuse act
aaron swartz’s death has stoked the flames of widespread criticism of the computer fraud and abuse act 18 usc §1030 one of two criminal laws under which he was prosecuted there has been increased publicity about cfaa prosecutions in many parts of the us together with calls for reform and a bill introduced in congress3 mit—and indeed many universities—have at least two institutional and educational interests in this debate
mit’s first interest flows from the cfaa’s “exceeds authorized access” clause under this clause accessing mit’s computer network beyond the bounds set by mit for such access can be a felony however mit is not a legislature it does not hold open debates about how its terms of service tos should be crafted defined provided with “safe harbors” and otherwise applied and it cannot foresee how rapid advances in technology and social uses of technology may make its tos obsolete unclear or a dangerous and unintended trap for the unwary does mit want to be in the position of determining what is and is not a felony the application of this clause can criminalize even minor violations of tos and expose violators to civil and criminal penalties in an intensive environment of exploration it is not uncommon for researchers to conduct experiments that arguably violate the broad terms of service often associated today with websites and services as one example research involving collection and analysis of data about internet services is vital to scholarly understanding of this medium4 moreover the cfaa has the effect of transforming minor violations of very broad service terms from a contractual issue often never intended to preclude research into a potential federal felony this creates a chilling effect on important research and puts mit in the awkward position of determining what is a felony based on its choice of the terms in its tos

￼
part v questions for the mit community  95
a second mit interest is the cfaa’s prohibition against “unauthorized access” which can be hard to apply clearly in the context of mit’s open network environment there the question of who is “authorized” can rest on details of mit’s internal policies such as the 14day limit on “guest registrations” aaron swartz’s attorney claimed that his access was in fact authorized as a consequence of mit’s guest policy an issue that presumably would have been argued at trial had the case reached there5 assuming for the sake of argument that swartz did violate mit’s guest policy by for example remaining on the system for 15 days rather than the “authorized” 14 is such a “violation” material and should such a violation turn acceptable conduct into a felony a similar issue arose in the david lamacchia case appendix 9 where the usao initially planned to charge mr lamacchia with unauthorized access under the cfaa but decided against that when mit refused to support the unauthorized access interpretation applied to its student university rules of access are not designed for the purpose of defining the predicates for criminal prosecutions forcing them into this role impedes the university’s ability to support open access and innovation
there are many voices currently weighing in on the debate over cfaa reform and mit’s role as a technology leader gives it special status to explain the impacts of the cfaa on research and academic exploration mit can press for change without necessarily taking sides in all facets of the debate on alternative ways to do reform
question 6 should mit strengthen its activities in support of open access to scholarly publications
aaron swartz’s downloading of the jstor database may have been motivated by the ideal of open access to scholarly works many commentators on the swartz case have criticized mit for not taking this into account in responding to his prosecution given that mit is itself a leader in advocating for open access should mit be doing even more in support of open access to scholarly publications at present the mit open access working group6 is considering possible proactive initiatives in light of recent push backs by some publishers against openaccess policies these include publicly advocating pro–open access positions with professional societies increasing mit’s support for openaccess journals and strengthening mit’s commitment to the faculty open access policy

another role mit might play is to lend its institutional support to the fastr fair access to science and technology research act currently before congress and to similar legislation mit could play a special role in demonstrating the value of fastr’s call for computational analysis by stateoftheart technologies of the results of governmentfunded research7 such an initiative would align well with some of the “big data” activities now springing up on campus
mit might also assume a leadership role among research universities in responding to the white house office of science and technology policy directive of february 22 2013 directing major federal agencies that sponsor research to develop plans to make the published results of governmentfunded research freely available to the public8 given our expertise in scholarly publishing repository development and digital preservation mit could offer perhaps in conjunction with others to assist agencies in creating such plans going beyond this mit could seek to mobilize the association of american universities aau and the association of public and landgrant universities aplu around an initiative such as share9 whereby providing public access to the results of university scholarly research becomes the responsibility of the university research community itself—thereby strengthening the partnership between those who create knowledge and the public that benefits from it and mit could use its prestige and influence to actively advocate for strengthening copyright law’s exceptions and limitations in support of scholarly pursuits including fair use for the purposes of teaching scholarship and research10
question 7 what are mit’s obligations to members of our extended community
mit maintains an open campus and an open network and benefits from both in that context how should mit treat people who actively participate in the life of mit but do not have a formal official connection ie people with different relationships to mit than those of students faculty and staff several people we interviewed for this report were emphatic that aaron swartz was a member of the mit community citing his involvement with the world wide web consortium and his participation in technical forums others said that he was not a member of the community pointing to the fact that

he was not a student others were not sure but said that he was at least a member of an “extended community”
aaron swartz’s father noted that in his discussions with some mit administrators he was asked if his son was a member of the mit community when he explained that his son was not a student or staff member he felt that these administrators assured themselves that mit had no responsibilities to aaron and gave no consideration to the idea that aaron was part of mit’s larger community of scholars and scientists
do we need to broaden our understanding of what it means to be part of the mit community in the words of one faculty member interviewed
besides its faculty students staff and employees mit has through the course of its history welcomed into its midst many who have only peripheral connections to the institute and a number who have no affiliation whatsoever these “guests” come via various informal routes as observers in laboratories visitors in hallways auditors in classrooms readers in libraries and overnight lodgers not all are integral to what goes on here and some have little more than nuisance value but many are tolerated because as a group they form part of a rich subculture that makes this community unique in its receptiveness to intellectual content regardless of credentials points of origin or other conventional standards it is a relatively loose undocumented subculture but almost everyone here recognizes its prevalence and values it as part of the fabric of this great institution
what institutional obligations does mit have to members of its larger community what is the nature and scope of those obligations if aaron swartz had been an mit student mit might very well have reacted differently to his prosecution if only because the committee on discipline could be available as an alternative mechanism for handling transgressions and the dean for students might have entered and possibly altered the trajectory of events should mit develop a formal recognition of “guests” contributors and other participants in the academic life of mit should such possible recognition be captured in policy or should it be left to informal channels and community awareness while differences will always exist there remains a basic issue of how mit should think about responses to members of a wider community—as the underlying mindset will affect actions whether it is codified or not11
11 while this question can be considered part of question 8 we think it useful to recognize the issues in this question without having them overwhelmed by the related questions for full members of the mit community
￼
part v questions for the mit community  98
question 8 how can mit draw lessons for its hacker culture from this experience
mit celebrates hacker culture our admissions tours and firstyear orientation salute a culture of creative disobedience where students are encouraged to explore secret corners of the campus commit goodspirited acts of vandalism within informal but broadly— although not fully—understood rules and resist restrictions that seem arbitrary or capricious we attract students who are driven not just to be creative but also to explore in ways that test boundaries and challenge positions of power
there are multiple times in the narrative of our review where one might wonder whether some earlier process of discussion and education might have had a positive impact on actions and decisions a similar thought comes when considering earlier experiences involving students detailed in appendix 9 in particular students faculty staff and administration might all benefit from a discussion of the nature of a desirable hacker culture recognizing both advantages and risks
this raises the question of whether the mit community is sufficiently aware of what the hacker culture is meant to be about of the risks inherent in crossing lines as part of hacking and the roles of faculty staff and administration in responding to what might or might not be a hack and we note that there has been a persistent undercurrent of concern over the past several years that mit’s hacking tradition is being vitiated by a perceived increasing tendency to interpret hacking as a criminal activity some of the concern stems from incidents in 2006–2008 where students engaging in “unauthorized access” to various areas of campus ended up in cambridge district court charged with breaking and entering with intent to commit a felony as swartz initially was12
yet in the computer context unlike as in the physical world “unauthorized access”—ill defined as it may be—can be grounds for a major federal felony prosecution for swartz the end result was calamitous the entire episode may create a chilling effect for those students contemplating exploits that may push the bounds of their and society’s knowledge but will also take them to places where conventional rules say they are not supposed to be—“coloring outside the lines” so to speak punishable by criminal records rather than mere forfeiture of crayons
how can we prevent a robust hacking tradition from becoming a casualty of the aaron swartz tragedy is mit doing enough to help students when their investigations lead them into confrontations with powerful authorities or existing law do we distinguish adequately the different sorts of ways students get into trouble and respond
12 see “hacking tradition under fire” the tech february 5 2008  “lawyer student in nw16 basement was ‘hacking’” the tech july 9 2008  and “difava pierce discuss hacking at ec” the tech november 4 2008 
￼
part v questions for the mit community  99
appropriately are we misleading students and community members by advertising one kind of community and enforcing rules more appropriate to a different kind of community are faculty staff and administrators on similar wavelengths about the responses that are most appropriate while an extended discussion will not lead to uniform views it would be good to expand awareness of the range of views in the community
more generally has mit become overly conservative in its institutional decisionmaking around these incidents more than once in our interviews the review panel heard members of the mit community express a feeling that there has been a change in the institutional climate over recent years where decisions have become driven more by a concern for minimizing risk than by strong affirmation of mit values several people interpreted the institute’s response in the swartz case in that light and some critics have chided mit for playing such a passive role when swartz’s actions were motivated by principles that mit itself champions yet we think it is important to view this tragedy in light of a history that may not conform with a myth of a golden past for this reason we have referred repeatedly to some prior experiences
one distinguished alumnus said to us “mit seemed to be operating according to the letter of the law but not according to the letter of the heart” even while he expressed his enormous respect for the mit leaders who had to grapple with these decisions is his concern on target mit aspires to be passionate about its principles but we must also behave prudently as an institution of all the decisions mit’s leadership must make those that require negotiating a balance between prudence and passion are some of the most wrenching how can we make those choices easier to confront
a possible way to move forward would be to charge a committee composed of students faculty staff and policyadministrators to organize a series of campuswide deliberations around issues raised by this report these issues might include but should not be limited to what is the mit community and who is in it what responsibility does mit have to advise and at times oppose laws and government when it sees implications adverse to mit’s purpose and scope of leadership what lines must mit’s students be made aware that they should not cross or at least be sternly warned that “there be dragons” beyond where does mit draw the line between riskavoidance so as to protect its more parochial interests and riskassumption to promote those things in which it is interested
conclusion
as the length of this report demonstrates the narrative of mit’s involvement in the events around aaron swartz’s arrest and prosecution is extensive and intricate this review panel hopes that we have set out the history of events with sufficient detail clarity and objectivity so that readers can consider the range of options that mit faced recognize mit’s actual choices as made in the context of events and draw their own conclusions we have also suggested areas where the institute might learn from these events including through community discussion and selfexamination some of the issues that mit faces transcend the particular events involving aaron swartz and reflect broader concerns that emerged during our investigations these include
• the challenges of preserving open environments and open access in a digitally connected world that is increasingly apprehensive about computer crime and information misuse
• the dilemmas that arise in responding to members of our community—and our extended community—whose exploits land them in legal trouble
• the responsibility to help brilliant and innovative students navigate the ethical choices that accompany their technical empowerment
• the opportunity to reinforce mit’s institutional leadership in information technology by increasing scholarship and expertise in information law and policy
the review panel encourages mit’s administration to take the occasion of this report to stimulate discussions across the mit community about these issues and the others described in part v
in concluding this review we recognize the desire for a simple takeaway a conclusion that “if mit had only done this rather than that things would have turned out ok” we can’t offer one there were too many choices too many mighthavebeens too great an emotional shock and a public response that has been supercharged by the power of the internet the same power that aaron swartz epitomized and that he helped to create even today with the benefit of hindsight we have not found a silver bullet with which mit could have simply prevented the tragedy
if the review panel is forced to highlight just one issue for reflection we would choose to look to the mit administration’s maintenance of a “neutral” handsoff attitude that regarded the prosecution as a legal dispute to which it was not a party this attitude was complemented by the mit community’s apparent lack of attention to the ruinous collision of hacker ethics opensource ideals questionable laws and aggressive
100
prosecutions that was playing out in its midst as a case study this is a textbook example of the very controversies where the world seeks mit’s insight and leadership
a friend of aaron swartz stressed in one of our interviews that mit will continue to be at the cutting edge in information technology and in today’s world challenges like those presented in aaron swartz’s case will arise again and again with that realization “neutrality on these cases is an incoherent stance it’s not the right choice for a tough leader or a moral leader”
in closing our review can suggest this lesson mit is respected for worldclass work in information technology for promoting open access to online information and for dealing wisely with the risks of computer abuse the world looks to mit to be at the forefront of these areas looking back on the aaron swartz case the world didn’t see leadership as one person involved in the decisions put it “mit didn’t do anything wrong but we didn’t do ourselves proud”
it has not been the panel’s charge for this review to make judgments rather only to learn and help others learn in doing so let us all recognize that by responding as we did mit missed an opportunity to demonstrate the leadership that we pride ourselves on not meeting accepting and embracing the responsibility of leadership can bring disappointment in the world at large disappointment can easily progress to disillusionment and even outrage as the aaron swartz tragedy has demonstrated with terrible clarity

january 13 2013
to the members of the mit community
yesterday we received the shocking and terrible news that on friday in new york aaron swartz a gifted young man well known and admired by many in the mit community took his own life with this tragedy his family and his friends suffered an inexpressible loss and we offer our most profound condolences even for those of us who did not know aaron the trail of his brief life shines with his brilliant creativity and idealism
although aaron had no formal affiliation with mit i am writing to you now because he was beloved by many members of our community and because mit played a role in the legal struggles that began for him in 2011
i want to express very clearly that i and all of us at mit are extremely saddened by the death of this promising young man who touched the lives of so many it pains me to think that mit played any role in a series of events that have ended in tragedy
i will not attempt to summarize here the complex events of the past two years now is a time for everyone involved to reflect on their actions and that includes all of us at mit i have asked professor hal abelson to lead a thorough analysis of mits involvement from the time that we first perceived unusual activity on our network in fall 2010 up to the present i have asked that this analysis describe the options mit had and the decisions mit made in order to understand and to learn from the actions mit took i will share the report with the mit community when i receive it
i hope we will all reach out to those members of our community we know who may have been affected by aarons death as always mit medical is available to provide expert counseling but there is no substitute for personal understanding and support

appendix 2 letter from hal abelson to the mit community
january 22 2013
to the mit community
president reif has asked me to lead a review of our involvement in the events that began in fall 2010 when the library system learned that large numbers of articles were being downloaded from jstor up through aaron swartz’s shocking suicide on january 11 among the thousands of news articles and postings over the past week— many strongly critical of mit—there was at least one comment that saw a glimmer of encouragement that the administration has assigned this task to a faculty member strongly identified with the ideals of free and open access to information on the net the same ideals that aaron championed so passionately i’m grateful and humbled by president reif’s expression of confidence and i’ll try to approach this review with fairness and with respect to aaron’s memory to his family and to our community
this matter is urgently serious for mit the world respects us not only for our scholarship and our science but because we are an institution whose actions are and always have been guided by the highest ideals and the most thoughtful judgment our commitment to those ideals is now coming into question at last saturday’s memorial aaron’s partner taren stinebricknerkauffman described his mental state “he faced indifference from mit an institution that could have protected him with a single public statement and refused to do so in defiance of all of its own most cherished principles”
i don’t know—we don’t know—if that’s accurate or fair but it demands our response i hope this review can provide some insight into what mit did or didn’t do and why
the review will not be a witchhunt or an attempt to lay blame on individuals we don’t know what we’ll find as the answers unfold but i expect to find that every person acted in accordance with mit policy more than that they acted in the belief that their actions were legally and ethically proper
in last sunday’s boston globe distinguished mit alumnus and former us senator john e sununu writes
for its part mit is conducting the inevitable soulsearching internal investigation new administrative policies and campus rules will be written in the soft tones of academic boilerplate but a new policy handbook will not suffice this is a crisis of values and judgment and it requires a change in attitude starting at the top
to this point mit’s administration has refrained from speaking about this matter publicly out of its expressed desire to first have a full record of events via our report but when the record is clear we will all need to ask if sununu’s criticism is on target are we becoming a place that in the words of legal scholar james boyle “confuses order with rectitude” that’s a question not only for mit’s leadership but something we will all need to ask of one another—and of ourselves

appendix 4 processes followed in preparing this report
the review panel faced several complexities in preparing this report one is the intense public interest and controversy surrounding the prosecution of aaron swartz another is that we were charged with reviewing mit actions that included those of the senior administration and the office of the general counsel yet another is that some of the documents relevant to the report are covered by attorneyclient privilege this appendix documents the processes we followed in addressing these issues we also provide information on the documents we examined and the people we interviewed
4a criterion for naming individuals
the review panel realizes that there has been significant controversy surrounding the events described we appreciate that many of the people involved have legitimate concerns about their privacy and their security and we know that some have even been personally threatened consequently our report generally does not identify individuals by name many of these individuals have already been identified in court filings and other public documents and we are fully aware that their names are readily discoverable on the internet even so we see no need to further erode their personal privacy so as a rule people in this report are identified by their role or position rather than by name there are a few exceptions
• in cases where including their names makes the narrative more understandable we’ve named public officials—such as prosecutors detectives federal agents judges or police officers whose role in the events has already been described in public court filings
• for some people actively involved in the events described such as defense counsels for aaron swartz we have used their names with their permission to do so
• we named some people whose connections are only tangential to the events described in the report without having sought permission

we examined about 10000 pages of documents in preparing this review these include legal productions electronic messages among individuals at mit and correspondence with jstor aaron swartz’s attorneys and the usao1
4c process for mit privileged documents
some of the documents pertinent to our review were covered by mit’s attorneyclient privilege such as specific legal advice provided to mit employees by the ogc and advice provided to mit by its outside counsel some are protected by the work product privilege such as where mit anticipated that it would be involved in litigation concerning the production documents and other matters pertaining to these events in order to protect mit’s privileges and to avoid the chilling effect a full disclosure of these communications might have for future deliberations on other matters between and among mit attorneys employees and officials even the review panel members were not given unrestricted access to this information instead mit engaged the outside firm of wilmer cutler pickering hale and dorr llp to manage a disclosure process the review panel provided a list of potentially pertinent documents to attorneys from wilmer hale who worked with the panel’s attorney grosso who was also engaged by mit to ensure that all necessary information was evaluated for the report and to determine which privileged documents should be disclosed to the rest of the review panel

appendix 6 jstor and the mit libraries
jstor journal storage is a notforprofit organization that leases subscriptionbased access to digitized and digital versions of scholarly journals that span more than 50 disciplines in the arts and sciences jstor’s database currently contains over 1400 journal titles from 800 publishers and it has more than 10000 institutional subscribers around the world jstor’s scholarly journal archive provides nearly the entire run for each journal title starting with its earliest issue as an archive jstor does not typically offer access to the most recent three to five years of a journal jstor provides its journals under agreements with the original publishers and copyright rests with the publishers not with jstor jstor was launched in 1995 with funding from the andrew w mellon foundation and with mit as one of five charter institutional subscribers jstor collections first became available in 1997
mit subscribes to nearly all of jstor’s major journal collections these journals are critical resources at mit and at other research libraries for mit scholars jstor is a main way to gain online access to the archival back runs of key scholarly journals such as the american journal of mathematics american mathematical monthly and british medical journal and from key scholarly societies including philosophical transactions of the royal society of london science and journals published by the american economic association the american statistical association and the society for in vitro biology the mit community uses jstor titles heavily in 2012 about 130000 articles were downloaded from the archive
mit’s cumulative cost for jstor access since 1997 is approximately 620000 this total includes an initial membership fee of approximately 30000 ≈ per capita income  netherlands 2005 followed by onetime approximately 90000 and ongoing leasing fees for each purchase of access to a collection totaling approximately 60000 per year to put these numbers in perspective purchasing subscriptions to hundreds of journals from a commercial publisher can cost more each year than the cumulative payments made to jstor since 1997
access to jstor’s content like most of the content mit purchases for access through the mit network is offered under a license agreement between mit and the content provider and access is controlled through ip address recognition
the access mechanism was changed in january 2011 in reaction to aaron swartz’s downloading activities as explained above in section ie2 jstor and econtrol before january 2011 any computer on the mit network could access jstor by simply going to httpwwwjstororg visitors to mit could establish a guest account on the mit network and access jstor by connecting their computer to the mit network as swartz did
116
from offcampus members of the mit community could obtain jstor articles by presenting their mitissued computer credentials which let them connect to the mit network via a vpn virtual private network or use the mit libraries’ shortcut urls to gain access through a proxy server
since early january 2011 access to jstor regardless of the user’s location requires both the same mit credentials that allowed offcampus access in the past and an additional authentication check with mit’s human resources database people using guest accounts can no longer access jstor articles although visitors can still gain access through certain workstations located in the libraries
jstor’s license agreement with mit requires that mit “shall use reasonable efforts to protect the database from any use that is not permitted under this agreement and shall notify jstor of any such use of which it learns or is notified” it stipulates that the following activities are not permitted using “materials in a manner that would infringe the copyright therein” or “copying downloading or attempting to download an entire issue or issues of a journal from the database”
as noted above the mit community downloaded about 130000 articles in 2012 in 2010 and 2011 the respective download numbers were 5329326 and 567488 the mit libraries’ analysis indicates that the elevated numbers result from aaron swartz’s download activity omitting the months when swartz was downloading and substituting average data for those months the adjusted numbers are 228919 for 2010 and 126000 for 2011 it seems plausible that the drop in “actual” downloads between 2010 and 2011– 2012 is due to the more stringent access controls that deny access to anyone not identified in mit’s human resources database as faculty staff or student
appendix 6 jstor and the mit libraries  117
appendix 7 records produced by mit to law enforcement
during the morning of january 4 2011 before the owner of the laptop had been identified the us secret service special agent asked mit ist for whatever electronic records mit might have that would be useful to the ongoing investigation see section ib ist after consulting with the office of the general counsel turned over some records that same afternoon these records were in the following categories network flow data logs dhcp server logs radius server logs portions of the network registration database and packet stream data no subpoena had been issued to mit at this point in time1 this appendix gives details and technical background on the electronic records provided and the relevant mit policies appendix 10 provides a legal analysis of mit’s provision of these records
7a network flow data logs
network flow data is collected by ist as part of routine network management and the logs are retained these logs show which ip addresses communicated with which other ip addresses when the communication took place how many bytes were transmitted how many data packets were transmitted and the network ports used the logs do not contain the substance of the communications transmitted between ip addresses
mit ist’s policy is to retain network flow data for as long as its storage capacity allows up to a maximum of 30 days in the case of the request by the special agent made on january 4 2011 network flow data going back only to december 14 2010 was available and it was this data that was provided by mit to the secret service on january 4 2011
7b dynamic host configuration protocol dhcp server logs
every computer is attached or connected to a network through a network interface the network interface is identified by name or label which is known as its mac address see part i footnote 4 for an explanation mac addresses are typically denoted by sequences of six twodigit hexadecimal numbers separated by colons an example is 00235a735ffb
a computer attached to a network also needs an ip address which the network uses to route data to and from the computer ip addresses are typically denoted by a sequence of four numbers between 0 and 255 separated by dots as in 182513216
1 mit was first presented with a subpoena on january 27 2011
118
￼
appendix 7 records produced by mit to law enforcement  119
while mac addresses are determined by the physical hardware of the computer and assigned at the time of manufacture ip addresses identify the port on the network where the computer is connected and they are determined by the network to which it is attached an ip address can be periodically changed by the network and ip addresses can be reassigned as computers are removed or relocated on a network2
assigning an ip address to a computer can be accomplished in different ways one is for the computer and the network to agree on a fixed or permanent address this is called a static ip address alternatively the computer can request the network to assign it a dynamic ip address that is an address that is subject to change using the network’s dynamic host configuration protocol dhcp service this is a service that finds available ip addresses and assigns them as needed unlike a static ip address the dynamic address can be different each time the computer reconnects to the network such as when it is turned off and then on—and can change as a computer moves from location to location to obtain the dynamic address the computer contacts the network’s dhcp server and presents its mac address together with a humanreadable name called a dhcp client id dhcp requests and assignments are recorded in the server’s dhcp log
when the special agent asked ist for information on january 4 ist took selected portions of the dhcp logs going back to the original september incidents and extracted all entries containing the word “ghost” here is a typical entry
sep 25 164242 wallstreet dhcpd dhcprequest for 18556215 from 00235a735ffb ghostlaptop via 185501
it shows the “ghostlaptop” machine with mac address 00235a735ffb connecting on september 25 with the assigned ip address 18556215
there were no records in the extracted dhcp logs for late october 2010 through january 2011 which includes the period of the most downloading activity in december 2010 this is because swartz had assigned the ghostlaptop machine a static ip address for those downloading episodes static addresses are not recorded in the dhcp log
ist’s policy is to retain dhcp logs for at most 30 days so a record from september 25 2010 should not have been available on january 4 2011 exceptions for longer retention periods can be made with the approval of the office of the general counsel in this case the relevant dhcp log excerpts were retained because of the activity being investigated in september and october but approval from the ogc was not sought at the
2 mac addresses and ip addresses can also both be changed by the computer’s user as aaron swartz did see section ia
￼
appendix 7 records produced by mit to law enforcement  120
time noting this the review panel recommends that ist revisit mit’s records retention policies and practices to ensure that practice aligns with policy
7c radius server logs
mit’s remote authentication dial in user service radius controls access to various network services like wireless mobile services or printing the radius server log records this activity the radius log has little information beyond the mac address and ip address of the requesting computer not even showing what service was requested here is a sample entry
thu jan 6 132652 2011  auth login ok 004ce5a0c756 from client 18618714 port 7 cli 004ce5a0c756
radius logs were not used by ist in its fall 2010 investigation of the downloading episodes however the logs in principle could have provided useful information ist therefore supplied radius entries in response to the request of the secret service for relevant electronic records while the request was made on january 4 2011 the information was provided on january 25 2011 the logs that were produced covered the day of january 6 2011
mit does not have a formal policy covering the radius logs in practice they are treated the same as dhcp logs with 30day retention since the information they contain is similar
7d network registration database
the network registration database contains the computer registration information provided by guests and others after the first grand jury indictment on july 14 2011 mit received a request for the registration information pertaining to gary host and grace host and mit provided six registration records to the lead prosecutor on september 28 2011 here for example is one of the six records provided
00235a735ffb0visitornullnull00gary hostghostmailinatorcom
nullnull529sep201024sep2010224619030sep 2010125746182635
the record shows the registration system on september 29 2010 reprocessing a registration for the gary host computer with mac address 00235a735ffb that was made on september 24 2010 with a registration to expire on september 30 2010
mit has no specific policy governing registration database records
appendix 7 records produced by mit to law enforcement  121
7e packet stream
the stream of data packets to and from the suspect computer was captured by the mit network engineer and recorded on an mit laptop this was accomplished within the network as mentioned in part 1 without making physical connection to the laptop or to the cable connecting the laptop to the mit network the recorded streams consisted only of the data packets directed to and originating from that specific suspect machine there were about 87 gb in all consisting almost entirely of jstor articles in pdf format the exception was a small amount of control information that would be visible to all machines connected to the same subnet
a hard drive with the captured packets was given to the secret service special agent on january 25 2011 in response to a request made by the agent on january 24 2011
there is no explicit ist policy governing packet streams capturing them is a very rare occurrence it had been done fewer than five times in the previous five years streams are never captured as part of routine maintenance but only for investigation
appendix 8 mit and open access publishing
mit has a history of being an early innovator in support of open access to scholarship research and educational materials these efforts are a direct outgrowth of mit’s mission to “advance knowledge and educate students in science technology and other areas of scholarship that will best serve the nation and the world in the 21st century” and to “working with others to bring this knowledge to bear on the world’s greatest challenges” mit’s researchers were instrumental in the origin and development of the free software and opensource software movements and in recent years mit has taken the lead with groundbreaking projects in four major areas related to open access publishing many of these efforts are described on the mit libraries scholarly publishing website httplibrariesmiteduscholarly which emphasizes how authors can retain and use their rights so that work produced at mit can be openly shared
the four major areas include open educational resources open institutional repositories open access to scholarly publications and massive open online courses
8a open educational resources opencourseware
in 2000 when many universities were exploring how they could profit from selling their course material for distance learning mit faculty proposed making mit’s courses openly available on the web for free viewing and reuse from anywhere in the world in order to advance knowledge and education worldwide mit’s unprecedented launch of opencourseware or ocw began with a first proofofconcept in 2002 with funding by the hewlett and the mellon foundations ten years later 2150 courses had been published at the httpocwmitedu following mit’s launch opencourseware has been adopted so extensively that in 2008 a nonprofit organization called the opencourseware consortium was created to coordinate the efforts of over 250 universities and associated organizations who collectively share more than 13000 open courses course content is made available under an open creative commons license to maximize the possibility for remixing and reuse
8b open repository software dspace
in 2002 mit libraries partnered with hewlettpackard to release the first public version of dspace httpdspacemitedu opensource repository software which is used for storing accessing and preserving scholarly and educational digital content and making it openly accessible dspace software has become one of the main platforms for universities to provide open access to their dissertations research reports research data and faculty articles approximately 1400 universities and other organizations have adopted the dspace software and are offering live repositories using it mit’s version of
122
dspace contains approximately 60000 items authored at mit all openly available around the world mit consistently ranks at or near the top of repository rankings which assess impact and openness through a variety of measures
8c open access to mit scholarly publications
in 2009 the mit faculty voted to make their scholarly articles openly available on the web through mit’s open access repository dspacemit in the first such allinstitution facultywide vote in the us the faculty established an open access policy because they are “committed to disseminating the fruits of their research and scholarship as widely as possible” the policy followed a model first adopted at harvard’s faculty of arts and sciences which has subsequently been taken up at more than 20 other universities in the united states through their open access policy the mit faculty have made over 8800 articles—onethird of the research articles they have published since the policy’s inception—openly available to the world these articles have been downloaded over 900000 times and have been met with gratitude from a wide range of readers including students and researchers in developing nations journalists independent scholars patient advocates and job seekers
8d massive open online courses mitx and edx
in late 2011 mit launched mitx a notforprofit online learning initiative that offers complete mit courses in an interactive online learning platform through opensource software in the spring of 2012 mit and harvard jointly launched a broader initiative as an outgrowth of mitx called edx to offer free online courses to students around the world as well as those on their own campuses since that announcement more than 28 other colleges and universities have joined the edx consortium and hundreds of institutions around the world have expressed interest in collaborating about 50 courses are available to the world with hundreds of thousands of individuals already participating
mit’s and its faculty’s efforts to launch and nurture programs that make mit’s research and teaching openly available have not emerged by accident these programs reflect mit’s core mission and most deeply held values
appendix 8 mit and open access publishing  123
appendix 9 some prior relevant incidents at mit
this appendix describes three prior incidents where the mit community became embroiled in controversy related to hacking or other use of electronics unlike the situation with aaron swartz these incidents involved registered mit students they provide relevant background and they may hold lessons to consider when looking ahead
9a david lamacchia 1994
the first incident reaches back two decades like the aaron swartz case it shows how easily events can escalate with internetrelated misdeeds when federal law enforcement becomes involved it also offers an example of prompt attention by mit to the issue of authorized access
the lamacchia incident began in november 1993 at a time when mit information systems was cooperating with the fbi to investigate a case of individuals based in denmark who were accessing mit workstations to stage penetrations of us government computers during the course of the investigation the fbi asked mit if they knew anything about two particular workstations in the student center mit did not notice anything suspicious about them but about a week later some students reported that these supposedly idle workstations were running with a large amount of disk activity information systems and technology ist investigated and discovered that mit sophomore david lamacchia had set up an open file service protocol fsp server which was being used as a transfer bulletin board for computer games and other copyrighted software at that point ist responded to the fbi’s earlier question
lamacchia might have been charged with criminal copyright infringement but in 1994 copyright infringement was not a criminal act if there was no profit motive involved and lamacchia was not engaged in any forprofit activity the boston us attorney’s office initially wanted to charge him with exceeding authorized access under the computer fraud and abuse act1 the same act that swartz was indicted under but mit refused to affirm that lamacchia had exceeded authorized access according to mit policy mit students had full access to these workstations including root access and were authorized to make any legal nondestructive use of them the relationship of aaron swartz’s actions and a legal interpretation of his access to mit’s network is more complex
lamacchia was indicted by a federal grand jury in april 1994 for conspiracy to commit wire fraud he brought a motion to dismiss the case was decided in us federal district

appendix 9 some prior relevant incidents at mit  125
court in december 19942 with district judge stearns referencing the supreme court decision in us v dowling to effectively rule that the wire fraud statute could not be used to prosecute copyright infringement and the case was dismissed
subsequently the fact that lamacchia could not be prosecuted for criminal copyright infringement became referred to as the “lamacchia loophole” congress closed this loophole in 1997 with passage of the no electronic theft act3 which modifies copyright law to include some forms of noncommercial infringement within the scope of criminal infringement4
despite the 20year gap some of the same people were involved in the swartz and lamacchia incidents the lead prosecutor in the aaron swartz case was deputy chief of the criminal division of the boston us attorneys office during the lamacchia case and he met at one point with lamacchia’s defense counsel also andrew good aaron swartz’s initial defense attorney was a member of the lamacchia defense team
the lamacchia case attained national notoriety it was not on the same scale as the aaron swartz case but it did gain attention from congress and it prompted a change in us law5
the charges of unauthorized access that the usao initially contemplated filing against david lamacchia and the actual charges of wire fraud filed against him were similar to the charges filed against aaron swartz6 this observation was not made by mit during the swartz prosecution and not brought to the attention of the usao
the swartz and lamacchia cases were separated by 20 years insofar as the review team has been able to determine despite the similarities in the two cases there was no institutional memory inside of mit spanning these 20 years and so no mention of david lamacchia as a precedent in any deliberations around aaron swartz by the mit administration or the office of the general counsel and no discussion of mit’s attitude towards a charge of unauthorized access7 part v of this report poses the question of what

3 see “net act” 
4 the no electronic theft act the “net act” amended the copyright act making it applicable to the
conduct in which lamacchia engaged it did not amend the wire fraud act the review panel has not examined the reasons as to why the prosecution chose to not pursue a charge against aaron swartz under the net act

appendix 9 some prior relevant incidents at mit  126
mit might do to better preserve its institutional memory in the hope of being better prepared for future challenges
9b andrew huang 2002
the microsoft xbox was a video game console introduced in 2001 it was designed to run only particular software licensed by microsoft using cryptographic methods to implement this restriction microsoft’s licensing revenue for the software subsidized the cost of the machine thus making it a powerful computer at a low price in 2002 andrew “bunnie” huang a graduate student working in computer design at the mit artificial intelligence laboratory ai lab discovered how to bypass this restriction and thereby make xboxes usable as generalpurpose computers with potentially serious consequences for microsoft’s product plans8 huang posted a description of the method in his blog
soon afterward an engineer with the microsoft xbox team contacted huang and asked him to remove the posting huang informed his advisor who cautioned him that the posting might be a violation of the digital millennium copyright act9 and suggested asking mit lawyers for help10 huang asked and the response he received was a letter stating
   the article is your personal work and not part of your studies research or other activities at mit    as an mit lawyer i am not able to provide you with any legal advice concerning it   
huang described the predicament to his advisor and some other faculty members at the mit artificial intelligence laboratory one of them arranged for huang to get pro bono assistance from the electronic frontier foundation eff the eff attorney advised that as a precautionary measure huang should emphasize the academic aspects of his work by rewriting it as a scholarly paper and sending this to microsoft for approval following dmca guidelines for publication huang wrote the paper and the faculty who were advising him arranged to publish it as an artificial intelligence laboratory memorandum11 at the same time they informally contacted microsoft executives
8 huang’s method involved connecting a hardware probe to the xbox board to read out the secret keys that needed to be presented by the licensed software to the xbox processor the fact that he was able to do this demonstrated an important security vulnerability in the xbox
9 the digital millennium copyright act dmca 18 usc §1201a criminalizes the production or distribution of technology designed to circumvent access control mechanisms
10 at this time mit did not have a general counsel’s office the lawyer contacted was one of mits intellectual property counsels—a group that was part of the mit technology licensing office

in 2013 huang released a free reprinting of his book in honor of aaron swartz he also wrote in his blog
aaron’s treatment by mit is not unfamiliar to me     i still remember the crushing disappointment of receiving a letter from mit legal repudiating any association with my work effectively leaving me on my own to face microsoft however in my case the faculty of my thenlab the ai lab were outraged by this treatment they openly defied mit legal by publishing my work as an official ai lab memo thereby granting me greater negotiating leverage with microsoft microsoft mindful of the potential backlash from the court of public opinion over suing an openly legitimized academic researcher came to a civil understanding with me over the issue13
this example points to the flexibility available without the presence of outside law enforcement it also illustrates the point that when it is a student who has a situation like this it naturally brings in additional members of the mit community

on september 21 2007 mit sophomore star simpson was arrested at gunpoint at boston’s logan airport simpson who had gone to the airport to meet her boyfriend entered terminal c wearing homemade electronic jewelry a lapel pin consisting of circuit board with flashing leds which she had built in her free time at the mit electronic research society club airport employees mistook this for a bomb and called airport security and the police simpson was accused of disorderly conduct and possession of a hoax device a charge that could have resulted in up to five years in state prison14 simpson was sentenced to pretrial probation and ordered to perform community service the charges were eventually dropped
on the same day as the arrest before anyone in the mit administration had spoken with simpson the mit news office issued a press release saying that “as reported to us by

authorities ms simpson’s actions were reckless and understandably created alarm at the airport” many members of the mit community did not view simpson’s behavior as reckless they were upset at what they regarded to be an unwarranted and prejudicial public statement by the institute to the detriment of one of its members
at the october 17 2007 faculty meeting several faculty members introduced for discussion a resolution proposing that “the mit faculty request that the mit administration refrain from making public statements that characterize    the behavior and motives of members of the mit community whose actions are the subject    of pending criminal investigation” the resolution was taken up at the following december 19 faculty meeting it was eventually voted down 3136 after two hours of vehement debate which included the offering and defeat of several alternative resolutions in the end none of the resolutions were adopted but the intensity of the meeting made a lasting impression on the administration at the may 2008 faculty meeting president susan hockfield expressed regret over her administration’s handling of the case she stated that the administration regretted its public statement that the decision to make the statement was rushed and that it included a poor choice of words15
these october and december faculty meetings and the proposed resolution were cited by the administration as part of the reasoning for not making a statement about aaron swartz see section iiia3

appendix 10 legal analysis of mit’s provision of documents and packet capture
mit engaged in its own investigation of the jstor downloading events beginning in september 2010 mit cooperated with law enforcement once it became involved starting january 4 2011 the purpose of this appendix is to provide some legal framework and analysis for the actions of mit regarding the capture and disclosure of electronic data
on four separate occasions mit produced electronic data to law enforcement regarding aaron swartz’s use of the mit network 1 on january 5 2011 prior to his arrest it produced records concerning the downloading engaged in by aaron swartz that is “metadata” 2 on january 25 2011 it produced packet data that is electronic communications including the articles downloaded by aaron swartz 3 on may 6 2011 it produced a cd with copies of the data already produced and 4 in september 2011 it produced additional metadata see the report ib appendix 7 the third set of data was produced pursuant to grand jury subpoena and the fourth was produced by mit under the belief that it was responding to a valid subpoena a belief that may not have been true the analysis below indicates that all four sets of data were properly produced by mit although for different reasons
10a thefederallawsprotectingelectroniccommunications
the two federal laws governing the interception and disclosure of electronic communications are 1 the electronic communications protections act ecpa 18 usc § 2510 et seq and 2 the stored electronic communications act seca 18 usc § 2701 et seq as their names imply they address primarily electronic communications in transit and electronic communications when they are stored
10a1 the electronic communications were lawfully disclosed
ecpa defines an electronic communication very broadly1 it is
any transfer of signs signals writing images sounds data or intelligence of any nature transmitted in whole or in part by a wire radio electromagnetic photoelectronic or photooptical system that affects interstate or foreign commerce    
1 18 usc § 251012 this definition includes several exceptions which are left out of the quoted portion and do not concern this report
129
￼
appendix 10 legal analysis of mit’s provision of documents and packet capture  130
the jstor articles downloaded by aaron swartz were electronic communications arguably the instructions communicated by his laptop to jstor’s servers asking for these articles also fell within the scope of this definition
ecpa prohibits both the “interception” of electronic communications and the disclosure of such intercepted communications except under certain delineated circumstances the prohibition against interception provides2
except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter any person who—
a intentionally intercepts endeavors to intercept or procures any other person to intercept or endeavor to intercept any wire oral or electronic communication    is in violation of law
the prohibition against disclosure reads3
whoever intentionally discloses or endeavors to disclose to any other person the contents of any wire oral or electronic communication knowing or having reason to know that the information was obtained through the interception of a wire oral or electronic communication in violation of this subsection is in violation of law
a careful reading of both of these provisions reveals that their application depends upon the meaning of the words “intercept” and “interceptions” the term “intercept” is defined by ecpa as the “aural or other acquisition of the contents of any wire electronic or oral communication through the use of any electronic mechanical or other device”4 on the surface this is a very broad definition of “intercept” however two provisions appearing elsewhere in ecpa limit the applicable scope of this definition
the first of these5 allows the provider of an “electronic communications service” such as mit’s network services “whose facilities are used in the transmission of an electronic communication” to
intercept disclose or use that communication in the normal course of his employment while engaged in any activity which is a necessary incident to the rendition of his service or to the protection of the rights or property of the provider of that service    
2 18 usc § 25111a
3 18 usc § 25111c
4 18 usc § 25104
5 18 usc § 25112ai
￼
appendix 10 legal analysis of mit’s provision of documents and packet capture  131
under this provision the conduct of mit’s ist personnel during the period between the discovery on january 4 2011 of the laptop in the network closet in the dorrance building and aaron swartz’s arrest on january 6 comprised activity that was necessary to the “protection of the rights and property” of mit’s network thus the monitoring and capture of communications flowing over the mit network during this period while in transit between swartz’s laptop and jstor’s servers was lawful6
the second exception concerns the doctrine of oneparty consent ecpa permits a person whether a law enforcement officer or otherwise to intercept an electronic communication where one of the parties to the communication “has given prior consent to such interception”7 here the discussions between mit libraries and jstor in the months leading up to the arrest of aaron swartz indicate that mit had jstor’s permission to intercept the articles being downloaded and the accompanying electronic signals in an effort to identify the perpetrator and to stop him8
since the interception of these communications was lawful the prohibition against disclosure of intercepted communications did not apply that prohibition only applies to the disclosure of communications obtained through an interception that is in violation of ecpa9 electronic communications were produced by mit to law enforcement on two occasions packet data on january 25 2011 and a copy of the packet data on may 6 2011 for the reasons here discussed these productions were permissible under ecpa
10a2 the metadata was lawfully disclosed
we now turn to seca specifically its provisions regarding metadata
in substantial part seca protects electronic communications that have been stored10 these provisions are not at issue here as the electronic communications produced by mit to the government were not taken from electronic storage but were monitored and captured in real time on the mit network
6 we take note of the fact that at no time did mit “tap” into the cable connecting swartz’s laptop computer to mit’s network thus all of the communications at issue were captured while flowing through the mit network and the exceptions to the prohibition found in ecpa as here noted apply
7 18 usc § 25112d
8 as we noted above jstor asked mit to stop the downloading and instructed mit as follows “we are requesting that every effort be made to identify the individuals responsible and to ensure that the content taken in this incident and those previously mentioned is secured and deleted” see section ia
9 18 usc § 25111c

10 seca is sometimes interpreted as applying to only communications being stored pending transmittal to the intended recipient and once that transmission is accomplished its protections no longer apply—even where a copy of the communication remains in electronic storage jennings v jennings 401 sc 1 2011 cert denied jennings v broom  us  2013 us lexis 1301 april 15 2013
￼
appendix 10 legal analysis of mit’s provision of documents and packet capture  132
seca also addresses metadata concerning electronic communications eg records of session times and durations dates of commencement of communications and network addresses similar to ecpa seca contains an exception to the prohibition regarding disclosure of the information that it covers this being where the disclosure is necessary to protect the rights and property of the communications service provider11 the metadata produced to the prosecution before the arrest of aaron swartz falls into this scenario
seca also provides that records of electronic communications can be produced pursuant to a grand jury subpoena and certain other administrative or judicial orders12 the copy of the metadata data reproduced in may 2011 falls under this provision as mit turned it over pursuant to the grand jury subpoena served on january 27 2011
however as noted above in september 2011 ist turned over additional network flow data concerning aaron swartz’s downloads this was done under the possibly mistaken belief that the january 27 subpoena was still valid and effective assuming for the sake of argument that this belief was wrong and the subpoena was no longer valid see section 10c below mit was nonetheless legally justified in disclosing these materials to the prosecution a good faith reliance on the validity of a subpoena demanding records of electronic communications legally protects the service provider from a claim that it acted in violation of seca13
we also note that ecpa 18 usc § 25112h expressly allows a provider of electronic communication services to
record the fact that a wire or electronic communication was initiated or completed in order to protect such provider another provider furnishing service toward the completion of the wire or electronic communication or a user of that service from fraudulent unlawful or abusive use of such service
for these reasons mit was not prohibited by either seca or ecpa from disclosing to law enforcement the metadata it collected
10b massachusettslawregardingelectroniccommunications
the massachusetts wiretap act is worded somewhat differently than ecpa it too allows a communications provider to intercept communications to protect the rights or property
11 18 usc § 2702c3
12 18 usc § 2703c2
13 sams v yahoo 713 f3d 1175 9th cir 2013 the review panel expresses no opinion as to whether
the prosecution could introduce such material at trial if the january 27 subpoena was no longer valid at the time that the prosecution asked mit for this information

appendix 10 legal analysis of mit’s provision of documents and packet capture  133
of such provider14 with regard to subsequent disclosure of a communication that has been intercepted—whether lawfully or unlawfully—such disclosure is a violation of the act15 unless either 1 it is “a necessary incident to the rendition of service or to the protection of the rights or property of the carrier of such communication   ” or 2 it is pursuant to a judicially issued warrant16 however during the joint federalstate investigation of aaron swartz’s activities concerning the mit network federal law—and not the massachusetts wiretap act—applied to mit the secret service and the cambridge police department
where an investigation is primarily federal in nature regardless of whether there is involvement by state or local law enforcement the federal ecpa supersedes the massachusetts wiretap act17 where the investigation is joint in nature but is primarily “stateoriented” then the massachusetts wiretap act applies18 the critical fact that determines the nature of the investigation is not where the case is ultimately prosecuted eg in the federal or state court but rather the nature and direction of the investigation at the time the conduct at issue occurs19
given the circumstances of the aaron swartz investigation and the nature of the joint federalstate investigation and subsequent prosecution federal and not state law applied to the interception and disclosure of aaron swartz’s communications across the mit network
10c document production
during the course of the investigation and prosecution of aaron swartz mit produced numerous documents as well as electronic copies of the articles downloaded by aaron swartz from jstor we take the opportunity to examine mit’s decisions regarding such production and law enforcement’s use of its subpoena power
beginning on january 4 2011 mit’s ist produced information to law enforcement this was part of ist’s own attempt to protect its network and to assist law enforcement in doing the same mit’s ogc was consulted by ist about the propriety of producing these materials and ogc gave its approval ogc’s focus was on the following issues 1 there was no personal identifying information in the material to be produced 2 the perpetrator was misusing mit’s network possibly committing a crime and injuring jstor and mit wished to cooperate with law enforcement

appendix 10 legal analysis of mit’s provision of documents and packet capture  134
after the arrest of aaron swartz ist continued to produce documents to law enforcement without initially further consultation with ogc apparently ist considered the initial advice provided by ogc to still govern despite the fact that the situation had changed mit was no longer disclosing communications in an effort to protect its network but to assist law enforcement in a possible criminal prosecution had mit continued to intercept communications between jstor and the laptop of aaron swartz for more than an incidental period of time after his arrest then this exception to ecpa20 would not apply however the interceptions essentially stopped at this point as the laptop was removed from its connection in the sipb office thus all of these interceptions were lawfully obtained and disclosed
in late january 2011 the prosecution served a grand jury subpoena on mit seeking a large number of documents and mit produced documents and information pursuant to this subpoena thereafter mit insisted upon being served with a subpoena before agreeing to produce additional matter that it considered to be outside the scope of the initial subpoena
two grand juries appear to have been involved in the investigation and prosecution of aaron swartz the first of which issued the two subpoenas and returned the initial indictment and a second which returned the superseding indictment21
in september 2011 the prosecution asked for and received additional information from ist this was produced by mit under the belief that it was covered by the initial subpoena served in january 2011 however it is unlikely that this initial subpoena was still valid in that the first grand jury had completed its work it had returned its indictment and no evidence appears that it was continuing its investigation into additional crimes additional defendants or an expanded scope of the offenses already charged22 the prosecution did not notify mit of this apparent fact thus mit unknowingly and unintentionally may have produced documents to the prosecution without benefit of a court order that is without benefit of a subpoena as noted above mit’s conduct in this regard was proper23
20 18 usc § 25112ai see also oneparty consent doctrine discussed above

21 the review panel concludes that two grand juries were used from the following facts first the names of the foremen who signed the two indictments are different second grand juries usually sit for only 18 months and the time period between the issuance of the first subpoena from the presumed first grand jury in january 2011 and the return of the superseding indictment in september 2012 is some 20 months
22 as noted in appendix 13 the prosecution may not use a grand jury to conduct additional investigation the purpose of which is to prepare for trial

appendix 11 comments on the computer fraud and abuse act charges against aaron swartz
the way in which mit’s rules of access to its network interact with possible charges under the computer fraud and abuse act cfaa is an important lesson for mit and is discussed in part v of the report here we discuss the interaction of mit’s rules of use with the charges brought against aaron swartz an interaction that would have been sorted out in the hearings or the trial had they occurred
the initial indictment against aaron swartz contained four counts each alleging a different violation of law ie a different legal theory the superseding indictment took these four counts and the events described in them “unbundled” these counts and created 13 counts out of the initial four also the theory of criminality in the last count was expanded
we briefly examine those counts alleging violations of the cfaa as they involve mit
count 3 of the initial indictment and counts 8 through 12 of the superseding indictment allege that aaron swartz “unlawfully obtained information from a protected computer” in this instance the computers at issue are the servers at jstor and the network servers and routers at mit which are included as protected computers under the act inasmuch as they affect interstate commerce since they are connected to the internet in the superseding indictment only counts 9 and 12 directly address mit’s computers with counts 8 10 and 11 addressing jstor’s computers
the initial indictment alleged that aaron swartz used two unlawful means of accessing these protected computers through “unauthorized access” and by “exceeding authorized access” the superseding indictment abandoned the second legal theory we take the time to examine both theories as they might have been applied to mit
the authorizing of “access” to a computer is made by the owner or administrator of the computer here that would be mit the terms and conditions of that access are found in mit’s terms of service known at mit as “mitnet rules of use”
11a exceedingauthorizedaccess
the first request made by the government for the mitnet rules of use that were in effect during the period of excessive downloading was made by the lead prosecutor by email on july 28 2011 this was almost two weeks after the first indictment had been returned mit produced them the same day on august 4 the lead prosecutor asked mit

responded the same day the rules of use were

don’t violate the privacy of other users
don’t interfere with the integrity of the system
don’t copy or misuse copyrighted material including software don’t use the network to harass anyone in any way
don’t restrict or deny access to the network by legitimate users
don’t use the network for private financial gain
the only
however inasmuch as mit had held license from jstor for authorized users to copy jstor’s articles it appears open to dispute whether swartz’s conduct exceeded authorized access on the mit network this analysis does not address issues of authorized access to jstor’s network this was not a question raised or discussed by mit or brought to the attention of the usao1
several other terms may appear applicable such as
no 3 “don’t interfere with the integrity of the system” however although aaron swartz clearly interfered with the integrity of the jstor system he never interfered with the integrity of the mit system to which this term seems directed2
no 5 “do not harass” however harassment has an element of intent and there is little indication that aaron swartz had as his purpose the goal to harass anyone and
no 6 “do not deny the system to other users” however although it is true that for two brief periods of time jstor cut off the mit campus from its services in response to the massive downloading here aaron swartz did not himself deny or intend to deny the system to other users
1 we again note that the superseding indictment returned in september 2012 eliminated “exceeding unauthorized access” as the basis for any of its counts in view of jstor’s terms of service the review panel makes no findings as to whether swartz’s conduct exceeded authorized access on jstor’s network
2 we note the doctrine of lenity discussed in appendix 13 which requires the application and interpretation of criminal laws to be narrowly drawn and where ambiguous in favor of the defendant
term of use rule clearly applicable to swartz’s conduct was the fourth
￼
appendix 11 comments on the cfaa charges against aaron swartz  137
the review panel draws no conclusion as to whether aaron swartz did or did not exceed authorized access on the mit network we also remark that consistent with its posture of neutrality mit made no effort to clarify whether the conduct alleged violated its rules of use
11b unauthorizedaccess
the superseding indictment abandoned the theory of “exceeding authorized access” and counts 9 and 12 applicable to mit relied instead on “unauthorized access” the allegations in the indictment focus on numerous means whereby aaron swartz obtained access to the computer through unauthorized means such as repeatedly taking steps to change his computer’s apparent identities and to conceal his computer’s real identity clearly these are means whereby aaron swartz obtained access to the computer in order to engage in unauthorized conduct that is to do something that mit did not want him to do through its network engage in massive downloading of jstor articles
the question posed by this charge in the indictment is however different it is whether— given mit’s guest policy—aaron swartz accessed the mit network without authorization put differently it is whether aaron swartz was authorized to access the network regardless of whether he used improper means to do so to illustrate this distinction the review panel has asked itself the following question had swartz intending to engage in the conduct for which he was indicted walked into an mit library shown his personal identification to the desk and asked to log on to the mit system as a guest—would he then have been given access if the answer to this question is “yes” then it seems possible that aaron swartz’s access to the mit network was authorized notwithstanding his inappropriate means of implementing access or of then abusing such access which may themselves have been violations of different criminal or civil prohibitions
the cambridge detective involved in the prosecution explained to the review panel that he repeatedly asked in various ways whether the laptop was authorized to be in closet whether the cable from the laptop to the network switch was authorized to be there whether the manner of downloading the articles was authorized and overall whether the method of accessing and using mit’s network in this manner was authorized he was told “no” and told that mit had tried to prevent the downloading by disconnecting the computer of the then unknown suspect
the review panel questioned five employees of mit’s ist who were involved in the identification and monitoring of aaron swartz’s laptop found in the network closet of building 16 and who provided information to the prosecution during its preparation of the criminal case according to them and also according to ogc and mit’s outside counsel at no time either before or after the arrest of aaron swartz did anyone from the
appendix 11 comments on the cfaa charges against aaron swartz  138
prosecution inquire as to whether aaron swartz had authorized access to the mit network3 given mit’s open guest policy it might be argued that aaron swartz accessed the mit network with authorization 4 put differently there is apparently an issue as to whether aaron swartz was authorized to access the network regardless of the considerations that 1 he might have used improper means to implement such access and 2 once he was on the network he might have used such access for an improper purpose
the relevance of this distinction can be seen in the department of justice’s computer crime manual prosecuting computer crime 2nd ed5 published by the office of legal education executive office for united states attorneys
a more difficult question is whether a person with some authorization to access a computer can ever act “without authorization” with respect to that computer the case law on this issue is muddy but as discussed below there is growing consensus that such “insiders” cannot act “without authorization” unless and until their authorization to access the computer is rescinded6
as far as the review panel could determine mit was never asked by either the prosecution or the defense whether aaron swartz’s access to the mit network was authorized or unauthorized—nor did mit ask this of itself7 given that 1 mit was the

3 the cambridge detective also told the review panel that in the later stages of the prosecution he asked ist personnel whether aaron swartz was authorized to access the network and was told that he did not none of the ist personnel questioned by the prosecution recall such a question being asked and the review panel has found no indication that the secret service agent or the federal prosecutors made such an inquiry

5 httpwwwjusticegovcriminalcybercrimedocsccmanualpdf
6 there is also complexity and ambiguity in the definition of exceeding authorized access the manual states
the cfaa defines “exceeds authorized access” as “to access a computer with authorization and to use such access to obtain or alter information in the computer that the accesser is not entitled so to obtain or alter”

accordingly to prove that someone has “exceeded authorized access” prosecutors should be prepared to present evidence showing a how the person’s authority to obtain or alter information on the computer was limited rather than absolute and b how the person exceeded those limitations in obtaining or altering information
7 the review panel asked the following question of five ist employees who were involved in the events around discovery of the laptop “was aaron swartz authorized to access the mit network” it received the following answers
1 probably yes
2 after mit began trying to disconnect the laptop from the mit network no

appendix 11 comments on the cfaa charges against aaron swartz  139
alleged victim of counts 9 and 12 2 the mit access policy its rules of use and its own interpretation of those rules of use including the significance or “materiality” of any violation of those terms were at the heart of the government’s cfaa allegations in counts in both indictments and 3 this policy and these rules were written interpreted and applied by mit for mit’s own mission and goals—not those of the government— the review panel wonders why
11c losses exceeding five thousand dollars
the indictments alleged that mit suffered more than 5000 in losses due to aaron swartz’s conduct under the cfaa the term “loss” is defined8 as
any reasonable cost to any victim including the cost of responding to an offense conducting a damage assessment and restoring the data program system or information to its condition prior to the offense and any revenue lost cost incurred or other consequential damages incurred because of interruption of service
the only “loss” as defined above—here being “out of pocket costs” incurred by mit resulting from swartz’s conduct—was the cost of copying documents and the cost of the surveillance camera placed in the basement closet of the dorrance building on january 4 2011 these totaled less than 50009 all other expenses were attributable to salaried personnel who would have been paid their full salary whether these events had or had not occurred thus from mit’s perspective the review panel does not find that mit suffered losses relevant for cfaa exceeding 5000 resulting from the conduct of aaron swartz10
3 his means of access was not authorized but he personally was authorized as a guest
4 it is unclear
5 there is no black and white or yes or no answer since 1987 the mit policies regarding its network
have been implemented with the intent to educate and guide never to litigate as a guest he had authorization to access the mit network but he was not authorized to get on the system the way he did
the review panel did not request of mit a formal answer to this question inasmuch as the purpose of this review was not to assess the government’s allegations in this case but rather to study how mit responded to events similarly the review panel draws no conclusions as to whether the other counts in the indictment did or did not have merit as they might pertain to mit or whether swartz’s access of the jstor system was or was not lawful
8 18 usc § 1030e11
9 alternatively one might argue that the few days that jstor severed mit from its service was a “loss” suffered by mit that could be determined by prorating mit’s yearly payment of service fees to jstor however to the knowledge of the review panel this calculation was never made or sought

10 the review panel’s finding would be different if mit had hired outside personnel to conduct the necessary investigation or had paid its own personnel overtime to do so see del monte fresh produce na inc v chiquita brands int’l inc 616 f supp 2d 805 811 nd ill 2009 “the cfaa states that a company that pays for damage assessment may satisfy the loss requirement” we note that in united

whether or not this 5000 jurisdictional amount was met by the actual losses incurred by mit appears to be relevant to only count 4 of the initial indictment and count 13 of the superseding indictment pertaining to damages caused by intentional or reckless conduct the remaining counts brought under the cfaa counts 2 and 3 and counts 3 through 12 of the initial and superseding indictments respectively include for their jurisdictional amounts the value sought or obtained by the conduct and not merely the actual loss caused by the conduct thus the number and value of the jstor articles downloaded by aaron swartz would be included when calculating the jurisdictional amount for these other counts
￼states v middleton 231 f3d 1207 9th cir 2000 the court found that where a computer had been damaged and its problems needed to be fixed it was appropriate to use the prorated time spent by employees to fix those problems as the value of the damage here however no damage was caused to the mit computer no problems were fixed and the review panel concludes that middleton is not applicable
appendix 12 letter from jstor to its publishers
this is the full text of the june 10 2011 letter from jstor to its publishers as discussed in report section iiia4
dear colleagues–
i am writing to make you aware that jstor experienced a significant misuse of its database in which a substantial portion of the content was downloaded in an unauthorized fashion using the network at one of our participating universities the situation has been remedied and the data are secure though i wanted to alert you given the scale of the incident and to share additional steps we are taking to prevent these occurrences in the future
the content that was taken was systematically downloaded using an approach designed to avoid detection by our monitoring systems fortunately we were able to uncover the activity and worked with the institution to isolate the source on campus and to stop it an individual believed to be responsible for this activity was later identified we understand this person was not affiliated with the school
our highest priority has been to secure the content and ensure that it not be distributed i am pleased to report that the data have been turned over and we have received a signed agreement from the individual identified in which this person confirmed that the downloaded content has not and will not be used copied transferred or disseminated
we have also undertaken a review of our monitoring systems to guard against future efforts of this kind stroz friedberg a firm specializing in this area has been retained to help us enhance the security of our systems as well as our monitoring techniques additionally we have contracted with attributor experts in antipiracy solutions used by many publishers to monitor the internet for content that might have been inappropriately downloaded from jstor
this is a matter that we take very seriously over the years jstor has had practices in place to monitor for excessive usage as well as to locate and remove copies of materials online that people may have inadvertently or inappropriately taken from jstor and subsequently posted elsewhere we will continue to develop and improve our systems to be responsible stewards of your content
i invite you to call or email me with any questions you may have about this situation sincerely

appendix 13 legal procedure and practice in criminal investigations and prosecutions
the investigation and prosecution of aaron swartz was in many ways a straightforward matter and in other ways very complex however both categories of the relevant activity are outside the experience of most laypersons as well as that of many attorneys who do not practice criminal law or who are not familiar with the laws governing computer crime and electronic communications

the united states department of justice doj is the primary law enforcement agency of the united states although its role inside the federal government is not limited to the handling of criminal matters a more thorough understanding of the doj and its multiple functions may be found on its website httpwwwusdojgov
the head of the department of justice is the attorney general who is a cabinetlevel official appointed by the president and confirmed by the us senate under him are a deputy attorney general and an associate attorney general and various assistant attorneys general aags all of whom are similarly appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate
the doj is divided into numerous divisions including for example the criminal civil civil rights and environmental crimes divisions each of which is headed by an assistant attorney general the doj also includes multiple agencies that have their own administrative structures among those agencies are the federal bureau of investigation fbi the marshals service and the us bureau of prisons1 to various extents these agencies and their heads report to the attorney general and those under him
federal prosecutors fall into two categories 1 trial attorneys and their supervisors these being the assistant attorneys general and their deputies and 2 united states attorneys and their assistants called assistant us attorneys ausas
trial attorneys are employed as part of the government’s civil service and are primarily stationed within washington dc they are assigned to various divisions within the doj that have responsibility for prosecuting federal crimes such as but not limited to the criminal division the criminal division itself is divided into various sections and units each of which has a particular area of expertise one of these is the computer and intellectual property section

the united states attorneys are appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate2 their terms are for four years each is assigned responsibility for one of the 94 judicial districts into which the united states is divided although one united states attorney has responsibility for two districts those of guam and the northern mariana islands thus there are 93 united states attorneys the authority of a united states attorney does not extend outside of his or her district
under the us attorney for each district are a number of assistant united states attorneys known as ausas they are not civil servants but are appointed by the attorney general upon the recommendation of the us attorney for a district
to a significant extent the us attorneys and their ausas function autonomously from the doj the interaction between the us attorneys’ offices and the doj is complex for example for most matters trial attorneys from doj must be invited by the us attorney in order to prosecute or assist in the prosecution of a crime in his district otherwise they will not be allowed by the district court to participate in the court proceedings also the use of some criminal statutes to prosecute a defendant such as the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations rico act and the use of some prosecution and investigative techniques such as grants of immunity or wiretaps by a us attorney or ausa must be approved by the appropriate assistant attorney general or division within the doj however as a general matter the following can be said us attorneys and their ausas have primary responsibility for enforcing the federal criminal statutes within their districts and do so without direct supervision or permission from the attorney general or the doj
because the doj has responsibility for the entire united states it sees similar types of criminal cases on a more regular basis than does a typical us attorney’s office that is one of the reasons why its divisions are themselves divided into sections and units each of these smaller subdivisions has an expertise in a particular area of the law in addition to being available to prosecute cases across the country that are within their particular specialties the attorneys within these subdivisions are available for consultation with ausas in the various districts
13b theinvestigativeagencies
although the doj and some us attorneys’ offices have their own investigators and auditors who assist prosecutors in preparing and pursuing a case the investigation of a criminal matter is usually done by a specific agency having independent law enforcement

authority some of these are administratively within the doj such as the fbi the drug enforcement administration and the marshals service others are outside of the doj and are within other departments of the executive branch of the government one such example is the us secret service which is administratively part of the united states department of homeland security others are the various offices of the inspector general oig of various departments and agencies such as the oig for the department of health and human services under all of these scenarios the investigators within these law enforcement agencies do not report to and are not supervised by the prosecutors with whom they work when a case is under investigation or prosecution
federal law enforcement investigators are referred to as “agents” and most agents are categorized and referred to as “special agents” among other powers special agents are authorized to carry and use firearms
13c the federal criminal investigation pre­‐indictment
criminal investigations conducted by the federal government are opened and may be conducted separately by a prosecutor and by a law enforcement agency typically a law enforcement agency such as the secret service will start an investigation and may proceed with it for a significant time before deciding that it wishes to pursue a prosecution at that point the agent handling it or less often his supervisor will meet with a prosecutor such as an ausa and ask that his office also open a criminal investigation at this stage such open investigations are referred to as “matters” how such matters are opened and who is assigned to a matter once opened varies from office to office among the us attorneys’ offices several additional points are worth noting
a prospective defendant does not have to be identified at the time that an investigation or criminal matter is opened similarly it is not necessary to establish that in fact a crime has occurred in order for a criminal matter to be opened it is not uncommon for a matter once opened to be closed when it becomes apparent for example that no crime has occurred that the perpetrator of a crime cannot be found or is outside the reach of the law that the proof necessary to obtain a conviction is not available or that a particular criminal incident is not worth the time and resources needed to successfully prosecute the perpetrator
the arrest of a person who is under investigation is normally accomplished after the issuance of a warrant by a federal judge the application for a warrant is called a “complaint” which describes the evidence known to the prosecution that justifies issuance of the warrant a complaint charges a person with having committed a specified crime the burden that must be carried by the prosecution when seeking an arrest warrant on a complaint is that the evidence show “probable cause” that a crime was committed and that the named defendant committed the crime exculpatory evidence or
appendix 13 legal procedure and practice in criminal investigations and prosecutions  145
possible defenses do not have to be included in the complaint alternatively a law enforcement agent can arrest someone without a warrant if he or she directly observes a suspect commit a serious crime usually a felony in the federal system once such an arrest is made the suspect is promptly brought before a federal judge where the agent explains the evidence that provoked the arrest this is done under oath the judge then decides whether probable cause existed to justify the arrest and if such a ruling is made the suspect—now the “defendant”—is held in custody pending a determination of any terms for his release on bail
for serious crimes ie felonies a defendant has the right to be charged by way of grand jury indictment before being subject to trial conviction and punishment3
a grand jury is composed of 23 persons and conducts its proceedings in secret the grand jurors are selected from a panel of potential jurors much as is a trial jury however for the grand jury the selection process occurs in closed session with a judge and a prosecutor and no defense attorney is present as there is no defendant or potential defendant at this point grand juries usually sit for a period of 18 months and consider a wideranging and continually changing collection of criminal investigations although it is not uncommon for a grand jury to focus upon just one complex investigation in such instances the court may extend a grand jury’s term beyond 18 months if the grand jury is investigating a complex matter and cannot complete the investigation without the extension
quorum for a grand jury is 16 persons and it takes 12 persons to approve or return an indictment the votes occur in secret with no one present but the grand jurors the foreman of the grand jury is one of their members whom they have voted to serve in that role it is this foreman who will sign all of the indictments approved by the grand jury and who will return and “hand up” the indictments to the judge when approved
a grand jury has enormous leeway for conducting investigations it is free to engage in “fishing expeditions” and it can compel witnesses to appear to testify and can compel the production of documents the assistant us attorney serves as counsel to the grand jury giving it legal advice guiding its investigations issuing its subpoenas for witnesses and documents and doing most of the questioning of the witnesses who appear it is the assistant us attorney who drafts the proposed indictments presented for the grand jury’s consideration although in theory the grand jury can propose and draft its indictments as well as issue its own subpoenas and call its own witnesses all of the grand jury’s proceedings are secret to protect the grand jurors from outside influence and
3 the fifth amendment to the constitution provides that “no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury except in cases arising in the land or naval forces or in the militia when in actual service in time of war or public danger”
￼
appendix 13 legal procedure and practice in criminal investigations and prosecutions  146
to prevent potential defendants from learning what the grand jury is investigating and what the prosecutors may have learned about their activities although it is rare that a grand jury refuses to approve a proposed indictment presented to it by an ausa such refusals do occur and the resulting declination is known as a “no bill”
once an indictment has been voted on and approved it is handed up to a judge sitting “above” on a bench by the foreman in what is a straightforward session usually with a prosecutor accompanying the foreman at that time the indictment with the names of the defendants and the facts alleged that set forth the crimes with which they are charged becomes a public document occasionally the prosecutor may ask the judge receiving the indictment to seal it that is to keep out of the public’s view this is usually done in one of two situations where there is concern that the defendants will flee upon learning that they have been charged with criminal offenses before they can be taken into custody and where the grand jury is continuing its investigation and the prosecutor does not want the returned indictment to “tip off” those still under investigation about what the grand jury is investigating and what it knows
the burden that must be met before an indictment may be returned is that 12 grand jurors must find that “probable cause” existed to conclude that the proposed defendant committed the crime or crimes to be charged put simply probable cause means that the facts asserted are probably true and that a crime was probably committed by the defendant once such a finding has been made a warrant for the arrest of the defendant may issue from the court
13d the arrest
as already discussed an arrest can take place upon a warrant issued upon an indictment or a complaint or if a law enforcement officer observes the defendant committing the crime charged
once arrested the defendant must be brought promptly before a judge this is known as the “initial appearance” if no warrant had been issued the judge will hold a hearing to decide whether or not the arrest is justified also bail may be set and counsel may be appointed if the defendant is indigent and cannot afford to retain counsel from his own resources if no indictment is returned within 20 days of an arrest with or without a warrant an additional proceeding known as a “preliminary hearing” may be held where the government will be put to its proof—that is the prosecution will have to introduce evidence before the court subject to cross examination and rebuttal by the defendant demonstrating that probable cause exists that the defendant committed the crime charged if the court concludes that the government has not carried its burden then the charges must be dismissed and the defendant is released from custody or from the terms and conditions of his bond however such a dismissal is usually without prejudice
appendix 13 legal procedure and practice in criminal investigations and prosecutions  147
meaning that the prosecution is able to “try again” after it accumulates more evidence generally prosecutors try to avoid preliminary hearings which can serve as early discovery opportunities for defendants to learn the strengths and weaknesses in the government’s case and try to obtain an indictment either before an arrest is made or within the 20day window before the preliminary hearing must be held
at some point an arraignment will take place an arraignment is where the defendant is advised by the court of the charges in the indictment and their penalties sometimes the court requires the defendant’s attorney to do this and the defendant is asked to enter his plea guilty or not guilty4
at some point sometimes at the arraignment and sometimes at a status conference held afterwards a plan for scheduling and determining the scope of discovery is agreed upon by the parties or ordered by the court sometimes the terms of this discovery plan are largely predetermined by the rules of the local court discovery in criminal cases is very different than that used in civil cases the prosecution and the defense each have advantages and disadvantages relative to the opposing party
13e investigations discovery and the asymmetric nature of criminal litigation
criminal litigation is very adversarial it is also very asymmetric the prosecution has the advantages of the use of the grand jury to investigate the case before indictment one or more federal agents to continue the investigation pending trial the use of search warrants and powers to compel testimony from reluctant witnesses through grants of immunity obtained from a court on the other hand the defense can raise the shield of the fifth amendment privilege against selfincrimination to avoid disclosing information known to the defendant and perhaps only to the defendant and it can force the government to prove the defendant’s guilt—beyond a reasonable doubt and to the unanimous satisfaction of 12 petit jurors—without having to put on a shred of evidence or cross examine a single government witness the burden to convict rests solely with the prosecution and the defense need do nothing if it so wishes
the prosecution’s investigation typically begins with a grand jury as stated above a grand jury can if it so wishes go on a “fishing expedition” it can issue subpoenas for the production of documents from third parties and the testimony of witnesses
a grand jury subpoena can be very broad although courts will often modify or entirely “quash” such a subpoena if it appears unduly or unnecessarily burdensome to a third
4 other types of pleas exist such as nolo contendere which means the defendant does not admit guilt but will not contest the government’s case and the court’s sentence such additional pleas are rarely entered and almost never at arraignment
￼
appendix 13 legal procedure and practice in criminal investigations and prosecutions  148
party the scope and timing of production by the party receiving the subpoena is often the subject of negotiation between the producing party and the grand jury’s counsel that is the ausa however the length of time that a subpoena is valid is subject to two constraints the first is the term limit of the grand jury itself once a grand jury expires say at the end of its normal 18month term the validity of the subpoena itself expires whether or not the grand jury’s investigation was completed
the second constraint is a bit more complex the purpose of a grand jury is to investigate the possible commission of a crime and decide whether or not to return an indictment naming the perpetrators of that crime once it has done that its job is done a prosecutor is not permitted to use the subpoena power of a grand jury in order to continue to investigate a case for the purpose of amassing additional evidence for use at trial however a grand jury is allowed to continue to investigate a matter if it is exploring additional charges other than the ones it initially returned or wishes to consider indicting additional defendants also sometimes a second grand jury may revisit an indictment returned by a previous grand jury for the same purposes or to correct a mistake made in the initial indictment under these circumstances the second grand jury may conduct its own investigations and issue its own subpoenas to accomplish these purposes
once the indictment has been returned the defendant has been arrested and arraigned and the court’s discovery plan has been entered true discovery begins instead of broad grand jury subpoenas available only to the prosecution both sides now have the use of much more limited trial subpoenas available under rule 17c of the federal rules of criminal procedure they are colloquially known as “17c subpoenas” these subpoenas may be served on any third parties who have evidence relevant to the issues to be argued at trial but are subject to the following limitations 1 they are limited to demanding the production only of documents calculated to produce evidence relevant for trial rather than to investigate the case and 2 absent a court order to the contrary the deadline for compliance with their terms is the date of trial or a specific pretrial hearing thus the defense which never had the advantage of the broader grand jury subpoenas is limited in what it can obtain and as to the timing of when it can obtain it
criminal discovery between the parties that is the information that one side must turn over to the other is governed primarily by rule 16 of the rules of criminal procedure and by several important supreme court rulings in a very broadbrush summary
1 the prosecution must produce to the defense any exculpatory information that it might possess that is anything that might show that the defendant did not commit the crimes charged this is known as brady material after the supreme court case announcing this rule
appendix 13 legal procedure and practice in criminal investigations and prosecutions  149
2 the prosecution must also produce any information that might be used to impeach government witnesses that is information that might cast doubt on the veracity of the government’s witnesses such as prior crimes of dishonesty plea deals or immunity agreements with the government etc this is known as giglio material after the supreme court case that announced this rule
3 the prosecution must surrender any statements of the defendant that it might seek to introduce at trial recorded or otherwise
4 the prosecution must identify any expert witnesses that it might introduce
also at the request of the defense the prosecution must turn over the exhibits that it intends to introduce at trial however if it does this then the defense is obligated to do the same
the defendant has a fifth amendment privilege against selfincrimination he does not have to tell the government anything and for the same reason the ability of the government to compel him to produce documents and tangible items is limited also he has the right to force the government to prove his guilt without having to disprove anything in the government’s case for this reason the rules governing discovery are weighted in the defendant’s favor he can choose to give the government nothing but will still be entitled to obtain items as listed above
13f interviews and compliance with subpoenas
the defense is severely limited in that it cannot compel a thirdparty witness to talk to it prior to trial to learn what he or she might say in contrast to the prosecution which had the opportunity to seek such a witness’s testimony during a grand jury proceeding
third parties must comply with subpoenas grand jury or otherwise and must be truthful during any testimony they give or interviews with government investigators to which they consent—if they mislead the government they can themselves be subject to prosecution for perjury the making of false statements or obstruction of justice however absent a subpoena or a court order a thirdparty witness is not obligated to tell or give the prosecution or the defense anything no matter how important might be what he knows or the evidence that he has5
5 a ≈ one typical 12 v motor vehicle headlight typically 60 w caveat is 18 usc § 4 which makes it a felony to knowingly fail to disclose actual knowledge of a felony offense however the supreme court has added the requirement that to violate this statute one must engage in some additional conduct serving to cover up the offense
￼
appendix 13 legal procedure and practice in criminal investigations and prosecutions  150
13g pretrial motions and hearings
the parties have the opportunity to file motions in order to limit the issues that will be presented at trial this is usually done by the defense in an effort to narrow the charges brought and the evidence introduced against the defendant by the prosecution two of these motions are the motion to dismiss and the motion to suppress
a motion to dismiss is what its name implies a request by the defense to the court asking that an indictment a count in the indictment or a particular legal theory within a particular count be removed from the jury’s consideration depending upon when the motion is filed and ruled upon an advantageous ruling—a dismissal—may be with or without prejudice that is the prosecution may or may not be able to seek an amendment to its indictment6 and correct the flaw identified by the defense and adopted by the court the primary issue will be whether the ruling comes down before or after the trial jury that is to hear the case is sworn
the fifth amendment of the constitution prohibits any defendant from being “subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb” the manner in which this prohibition is applied is that once a trial jury is sworn the government cannot appeal or seek a superseding indictment if a charge is dismissed by the court thus if a dismissal is ordered by the court before the jury is sworn the government has the opportunity to “try again” if it is ordered after the jury is sworn the defendant is forever acquitted of that charge
a motion to dismiss is usually brought on the grounds that even if the facts alleged in a count are correct those facts do not set forth a violation of the law that is charged thus it may be argued—as it was in the lamacchia case discussed in appendix 9—that even if the defendant david lamacchia did what the government alleged he did what he did was not a crime
closely allied with this concept is the criminal doctrine of “lenity” this doctrine applies to the language used in a criminal statute and to the extent to which such language is ambiguous put simply if a statute can be read in two different ways one exonerating the
￼6 an “amended” indictment is referred to as a “superseding indictment”
appendix 13 legal procedure and practice in criminal investigations and prosecutions  151
defendant and the other convicting him the benefit of the doubt must be given to the defendant and he must be acquitted of the charge this doctrine arises from the due process clause of the fifth amendment which provides that no person “shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law    ” a pedestrian definition of “due process” is this notice and an opportunity to be heard “notice” means adequate notice such that a reasonable person can understand the conduct that the statute proscribes thus if a criminal statute is so ambiguous as to be read in two contradictory ways one of which exonerated a defendant charged with its violation then it is the more lenient of the two readings which the courts will apply to the considerations of the defendant’s guilt or innocence
a motion to suppress is different in that it does not directly attack a charge brought by the prosecution but instead attacks the evidence the prosecution intends to introduce in order to prove that the defendant committed the crime as charged for example if a police officer entered a person’s home without a warrant and without any judicially acknowledged exception to the requirement for a warrant and he found and seized contraband such as drugs counterfeit currency or bombs that contraband would on a motion to suppress be held to be excluded from introduction and from the consideration of the jury at trial put simply evidence illegally found and seized is not admissible against a defendant whose rights have been violated by the illegal search and seizure
a motion to suppress if successful is a very powerful blow against the prosecution given the heavy burden it bears of having to prove guilt in a case “beyond a reasonable doubt” often after a motion to suppress is granted the prosecution will choose to forego pursuing a trial rather than expend its resources in an attempt to obtain a conviction in much weakened circumstances
13h the status of “victims” in federal prosecutions
the federal crime victims’ rights act was enacted in 2004 it provides for a number of procedural rights that must be accorded to victims of a crime that is the subject of a criminal prosecution these are
1 the right to protection from the accused
2 the right to notification
3 the right not to be excluded from proceedings
4 the right to speak at criminal justice proceedings
5 the right to consult with the prosecuting attorney
6 the right to restitution
appendix 13 legal procedure and practice in criminal investigations and prosecutions  152
7 the right to a proceeding free from unreasonable delay
8 the right to be treated with fairness and respect for the victims’ dignity and privacy
in the federal system of criminal justice a victim of a crime does not have the right to “press charges” that is to authorize the prosecuting officials to pursue criminal charges against a suspected perpetrator nor does he or she have the right to refuse officials permission to pursue such charges the power and discretion as to whether or not to prosecute a person who is suspected of committing a crime is vested entirely with department of justice subject only to the limiting powers of the grand jury and the courts
appendix 14 questions from the mit community
at the outset of this review the review panel set up a website where mit community members could post questions about the swartz incident this appendix lists the questions together with our answers
1 what support if any does mit offer for students undergoing federal investigations or criminal charges if none why not
answer mit students facing criminal investigation or prosecution have several mit resources available to them for guidance and support including student support services and if needed mit medical the office of the general counsel cannot provide legal advice or representation to students—nor to faculty or other members of the mit community—on their personal legal issues professional responsibilities governing lawyers prohibit the ogc from representing individuals in their personal issues because the ogc represents only mit the ogc refers individuals needing personal advice to sources of legal assistance and when asked ogc will provide general guidance and assistance to community members as to finding counsel
2 it appears that swartz was not intending to sell any jstor content does this mean the main charge was trespassing

appendix 14 questions from the mit community  154
4 why did mit continue to support the charges against aaron after jstor dropped their case
answer mit took no position on the criminal charges against aaron swartz either before or after the jstor settlement the report section iiia4 mit discusses possible public statements with jstor addresses in detail the history of mit’s interaction with jstor about possible statements in anticipation of the indictment in july 2011 after the indictment mit did not issue any statements it did not support the charges nor did it advocate that they be dropped report section ivb neutrality issuing statements providing information to prosecution and defense discusses some of the options mit had here
5 why is it that you mit get to review yourself
answer mit typically assigns the responsibility of internal reviews to members of its community who were not directly involved with the events under review and who mit believes will make a thorough and impartial review the review panel for the aaron swartz matter also included one individual who has no mit affiliation
6 doesnt mit have the right to monitor including w video its own property and hand that evidence over to the police if it feels there is a trespasser
answer mit has the right to use video to monitor its own property regarding the handing over of evidence please see the report section ib discovery of the laptop section iva3 providing information to law enforcement presubpoena and appendix 10 legal analysis of mit’s provision of documents and packet capture
7 what options did mit have in terms of issuing a public statement in support of swartz at what points would it have been legally possible to issue a statement possible under mit policy was this option considered at these junctures
answer making a public statement was indeed an option considered by mit at various stages of the events related to aaron’s prosecution it would have been legally possible to do so at any time and no formal mit policy would have prevented it please see the report part iii mit’s response to the prosecution and section ivb neutrality issuing statements providing information to prosecution and defense
8 is there any record of aaron attempting more straightforwardcooperative ways of downloading articles
answer the report notes two of aaron swartz’s previous experiences with downloading large numbers of articles both of which appear to have been done in a straightforward
appendix 14 questions from the mit community  155
manner see the report section iia2 possible motives for downloading we have no evidence that he attempted to download the jstor files at mit in a more straightforward or cooperative way nor of his seeking permission from jstor for research on its database through his harvard appointment which provided access to jstor through harvard’s network
9 does mit believe that copying the wrong bits warrants prison time
answer mit as an institution has been a leader in promoting open access and strongly supports fair use for academic and research purposes while there are a lot of different opinions about copyright law within the mit community the general stance of mit towards open access is something to be explored please see the report part v questions for the mit community question 6
10 what is the record of prosecutor carmen ortiz arranging any plea bargain either favorable or draconian weeks before a trial
answer the review panel’s charge was to review the actions of mit’s offices and individuals not those of the us attorney so we did not explore the record of us attorney ortiz or the boston office beyond the aaron swartz case
11 what mit officials are in charge of protecting privacy of electronic records logs
answer the office of the general counsel with information services and technology together determine the institute’s policy on the privacy of electronic records the report suggests that these policies be reviewed see part v questions for the mit community question 2

appendix 14 questions from the mit community  156
community raised in part v of the report which address some of the issues related to network resources and the mit culture
14 were mits actions in this case consistent with mit policy and with actions taken in prior situations when an individual was caught “misusing” the mit network and network resources if not then why
answer mit’s actions in the swartz matter appear consistent with actions taken by the institute in prior situations although the initial response was to a situation that was unique in the magnitude of the downloading and the fact that the owner of the laptop was unknown please see the report section ia downloading of jstor articles for mit’s actions after that and the considerations of whether they were consistent or should be see part v questions for the mit community questions 1 and 5 and appendix 9 some prior relevant incidents at mit
15 given mits tradition of student “hacks” mit officials should ask how would we have responded if aaron swartz had been an mit student and had performed his actions by hacking into harvards network and how would we have wanted harvard to respond
answer these are important questions for the mit community to address for a discussion of these issues please see the report part v questions for the mit community question 7
16 so why was he arrested after all
answer the initial state charge at the time of aaron swartz’s arrest was breaking and entering for the federal indictment he was accused of violating the computer fraud and abuse act and committing wire fraud for a full description of the charges please see the report section iib1 the state prosecution and section iib2 the federal prosecution
17 what view did mit take of the superseding indictment additional charges against swartz and did it play a role in influencing or trying to influence the indictment one way or another who from mit testified at the grand jury and what did they say
answer mit had no advance knowledge of the superseding indictment and played no role in influencing the indictment either before or after it was issued no one from mit testified at the grand jury for the second indictment
appendix 14 questions from the mit community  157
18 who told mit police to say swartz had “no known address”
answer the report in part describes the actions of the mit police in the course of the downloading investigation and the arrest of aaron swartz aaron swartz refused to speak to the police at the time of his arrest the incident report completed by the mit police after the arrest indicts that his residence was “il” that is illinois the review panel speculates that the arresting officers saw mr swartz’s driver’s license or other identification card from his hometown in illinois and not knowing his massachusetts address simply listed “il” for mr swartz’s residence
19 what can mit do to hasten reform of the academic publishing industry
answer mit has an ongoing interest in promoting open access of scholarly publications for details of this activity and ideas for doing more please see the report part v questions for the mit community question 6 and appendix 8 mit and open access publishing

40 why did mit personnel hand over data about aaron including dhcp logs and other intercepted network information to the secret service without a warrant court order or subpoena

43 swartzs family has alleged in the press that mit promised not to release more data to law enforcement than it had to and not to do so without a warrant yet it seems to have done so how can this be
answer we are not aware of this claimed allegation from aaron swartz’s family but in any case mit made no such promise mit did tell the family that it had not turned over any information without a court order this claim was mistaken in any case mit provided information to law enforcement officers both before and after being issued subpoenas for information see the report section ib discovery of the laptop and section iva3 providing information to law enforcement presubpoena
