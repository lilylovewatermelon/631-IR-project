verse 1
red and purple vince carter on the jersey
keep a bad lil mamacita lookin curvy
my 40 glock milly rockin its movin sturdy
if she aint fuckin me proper i do her dirty

keep an fn and a stick for every journey
you want this dick lil mama you gotta earn it
phone airplane mode dont disturb me
walkin birkin then im telling my lil bitch to ball
all that low money budget shit turn my bitches off
she got a taste of the sauce look how it drip baby
she see a young nigga ballin

chorus

know you thirsty ass bitches gon be thirsty
know you hatin ass niggas wanna murk me
all of my exes dont deserve me
