and we can run from the backdrop of these gears and scalpels
at every hour goes the ticktock bang of monitors
as they stared us down when we met in the emergency room
and in our beds i could hear you breathe with help from cold machines
every hour on the hour they drew blood
well i felt i couldnt take another day inside this place
from silent dreams we never wake and in this promise that well make
starless eyes for heavens sake but i hear you anyway

prechorus
well i thought i heard you say i like you we can get out
we dont have to stay stay inside this place

chorus
someday this day we kept falling down
someday this day set the ferris wheel ablaze
you left my heart an open wound
and i love you for
this day someday we kept falling down
one day this day all we had to keep us safe
and if we never sleep again
it would never end

outro
well i thought i heard you say to me well go so far far as we can
and i just cant stay one day well run awaysee my chemical romance liveget tickets as low as 445you might also like14embed"
