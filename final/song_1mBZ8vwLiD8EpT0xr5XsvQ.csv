everyones corrupt
you should just shut up
lay down back off
the demon youve disrupted

prechorus
dont wanna talk about politics
dont preach or talk about politics
dont let me talk about politics
dont give a shit about politics

chorus
you want to sleep with him
to get to who you need to know
think thats the way to go dont you dont you
its in religion sex and everything we do and say
i look the other way wont you wont you

verse 2
everybodys raped
lying to your face
kiss em and got to go slit you
here all messed up

prechorus
dont wanna talk about politics
dont preach or talk about politics
dont let me talk about politics
dont give a shit about politics

bridge
tiny spirits are in your soul
and they remain there
time is like in the deepest hole
you sit and pray there
all the guilt from the things youve done
you wonder what for
what you thought was so much fun
you have to pay for

prechorus
dont wanna talk about politics
dont preach or talk about politics
dont let me talk about politics
dont give a shit about politics

chorus
you want to sleep with him
to get to who you need to know
think thats the way to go dont you dont you
its in religion sex and everything we do and say
i look the other way wont you wont you
outro
dont wanna talk about politics
dont preach or talk about politics
dont let me talk about politics
dont give a shit about politics
dont wanna talk about politics
dont preach or talk about politics
dont let me talk about politics
dont give a shit about politics2embed"
