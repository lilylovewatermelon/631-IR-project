you put the drops on the paper
you said it would bring us closer to nature
and it did
so we got lost in the dessert
even though it was your best friends bedroom
by ourselves

bridge
we did it all babe yeah we did it all and then some
i wish everything in life could be this random
we were the last ones yeah we were the last ones standin
never knew this part could be so demandin

chorus
turn this song up loud
when the party dies down
and everyones passed out
play this song right now
if youre feeling yourself
and wanna let it all out

verse 2
a sunset in a private jet
while having sex
could be the best
end to the night
and success leads to happiness
at least thats what you said
but all it did was
take up time

cause we had it all babe yeah we had it all and then some
wish i could freeze time and keep this moment
the last ones yeah we were the last ones standin
never knew that life would end up being so random
