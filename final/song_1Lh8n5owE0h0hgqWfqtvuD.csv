got nowhere to go and all night to get there
but im going there with you
tonight were running on luck
if were gonna use it all up
theres only one thing left to do

chorus
gonna take a deep breath and hold it in
twirl you around til my head spins
kiss that lipstick and wear it thin til its gone til its gone
break every rule we ever learned
kick back and watch the big wheels turn
light up the night and let it burn til its gone
til its gone til its gone

bridge
you look way too good
and this feels way too right
itd been way too long to start
and its sure worth drinking to
so baby heres to you
i dont wanna waste a drop

chorus
gonna take a deep breath and hold it in
twirl you around til my head spins
break every rule we ever learned
kick back and watch the big wheels turn
light up the night and let it burn til its gone
til its gone til its gone
see kenny chesney liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likeverse 2
one life one chance
one ticket to the big dance
you and me still holding on
right down to the last song

chorus
gonna take a deep breath and hold it in
twirl you around til my head spins
kiss that lipstick and wear it thin til its gone til its gone
break every rule we ever learned
kick back and watch the big wheels turn
light up the night and let it burn til its gone
til its gone til its gone
yeah til its gone

refrain

baby heres to you
i dont wanna waste a drop
