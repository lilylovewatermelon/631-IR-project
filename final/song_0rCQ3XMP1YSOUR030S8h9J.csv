paralyzed on the floor again
lately ive been fiending
cause its over im stupid
living a lie on my own so alone
youre calling consistently
but im paralyzed on the floor far from you

chorus
and lately ive been thinking
im not feeling anything at all
will i survive in the dead of night
and now the lights are fading faster
save me from my disaster my disaster

verse 2
lay the lights down low
god only knows i give up to the fire
you didnt always come up from the water
i only thought you were crying from laughter
saving myself from the mouth of a monster
paralyzed on the floor again
baby ive been fiending

chorus
and lately ive been thinking
im not feeling anything at all
will i survive in the dead of night
and now the lights are fading faster
save me from my disaster my disaster
