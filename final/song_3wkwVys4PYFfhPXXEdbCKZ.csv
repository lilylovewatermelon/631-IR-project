there you were standin in the shadows
well i just looked where i dont see
im still pretendin i dont need you
i wont let you know youre killin me

verse 2
like some big black widow spider
you know just how to catch your prey
im actin like it doesnt matter
and you sneak up from behind and whisper my name

chorus
and there go your paralyzin eyes
there goes your tantalizin smile
there goes my act of playin it cool
and there go the words i meant to say
there go the games i wanted to play
there goes my heart fallin for you

verse 3
well i think youre playin with me darlin
you like to see what you can do
well i should be fishin for blue marlin
instead of bein hooked by again by you
