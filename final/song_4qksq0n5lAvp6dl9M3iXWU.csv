i know you hate the way we drifted
but we both inside this party and we lifted
so whats up

verse
ima sip my drink and crack a big smile
just to see if i can still get you cause its been a while yeah
its been a minute now
your friends just started listening to my music but i been in style
you say that i play too much but we both know i been a child
asked you when you got to town you say that youve been in town
thats fucked up
so you just wasnt gon hit me
lookin like this you thought it wasnt gon tempt me
im sorry but you aint gotta bar me up
you should come and step into my world just like narnia
i wont do no harm to you come on lets find a quiet spot
hows your sister and your niece does she still cry a lot
who you talkin to now are yall bout to tie a knot
hope not speak now hold your peace i will make that show stop
member back when i would come and spend the night at your house
wake up by myself in bed cause youd be at the stovetop
walk inside the kitchen put my hands up ah let me stop
please excuse me i know these are heavy thoughts
a mans greed cant see the things that hes already got
fucked it up between us cause i wanted you and every thot
things would only worsen when youd let me rock
your bestie tried to warn you but you told her that he said he stopped
you used to say her man was trash and tell me bout the way hed act
i would shake my head until i realized im the same as that
now i wonder did she tell her man that im a trash dude
and would he shake his head until he realized he was trash too
i know this reunions unexpected but its past due
at least if you ask me i wont ask you
so what you bout to do
you might also likechorus
i know you hate the way we drifted
but we both inside this party and we lifted
so whats up5embed"
