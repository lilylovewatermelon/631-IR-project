and he decides who to free and who to blame
everybody wont be treated all the same
there will be a golden ladder reaching down
when the man comes around

the hairs on your arm will stand up
at the terror in each sip and in each sup
will you partake of that last offered cup
or disappear into the potters ground
when the man comes around

hear the trumpets hear the pipers
one hundred million angels singing
multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
voices calling and voices crying
some are born and some are dying
its alpha and omegas kingdom come

and the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
the virgins are all trimming their wicks
the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
its hard for thee to kick against the pricks

til armageddon no salam no shalom
then the father hen will call his chickens home
the wise man will bow down before the throne
and at his feet theyll cast the golden crowns
when the man comes around
you might also likewhoever is unjust let him be unjust still
whoever is righteous let him be righteous still
whoever is filthy let him be filthy still
listen to the words long written down
when the man comes around

hear the trumpets hear the pipers
one hundred million angels singing
multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
voices calling and voices crying
some are born and some are dying
its alpha and omegas kingdom come

and the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
the virgins are all trimming their wicks
the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
its hard for thee to kick against the pricks

in measured hundredweight and penny pound
when the man comes aroundembed"
