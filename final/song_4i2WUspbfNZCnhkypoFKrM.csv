i missed you so much that i begged you to fly and see me
you mustve broke down cause you finally said that you would
but now that youre here i just feel like im constantly dreaming
cause somethings gotta go wrong cause im feelin way too damn good

verse 1
for 48 hours i dont think that we left my hotel room
should show you the sights cause im sure that i said that i would
we gotta make love just one last time in the shower
well somethings gotta go wrong cause im feelin way too damn good

chorus
and its like every time i turn around
i fall in love and find my heart face down and
where it lands is where it should
this time its like
the two of us should probably start to fight
cause somethings gotta go wrong cause im feelin way too damn good oh
feelin way too damn good

verse 2
sometimes i think best if left in the memory
its better kept inside than left for good
looking back each time they tried to tell me
cause somethings gotta go wrong cause im feelin way too damn good oh
