i know its been a long day you been haulin’ that hay
you need a break from workin in the sunshine
so you met me in here for a couple of beers
just to wash away that overtime

prechorus
now youre sayin’ that you wish you wouldve cleaned up
but you know i dont care about that
when youre leanin in and kissin me
and i cant stop kissin you back

chorus
gettin’ dirty looks from people at the bar
gettin’ dirty looks like dont you know where you are
gettin’ dirty looks like everybodys got somethin to tell us
but they aint nothin’ but jealous baby
somethin bout rough hands on a hardworkin man
i just wanna get all over you
like the dirt on your shirt and your jeans and your boots
if you ask me dirty looks
good on you boy good on you boy
good on you

verse 2
