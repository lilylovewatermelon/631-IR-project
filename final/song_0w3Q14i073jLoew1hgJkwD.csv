yeah i was just hanging out
some little west coast town
found a bar out by the sand
so i made my way in
first thing that caught my eye
lke nothing id ever seen
sunburned auburn air
the california dream
yeah she was shaking them hips
to some old motown song
i couldnt say anything
so i sang along

chorus
she was a heartache on the dance floor
yeah shes moving through my mind
i gotta know her name and i gotta see her again
shes got me wondering yeah im just wondering
where she at where she at where she at tonight
where she at where she at where she at tonight

verse 2
so i just hung around
this little west coast town
i dropped by every night
i stayed till closing time
my little mystery
that girl is killing me
so i put on a song
just to sing along
