i am fueled by all forms of failure
i paid the price so ill take whats mine

verse 1
oh i bet ya didnt see that one coming
cause i do as i please and apologize for nothing
my time is flying but im still second to none
always shining the brightest when im placed under the gun

prechorus
goddamn so here i stand
the only son of a workingclass man
i wont be held back
i cant be held down

chorus
where were you when my walls came falling down
they came falling down
you tried to hide you stood close by
and didnt make a sound
say something

verse 2
find you some paper and ill go grab you a pen
you can start taking notes on how this all started again
been dead last but found my way to the front
with my inspirational quotes on why i never gave up what
see a day to remember liveget tickets as low as 108you might also likechorus
where were you when my walls came falling down
they came falling down
you tried to hide you stood close by
and didnt make a sound
where were you when it all came back around
it goes back around
the reasons why you passed me by
will always hold you down
say something

bridge
if you cant stand the pressure
stay the fuck out of my way i know my place
this one goes out to everyone whos lied to my face
my heart is filled with hate

breakdown
im making a difference
im taking a chance a chance
you can say what you want about me
but no one can tell me i cant

chorus
where were you when my walls came falling down
they came falling down
you tried to hide you stood close by
and didnt make a sound
where were you when it all came back around
it goes back around
the reasons why you passed me by
will always hold you down
say something2embed"
