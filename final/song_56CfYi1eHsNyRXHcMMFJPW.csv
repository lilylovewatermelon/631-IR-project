verse 1 kelli sae
where has our love gone these days baby
you promised me our love thats true
i thought we were man and lady
but now its time i make my move
cause there was a time that i loved you
but then you treated me bad and so cruel
then i finally came to my senses
now im doing better since i left you

verse 2 breeze brewin
yo
im just a juggernaut surfing on a avalanche
i wanted love a lot searching just to have a chance
my past love didnt pan out help your man out
not on some handout lover my style is stand out
exgirl to next girl maybe with a little triple x girl
dont get it too complex girl just great throwin my vibe
and i catch ya fresh lake over from mine since i left her
