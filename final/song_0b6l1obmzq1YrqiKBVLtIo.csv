yeah

chorus pharrell williams
you know how i feel
im in love with you still ooh yeah
it helps but it kills
your lovin your lovin
it hurts it heals
it breaks but it builds ooh yeah
your power and your will
your lovin thats your lovin

verse 1 daniel caesar
wanna feel it something i can feel
i know the things that i been feelin they aint real
wanted to know what it felt like for them to like me
now i know i gotta say its mighty frightening
wanna use it use my frontal lobe
but these feelings took this shit around the globe
god im sick and tired of always feelin lonely
got this golden child shit poppin with my homies
its a hell of a feeling i put this thing on the map
remember back in the day you talked a whole lotta smack
it was hard for the black kid you used to get at my gap
used to steal all my groceries and now i get to the racks
used to be ugly but now i hit from the back
the side from the front and i swear this pussy like crack
nigga got rhythm i like to hear that shit clap
i like to hear that shit back
i like to hear that shit

further from home the unknown is all that i know
couldnt atone on the phone
i wish that i would be on my own all alone
i wish that i would quit bein stoned be a stone
i wish that i would
i wish that i would just be a man when i can
i wish you had the vision to follow the plan
i wish i had a reason to see you again

chorus pharrell williams
you know how i feel
im in love with you still ooh yeah
it helps but it kills
your lovin your lovin
it hurts it heals
it breaks but it builds ooh yeah
your power and your will
your lovin thats your lovin

verse 2 daniel caesar
wanna feel it something i can feel
i know the things that i been feelin they aint real
look my whole life they been beggin me to chill
got it weighin on my conscience just a lil
i wanna venture into the unknown
never got shit poppin layin round at home
never got no pussy actin like a pussy
let my nuts hang god damn look where that shit took me
outro pharrell williams

never keep it inside ayy
