fuck fuck fuck
you know a nigga really dont wanna go to school today

hook wiz khalifa
when i pull up we look so fresh in my ride
we smoke the best you can buy
them niggas talking it but they just dont go harder than us
keep stunting just cause i can
these hoes know just who i am
them niggas talking it but they just dont go harder than us

verse 1 wiz khalifa
this ones for the gs all black chucks on the cuffs of my jeans
king size papes stuffed full of trees i be with the boss dogg yall fuck niggas fleas
now they say im hot hundred somethin degrees
taking pictures with a young nigga cheese
remember days homey i aint had a thing
now im hoping off the plane putting roaches on the wing
and my hoes like queens but we smoke like kings
jewelry froze like bling
money come fast yours slow like lean
rolling up grass sold weed to half the staff so i know im gonna pass
third period showing up last
with a late note blowin great smoke laughs
