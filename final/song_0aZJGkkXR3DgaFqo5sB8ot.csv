manage me im a mess
turn a page im a book half unread
i wanna be laughed at laughed with just because
i wanna feel weightless and that should be enough
but im stuck in this fucking rut
waiting on a secondhand pickmeup
and im over
getting older

prechorus
if i could just find the time
then i would never let another day go by
im over
getting old

chorus
maybe its not my weekend
but its gonna be my year
and im so sick of watching
while the minutes pass as i go nowhere
and this is my reaction
to everything i fear
cause ive been going crazy
i dont want to waste another minute here
see all time low liveget tickets as low as 114you might also likeverse 2
make believe that i impress
that every word by design turns a head
i wanna feel reckless i wanna live it up just because
i wanna feel weightless cause that would be enough

prechorus
if i could just find the time
then i would never let another day go by
im over
getting old

chorus
maybe its not my weekend
but its gonna be my year
and im so sick of watching
while the minutes pass as i go nowhere
and this is my reaction
to everything i fear
cause ive been going crazy
i dont want to waste another minute here

this could be all ive waited for
ive waited ive waited for
and this could be everything
i dont wanna dream anymore
maybe its not my weekend
but its gonna be my year
and ive been going crazy
im stuck in here
chorus
