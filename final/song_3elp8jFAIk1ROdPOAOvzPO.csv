ill take care of you
you can put your heart right in my hands
oh
baby youre like the rarest flower
ill make sure you bloom

baby
just imagine if i was your man
oh baby
i pray to you
breakfast in the bed
and every night id sing to you
no matter what it is
before you sleep

ill have you saying
ooh
how did he know just what to do
like a radio
im tuned into your soul

oooh oh
if
if it was up to me
you know id fill you up with love
and make it flow like water
you might also likestars at the sky
ill place em in your eye
oooh
since i was a young player talking to the ladies
i just know

its just my intuition
i know what you like
shorty how you like it
i know if it possess you
i know what you feel
you cant even fight it

its just my intuition
i know your every wish
shorty let me in your life
and watch me put it downembed"
