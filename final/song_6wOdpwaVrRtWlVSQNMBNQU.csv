pretty woman pretty girl with pretty thighs
older black woman had me feelin like im thirtyfive
get it girl hit her with the phrase still stuck in my ways
hit her both ways as her main nigga and a sidekick

verse 1 goldlink
i met her in the summer started with a kiss
and she fucked so good that i had to flood her wrist
two days in and i wanna have her kid
then she told me she belong to the city and her boy
wear a wig and a cig just to smoke away her tears
and i wanna learn about her fears and touch her rear
i think i love her cant nobody come before her
aint no one above her and i wrote this like a sucka singin

uh pretty woman pretty girl and pretty thighs
older black woman had me feeling like im thirtyfive
get it girl hit her with the phrase still stuck in my ways
hit her both ways as her main nigga and a sidekick
lil rider fuck me like a side chick
she down like a north face with some posits
bank credit card scammin for deposits
and when i do i do my thing she never stop me
she love to love me lovin me is like a hobby
lovin the dough and my nigga cho i told him hit the fort
she never let a nigga get too close
if i die shell probably marry me and love my ghost
so i had to work and get the ghost
had to work harder so the bitchll see the ghost
oh my baby ridin in it and my baby ridin tinted
and i only fuck with you because it got you in it get it
