its easy to slip dont want you to fall
i drip on this bitch like met gala ballin
answer her texts dont answer her calls

chorus
yeah she sent me a text wont answer her call
she love when i flex and shop in the mall
relieving her stress i beat down her walls
skeetskeet on her chest she kissin my balls
we speed in that vette dont stop for the laws
vvs on my neck i shine in the dark
its easy to slip dont want you to fall
walk in with the drip that met gala ball

verse 1
shoot your shit up i got accurate aim
fucked up a few mil now im back like i came
that boy say my name i went and got me some strain
you know i dont crash i just stay in my lane
please dont compare because we not the same
gunwun aint no gimmick aint clownin for fame
i trapped for a living and been had a name
work hard for these clothes cars and watches and chains
oh man rollsroyce got umbrellas this whip for the rain
these folks done fucked up let me slip in the game
this bitch let me fuck this shit went to her brain
she know im a beast and aint easy to tame
she squirt on my sheets while i beat out her frame
dozed off woke back up she still sayin my name
in love with my life and you wish we could trade

verse 2
walk in with the drip like met gala ball
came in and she strip her panties and all
lip gloss on her lip suck me like a hall
a boss and a pimp i bought me a ship
i walk with a limp fn in my drawers
when she talk that shit i put dick in her jaws
i hit and dont miss aint no win lose or draw
hit and dont miss aint no win lose or draw
came from flat shoals and old nat
on the south in that back you get whacked then get shot in your car
why hell you think that im maxin relaxin in mansions no cappin cause we had it hard
i aint get this shit just from askin i made this shit happen and passion it played a big part
i aint get this bitch off of mackin it came off of actions and fashion and stay in accord

relieving her stress i beat down her walls
