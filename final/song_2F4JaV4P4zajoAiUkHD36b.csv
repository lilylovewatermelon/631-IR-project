part 2 i tried
verse 1
got a letter from an old flame the other day
envelope had a scent reminiscent of may
said she’s doing just fine that i’ve been on her mind and
that she wishes that i never ever went away
i gave it all i had just to let it go
but you should know that i tried
hook

i tried just know that i tried
that i tried i tried

verse 2
got a call from an old friend the other night
he said that he just saw you and you’re living the life
we were always best friends
it all came to an end and things change
one day i hope you realize

bridge
maybe one day we’ll find common ground
when the weather’s warm and the trees are green
maybe when the leaves start falling
maybe then we’ll find ourselves together again

verse 3
that’s it my seeds are there in your garden
i fell in love with smoke and mirrors
the spring i guess we’ll see if we blossom
or are we just fallen petals is it autumn

outro
maybe one day we’ll find common ground
when the ocean’s cold and the pigs all fly
maybe when the sky starts falling18embed"
