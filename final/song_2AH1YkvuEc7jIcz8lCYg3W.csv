theres tougher lifes i might have had
sometimes i live hand in mouth
but there are those who go without
there might be things i wish i had
but when i look at where im at
i aint got it all that bad

in my time ive tried it all
three love drugs and alcohol
got loaded up to kiss the sky
just about kissed the world goodbye
there were those who never made it back
but me i got lucky found my landing pad
hey i aint got it all that bad

i got the sunshine
and a few good friends ive found
a roof to give me shelter when the rain comes down
ive got tomorrow and the promise that it brings
a few chances still worth taking
and that dreams still have wings

these days i dont ask for much
just the grace of god and my womans touch
strength each day to face a fight
and a place in someones prayers at night
life enough to love and laugh
if i end up with half of that
i aint got it all that bad
i aint got it all that bad
i aint got it all that badyou might also likeembed"
