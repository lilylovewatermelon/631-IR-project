isnt it an irony
the things that inspire me
they make me bleed
so profusely
i got everything i need
time and space to think and breathe
what does it mean
when cash grows on trees

chorus daniel caesar
exist in superposition
lifes all about contradiction
yin and yang
fluidity and things
im me im god
im everything
im my own reason why i sing
and so are you are you understanding

bridge daniel caesar
whoa

verse 2 daniel caesar
i know you think this shit is easy
for you but not so much for me
but ill still ride thats just the risk ill take
i know you see me actin sleazy
im working on it take it easy
ill figure it all out before i break
if i should die before i wake
oh please do not resuscitate
i know i didnt live my life in vain
this music shits a piece of cake
the rest of my lifes in a state of chaos
but i know ill be okay
