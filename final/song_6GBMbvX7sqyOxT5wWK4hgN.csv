ooh ooh

verse 1
this is gonna hurt but i blame myself first
cause i ignored the truth
drunk off of that love it  my head up
theres no forgetting you

prechorus
youve awoken me but youre choking me
i was so obsessed
gave you all of me
and now honestly i got nothing left

chorus
i loved you dangerously
more than the air that i breathe
knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
didnt care if the explosion ruined me me me
baby i loved you dangerously
mmm mmm
i loved you dangerously

verse 2
usually i hold the power with both my hands tied behind my back
look at how things changed
cause now youre the train
and im tied to the track
you might also likeprechorus
youve awoken me but youre choking me
i was so obsessed
gave you all of me
and now honestly i got nothing left

chorus
cause i loved you dangerously
more than the air that i breathe
knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
didnt care if the explosion ruined me me me
baby i loved you dangerously

bridge
you took me down down down down
and kissed my lips with goodbye
i see it now now now now
it was a matter of time
you know i know
theres only one place this could lead
but you are the fire and im gasoline

breakdown
i love you i love you i love you

chorus
i loved you dangerously
ooh more than the air that i breathe
oh now knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
didnt care if the explosion ruined me me me
