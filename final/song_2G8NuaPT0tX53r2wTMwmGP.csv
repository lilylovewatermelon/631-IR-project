picked you out and picked you up
hopin that my luck would change
i let the summer fill my lungs
and superstition fill my brain

chorus
dandelion
a million little wishes blow across the sky
but its a waste of breath and its a waste of time i know
cause just like him
you always leave me cryin dandelion

verse 2
sent you dancing on the breeze
and like a stupid little girl
i spent my wishes on a weed
thinkin it could change my world

chorus
dandelion oh
a million little wishes blow across the sky oh
but its a waste of breath and its a waste of time i know
cause just like him
you always leave me cryin dandelion
you might also likebridge
falling stars and lucky pennies
have let me down so many times before
and youre just one more
oh dandelion
oh

chorus
oh dandelion oh
im always blowing kisses out across the sky oh
but its a waste of breath and its a waste of time i know
cause just like him
you always leave me cryin dandelion
