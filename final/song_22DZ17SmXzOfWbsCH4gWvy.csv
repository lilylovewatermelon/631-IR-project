i swear im traumatized whoa
im caught up in that fire

chorus
i swear im traumatized caught in that fire
lot of bullets flying whole lot of people dying
i swear im traumatized im hypnotized
like im a reaper i see blood when i open my eyes
wont sacrifice my child 2020 we all will die
ima go fly high in the sky take a doll and i pop out his eyes
hit the gas and i jump out the wraith im causin suicide
head on collision collateral damage im letting go of my pride

verse
percs and molly in my casket so i can roll in heaven
get a bad bitch up out of magic need a ho in heaven
i need me a tec and i need me a stick have a shootout with the devil
no weed up in my kingdom ben said that he need a seven lets go
cheat on my girl ima fuck on that ho
if i go broke ima stick up a store
if you got to school go strapped with a pole
better not let a nigga come step on you no
got brand new shoes dont step on my toes
im ready to fight with a nigga or ho
i leave out the class cause i gotta go
im gettin head in the bathroom
they always talk bout me no they dont know bout me
gotta pray before i sleep the devil talk to me
gotta get em out my dreams fore he take over me
get down on my knees like lord dont cancel me
