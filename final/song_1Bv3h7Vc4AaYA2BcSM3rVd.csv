think of me when youre out when youre out there
ill beg you nice from my knees
and when the world treats you way too fairly
well its a shame im a dream

chorus
all i wanted was you
all i wanted was you

verse 2
i think ill pace my apartment a few times
and fall asleep on the couch
and wake up early to blackandwhite reruns
that escape from my mouth oh oh

chorus
all i wanted was you
all i wanted was you
all i wanted was you
all i wanted was you

verse 3
i could follow you to the beginning
just to relive the start
and maybe then wed remember to slow down
at all of our favorite parts
