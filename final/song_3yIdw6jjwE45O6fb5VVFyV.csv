there he goes gone again
same old storys gotta come to an end
lovin him was a one way street
but im gettin off where the crossroads meet

verse 2
a quarter moon in a ten cent town
its time for me to lay my heartaches down
saturday night i wanna make myself a name
take a month of sundays to try and explain

chorus 1
its gonna be easy to fill
the heart of a thirsty woman
and harder to kill the ghost of a no good man
and ill be ridin high in a fandangled sky
its gonna be easy its gonna be easy from now on

verse 3
raw as a whit but clean as a bone
soft to the touch when you take me home
when the mornin comes and its time for me to leave
dont worry bout me i got a wild card up my sleeve

chorus 2
its gonna be easy to fill
the heart of a thirsty woman
and harder to kill the ghost of a no good man
and ill be ridin high in a fandangled sky
its gonna be easy its gonna be easy
its gonna be easy from now on
