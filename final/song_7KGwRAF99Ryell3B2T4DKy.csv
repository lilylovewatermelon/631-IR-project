verse 1
he was never gonna make it
every pill he found hed take it
always on the edge of breakdowns
keepin it together somehow
just another cold november
you called me but i didnt answer
i was so oblivious now im askin for forgiveness
for every single time i failed you
im feelin like its me that killed you
rememberin the time they jumped you
and i was too scared to help you
looking back i cant erase it
i guess its time to face it
you never seemed to know how to let it all go

chorus
dont listen to a single word they say about you
they dont know you like i do
dont listen to a single word they say about you
they dont know you like i do
see imagine dragons liveget tickets as low as 120you might also likeverse 2
everybody saw you smilin
that you were always good at hiding
you were always asking questions so you wouldnt draw attention
everyone who used you they never really knew you
youre always showin up for everybody but yourself everybody but yourself
see i wish i could take it back
change the future and erase the past
grab the bullet out and pull you back
i promise that id save your life like you saved mine
but now its far too late for that
and all i have is your story left to tell
so let me tell it let me tell

chorus
dont listen to a single word they say about you
they dont know you like i do
dont listen to a single word they say about you
they dont know you like i do
