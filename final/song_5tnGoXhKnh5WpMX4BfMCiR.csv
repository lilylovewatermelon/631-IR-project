chorus
i live a dark life i dont let people in
they say i smoke too much but this my medicine
dont get the wrong impression im bout my presidents
rockstar my life look at the evidence
and would you shoot for me cause i would kill for you
i like the way you dance you got no point to prove
i shine just like a jewel my baby thats my boo
we both is off the goop and swerving in my coupe

verse 1
depression settin in so grab my medicine
the cops lookin for it i hide the evidence
bitch im intelligent they say im heaven sent
life feel like hell on earth i fly high like a blimp
girl why you fuck with him you know that nigga simp
he said he got a bag that boy is not a pimp
all of my niggas up i did this for my team
bitch im a young boss didnt have anything
im tryna own a house you tryna own a chain
omert√† still the code i wont tell on my gang
i used to dream about it made it reality
and you are not my friend cause back then you was doubtin me

verse 2
lil baby fuck me good i took her to my hood
i wish that nigga would would throw him in the woods
my life a scary movie i never catch a break
how you gon help me out then throw it in my face
this worlds a different place my mind is like a race
im always on the go i gotta let you know
that im a lonely nigga no i dont need a ho
i only need my dough im talkin bankroll
all of these bitches fuckin all of these niggas lame
i cant fall victim to it im in a different lane
you wanna see me fail dont wanna see me change
its funny how it works now you are stuck in pain
