verse 1 kanye west
man i promise shes so selfconscious
she has no idea what she doin in college
that major that she majored in dont make no money
but she wont drop out her parentsll look at her funny
now tell me that aint insecurr
the concept of school seems so securr
sophomore three yurrs aint picked a carurr
she like fuck it ill just stay down hurr and do hair
cause thats enough money to buy her a few pairs
of new airs cause her baby daddy dont really care
shes so precious with the peer pressure
couldnt afford a car so she named her daughter alexis
she had hair so long that it looked like weave
then she cut it all off now she look like eve
and she be dealin with some issues that you cant believe
single black female addicted to retail and well

verse 2 kanye west
man i promise im so selfconscious
thats why you always see me with at least one of my watches
rollies and pashas done drove me crazy
i cant even pronounce nothing pass that versaysee
then i spent four hundred bucks on this
just to be like nigga you aint up on this
and i cant even go to the grocery store
without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team
it seem we livin the american dream
but the people highest up got the lowest selfesteem
the prettiest people do the ugliest things
for the road to riches and diamond rings
we shine because they hate us floss cause they degrade us
we tryna buy back our 40 acres
and for that paper look how low well stoop
even if you in a benz you still a nigga in a coupe
chorus syleena johnson  kanye west
oh when it all it all falls down
come on come on
im tellin you all it all falls down
and when it falls down who you gon call now
oh when it all it all falls down
come on come on
im tellin you all it all falls down
and when it all falls down
verse 3 kanye west
i say fuck the police thats how i treat em
we buy our way out of jail but we cant buy freedom
well buy a lot of clothes but we dont really need em
things we buy to cover up whats inside
cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
thats why shortys hollerin where the ballers at
drug dealer buy jordan crackhead buy crack
and the white man get paid off of all of that
but i aint even gon act holier than thou
cause fuck it i went to jacob with 25 thou
before i had a house and id do it again
‘cause i wanna be on 106  park pushin a benz
i want to act ballerific like its all terrific
i got a couple pastdue bills i wont get specific
i got a problem with spendin before i get it
we all selfconscious im just the first to admit it
chorus syleena johnson  kanye west
oh when it all it all falls down
