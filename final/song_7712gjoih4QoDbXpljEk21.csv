your exfriends sister
met someone at a club and he kissed her
turns out it was that guy you hooked up with ages ago
some wannabe zlister
and all the outfits were terrible
2003 unbearable
did you see the photos
no i didnt but thanks though

prechorus
im so in love that i might stop breathing
drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
no i didnt see the news
cause we were somewhere else
stumbled down pretend alleyways
cheap wine make believe its champagne
i was taken by the view

chorus
like we were in paris
like we were somewhere else
like we were in paris oh
we were somewhere else

verse 2
privacy sign on the door
and on my page and on the whole world
romance is not dead if you keep it just yours
levitate above all the messes made
sit quiet by my side in the shade
and not the kind thats thrown
i mean the kind under where a tree has grown

im so in love that i might stop breathing
drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
no i didnt see the news
cause we were somewhere else
stumbled down pretend alleyways
cheap wine make believe its champagne
i was taken by the view

chorus
like we were in paris oh
like we were somewhere else
like we were in paris oh
we were somewhere else

bridge
i wanna brainwash you
into loving me forever
i wanna transport you
to somewhere the cultures clever
confess my truth
in swooping sloping cursive letters
let the only flashing lights be the tower at midnight
in my mind

breakdown
we drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
no i didnt see the news
cause we were somewhere else
in an alleyway drinking champagne
chorus
cause we were in paris
yes we were somewhere else
my love we were in paris
yes we were somewhere else17embed"
