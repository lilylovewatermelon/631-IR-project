i never found a heart i couldnt break
for you i hoped my parts would rearrange
youd see a change
do you see a change
oh i dont know

prechorus
cause honey now this house feels like a grave
and now i cannot help but take the blame
for every stain
for messes ive made with your heart

theyre up ready theyve been six feet underneath
cant you see

chorus
so our times come around
and our wounds run deep
there aint no words to speak
honey bury me
watch it fall
let it drown
in a deep blue sea
baby bury me
honey bury me
see noah kahan liveget tickets as low as 102you might also likeverse 2
if i could find a way to change our fate
would any of our demons be erased
oh could i change
oh could i change
help i dont know

prechorus
cause honey theres no shame in letting go
i guess ill see you at the funeral
ill be alone
youll be alone
oh arent we all
theyre up ready theyve been six feet underneath
cant you see

chorus
so our times come around
and our wounds run deep
there aint no words to speak
honey bury me
watch it fall
let it drown
in a deep blue sea
baby bury me
honey bury me
bridge
faking sleep but my eyes havent closed
i know youre dreaming of letting me go
can you feel the dirt down below

chorus
so our times come around
and our wounds run deep
there aint no words to speak
honey bury me
watch it fall
let it drown
in a deep blue sea
baby bury me
honey bury me

bury me
bury me
bury me
bury me

bury me
bury me
bury me
bury meembed"
