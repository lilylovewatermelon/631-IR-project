freeze

verse 1
its time to take you home
it feels so early but i promised i would bring you to your door
now our lips are numb as we walk sharing warm alcohol
that kiss tastes like summer
i hope you like the stars i stole for you
one hundred million twinkle lights in neon blue
ill be the brightest someday
ill be the brightest someday
ill be the brightest youll see

chorus
dont rain on my parade
its gonna glow in the dark
i like it better when you cant keep warm
dont ruin a perfect thing a perfect thing
the boy on the blue moon dreams of sun

verse 2
now as the rain
now as the rain falls like shattered pieces of glass from the sky
we bleed like water colors and drunken pastels down the stairways
and i ask myself why do i still pray
when will it end and who fucking cares
i swear to god i did what i could
i practically begged you
i pretended everything was fine
a soul sacrifice an american nightmare
id rather be dead
see pierce the veil liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likechorus
dont rain on my parade
its gonna glow in the dark
i like it better when you cant keep warm
dont ruin a perfect thing oh a perfect thing oh
the boy on the blue moon hears a nightmare in his head

verse 3
ill bet you money as youre running to the bathroom
you barely started drinking but your beauty never stopped you
you died in california by the sulfur and the sea
i guess i never shouldve loved you
but i do forever cause you loved me
and i break my glasses as i fall in the street
if you were gonna leave this world how could it be without me
now its all over my tongue and still it has no taste
cause without you there is no me

bridge
theres no me at all
sometimes love sometimes love
love dies like love dies like
dies like a dies like a
love dies like a dog like a dog like a dog
so why dont we just let this one take care of itself
chorus
dont rain on my parade
its gonna glow in the dark
i like it better when you cant keep warm
dont ruin a perfect thing oh a perfect thing oh
the boy on the blue moon dreams

outro
dont rain on my parade woah no
im losing a perfect thing oh a perfect thing oh
a perfect thing24embed"
