they told me boy i think the moneys startin to change you

member runnin through the city in the same shoes
now im gunnin in the benz and the range too
im on point know a nigga never take two
they said i couldnt reach mars so i turned to a star
now i might have fucked around might have raised up the bar
now im talkin cash talk cash all in my palm
my nigga cash said watch what they do for the ones
