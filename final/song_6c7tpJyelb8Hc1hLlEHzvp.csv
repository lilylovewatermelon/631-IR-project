i heard today that you were gone
i had to stop and sing along
the song they played to say goodbye
a song that gave gave me back life

chorus
youll never fade
the words you gave
my life you saved
your name was layne

verse 2
and on that day a child was born
to someone who you helped along
and helped see through his darkest times
because of you this child she is mine

chorus
youll never fade
the words you gave
my life you saved
your name was layne

bridge
the words you said
you made me feel like they were all for me
the words you said
they will always be a part of me
the words you said
you made me feel like i was not alone
with what you said
you gave me all the strength to carry on
