the sky in cheyenne wyoming
is just about as blue as it gets
and if you aint seen a santa fe sunset
you aint seen red
texas sunflower yellow
can take your breath away
ive seen it all from the orange of the fall
to the green of the summer but my favorite color is

chorus
neon the light they always leave on
a weekend on the rocks
and an old school jukebox
with a little johnny lee on
the buzz i love to be on
you put a double on your troubles
the light at this end of the tunnel
is neon

verse 2
the sun can do the job in the daytime
but the moon aint quite bright enough
to light up the way to playtime
for people like us
just like a beach side beacon
callin all the ships back home
a few thousand volts to cut through the smoke
the windows are tinted thats why they invented

neon the light they always leave on
a weekend on the rocks
and an old school jukebox
with a little johnny lee on
its the buzz i love to be on
you put a double on your troubles
the light at this end of the tunnel
is always neon

bridge
you know ive seen it all
from the orange of the fall
to the green of the summer
but my favorite color is

chorus
neon the light they always leave on
put a double on your troubles
the light at this end of the tunnel
