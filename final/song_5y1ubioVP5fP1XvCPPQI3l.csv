and this space dont take my mind
a cloudy wake its a young mistake
that im clothed in
i cant see when im filled with sleep
its a golden dream of mine
but when i rise with my morning eyes
its all spoken

wait dont drown it in the waterhole
taste the feeling of a fever soul
all in all i need to get me through

i still stir such a war of words
im a maker of my time
a feeble man with a broken plan
oh im loathing
make my bed on the great unsaid
and my meekness sends me low
i stood fair but you still werent there
so youve chosen

wait dont drown it in the waterhole
taste the feeling of a fever soul
all in all i need to get me throughsee the paper kites liveget tickets as low as 26you might also likeembed"
