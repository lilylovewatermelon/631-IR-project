that crooked smile doesnt hide your greed all of your hypocrisies
im gonna tell everyone the truth
live in denial while your insides bleed and i will keep you company
so i can watch when your worlds consumed

chorus
i was there when it began and ill be there to watch it end
ill take my time once ive sunk my teeth in
i was there when it began and ill be there to watch it end
ill take my time once ive sunk my teeth in
once ive sunk my teeth in

verse 2
i wont take part in your complacency or words you dont really mean
all that you did was light my fuse
soon youll be nothing but a memory and i wont keep you company
when everything falls apart for you

chorus
i was there when it began and ill be there to watch it end
ill take my time once ive sunk my teeth in
i was there when it began and ill be there to watch it end
ill take my time once ive sunk my teeth in

bridge
ill take my time with you
ill take my time with you once ive sunk my teeth in
