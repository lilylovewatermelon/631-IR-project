verse 1
hands on my knees shakin ass on my thot shit
post me a pic finna make me a profit
when the liquor hit then a bitch get toxic
why the fuck you in the club when niggas wildin’
ive been lit since brunch thot shit
order 42 for the table let’s pop shit
missionary or doggystyle ima top shit
pussyass niggas hatin on me from the closet ah
hoes tryna call me a snake shit i guess i can relate
cause a bitch spit a whole lotta venom
and since these hoes all rats when they come around me
all i see is a whole lotta dinner
i walk around the house buttnaked
and i stop at every mirror just to stare at my own posterior
i dont give a fuck who talk behind my back
cause the bitch knew better than to let me hear her ah

chorus
hands on my knees shakin ass on my thot shit
hands on my knees shakin ass on my thot shit thot shit

go to your place no face no case
ninetynine percent tint in a blackedout wraith
i remember hoes used to clap for me happily
now im bossed up and them same hoes mad at me
acting like they ridin whole time tryna pass me
watchin me go through it and still tryna drag me

hot girl but im still the coldest hey
im the big homie but i aint the oldest hmm
bitch dry hatin tryna get noticed
man aint nobody come to see you otis look
how many bitches lyin if they say they bars is better
they really puppets so i really gotta go and geppetto
im really talkin but it really can apply to whoever
my pen a freak itll go after a bitch or a nigga huh
big bank take lil bank bitch add it up
hoes takin shots but they aint in my caliber
booked but i squeeze a lil head in my calendar
lookin in the mirror like damn i dont brag enough
lvs double cs birkins im workin
my chain aint hittin if a bitch aint hurtin
look i aint even finna argue with a bitch
one thing i know two things for certain
none of these hoes sayin shit to my face
and none of these hoes finna see me at the bank
and ima keep talkin all the shit that i want
and i dare one of these hoes come tell me i cant
we aint even speakin if the nigga aint spendin
he could never say that i was one of his women
i dont even let niggas know where i stay
ill be damned if he thinkin he poppin up on this pimpin ah
chorus
