im sorry mother
im sorry i let you down
well these days im fine
no these days i tend to lie
ill take the western train
just by the side of amsterdam
just by my left brain
just by the side of the tin man

verse 2
im sorry brother
im sorry i let you down
well these days youre fine
no these days you tend to lie
youll take the western train
just by the side of amsterdam
just by your left brain
just by the side of the tin man

chorus
your time will come
if you wait for it if you wait for it
its hard believe me ive tried
but i keep coming up short

im sorry lover
im sorry i bring you down
well these days i try
and these days i tend to lie
kinda thought it was a mystery
and then i thought it wasnt meant to be
you said yourself fantastically
congratulations you are all alone

chorus
your time will come
if you wait for it if you wait for it
its hard believe me ive tried
your time will come
if you wait for it if you wait for it
its hard believe me ive tried

bridge
but the rain wont fall for the both of us
the sun wont shine on the both of us
believe me when i say
that i wouldnt have it any other way

chorus
your time will come
if you wait for it if you wait for it
its hard believe me ive tried
outro
but i wont wait much longer
cause these walls start crashin down
no i wont wait much longer
cause these walls start crashin down
then i keep comin up short45embed"
