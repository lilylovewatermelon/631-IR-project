you
you believed
you believed in movements none could see
you believed in me

verse 1
a passionate spirit
uncompromised
boundless and open
a light in your eyes
then immobilized

refrain
broken broken
fell at the hands of those movements that i wouldnt see
yet it was you who prayed for me
so what have i done
to be a son to an angel
what have i done
to be worthy

interlude

outro
daylight dims leaving cold fluorescents
difficult to see you in this light
please forgive this selfish question but
what am i to say to all these ghouls tonight
she never told a lie well might have told a lie
but never lived one
didnt have a life didnt have a life
but surely saved one
see im alright
now its time for us to let you gosee tool liveget tickets as low as 64you might also like14embed"
