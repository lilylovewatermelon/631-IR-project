verse 1 juicy j
north north in this thing and you know we runnin things
everybody raise ya thumb everybody show your gang
march in a circle mane muscle up until you strain

yes we keep the lightest dope
yes we house the freakiest hoes
then we ride to evergreen on the block is where we post
policeman cant stop us i think they oughta stop it
im talkin in that ghetto english sayin fuck the mobsters
gangsta niggas walk up in the club
high as hell because we full of drugs
what gang you claim the way they wore them hats

we put it on the map we keep our gezees flapped
and if you see me in the hood you better give me dap

verse 3 juicy j
i done lived in the north round the way
i done planted playa seeds in the mutherfuckin bay
hypnotize is the label that you dont wanna hate
i done seen niggas make it i done seen niggas sprayed
brothas on the same block till his hair turn gray
still all about a hustle punchin clock no way
the police hit the block swallow rocks throw the hate
back in the same spot the next fuckin day
project pat wassup

verse 4 project pat
jimmy jimmy cocoa puff you know how we roll
nigga is gon get shot up trippin wit this north
ride up outside yo dog pullin up them logs
squeeze on them triggers empty clips and reload
if you got beef my nigga you better bring it
the hood buck as hell the police couldnt tame it
inhalin palm trees something you cant hang with
hydro with red hair something i can slang trick
