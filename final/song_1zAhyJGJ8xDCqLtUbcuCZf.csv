i aint tryna vibe with you baby girl
i aint tryna tell you lies
you been showin signs to me baby girl
and i aint tryna waste no time
i understand you want what you want bad
high class cause you all that
want a nigga who can ball out
but imagine if it fall back
imagine i was dead dead broke
all the money and fame wasnt there
imagine if it all went left
tell me girl would you still be here
its sad but we both know the truth
if this aint real baby swear
tired of guessin and stressin and questionin love
i guess its best i disappear

chorus
wont judge
why dont you just tell me whats up
i dont think you know how to loove
this shit aint no rеgular love regular love rеgular love

verse 2
somethin different bout you girl and i like that mm
you make my stomach curl i cant fight that mm
its deeper than my girl cause you wife sat
cant nobody pipe that
i wanna know that if it go down you gon still ride
i told you i just want your truth and girl you still lied
i kept my feelings in but dont think i aint realized
my guts told me i should spin and i still tried still tried
i know you finna try and say im fucked up mm
girl you dont realize you lucked up
young nigga too real got my bucks up mm mm mm mm
i think it was better girl for real when we just fucked
and keep it honest keep it real can you feel that mm
and if you just wanna be a kill i could kneel back
and i cant waste no more time with you old girl
