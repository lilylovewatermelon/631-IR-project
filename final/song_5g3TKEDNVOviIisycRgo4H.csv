you make me so upset sometimes
i feel like i could lose my mind
the conversation goes nowhere
cause youre never gonna take me there

and i know youre no good for me

and i know its not meant to be

one half of me wants ya
and the other half wants to forget

i just cant get you outta my head
and i tell myself to run from you
but i find myself attracted to my dilemma
my dilemma its you its you
