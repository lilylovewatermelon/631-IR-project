if you wanna go back to him baby get up and go
im tired of being a clown caught up in your sideshow
night after night it never ends
its like a heavyweight fight nobody wins
and im throwing in the towel enough is enough

chorus
knock yourself out break me in two
you gotta go do what you gotta do
i gave you my best shot but you didnt fall
head over heels in love after all
i dont wanna hear no more
baby theres the door
theres nothing left to fight about
knock yourself out

verse 2
oh lets not pull any punches
while were standing here toe to toe
if youre gonna leave me here
baby go on go

chorus
knock yourself out break me in two
you gotta go do what you gotta do
i gave you my best shot but you didnt fall
head over heels in love after all
i dont wanna hear no more
baby theres the door
theres nothing left to fight about
knock yourself out
oh knock yourself out

if you wanna go back to him
baby get up and goembed"
