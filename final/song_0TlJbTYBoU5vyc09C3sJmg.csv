verse
im in the mix with the crackers
on telegram lookin for mud im in the mix with the factors
i fell out of mix with a slut i fell out of mix with the actors
the mud like the movie thats good
new york ho told me shell jack it
make three hundred thousand off jackets
i send her back home with a accent
make a trackhawk almost back flip
i cut a ho off like magic
whatever i buy you can have it
i crash another whip aint cute but it is what it is
im pop lil brother with aâ€” shh
