i bet they say the same damn thing
got niggas paying top dolla to holla
talking bout that pretty brown frame
and i dont mean the impala that you just hopped out of
go on bout your business
you must be religious
cause god done took her time
and youre tired of hearing those same old lines

chorus
can i talk to you bout something new
i know we tend to look the same to you
can i talk to you bout something new
put me on how does one get on with you
can i talk to you bout something new
i know we tend to look the same to you
can i talk to you bout something new
how does one how does one get on with you

verse 2
truth is i came to know ya
dont give a damn about the things they told ya
cause they dont have a clue
but they dont read you like i do
you dont need champagne
youd rather be held tight and maintained
i wanna know everything about you
but first i gotta talk to you
you might also likechorus
can i talk to you bout something new
i know we tend to look the same to you
can i talk to you bout something new
put me on how does one get on with you
can i talk to you bout something new
i know we tend to look the same to you
can i talk to you bout something new
how does one how does one get on with you

bridge
if you dont mind
i wanna be the only one on your mind
and if you dont mind mind
i wanna get the chance to spend some time
can i talk to you

chorus
