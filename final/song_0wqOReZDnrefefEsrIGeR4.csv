desperate for changing
starving for truth
im closer to where i started
im chasing after you

chorus
im falling even more in love with you
letting go of all ive held onto
im standing here until you make me move
im hanging by a moment here with you

verse 2
forgetting all im lacking
completely incomplete
ill take your invitation
you take all of me now

chorus
im falling even more in love with you
letting go of all ive held onto
im standing here until you make me move
im hanging by a moment here with you
im living for the only thing i know
im running and not quite sure where to go
and i dont know what im diving into
just hanging by a moment here with you
you might also likebridge
theres nothing else to lose
theres nothing else to find
theres nothing in the world
that can change my mind
there is nothing else
there is nothing else
there is nothing else
