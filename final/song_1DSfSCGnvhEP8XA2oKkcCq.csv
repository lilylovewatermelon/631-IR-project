halfpast twelve
and im watchin the late show in my flat all alone
how i hate to spend the evening on my own
autumn winds
blowin outside the window as i look around the room
and it makes me so depressed to see the gloom

prechorus
theres not a soul out there
no one to hear my prayer

chorus
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
wont somebody help me chase the shadows away
gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
take me through the darkness to the break of the day

verse 2
movie stars
find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win
its so different from the world im livin in
tired of tv
i open the window and i gaze into the night
but theres nothing there to see no one in sight

theres not a soul out there
no one to hear my prayer
