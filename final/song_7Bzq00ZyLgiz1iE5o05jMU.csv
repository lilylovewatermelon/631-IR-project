you look a lot like youd shatter in the blink of an eye
but you keep sailing right on through
every time you say youre learning
you just look a lot like me
pale under the blistering sky
white and red
black and blue

youve been waiting a long time
youve been waiting a long time
to fall down on your knees
cut your hands
cut yourself until you bleed
just fall asleep next to me
wait for everyone to go away
and in a dimly lit room where youve got nothing to hide
say your goodbyes
tell yourself well read a note that says
im sorry everyone
im tired of feeling nothing
goodbye
wash your face
dry your eyes
see counting crows liveget tickets as low as 170you might also likeyouve been waiting a long time
youve been waiting a long time
to fall down on your knees
cut your hands
cut yourself until you bleed
but fall asleep next to me
have a dream im falling down on my face
i scrape my knees
i scrape my hands until they bleed
cause youre fast asleep next to me
next to me
next to me
next to me1embed"
