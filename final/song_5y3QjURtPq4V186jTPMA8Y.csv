you will say youre dreaming up a way
youre dreaming up a way to explode
theres a time youll seek out a disguise
when you think people hate you the most
and it gets worse before it gets better
thats one thing that i have come to know
just so you know

chorus
do not wait do not wait do not wait
ill be there ill be there ill be there ill be there
do not wait do not wait do not wait
ill be there ill be there ill be there ill be there

verse 2
all the things you dont wanna let go
you wanna look back on and recall
all the times that feel like everything
when nothing really happens at all
theyre still here
oh in that important room
weve got your pictures up on the wall
up on the wall

chorus
do not wait do not wait do not wait
ill be there ill be there ill be there ill be there
do not wait do not wait do not wait
ill be there ill be there ill be there ill be there
do not wait do not wait do not wait
ill be there ill be there ill be there ill be there
do not wait do not wait do not wait
ill be there ill be there ill be there ill be there
you might also likebridge
break a promise to your ex
nothing happens
you are terrified of sex
nothing happens
the first time is humiliating
nothing happens
something youll want to forget
nothing happens
your parents will eventually separate
nothing happens
dads stuff in trash bags and in the pool
nothing happens
oh guess what you have a sister now
nothing happens
and as you go on and shit gets hard dont worry about me

outro
do not wait do not wait do not wait
ill be there ill be there ill be there ill be there
youre ready and you know it
do not wait do not wait do not wait
ill be there ill be there ill be there ill be there
something youll always remember
do not wait do not wait do not wait
ill be there ill be there ill be there ill be there
your parents will end up where they belong
do not wait do not wait do not wait
ill be there ill be there ill be there ill be there
theyll eventually talk again though
do not wait do not wait do not wait
and guess what shes obsessed with you
ill be there ill be there ill be there ill be there
when shit gets hard dont worry about me
oh
oh
