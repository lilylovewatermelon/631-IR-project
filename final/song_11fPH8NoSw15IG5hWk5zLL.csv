verse 1 big sean
i woke up this morning rolled a joint then got to it
dealt with real life shit manned up and got through it
im a real dboy take a look up in my face
never did real estate and still put you in your place
i dont trust dog hoes dog hoes got fleas
from where they rock skimasks and dont nobody ski
every time i spit a verse my city like preach
niggas thought i got evicted how my shit up in the streets
big sean aint nothing obese but the feast
swear im skinny cause im always on my feet
gotta hustle every second stacking paper every week
boy im in the field for real i might run up in some cleats
was in japan so long i almost learn to speak had to leave
back to the hood where they dont understand unless you speak in trapanese
if i fall down bet i only trampoline bounce back
back on my feet thats just how i be
i be out of town repping valid as an absentee
lord jeeze jealous motherfuckers trying to absent me
fuck these niggas up now its absent teeth
trying to pass on me when im first place in the playoffs bitch
im even working half days on my day off bitch
say its gon kill me fuck it i work graveyard shifts
long as that weed and money chilling in the pile

verse 2 big sean
i woke up this morning rolled a joint then got to it
can do anything in the world except not do it
bought my fam new land six star crib
momma feeling like she jewish im the motherfucking truest
yeah i talk about my mom but shoutout to my dad
would drive me to school every single chance he had
tell me bout the crazy girls and all about his past
and gave me the talks that made me to a man
not everybody got a dad but they got a uncle sam
and he aint came around till i made a 100 grand
coming from detroit where everybody say what up doe
horror movie shit cause everybody there cut throat
watch who you hustle with you might not get a cut though
even though you deserved a commission plus mo
and grandma sad when she saw my commercial
stop having people at your shows that wasnt at rehearsals
iâ€™m tryna to get a office at the empire state
to bring it back to empires plate thats home
man im reppin for my entire state
prayin that i wont be late
when its all finished at the endin after all bottles spillin
throttle gripping models switching chin chilling in my villa
fucking like i tryna populate a village im replenished
i didnt do it just for the money man for the feeling
i made it through the
