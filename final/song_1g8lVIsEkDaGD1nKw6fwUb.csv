pain
here comes the pain

verse 1
enemy show me what you wanna be
i can handle anything even if i cant handle you
readily either way it better be
dont you fuckin pity me get up get off

prechorus
what the hell am i sayin
i dont know about malevolent
sure as hell decadent
i want somebody to step up step off
walls let me fall fuck you all
get a grip dont let me slip till i drop the ball

chorus
fuck this shit im sick of it youre goin down this is a war
fuck it

verse 2
who the fuck am i to criticize your twisted state of mind
youre leavin me suspect im leavin you grotesque
feels like a burn from which you never learn
cause and effect you jealous ass press your face against the glass suffer
