jet trails cut across the winthrop county sky
thats why i reckon sunday is a good day to die
theres a beautiful black gelding and hes waiting there for me
pissed off and raising neck hairs out in chute number three
last night they were pulling pints of pesky pendleton
snuck away from the fire slept there with the grass and wind
i looked up at heaven saw how small i really was
i wanna build a house and burn it down just because

prechorus
and youre smirking like an asshole with a cheek full of tobacco
in the back of some bronco in a town youve never been

chorus
nothing fun happens after you turn twentyfive
if i make it out at all i pray youre right here by my side
and if im going down then im going down true
if i got anyone to thank then itll always be you

verse 2
what the hell am i doing who the hell am i
how i miss the scripture oh sundays the day to die
and granddad sure was punchy but loved jesus to his core
i wanna die today so i can learn to live for more
see zach bryan liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likechorus
nothing fun happens after you turn twentyfive
if i make it out at all i pray youre right here by my side
and if im going down then im going down true
if i got anyone to thank then itll only be you
if i got anyone to thank then itll always be you

postchorus
jet trails cut across the winthrop county sky
thats why i reckon sunday is a good day to die
