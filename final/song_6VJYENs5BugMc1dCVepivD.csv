im a flash oh you were blinded by the love i had
im a flash the light could only get in through the cracks

chorus
and youve gotta do the right thing do the right thing baby
youre the white swan in the photograph
do the right thing do the right thing baby
youre the white swan in the photograph

verse 2
when they crashed the helicopters in my heart it ripped
cut in half you saw me lying there bleeding to death

chorus
and you had to do the right thing do the right thing baby
youre the white swan in the photograph
do the right thing do the right thing baby
youre the white swan in the photograph

bridge
now i stand on the stage
i forget my lines to your play satans imagination
and a voice in my heads causing suicide searching for any way to remember them

chorus
and youve got to do the right thing do the right thing baby
youre the white swan in the photograph
do the right thing do the right thing baby
youre the white swan in my photographyou might also like7embed"
