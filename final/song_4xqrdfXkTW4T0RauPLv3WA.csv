i still remember third of december
me in your sweater you said it looked better
on me than it did you only if you knew
how much i liked you but i watch your eyes as she

prechorus
walks by
what a sight for sore eyes
brighter than a blue sky
shes got you mesmerized while i die

chorus
why would you ever kiss me
im not even half as pretty
you gave her your sweater its just polyester
but you like her better wish i were heather
verse 2
watch as she stands with her holding your hand
put your arm round her shoulder now im getting colder
but how could i hate her shes such an angel
but then again kinda wish she were dead as she

prechorus
walks by
what a sight for sore eyes
brighter than a blue sky
shes got you mesmerized while i die

why would you ever kiss me
im not even half as pretty
you gave her your sweater its just polyester
but you like her better i wish i were heather

bridge
oh
wish i were heather
oh oh
wish i were heather

chorus
why would you ever kiss me
im not even half as pretty
you gave her your sweater its just polyester
but you like her better wish i were156embed"
