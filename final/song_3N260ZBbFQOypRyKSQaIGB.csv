look at me so damaged and destroyed
this worlds plans and its ploys to take me out
im on a highway directly to the moon
with no plans on stoppin soon im leavin town

refrain
them christians are talkin so often of coffins
no heavens could top this moment now

verse 1
my foot out the window and my flask halfway full
i may have to pull over soon
i cant afford a motel but the floorboardsll work well
ill sleep there til tomorrow afternoon
then ill get on the road again had another chance at fittin in
but fittin in to kids like me is dyin
but i know when im with you after one shot or twentytwo
and a cigarette ill feel like im flyin

chorus
them christians are talkin so often of coffins
no heavens could top this moment now
ive searched and ive found to get to that ninth cloud
you must trek through some dark and troubled ground
so may we all just once or twice
once in this life just look around
cause usually im a wreck
but the hard times were just a step
to get to where i am on this ninth cloud
see zach bryan liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likeverse 2
and were screamin feelin good again just past 3 or 4 am
im talkin like the sunll never rise
but the sunll crest the trees and bring this devil to his knees
as it outlines the silver in these skies

chorus
them christians are talkin so often of coffins
no heavens could top this moment now
ive searched and ive found to get to that ninth cloud
you must trek through some dark and troubled ground
so may we all just once or twice
once in this life just look around
cause usually im a wreck
but the hard times were just a step
to get to where i am on this ninth cloud

outro
look at me so damaged and destroyed
this worlds plans and its ploys to take me out
im on a highway directly to the moon
with no plans on stoppin soon im leavin townembed"
