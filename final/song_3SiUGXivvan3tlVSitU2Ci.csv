hey hey do you wanna be famous
everywhere ya go people know what ya name is
everyone ya know tryin to tell ya ya changin
they wanna taste that fame that fame that fame that fame that fame

verse 1
famous everybody wanna be famous
most people wanna just taste it
other people try to just sneak in the vip and chill with the big faces
that dont really see them changes when the fame hit
when im up on the stage they sing it but soon as i step off they hate it
and im sayin i really aint with that complainin
just look at the picture im paintin
yeah i pay my rent vacation then
take trips all around the equator then
come back to the a hit the stage again
then i go up in the booth where they cage me in
feel regular but then i go insane again fame
if you witness the condition that my brain is in
you will see im in hell where satan is
hardest thing to do is to maintain a friend
cause everybody tryin to get paid from it
but fuck it this the entertainment bus so let the games begin
i mean let the flames begin
but hey im just trained at this
lie to everybody then get paid from it im famous
