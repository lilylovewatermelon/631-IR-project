he works the night shift at the depot
with a pistol and a light
and he guards them rusty missiles
counting whitetail to pass the time
and hes worked there for a long while
since he came home from overseas
helping kilcoran fight the good fight
and bring baghdad to its knees
and it was hotter than the mountain
but it werent so he couldnt stand
and it werent so much the heat wave
nearly as much as all the sand

verse 2
now his daddy hes a log man
with a good leg and a fake
that he got off of a buddy
and a shitshot that he made
and he worked them hands to splinters
and he raised them younguns right
on a little bit of scripture
and an acreage of paradise
and hed go out on the weekend
and he played like clarence white
if clarence had had a real job
and picked the guitar when there was time
see tyler childers liveget tickets as low as 39you might also likeverse 3
keeps a trap line in the winter
keeps a line wet in the spring
on a lock wall fishing muskie
with his eldest and steve
and they swap tales about their raisin
and they tell the awfulest lies
and they go home when theyve a notion
and the muskie quit to bitinembed"
