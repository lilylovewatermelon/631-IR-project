its gon be alright its gon be alright
and where do you go when you lost all hope
and you wanderin off to the dark side
its gon be alright its gon be alright
and where do you go when you lost all hope
and you wanderin off to the dark side

verse 1
cold nights on the block so quiet you can hear a pin drop
retaliation every time that fourth gen pop
that glizzy barrel smokin left his skin hot
old heads been in it they done seen the third gen drop
hereditary hate we been in this for years
when a father have a son he just givе it to his
designer stitched with a bullsеye thats just how we live
put our life on the line til we aint got one to give

chorus
its gon be alright its gon be alright
and where do you go when you lost all hope
and you wanderin off to the dark side
its gon be alright its gon be alright
and where do you go when you lost all hope
and you wanderin off to the dark side

tell me whats a vet to a goat let that settle in
i cant try to take advice from rappers that im better than
wont attach to gimmicks so our drama just for relevance
street nigga with class im a gangster but im elegant
catchin rich vibes hopin i become a better man
turn up on these haters they cant take me out my element
when you tried to play me you insulted my intelligence
found out you the devil had me thinkin you was heavensent
i know im not perfect got a closet full of skeletons
he stuck in his ways but hate the taste of his own medicine
i took guns to school that smith  wesson in my letterman
city full of murders cops cant luck up on no evidence
bunch of cold cases on my block shit is treacherous
ttg a family im gangin with my brethren
posted on the corner duckin jakes narcotic peddlin
dope boy swag but im no longer dealin heroin

chorus
its gon be alright its gon be alright
and where do you go when you lost all hope
and you wanderin off to the dark side
its gon be alright its gon be alright
and where do you go when you lost all hope
and you wanderin off to the dark side6embed"
