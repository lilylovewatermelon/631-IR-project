verse
dont try man dont you dare
keep her from living her life out there
cause she was meant for soaring and you were built for work
she likes the way that you smoke cigarettes
and you like the way that she never regrets
holdin onto you like no one ever has

prechorus
if you were the darkness then shed be the sun
theres some things in life that you cannot outrun
the fact that she was meant for so much more than you

chorus
a boy like you with your faded tattoos
a raspy voice and a shitty attitude
a motorcycle she likes holdin tight to you on
a boy like you with your stories of shame
and all of the reasons she wont have your name
if you love that girl then youve got to set her free
