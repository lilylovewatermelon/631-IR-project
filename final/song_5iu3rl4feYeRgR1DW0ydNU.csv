lets pack our stuff now and run away
we cant be all we want in this small town
our life was rough so lets make our days
what we want and ill give you my last name

prechorus
well take our chances
after all these letdowns
lets keep our patience
until ourselves are found
ohohoh oh

chorus
all we wanted
was a place to feel like home
thats why we parted
from our ways to heal our souls
im a smalltown miserable man
that does what he can
im a smalltown miserable man
that does what he can
im a miserable man

verse 2

without the light we wouldnt find our way

chorus
all we wanted
was a place to feel like home
