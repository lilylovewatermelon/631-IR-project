come in close now its time to tell the story
long ago and so many years before we
ever were ever dreamed we even could be
there was her and her very first heartbeat
all alone in a corner of the night sky
spiral bones of a supernova starlight
fell in love with another burning bright
she dreamed of a way to ignite
she said

chorus
tonight
come on come on collide
break me to pieces i
i think youre just like heaven
why
come on come on collide
lets see what a fire feels like
i bet its just like heaven
just like heaven
just like heaven

verse 2
such a shame nowhere near even a near miss
light years away from the hope of being sunkissed
anchored home in her interstellar sea
but poor lonely cassiopeia
so she sighs and she burns with desperation
learns to cry over love of constellations
then a spark from a star shooting too close
they both smiled what a day to explode
she said

tonight
come on come on collide
break me to pieces i
i think youre just like heaven
why
come on come on collide
lets see what a fire feels like
i bet its just like heaven
just like heaven
just like heaven

outro
long ago in a sky built before us
a supernova grew up to be stardust2embed"
