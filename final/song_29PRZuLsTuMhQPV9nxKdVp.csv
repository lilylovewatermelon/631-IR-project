whyd you have to wear that dress this evening
and those high heels with those buckles on your feet
i love the way your hair falls down across your shoulders
but you aint gonna hear that from me

verse 2
you got my heart racing like a freight train
wishing you and me were somewhere else
i know how good its gonna be when we get to where were going
think id better keep it to myself

chorus
cause baby i cant tell you what im thinking
ive had way too much to drink tonight
oh this is where i usually say something out of line
just be glad that right now you cant read my mind

verse 3
every time we dance were getting closer
and id like too say a thing or two about it
but trust me you dont wanna get me talking
im better off just dancing all around it

chorus
cause baby i cant tell you what im thinking
ive had way too much to drink tonight
oh this is where i usually say something out of line
just be glad that right now you cant read my mind
you might also likecause baby i cant tell you what im thinking
ive had way too much to drink tonight
oh this is where i usually say something out of line
just be glad that right now you cant read my mind

outro
oh the road to love is paid with good intentions
just be glad that right now you cant read my mind
just be glad that right now you cant read my mindembed"
