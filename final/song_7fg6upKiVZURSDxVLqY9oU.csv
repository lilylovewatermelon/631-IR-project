the beast will make off with your children

mob spoken
gasps

gaston spoken
hell come after them in the night

belle spoken
no

gaston spoken
were not safe till his head is mounted on my wall i say we kill the beast

mob spoken
kill him

man 1
were not safe until hes dead

man 2
hell come stalking us at night

woman
set to sacrifice our children
to his monstrous appetite
you might also likeman 3
hell wreak havoc on our village if we let him wander free

gaston
so its time to take some action boys
its time to follow me

through the mist through the woods
through the darkness and the shadows
its a nightmare but its one exciting ride
say a prayer then were there
at the drawbridge of a castle
and theres something truly terrible inside
its a beast
hes got fangs razorsharp ones
massive paws killer claws for the feast
hear him roar see him foam
but were not coming home til hes dead
good and dead kill the beast

belle spoken
no i wont let you do this

gaston spoken
if youre not with us youre against us bring the old man
maurice spoken
get your hands off me

gaston spoken
we cant have them running off to warn the creature

belle spoken
let us out

gaston spoken
well rid the village of this beast whos with me

mob spoken
i am i am i am
sung
light your torch
mount your horse

gaston
screw your courage to the sticking place

mob
were counting on gaston to lead the way

through a mist through a wood
where within a haunted castle
somethings lurking that you dont see every day
its a beast
one as tall as a mountain
we wont rest til hes good and deceased
sally forth
tallyho
grab your sword
grab your bow
praise the lord and here we go
gaston spoken
well lay siege to the castle and bring back his head

belle spoken
i have to warn the beast this is all my fault oh papa what are we going to do

maurice spoken
now now well think of something

mob
we dont like
what we dont understand
in fact it scares us
and this monster is mysterious at least

bring your guns
bring your knives
save your children and your wives
well save our village and our lives
well kill the beast

cogsworth spoken
i knew it i knew it was foolish to get our hopes up

lumière spoken
maybe it would have been better if she had never come at all could it be

mrs potts spoken
is it she

lumiere spoken
sacré bleu invaders

cogsworth spoken
encroachers

mrs potts spoken
and they have the mirror

cogsworth spoken
warn the master if its a fight they want well be ready for them whos with me ahha

gaston spoken
take whatever booty you can find but remember the beast is mine

enchanted objects
hearts ablaze
banners high
we go marching into battle
unafraid although the danger just increased

mob
raise your flag
sing the song
here we come were fifty strong
and fifty frenchmen cant be wrong
lets kill the beast

mrs potts spoken
pardon me master

beast spoken
leave me in peace

mrs potts spoken
but sir the castle is under attack

mob
kill the beast
kill the beast

lumiere spoken
this isnt working

featherduster spoken
oh lumière we must do something

lumiere spoken
wait i know

mob
kill the beast
kill the beast

mrs potts spoken
what shall we do master

beast spoken
it doesnt matter now just let them come

mob
kill the beast
kill the beast
kill the beastembed"
