youll never make me stay
so take your weight off of me
i know your every move
so wont you just let me be
ive been here times before
but i was too blind to see
that you seduce every man
this time you wont seduce me

prechorus
shes saying thats okay
hey baby do what you please
i have the stuff that you want
i am the thing that you need
she looked me deep in the eyes
shes touching me so to start
she says theres no turning back
she trapped me in her heart

chorus
dirty diana no
dirty diana no
dirty diana no
dirty diana let me be
oh no oh no oh no

she likes the boys in the band
she knows when they come to town
every musicians fan
after the curtain comes down
she waits at backstage doors
for those who have prestige
who promise fortune and fame
a life thats so carefree

prechorus
shes saying thats okay
hey baby do what you want
ill be your nightloving thing
ill be the freak you can taunt
and i dont care what you say
i want to go too far
ill be your everything
if you make me a star

verse 3
she said i have to go home
cause im real tired you see
but i hate sleeping alone
why dont you come with me
i said my babys at home
shes probably worried tonight
i didnt call on the phone
to say that im alright

prechorus
diana walked up to me
she said im all yours tonight
at that i ran to the phone
saying baby im alright
i said but unlock the door
cause i forgot the key
she said hes not coming back
because hes sleeping with me
