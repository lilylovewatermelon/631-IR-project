you have a way of coming easily to me
and when you take you take the very best of me
so i start a fight cause i need to feel something
and you do what you want cause im not what you wanted

chorus
oh what a shame what a rainy ending
given to a perfect day
just walk away aint no use defending
words that you will never say
and now that im sitting here thinking it through
ive never been anywhere cold as you

verse 2
you put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
and i stood there loving you and wished them all away
and you come away with a great little story
of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

chorus
oh what a shame what a rainy ending
given to a perfect day
so just walk away aint no use defending
words that you will never say
and now that im sitting here thinking it through
ive never been anywhere cold as you
see taylor swift liveget tickets as low as 170you might also likebridge
you never did give a damn thing honey
but i cried cried for you
and i know you wouldnt have told nobody
if i died died for you died for you

chorus
oh what a shame what a rainy ending
given to a perfect day oh
every smile you fake is so condescending
counting all the scars you made
and now that im sitting here thinking it through
ive never been anywhere cold as you
