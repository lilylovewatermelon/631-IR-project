yeah

verse 1
say im just a youthful face
somethin to do on saturdays
say its the best you ever had or say its bad
say its something just dont say its nothing

chorus
cause nothing lasts forever
nothing lasts forever
so say im someone that you wish you never met
your best mistake your worst regret
say everything say anything but nothing
cause nothing lasts forever
nothing lasts forever

verse 2
you tell me that you fixed you hair
and overthink the clothes you wear
in case you see me out somewhere
or listen to my old voicemails and hate yourself
for still feelin somethin when were nothing

chorus
cause nothing lasts forever
nothing lasts forever
so say im someone that you wish you never met
your best mistake your worst regret
say everything say anything but nothing
nothing lasts forever
see sam hunt liveget tickets as low as 32you might also likebridge
tell me you feel guilty
tell me you feel childish
tell me you feel sorry for me
tell me you feel stupid
tell me you feel lonely
tell me you feel somethin for me

chorus
cause nothing lasts forever
nothing lasts forever
so say im someone that you wish you never met
your best mistake your worst regret
say everything say anything but nothing
cause nothing lasts forever
nothing lasts forever

outro
nothing lasts forever
nothing lasts foreverembed"
