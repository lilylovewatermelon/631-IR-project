im gunna move to the city
the countrys too slow
i want pretty things in magazines
im gunna buy some clothes

verse 2
im gunna move to the country
the citys too fast
i want open fields to earn my meals
im gunna buy some land

chorus
and when you see me
ill be there i promise you
you want to lead with all your stones in my shoes
the weary travel he isnt too hard to suit

verse 3
so ill walk into the woods
just to show i can
and the willow tree will harbor me
and from the top ill see just where i am

verse 4
lets cut the damn tree down
it blocks my view
but from the top itd be the perfect spot
but ill cut it on down with a chop chop chop

and when you see me
ill be there i promise you
you want to lead with all your stones in my shoes
