i push my fingers into my eyes
its the only thing that slowly stops the ache
but its made of all the things i have to take
jesus it never ends it works its way inside
if the pain goes onâ€¦ aaaah

verse 1
i have screamed until my veins collapsed
ive waited as my times elapsed
now all i do is live with so much fate
ive wished for this ive bitched at that
ive left behind this little fact
you cannot kill what you did not create

verse 2
ive gotta say what ive gotta say
and then i swear ill go away
but i cant promise youll enjoy the noise
i guess ill save the best for last
my future seems like one big past
youre left with me cause you left me no choice

chorus
i push my fingers into my eyes
its the only thing that slowly stops the ache
if the pain goes on im not gonna make it

put me back together or separate the skin from bone
leave me all the pieces then you can leave me alone
tell me the reality is better than the dream
but i found out the hard way nothing is what it seems

chorus
i push my fingers into my eyes
its the only thing that slowly stops the ache
but its made of all the things i have to take
jesus it never ends it works its way inside
if the pain goes on im not gonna make it

i push my fingers into my eyes
its the only thing that slowly stops the ache
