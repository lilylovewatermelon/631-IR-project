well im a sucker for fine cuban cigars
the problem is i cant afford them
but last year i went and got myself a whole box
and just to be safe i insured em

verse 2
i took out a policy against fire and theft
and then i hurried on home
and with a fiftycent lighter i sat on my back steps
and i smoked em one by one

verse 3
two weeks later i went to see that insurance man
and i handed in my claim
with a straight face i told him that through a series of small fires
theyd all gone up in flames

verse 4
they reviewed my case and they had no choice
but to pay me for what id done
i took that check and bought a whole new box
and i smoked em one by one

verse 5
two weeks later this detective shows up
and tells me that companys pressing charges
one speedy trial later they locked me up
on twentyfour separate counts of arson

and now i sit and i stare at a blank brick wall
looking back on what ive done
to pass the time ive got some tencent cigars
and i smoke em one by one
yeah i smoke em one by oneembed"
