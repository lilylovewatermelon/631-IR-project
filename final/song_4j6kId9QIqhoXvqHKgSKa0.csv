one two three
one two—

verse 1
yesterday it finally came a sunny afternoon
i was on my way to buy some flowers for you
thought that we could hide away in a corner of the heath
theres never been someone whos so perfect for me

prechorus
but i got over it and i said
give me something old and red
i pay for it more than i did back then

chorus
theres just no getting through
without you
a bottle of rouge
just me and you

verse 2
sittin in the garden im a couple glasses in
i was tryna count up all the places wevе been
youre always there so dont ovеrthink
im so over whites and pinks
you might also likeprechorus
i pay for it more than i did back then

chorus
theres just no getting through
without you
a bottle of rouge
just me and you
1982
just me and you
theres just no getting through
the grape juice blues
