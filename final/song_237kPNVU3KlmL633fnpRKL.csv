she said goodbye to her daddy
while her mamma cried
i kept the motor running
in my car outside
she kissed him on the cheek
daddys little girl
then a woman walked out
to take on the world

verse 2
through red taillights
and a cloud of dust
we went flying through the night
it was all about us
sitting on the seat right next to me
we drove with a tank full of destiny

chorus
she was born to run
she was born to run
yeah she was born to run
born to run to me

verse 3
with a new world waiting
down the road up ahead
passion running wild
through our hearts and our heads
with everything we owned
packed in the backseat
we had each other
that was all wed need
see brooks  dunn liveget tickets as low as 30you might also likeverse 4
they all called me crazy
said shed never settle down
i was just her ticket
her ticket out of town
but it looks like that night
fate proved em wrong
because shes been mine
mine all along

chorus
she was born to run
she was born to run
yeah she was born to run
born to run to me oh i

bridge
its been years now
and i never doubted
somewhere somehow
wed make through
shes still here
no two ways about it
her hearts still mine
and her loves still true
chorus
she was born to run
was the masters plan
born to run
put her heart in my hand
born to run born to run to me

chorus
she was born to run
was the masters plan
born to run
put her heart in my hand
born to run born to run to me oh iembed"
