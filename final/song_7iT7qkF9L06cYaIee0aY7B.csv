iiii cant explain a thing
oh iiii want everything
to change and stay the same oh
time doesnt care about anyone or anything oh
come together come apart
only get lonely when you read the charts

prechorus
and oh baby when they made me they broke the mold
girls used to follow me around then i got cold
throw your cameras in the air
and wave em like you just dont care

chorus
i will never believe in anything again
i will never believe in anything again
though change will come oh change will come
i will never believe in anything again

postchorus
we will never believe again
kick drum beating in my chest again
no we will never believe again
preach electric to a microphone stand oh

and i i i love the mayhem more than the love

and oh baby when they made me they broke the mold
