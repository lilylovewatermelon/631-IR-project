ooh
ooh ooh
ah ah woah

spoken word
who if i cried out would hear me among the angels order
even if they pressed me against their heart i’d be consumed
for beauty is the terror we endure
while we stand and wonder were annihilated
every angel is terrifying

interlude
intense graphic sexy euphoric
provocative edgy thoughtprovoking
technically and visually stunning
a compelling work of science fiction
a suspenseful еxposé
cinema like youve nеver seen it before
the exotic bizarre and beautiful world of after life
and this is your invitation to enter
critics say after life makes your current life look like a total comatose snooze fest

the future of everyones fate
