but thats all right by me
werent you just waiting by the phone
well i should give a little warning
but i need the things i need
im not proud to need a hand
but i just dont understand
so why should you come when i call
i never say nothing at all
why do i go when i go
its leaving me here all alone
you ought to get out on your own

aint necessarily a bad thing
to believe the things i say
cause you can make yourself feel good
you know its really not a good thing
to give everything to me
im just waiting for the show
cause i got nowhere to go

so why should you come when i call
i never say nothing at all
why do i go when i go
its leaving me here all alone
you ought to get out on your own
see counting crows liveget tickets as low as 170you might also likecause nothing makes me feel so good makes me feel so good
and gets me high gets me high
so i sleep at night
and lets me know that everythings all right
i feel nice

im so sorry in the morning
you can believe what you believe
but im used to waking up alone
but if you think about it
anyone you think about is better love than me
but if youve not fallen quite asleep
i might call tonight
if thats alright

why should you come when i call
i never say nothing at all
why do i go when i go
its leaving me here all alone
you ought to get out on your own

oh why should you come when i call
oh why do i go when i go
why should you
why should you come when i call
why should you come
why should you come when i callembed"
