do i know better than this
youre a word that i cant forget
though the thought rattles my brain
will you fold or will you remain

prechorus
if i dont get better than this man in my skin
if i dont get better than this man in my skin

chorus
if i let go would you hold on would we fly
is it safer if we just say that we tried
are we laughing at the danger
are we dancing after death you and i

verse 2
as the sun waits to eclipse
and the taste teases my lips
im too tired to wrestle with it
will we burn or will we repent

prechorus
if i dont get better than this man in my skin
if i dont get better than this man in my skin

chorus
if i let go would you hold on would we fly

are we dancing after death you and i4embed"
