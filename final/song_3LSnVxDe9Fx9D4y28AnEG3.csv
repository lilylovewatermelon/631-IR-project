sunny morning
you can hear it
sirens warning
there is weather on both sides
and i know its coming
just like before
theres a black dog
that scratches my door
hes been growling my name saying
you better get to running

chorus
can you make it better for me
can you make me see the light of day
cause i got no one
who will bring me a
big umbrella
so im watching the weather channel
and waiting for the storm

verse 2
its just sugar
just a pill to make me happy
i know it may not fix the hinges
but at least the door has stopped its creaking
i got friends theyre
waiting for me to comb out my hair
come outside and join the human race
but i dont feel so human
see sheryl crow liveget tickets as low as 46you might also likechorus
can you make it better for me
can you make me see the light of day
cause i got lab coats
who will bring me a panacea
but im watching the weather channel
and waiting for the storm

outro
you wont want me
hangin round the birthday pony
even though its just a game
you know we are the same
but youre the better fakerembed"
