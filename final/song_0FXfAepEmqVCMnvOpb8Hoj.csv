i want you to understand something
that when i come up in this bitch i want the fans jumping
i want the fists pumping in the air i dont look like a millionaire
but i feel like a million bucks ladies wont ya fill your cups
shadys come to feel ya up are you a d or a c cup
you could even be a b its just me and dre
youll be in the er we are strapped with so much tnt
we may blow no not even cpr from the emts
could help you to resuscitate you busters must be flustered wait
you cant cut the mustard
whats your problem cant you bust a grape
chkkchkchk whats my name
shady came and just crushed the game
its really not even fair to them
cause they pale in comparison
so much they might as well wear his skin
dont you wish you could just share his pen
cause this shits getting embarrassin
the fog is thick and the air is thin
cause he wont even let them try to breathe
ladidididadadadidi
he makes it look so easy girl you just hit the lottery

chorus eminem  nikki grier
now thisll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on

this is when shit hits the fan like it just splattered on stan
this is the only moment that matters your homie rolled in with mathers
now chaos erupts ems in back dres in the front
so do what we say at once this songâ€™s like a seance it haunts
it makes them stay in a trance no choice they have to dance
its like the playoffs just making sure that we stay in the hunt
take a day off of what man you better lay off the blunts
you must be smoking something you think i aint smoking nothing stay off my nuts
now hit the floor baby time to wipe away all the rust
shake all them cobwebs loose
loosen up with a little bit of grey goose
yeah girl shake that caboose
i dont wanna see you try to make no excuse
dre is on the loose
a mongoose when it comes to the chronic use
you know i cant stand to lose
me and my goons are like animals
we come through like a pack of wolves
and we came here to retract the roof
yeah man aint that the truth
girl your mans back in the booth
definitely back up in this bitch
and this is when all hell breaks loose

chorus eminem  nikki grier
now thisll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
and hell breaks loose yeah
try to restrain us you cant contain us
were still gonna make a statement no matter what we do oh
everywhere we go it seems were looking for any excuse
to just cut loose come on
so thisll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
and hell breaks loose hoo
verse 3 eminem
now i know youre feeling discouraged but homie just mark my words
im murderin the flow liquid courage im finna blow
as soon as we hit the door power surges head to toe
im sure to push it as far as words are meant to go
were in the indigo winnebago with tinted windows
ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block wit your ho
with speakers knocking its threeoclock me and doc then proceed to drop
e and hop out the vehicle and knock on your door

verse 4 dr dre
yeah so let us in fore we huff and puff and we blow
we aint bluffing for nothing well knock the stuffing out you
revenge is so sweet move til you injure your feet
yeah move it or lose it freak move to the beat
lose yourself indubitably
pass up on that little cute chick right there
thatd be pretty damn stupid to me
born and raised in the cpt yeah los angeles rules of the streets
them haters hatin on me but i refuse to lose any sleep
keep that deucedeuce in the seat
dre fall off thats news to me

chorus eminem  nikki grier
now thisll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
and hell breaks loose hoo

were still gonna make a statement no matter what we do yeah
everywhere we go it seems were looking for any excuse
to just cut loose come on
so thisll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
