today seems like a good day to burn a bridge or two
the one with old wood creaking that would burn right away on cue
i try to be not like that but some people really suck
people need to get the axing chalk it up to bad luck

verse 2
i know a drugstore cowgirl so afraid of getting bored
she’s always running from something so many things ignored
i might do that stuff if it didn’t make me feel like shit
i’m on some old reality tip so many trips in it

chorus
beautiful disaster
flyin down the street again
i tried to keep up
you wore me out and left me ate up
now i wish you all the luck
you’re a butterfly in the wind without a care
a pretty train crash to me and i can’t care
i do i don’t whatever

verse 3
i know a drugstore cowgirl so afraid of getting bored
she’s always running from something so many things ignored
i try to be not like this but i thought it’d make a good song
there’s nothing to see shows over people just move along
