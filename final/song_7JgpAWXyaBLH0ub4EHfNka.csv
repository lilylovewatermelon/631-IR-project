ive waited for this moment all my life and more
and now i see so clearly what i could not see before
the time is now or never and this chance wont come again
throw caution and myself into the wind

chorus 1
theres no promise of safety
with these secondhand wings
but im willing to find out
what impossible means
a leap of faith

verse 2
parody of an angel miles above the sea
i hear the voice of reason screaming after me
youve flown far too high boy now youre too close to the sun
soon your makeshift wings will come undone

prechorus
but how will i know limits from lies
if i never try

chorus 2
theres no promise of safety
with these secondhand wings
but im willing to find out
what impossible means
ill climb through the heavens
on feathers and dreams
cause the melting point of wax
means nothing to me
nothing to me
nothing to me
see thrice liveget tickets as low as 32you might also likebridge
i will touch the sun or i will die trying
die trying

chorus 3
fly on these secondhand wings
willing to find out what impossible means
ill climb through the heavens on feathers and dreams
cause the melting point of wax means nothing to me
nothing to me
means nothing to me
miles above the sea2embed"
