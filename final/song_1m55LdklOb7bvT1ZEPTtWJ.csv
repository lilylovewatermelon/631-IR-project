verse 1
boy meets girl meets girl
you were my dream my world my world
but i but i was blind was blind
you cheated on me from behind
so on so on my own my own
i feel so all alone
though i know its true its true
im still in love with you

chorus
i need a miracle i wanna be your girl
give me a chance to see that you are made for me
i need a miracle please let me be your girl
one day youll see it can happen to me
i need a miracle i wanna be your girl
give me a chance to see that you are made for me
i need a miracle please let me be your girl
one day youll see it can happen to me it can happen to me
