i got the letter back saying i can come and see you
i really dont have time but promised that id come and see you
youre sitting far away but do you know i sometimes need you
i know that you deserve the time you got of all the people
i know you never bent even in the strongest wind
i really wished to every god that you were innocent
im happy and im proud that i can still call you my friend
i hope you read the letters and the magazines i send

prechorus
you got your head up
but i dont have my hopes high
i know that youre a good man
and thats what brings a tear to my eye

chorus
im like oh
i hope you know youre not alone in that hell
and there aint no
no one can change it no one can do it better but yourself

verse 2
i was 16 and we used to roll together
you told me back then that i was meant for something better
you know in our life nothings gon change but the weather
it seems it been forever since we really stuck together
im living a crazy life i wish that you could see it too
see a thousand people sing my song from me to you
every time i sing it you know im bleeding too
man i accept you as you are no i dont need the truth
see lukas graham liveget tickets as low as 49you might also likeprechorus
i got my head up
but i aint got my hopes high
see i know youre a good man
and it it brings a tear to my eye

chorus
and im like oh
i hope you know youre not alone in that hell
and there aint no
no one can change it no one can do it better but yourself

verse 3
i reminisce to back then when it was you and i
smoking big fat blunts drivein movie night
they tried to get you down but you refused to die
they tried to give you angel wings but you refused to fly
youd rather stay in hell and take your time in jail
theyre only punishing a soul that you will never sell
we both know that we owe nothing to each other
but can you blame me for loving and missing my brother

chorus
oh
i hope you know youre not alone in that hell
and there aint no
no one can change it no one can do it better but yourself
oh
i hope you know youre not alone in that hell
and there aint no
no one can change it no one can do it better but yourself6embed"
