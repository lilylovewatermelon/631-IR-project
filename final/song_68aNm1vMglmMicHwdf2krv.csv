i met a man locked away for things he hadnt done
innocence on ball and chain
hell never feel the sun
again on his face or roses in his hands
but when he smiled at me i could understand

chorus
if youre free youll never see the walls
if your head is clear youll never free fall
if youre right youll never fear the wrong
if your head is high youll never fear at all

verse 2
there was a daughter of a man who took his life too young
she swore shed never do the same then did just what hed done
and a boy whos gone insane heard voices in his head
no one knows what they say now his mothers dead

chorus
if youre free youll never see the walls
if your head is clear youll never free fall
if youre right youll never fear the wrong
if your head is high youll never fear at all

verse 3
there was a man who had a face that looked a lot like me
i saw him in the mirror and i fought him in the street
then when he turned away i shot him in the head
then i came to realize i had killed myself

if your head is high youll never fear4embed"
