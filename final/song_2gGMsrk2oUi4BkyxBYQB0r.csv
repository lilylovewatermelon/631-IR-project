everything the sun touch belongs to me
and everywhere the moon creeps is where i be
its simply no defeating us
we cant be beat
you see hollowsquad the regimen pull the strings
i stomp you boys from underneath stay away from me
we pull up to your venue and crush the whole thing
i might let her smoke the blunt but not the whole thing
im higher than the gundam wing eating chicken wings
i know this girl from asia all i say is dong  ding
she flipped them words around then she descend to her knees
bitch i dont say please im just taking what i please
boy stay the fuck up out my way before i swing on ye
he thought that i was playin till he saw me on his street
all these rap niggas need help so they listenin to me
i got ears in the streets i got eyes in the streets
bitch talkin shit bout me can get you mangled in your sleep
i aint ever been a bitch boy ask anyone with me
you can copy all my style but you cant copy my unique
all i do is roll a blunt and keep watch on the sea
im a bloodshore lord cant no human tangle me
put my blade in his mouth now let this pussy boy speak
i will cut his teeth up out his gums if he lie on me
i wont ever become weak i cant ever become weak
cause the truth is in my strength that lets me swing so freely
all i want to do is smoke my weed and live in peace
but these idiots in the world make it hard to keep it clean
tell the children wait inside while im on the killing spree
tell the children close their eyes while the blood cover me
we dont need no damn help all you labels lookin silly
why the fuck would we sell music when we sellin out the building
we dont need no gas we on e driving fast smokin on a new zip
i aint even finished with my last bitchyou might also like19embed"
