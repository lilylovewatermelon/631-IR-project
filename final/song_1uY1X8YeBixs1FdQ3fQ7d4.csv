heart plays in ways the mind cant figure out
heart plays in ways the mind cant—
heart plays in ways the mind cant figure out
this is how we conceptualize human beings

verse 1 kendrick lamar
my auntie is a man now
i think im old enough to understand now
drinking paul masson with her hat turned backwards
motorola pager offwhite guess jacket
blue air maxs gold chains and curl kits
93 nissan wax job the earliest
big social big personality vocal
played the underground verbatim and stayed local
my auntie is a man now
i watch him and his girl hold their hands down
tip of the avenues under street lights made his
thinking i want me a bad bitch when i get big
they hug on the corner like california king
cold hand all up her skirt cars whistling down the road
see my auntie is a man now slight bravado
scratching the likes from lotto
hoping that she pull up tomorrow
so i can hang out in the front seat
sixbynines keeping the music up under me
my auntie is a man now
asked my momma why my uncles dont like him that much
and at the parties why they always wanna fight him that much
she said aint no tellin
niggas always been jealous because he had more women
more money and more attention made more envy
calling him anything but broke was less offending

my auntie is a man now
i think im old enough to understand now
drinking paul masson with her hat turned backwards
back when it was comedic relief to say faggot
faggot faggot faggot we aint know no better
elementary kids with no filter however
my auntie became a man and i took pride in it
she wasnt gay she ate pussy and that was the difference
thats what i told my friends in second grade
she picking me up from school they stare at her in the face
they couldnt comprehend what i grew accustomed
we pull off bumpin quik like it was nothing
my auntie is a man now what a relationship
i grew up fast i needed no one to babysit
he gave me some cash then gave me some game
cherry freshener on the dash i never complained
she even cut my hair at the pad was loving my fade
the first person i seen write a rap
thats when my life had changed
house full of demo smoke stuck on the window
cameras on the microphone all women and men know
my auntie was a man now we cool with it
the history had trickled down and made us ignant
my favorite cousin said hes returning the favor
and following my auntie with the same behavior
verse 3 kendrick lamar
demetrius is maryann now
hes more confident to live his plan now talking to the worlds gonna bring you down
but the family in disbelief this time talking to the worlds gonna bring you down
convincing themselves he aint living discreet hes fine talking to the worlds gonna bring you down
they said they never seen it in him but i seen it ooh ooh ooh ooh
the barbie dolls played off reflection of venus ooh ooh ooh ooh
he built a wall so tall you couldnt climb over
he didnt laugh as hard when the kids start joking ooh ooh ooh ooh
faggot faggot faggot we aint know no better
middle school kids with no filter however
i had to be very mindful of my good cousin
i knew exactly who he was but i still loved him
demetrius is maryann now
i mean hes really maryann even took things further
changed his gender before bruce jenner was certain
living his truth even if it meant see a surgeon
we didnt talk for a while he seemed more distant
wasnt comfortable around me everything was offensive
but i recall we both had a sick sense of humor
made raw but time changes all

verse 4 kendrick lamar
demetrius is maryann now
remember church easter sunday
i sat in the pew you had stronger faith
more spiritual when these dudes were living life straight
which i found ironic cause the pastor didnt see him the same
he said my cousin was going through some things
he promised the world we living in was an act on abomination
and demetrius was to blame
i knew you was conflicted by the feelings of preacherman
wondering if god still call you a decent man
still you found the courage to be subservient just to anoint
until he singled you out to prove his point saying
demetrius is maryann now
church his auntie is a man now it hurt
you the most cause your belief was close to his words
forcing me to stand now
i said mr preacherman should we love thy neighbor
the laws of the land or the heart whats greater
i recognize the study she was taught since birth
but that dont justify the feelings that my cousin preserved
the building was thinking out loud bad angel
thats when you looked at me and smiled said thank you
the day i chose humanity over religion
the family got closer it was all forgiven
i said them fbombs i aint know any better
mistakenly i aint think that youd know any different
see i was taught words was nothing more than a sound
if ever they was pronounced without any intentions
the very second you challenged the shit i was kicking
reminded me about a show i did out the city
that time i brung a fan on stage to rap
but disapproved the word that she couldnt say with me
you said kendrick aint no room for contradiction
to truly understand love switch position
faggot faggot faggot we can say it together
but only if you let a white girl say nigga47embed"
