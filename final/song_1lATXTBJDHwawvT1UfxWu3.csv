who are you to wave your finger
you mustve been out your head
eye hole deep in muddy waters
you practically raised the dead
rob the grave to snow the cradle
then burn the evidence down
soapbox house of cards and glass so
dont go tossin your stones around
you mustve been high
you mustve been high
you mustve been

bridge 1
foot in mouth and head up ass
so whatcha talkin bout
difficult to dance round this one
til you pull it out boy
you mustve been so high
you mustve been so high

verse 2
steal borrow refer save your shady inference
kangaroo done hung the juror with the innocent
now youre weepin shades of cozened indigo
got lemon juice up in your eye
when you pissed all over my black kettle
you mustve been high high
you mustve been high high
see tool liveget tickets as low as 64you might also likeverse 3
who are you to wave your finger so full of it
eye balls deep in muddy waters fuckin hypocrite
liar lawyer mirror show me whats the difference
kangaroo done hung the guilty with the innocent
now youre weepin shades of cozened indigo
got lemon juice up in your eye eye
when you pissed all over my black kettle
you mustve been

bridge 2
so who are you to wave your finger
who are you to wave your fatty fingers at me
you must have been out your mind
weepin shades of indigo
shed without a reason
weepin shades of indigo

verse 4
liar lawyer mirror for ya whats the difference
kangaroo be stoned hes guilty as the government
now youre weepin shades of cozened indigo
got lemon juice up in your eye eye
now when you pissed all over my black kettle
you mustve been high high high high

eyeballs deep in muddy waters
youre balls deep in muddy waters
ganja please
you must have been out your mind49embed"
