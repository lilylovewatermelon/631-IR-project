you came out of nowhere
stealing my heart and brain
flaming my every cell
you make me feel myself

chorus anthony gonzalez
oh oh oh oh oh ohohoh
oh oh oh oh oh ohohoh
will you stay in this land forever
will you stay in this land forever

verse 2 anthony gonzalez
across the time and space
a neverending dance
a blooming and a trance
you make me feel my soul
theres no more loneliness
only sparkles and sweat
theres no more single fate
you make me feel myself

chorus anthony gonzalez
oh oh oh oh oh ohohoh
oh oh oh oh oh ohohoh
will you stay in this land forever
will you stay in this land forever

my body is like a lightning rod
capsize me and douse me in your bay
a shiver of want always
when you are on the tip of my tongue
in the back of your parked car
i could build a fort
and play all day
between your lips and mine
lets stay here forever

chorus anthony gonzalez
oh oh oh oh oh ohohoh
oh oh oh oh oh ohohoh
will you stay in this land forever
will you stay in this land forever11embed"
