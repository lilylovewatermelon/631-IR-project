youre like a highway to a rebel thats ready to run
a no trespass sign on a barbwire jump
that i cant resist thats just the way it is
youre a dont touch red button i want to push
a bad for me that feels so good
and we both know i cant say no

chorus
cause a phone call turns into a whats up whats up
turns into baby can you pick me up
hey im downtown and i dont wanna go home
after two left turns its you and me alone
turns into tangled up on my couch with you
slipping your kisses right across my mouth
and that turns into later on
later on lights turned down
cause i cant turn you down

verse 2
i could say that i aint picking up next time
i could say i dont want it but id be lying
cause baby the truth is i want you
and there aint a damn thing i can do

chorus
a phone call turns into a whats up whats up
turns into baby can you pick me up
hey im downtown and i dont wanna go home
after two left turns its you and me alone
turns into tangled up on my couch with you
slipping your kisses right across my mouth
and that turns into later on
later on lights turned down
cause i cant turn you down
see jon pardi liveget tickets as low as 63you might also likebridge
youre like my favorite song
i cant turn you off

chorus
a phone call turns into a whats up whats up
turns into baby can you pick me up
hey im downtown and i dont wanna go home
after two left turns its you and me alone
turns into tangled up on my couch with you
slipping your kisses right across my mouth
and that turns into later on
later on lights turned down
cause i cant turn you down
no i cant turn you down
cant turn you downembed"
