i care about you baby baby
more than youll ever know

verse 2
up til the sun rises
theres no compromising
i know i know i know
you are such a liar
i never denied you
i was for sure
but its really out of my control
the way you feel is not my problem
i dont wanna see you go
but i dont have time to solve this
and you dont have the right
after all you put me through
