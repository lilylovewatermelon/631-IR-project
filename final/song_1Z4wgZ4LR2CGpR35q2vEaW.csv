epiphany
epiphany
definition 1 the manifestation of a supernatural being
definition 2 a sudden moment of insight or revelation
marinate on the though
tallahassee love

they thought i left man
yeah tpain lets go man
tpain man im back in this thang
you already know what it is
hey tallahassee got my back though
this how it went aye

verse 1 tpain
i used to hit the stage with my js on
40 brought me to the west coast
now its khaki suits with my shades on
im on the same shit game on
but on sundays im like diddy  grown man with one chain on
when i come back niggas see my growth
they see my mommas two cars and both of my daddy boats
they see the sean john coats tag
they see my wife hoppin out the lamborghini with the coach bag
im gettin paid for nuttin
sittin back drinkin lemonade chillin in the shade im stuntin
makin hits when i graze the button
go ahead and put them two baby seats in my escalade
its nothin im gettin money
learned from the past and the future
learned not to never stab a nigga thatll shoot ya
even though my pockets gettin fatter
im still gettin tallahassee love and thats all that matters
jay lyriq get em
see tpain liveget tickets as low as 49you might also likehook jay lyriq
ive been there and ive been back
but somethin here always brings me back
so when im here i get that tallahassee love
if you love me then i love you
my people love it when i come through
so when i do i get that tallahassee love

outro tpain
it shouldnt have to be like this man
i dont know how i did it either man
i know you haters hatin this right here boy
second time around lets go manembed"
