every day you want me to make
something i hate all for your sake
im such a fake im just a doll
im a ripoff and it turns you on

verse
bought some new clothes
then i polish my toes
then i powder my nose
in case you get close get too close baby
knock on your door
then i put on a show
then i gave you the floor
and you just froze

chorus
every day you want me to make
something i hate all for your sake
im such a fake im just a doll
im a ripoff and it turns you on

postchorus
and it turns you on
and it turns you on
and it turns you on

someone has to do it do it
so i guess i will me
you want more influence
and i i can be your thrill
i can be your thrill
i can be your thrill can i be yours
i can be your boy

outro
and it turns you on
and it turns you on
and it turns you on
and it turns you on37embed"
