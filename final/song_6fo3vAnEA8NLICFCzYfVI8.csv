give me one good reason to love you
give me one good reason to tell you
i’m in love no more
i’m walking out that door

verse 1
i could have saw it coming from far and away
now you’ve got me running running away
walk out the door cause i don’t need your love
i don’t mind the feeling of sleeping alone
i’m better off being being on my own
walk out the door cause i don’t need your love

chorusx2

verse 2
got a pistol in my pocket and a bottle of booze
the time has come fuck it got nothing to lose
walk out the door cause i don’t need your love
it’s the same damn feeling i’ve been here too long
the truth is so revealing i knew it all along
walk out the door cause i don’t need your love
