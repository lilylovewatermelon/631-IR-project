she said the mans going home with me
she told the bar she was taking all bets
well never trust a woman drinking whiskey
that lights her own cigarette
i started calling her baby temptation was driving me wild
i think the only thing that saved me
its just not my style

chorus
cause im not the kind of man that goes out just looking for a woman
i like the price you pay to keep passion on solid ground
im not the kind of man that holds out on a need for nothing
im as lonely as any man around
i just dont like to pick them up and lay them down
lay them down
pick them up and lay them down

verse 2
so we went from bottoms up to coffee cups
a corner booth where the lights got dim
we started talking bout getting real close
about how and about when
it started raining harder and harder
i got up and with a thoughtful smile
i said honey if that aint thunder and lightning
it just aint worthwhile

im not the kind of man that goes out just looking for a woman
i like the price you pay to keep passion on solid ground
im not the kind of man that holds out on a need for nothing
im as lonely as any man around
i just dont like to pick them up and lay them down
lay them down down down down down

bridge
i turned around and gave her one last smile
and thought about one long kiss
but that would be taking it too far baby
and maybe something i couldnt resist

chorus
im not the kind of man that goes out just looking for a woman
i like the price you pay to keep passion on solid ground
im not the kind of man that holds out on a need for nothing
im as lonely as any man around
i just dont like to pick them up and lay them down
lay them down
pick them up and lay them down
lay them down

outro
if it aint about thunder and lightning
it just aint worthwhile
lord knows it just aint my style
pick them up and lay them down down down down down
pick them up and lay them downembed"
