im back again in this town to find a girl that i used to know
i bumped into a friend of mine and she told me where to go
she said go right down to 56th street
make a left at the corner store
there will be a house on the alley way
i hope she didnt move away
i pray shes still around
but somebody came to the door that i didnt know
and i knew i had to let her go
is it over all over
i let a good girl get away

chorus
how could i ever let her get away
today is not a happy day
so many words that i had to say
baby i miss you and i need your love
how could i ever let her get away
today is not a happy day
it could have been our anniversary
ill do anything to have you right here in my arms

verse 2
remember when we talked about
all the things that we planned to do
our wedding day a house in the valley
and maybe a kid two
we could have had it all but somehow it all fell apart
i agree to take the blame see im feeling so ashamed
i never should have lied
ill give anything to see your pretty face again
to hold you to be with you heaven give me one more chance

how could i ever let her get away
today is not a happy day
so many words that i had to say
baby i miss you and i need your love
how could i ever let her get away
today is not a happy day
it could have been our anniversary
ill do anything to have you right here in my arms

bridge
if only it were possible for me to turn back the hands of time
id do anything ill give anything just to make her mine
i cant live without your lovin baby i cant go on another day
where did she go i gotta know
i let a good girl get away get away get away

chorus
how could i ever let her get away
today is not a happy day
so many words that i had to say
baby i miss you and i need your love
how could i ever let her get away
today is not a happy day
it could have been our anniversary
ill do anything to have you right here in my armsembed"
