round here fast is how the grass grows
lost  is what you find on a back road
proofs  in the whiskey reds in the dirt
and hard work stops at the fence row
we stand for the flag and if you dont like it we dont care
cause  we do things a little different round here

chorus
where  brave is eighteen wearin army green
truth is in the words in red we read
proud  is what you say about where youre from
heroes are daddies and mamas are love
where right is right and wrong is wrong
yeah were doin things a little different round here

verse 2
easys  at the end of a long day
frees how you feel not what you pay
simples how we live yeah thanks is what we give cmon
roots in the grounds why we stay why we stay

chorus
brave is eighteen wearin army green
truth is in the words in red we read
proud is what you say about where youre from
heroes are daddies and mamas are love
yeah right is right and wrong is wrong
yeah were doin things a little different round here
