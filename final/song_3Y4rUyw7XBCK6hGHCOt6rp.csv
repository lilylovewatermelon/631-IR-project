close the door
not all the way
he don’t understand
we don’t understand
so don’t you wanna remind me
i don’t know a thing
and some of us remember
and some run out of place

chorus
can i waste all your time here on the sidewalk
can i stand in your light just for a while
i’ve waited around to wait in a room
having a hard time watching you

verse 2
you got it down now don’t you
i wanted to understand your face
so don’t you wanna remind me
i don’t know a thing
and some of us remember
and some run out of place

chorus
can i waste all your time here on the sidewalk
can i stand in your light just for a while
i’ve waited around to wait in a room
having a hard time watchin you
