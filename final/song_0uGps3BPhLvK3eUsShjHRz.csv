i wanna do it til the sun comes up
til were both so good and sweaty we cant stand up
i wanna do it till were both about to drop
as long as were caught in together then were never gonna stop

i wanna go until the neighbors all complain
cause they heard somebody screaming and they think were both in pain
i wanna go so long your parents think you died
theyâ€™re gonna call the cops the cia and then the fbi

chorus
yeah were gonna love it when the lights go down
hold on here we go
yeah were gonna go until our legs give out
round and round we go
yeah were gonna do it hanging upside down
up and down we go
yeah were getting ready for the next go round
round and round we go

verse 2
shut the windows lock the doors unplug the phone
for all intents and purposes there aint nobody home
then we can do it till the batteries are gone
and borrow two from the tv remote to throw this thing back on
i wanna cover you with jello in the tub
we can roll around for hours without ever coming up
i want you naked with your favorite heels on
slap john deere across my ass and ride me up and down the lawn
see nickelback liveget tickets as low as 74you might also likechorus
yeah were gonna love it when the lights go down
hold on here we go
yeah were gonna go until our legs give out
round and round we go
yeah were gonna do it hanging upside down
up and down we go
yeah were getting ready for the next go round
round and round we go

solo

chorus
yeah were gonna love it when the lights go down
hold on here we go
yeah were gonna go until our legs give out
round and round we go
yeah were gonna do it hanging upside down
up and down we go
yeah were getting ready for the next go round
round and round we go2embed"
