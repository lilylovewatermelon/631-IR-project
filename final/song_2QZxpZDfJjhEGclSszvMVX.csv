your bottles almost empty
you know this cant go on
because of you my mind is always racing
the needles breaking your skin
the scar is sinking in
and now your trip begins

its all over for you for you
when youre on the edge and falling off
its all over for you for you
when youre on the edge and falling off
its all over

verse 2
i know what runs through your blood
you do this all in vain
because of you my mind is always racing
and it gets under my skin
to see you giving in
and now your trip begins

chorus
but its all over for
its all over for you for you
when youre on the edge and falling off
its all over for you for you
when youre on the edge and falling off
its all over
