feel like maybe i might go to boston
cut my hair in the way that ive wanted
change my number and bury my wallet
california makes me exhausted

chorus
im lost
im lost

verse 2
heard a poem about midoctober
how the leaves in the fall feel like closure
about a girl that the guy wasnt over
think that i might relate when im older

chorus
im lost
im lost
im lost
im lost

verse 3
tough i dont know a lot that could hurt me
learned the hard way to forget my body
til youre walking around like a zombie
still dont know how to talk through that story
