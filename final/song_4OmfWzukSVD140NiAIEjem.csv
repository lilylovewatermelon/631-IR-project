baby you got something in your nose
sniffin that k did you feel the hole
hope you find peace for yourself
new boyfriend aint gon fill the void
do you even really like this track
take away the drugs would you feel the noise
more and more you try to run away
you fucking yourself do you feel the toy
uh lookin for a bitch cause im over boys
would you be my girlfriend baby
ooh woah woah woah woah
something turned me off
smoking made me—cough
cause i im longing for somethin secure
if you had to stunt your shining for your lover dump that fucker
