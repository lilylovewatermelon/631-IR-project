im in conniptions for the final act you came here for
the one derivative you manage is the one i abhor
i need a minute to elaborate for everyone the
everyday abusive things that you have done
your impossible egofuck
is like a megalomaniacal tab on my tongue
and if you touch me i will rip you apart
ill reach in and take a bite out of that bitch you call a heart

chorus
i know why you blame me
i know why you plague yourself
i know why you blame me
i know why you plague yourself

verse 2
im turning it around like a knife in the shell
i wanna understand why but im hurting myself
i havent seen a lot of reasons to stop it i cant just drop it
im just a bastard but at least i admit it at least i admit it

chorus
i know why you blame me
i know why you plague yourself
i know why you blame me
i know why you plague yourself
i know you plague me
i know why you blame yourself
i know why you plague me
i know why you blame yourself
