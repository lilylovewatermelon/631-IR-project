its just a piece of paper it says in god we trust
a little sure felt good
but a lot was not enough
and everybody loved me when i was on a roll
and i thought i had everything
when i held the gold

chorus
but youre not my god
and youre not my friend
youre not the one that i will walk with in the end
youre not the truth
youre a temporary shot
you ruin peoples lives and you dont give a second thought
youre not my god

verse 2
little white lines on a mirror
cut neatly in a roll
a medicine that kept me from looking in my soul
i thought you were the answer
to all of my despair
and you almost had me six feet down
but im still breathing air
see keith urban liveget tickets as low as 4you might also likechours
but youre not my god
and youre not my friend
youre not the one that i will walk with in the end
youre not the truth
youre a temporary shot
you ruin peoples lives and you dont give a second thought
youre not my god

verse 3
from the cradle to the grave
temptations all around
but no matter how good the fix
its going to take you down
now some call it a weakness
some call it a sin
but its all the same behind each game
i see your evil grin

chorus x2
but youre not my god
and youre not my friend
youre not the one that i will walk with in the end
youre not the truth
youre a temporary shot
you ruin peoples lives and you dont give a second thought
youre not my god
but youre not my god
and youre not my friend
youre not the one that i will walk with in the end
youre not the truth
youre a temporary shot
you ruin peoples lives and you dont give a second thought
youre not my god
outro
youre not my god
oh oh oh youre not my god
youre not my god
mmmmm not my god
not my god
youre not youre not youre not my god
no youre notembed"
