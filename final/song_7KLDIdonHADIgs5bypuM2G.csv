they got that
they got that kryptonite

it seems the more i try to do right
the more i lie about being at sessions and leaving at certain times
shes like where you at
im at the studio at home
and im thinking to myself we cut that record days ago
cause shorty on the east side hit me and want to know if i could stop by
now im contemplating what i am gonna say bout this being the umpteenth time that im late

i wanna be your superman
im trying to save our love the best way that i can
cause these girls theyre like kryptonite
these girls my kryptonite
these girls got kryptonite
these girls my kryptonite
and i really wanna make it work but i cant stop messing round
im here doing dirt
cause these girls theyre like kryptonite
these girls my kryptonite
these girls got kryptonite
these girls my kryptonite
oh baby
you might also likeits like the more i brush them off the more they call
the more i want to tell them that im not in love
with anyone when i know its you
wanna tell the truth but its just so hard to do
caught up in me again its driving me crazy
its the reason i wont tell em i got a lady
now im trying to contemplate on what i am gonna say on this being the umpteenth time that im late

no matter what i do i know that your my true love
but i just cant help it to get caught up with all these broads
sitting here with this mic in my hand
trying to record the words to make my baby understand

i wanna be your superman
im trying to save our love the best way that i can
cause these girls theyre like kryptonite
these girls my kryptonite
these girls got kryptonite
these girls my kryptonite

and i really wanna make it work but i cant stop messing round
im here doing dirt
cause these girls theyre like kryptonite
these girls my kryptonite
these girls got kryptonite
these girls my kryptonite
oh baby
i want you to be my lois lane
girl i promise im gonna change and it aint gonna be this way forever
girl im gonna get myself together cause your the one i love
because your like a drug that i cant get enough of
im just so confused dont know what to do
cause the way that its feeling i like how its feeling
its getting so hard to fight that feeling

im a rich boy riding wit my bitch superstar shit
the one girls try to get they text me on my sidekick
bring em to my palace tell em take it off we make a flick
every night i do it so at least one chick i gotta get
just like kryptonite them girls make me super weak
suck my dick and play with me until they put me straight to sleep
twenty girls on my sheets seven days out the week
its hard trying to hold it down with groupies trying to get with me
i stay dreaming fantasizing with my eyes closed
i love you girl but im addicted to them hoes
if ballin is a sin then god please forgive me
my women so bad and my money so filthy really

i wanna be your superman
im trying to save our love the best way that i can
cause these girls theyre like kryptonite
these girls my kryptonite
these girls got kryptonite
these girls my kryptonite
and i really wanna make it work but i cant stop messing round
im here doing dirt
cause these girls theyre like kryptonite
these girls my kryptonite
these girls got kryptonite
these girls my kryptonite
i wanna be your superman
im trying to save our love the best way that i can
cause these girls theyre like kryptonite
these girls my kryptonite
these girls got kryptoniteembed"
