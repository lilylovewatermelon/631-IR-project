feelin my way through the darkness
guided by a beatin heart
i cant tell where the journey will end
but i know where to start
they tell me im too young to understand
they say im caught up in a dream
well life will pass me by if i dont open up my eyes
well thats fine by me

chorus aloe blacc
so wake me up when its all over
when im wiser and im older
all this time i was findin myself and i
didnt know﻿ i was lost
so wake me up when its all over
when im wiser and im older
all this time i was findin myself and i
didnt know﻿ i was lost

verse 2 aloe blacc
i tried carryin the weight of the world
but i only have two hands
hope i get the chance to travel the world
but i dont have any plans
wish that i could stay forever this young
not afraid to close my eyes
lifes a game﻿ made for everyone
and love is the prize
