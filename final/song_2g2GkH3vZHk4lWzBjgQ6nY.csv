i would really wanna know whats happening
i dont wanna be on mother earth no more
cause mister dobalina left her raped and sore
all i see is grey up in this thang
and all i want is paint the world green again
who has the right to prevent me from tokin and coughin
and everytime i see a tree i aint recognize nothin
its the beauty in so many things that i dont see
because im blind from technology we think is pretty
so i need to change my priority that i think of
to gather gratitude indo nature and love
and try to make everybody understand and see
what a wonderful world this could be

1 2 3 back to the intention
of mr sam cooke i aint forget to mention
dont know much about history and though i want to rest
i have to learn it cause tomorrow we are gonna write a test
and im not interested in the subject because the past
is something not like the presence that is not gonna last
you cant live reminiscing or else your memories will change ya
not in a good way they will rather fool and derange ya
focus on your focus and focus not on distractions
your goal is way better than all their little attractions
be strong and courageous be patient stay optimistic
and after a while you gon see the lights in the distant
but talk is cheap i wish it was that easy
what a wonderful world this would beyou might also likeembed"
