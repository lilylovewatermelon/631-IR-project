this shit right here for my oodles o noodles babies
his ma’ smoked the crack while she was pregnant so he cant even help that he crazy
he goin to jail it’s inevitable forreal

verse 1
i aint have nobody to give me no hope
i hope my momma aint doin no coke
i used to wish that my daddy was livin
i had a dream that i seen him as ghost
i used to act up when i went to school
thought it was cool but i really was hurt
wanted my family to come to my games
my mama couldnt make it cause she was at work
lived with my grandma she took me to church
really no i aint wanna go
remember i kissed my aunt in the casket
and her forehead was cold
i was like 4 years old
we couldn’t afford no clothes
it was hand me down
who would think a nigga get a grammy now
got a black judge tryna tear me down
all this jail time probably wear me down
turn the lights off in the bathroom
screaming bloody bloody bloody mary now
havin’ nightmares about candyman
with the tool on me like a handyman
killed my lil cousin i’m like damn it man
had to see the footage on a camera man
on the pavement with his brains out
with the white sheet he was laid out
wanna ask ye is this a choice
it was like this when i came out
what the fuck is you really complaining bout
i know niggas thats never gon’ make it out
this that shit you wont see in the media
poor get poorer and the rich gettin greedier
lot of daddies goin back and forth out of jail
lot of sons growin up and repeating them
this the belly of the beast you wont make it out
man this shit was designed just to eat us up
and my momma told nigga keep it up
you gon end up in prison just sweepin up
remember nobody never believed in us
when they see us now they cant believe its us no
you might also likeinterlude
i think its funny how
we used to go to school play segas
and then next thing you know you runnin round with glock 40s
we aint never believed in the police they was shootin us

verse 2
yeah they called it the projects they put us in projects
what they gon do with us cant call the cops yet
you might just get popped at
cause they the ones shootin us
im on my moms steps its like a bomb threat
the violence pursuing us i aint meet god yet
cause im on the block where
its just me and lucifer look what they do to us
they know we in poverty
when i went to court the judge said meek you a menace to society
huh you said you would give me a chance your honor why would you lie to me
16 more years of probation you know you gon get some more time on me huh
whole hood goin crazy babies havin babies
she was fourteen actin like she eighty
got pregnant by a nigga that was locked up in them cages
and the story goes on if you make it you amazing word up

outro
see i got homie thats a billionaire
and i be tryin to explain it to him like
if your mom aint on crack or if she got a job and she doing eight hours a day
and your daddy in the graveyard or in the jail cell who the fuck gon babysit8embed"
