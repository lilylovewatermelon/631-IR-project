no one knows
just what has become of her
shattered doll desperate
oh so innocent and delicate
but too damn obdurate and obstinate to let go
broken down hurt again
it never ends
frightened and trembling
did she fall again an accident
her eyes encircled in black again
i cant believe that shes still with him

chorus 1
for how long will you try
how long until you walk away
your façade cant disguise
the fact that youre in misery

verse 2
look inside
see what has become of her
hiding within again
can she pick herself up again
its just too difficult and arduous to let go
homicide flashes through her mind again
no more pain take control
if he raises his hand again
shell find her freedom in killing him
the world will see that shes had enough

for how long will you try
how long until you walk away
your façade cant disguise
the fact that youre in misery
for how long will you try
how long until you walk away
from the look in your eyes
i know you bleed internally

chorus 3
for how long you deny
how long until you walk away
your façade cant disguise
the fact that youre in misery
for how long will you try
how long until you walk away
from the look in your eyes
i know you bleed internally

outro
broken down hurt again
it never ends3embed"
