verse 1
i just caught a shawty off a finsta
just threw on a hoodie its a crenshaw
way that i been livin unconventional
im just tryna make it to the end ya know
certain things just started gettin tenser
think we need to have us an adventure
i could be your man but maybe down the road
right now i would rather see my heart turn to chrome
rather see my heart turn crystal
i cant even front like i dont miss ya
right now im just stuck inside the crib on my own
soon as i free up im bout to pop up on your phone like

verse 2
hearts still on javelin baby
too turnt baby girl you know me
i was pullin off fore they knew me
sometimes i wish there was two of me or three of me
when it was you and me
i felt like i love you too much to change you
you believe in angles more than angels
feel like ive been going through too much to explain to you
but im still the same way i was when i came to you
everything i have what i had to exchange for you
everything ive been through i cant even complain to you
wish it stayed the same for you sorry
im sorry
