chorus kelly rowland
i told myself that i would make some changes yeah
but the more i change theres one thing that remains the same
i cant seem to shake ya
you seem to really have a hold on me
and every time that we break up we turn around and make up
this cant go on now no
i gotta move on now
its not the fact that i dont love you no more
but i gotta break this bad habit
cant take this bad habit no more

verse 2 kelly rowland
im totally out of my element
learnin new ways to live while youre in a comfort zone
not even thinkin couldnt think about me
to call me when i get mad you buy me gifts
thinkin its gonna solve every issue
from the girl callin my phone phone
to the pictures that i saw you know what i saw
and every time you would break up with me for nothing at all
ive taken all i could take ive taken all i could take
but the way i live has gotta change ohoh
