i love all your shit talkin i love all your shit talkin’
you aint got nothin better to do with yourself

verse 1 kanye west
i done proved to myself back on that rulin’ myself
i got new news to tell act like you knew you done failed
only true know how i feel and only if you knew how i felt
sniffed a lil bootch off the nail
through with mixed messages through with the mail
only a few in the field little bit off for the real

verse 2 kid cudi
its so many days i prayed to god
all this pain i couldnt seem to find a way
on a mission livin carry on
got my family im seein through better days
never late pull up a seat and come grab a plate
check the date let em hate
this the type shit that they couldn’t make watch the fakes
leave ’em buzzin thought they wasn’t huh
tell all your kinfolk and cousins huh
this is the package you ordered huh
beautiful madness

outro kid cudi

these scars i left behind hmmmmm
heaven lift me up hmmmmm
heaven lift me up hmmmmm
on this road i find hmmmmm
these scars i left behind hmmmmm
