she is something to behold
elegant and bold
she is electricity
running to my soul oh

chorus
and i could easily lose my mind
the way you kiss me will work each time
calling me to come back to bed
singing georgia on my mind

verse 2
lips generous and warm
you build me up like steps
eyes innocent and wild
remind me what its like oh

chorus
and i could easily lose my mind
the way you kiss me will work each time
pulling me back into the flames
and im burning up again im burning up
