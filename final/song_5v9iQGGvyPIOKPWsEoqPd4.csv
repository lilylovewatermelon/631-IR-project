1 fade in
close shot a whiskey tumbler

that sits on an oak side bar under a glowing green bankers
lamp as two ice cubes are dropped in from elsewhere in
the room

man off
im talkin about friendship im talkin about
character im talkin abouthell leo i aint
embarassed to use the wordim talkin about
ethics

whiskey is poured into the tumbler filling it almost to
the rim as the offscreen man continues

   you know im a sporting man i like to
make the occasional bet but i aint that
sporting

the speaker

a balding middleaged man with a round open face he
still wears his overcoat and sits in a leather chair in the
dark room illuminated by the offscreen glow of a desk
lamp this is johnny caspar
behind him stands another man harder looking wearing an
overcoat and hat and holding another hatpresumably
caspars this is bluepoiont vance

caspar contd
when i fix a fight sayif i pay a threetoone
favorite to throw a goddamn fighti figure i got
a right to expect that fight to go off at three
toone but every time i lay a bet with this
sonofabitch bernie bernheim before i know it the
odds is even upor worse im betting the short
money  

behind caspar we hear the clink of ice in the tumbler and a
figure emerges from the shadows walking away from the
glowing bar in the backgound

   the sheeny knows i like sure things hes
selling the information i fixed the fight out
oftown money comes pourin in the odds go
straight to hell i dont know who hes sellin
it to maybe the los angeles combine i dont
know the point is bernie aint satisfied with
the honest dollar he can make off the vig he
aint satisfied with the business i do on his
book hes sellin tips on how i bet and that
means part of the payoff that should be ridin on
my hip is ridin on someone elses so back we
go to these questionsfriendship character
ethics
the man with the whiskey glass has just passed the camera
and we cut to the

reverse

another well dressed middle aged man behind a large
polished oak desk listening intently this is leo he is
short but powerfully built with the face of a man who has
seen things

the man with the whiskey enters frame and passes leo to
lean against the wall behind him where he listens quietly

caspar
   so its clear what im sayin

leo
clear as mud

caspar purses his lips but continues unfazed

caspar
its a wrong situation its gettin so a
businessman cant expect no return from a fixed
fight now if you cant trust a fix what can
you trust for a good return you gotta go
bettin on chance and then youre back with
anarchy right back inna jungle on account of
the breakdown of ethics thats why ethics is
important its the grease makes us get along
what separates us from the animals beasts a
burden beasts a prey ethics whereas bernie
bernheim is a horse of a different color ethics
wise as in he aint got any hes stealin
from me plain and simple
leo leans back in his chair

the man behind leo raises the whiskey glass to his lips

he is trimmer and younger than leo perhaps in his thir
ties darkcomplected with a pencil mustache and a gaunt
intensity that is not entirely healthylooking this is
tom

as he drinks he studies caspar and bluepoint

leo
you sure its bernie selling you out

for the first time the man behind caspar speaks

bluepoint
it aint elves

leo
nobody else knows about the fix

caspar
no one that aint got ethics

leo
what about the fighters you pay to tank out

bluepoint
we only pick fighters we can put the fear of god
in

leo
any other bookies know you play anyone elses
book

caspar
i lay an occasional bet with mink larouie

bluepoint
but it aint mink ill vouch for that

leo
how do you know

caspar shakes his head

caspar
it aint mink mink is bluepoints boy

leo
mm and of course bluepoint always knows about
the fix

bluepoint
what the hell is that supposed to mean

leo
let it drift all it means is a lot of people
know

caspar
i guess you aint been listening sure other
people know thats why we gotta go to this
question of character determine just who exactly
is chiseling in an my fix and thats how we
know its bernie bernheim the motzah kid
cause ethically hes kinda shaky

leo
you know bernies chiseling you because hes a
chiseler and you know hes a chiseler because
hes chiseling you

airily

caspar
sometimes you just know

leo
   so you wanna kill him

bluepoint
for starters

leo nods thinking he swivels to look interrogatively at
tom

tom gives an almost imperceptable shrug the ice cubes in
his glass clink

leo turns back to caspar pauses

leo
   sorry caspar bernie pays me for protec
tion

tom peering over his drink does not entirely conceal his
surprise

caspar stares at leo his mouth open it is not the
response he expected

caspar
   listen leo i aint askin for permission
im tellin you as a courtesy i need to do this
thing so its gonna get done

leo
then im telling you as a courtesy that youll
have trouble you came here to see if id kick
if you killed bernie well theres your answer

caspars voice is harder

caspar
listen leo i pay off to you every month like a
greengrocera lot more than the motzahand im
sick a gettin the high hat

leo
you pay off for protection just like everyone
else far as i knowand what i dont know in
this town aint worth knowingthe cops havent
closed any of your dives and the oa hasnt
touched any of your rackets you havent bought
any license to kill bookies and today i aint
selling any now take your flunky and dangle

caspar is staring at leo he looks at tom then rises
slowly to his feet back at leo

caspar
ya know im tryin   im tryin not to raise my
voice in anga ive always gone along to get
along but you make me lay off the matzoh and
youre givin me the needle i told you the
sheeny was robbin me blind i told you i wanna
put him in the ground and im telling you now im
sick a the high hat

he swipes his hat from bluepoint

   you think im some guinea fresh off the
boat and you think you can kick me but im too
big for that now

he puts his hands on the desk and leans towards leo
the cords stand out on his ndck

im sickof takin the strap from you leo im
sick a marchin down to this goddamn office to
kiss your irish ass and im sick a the high hat

caspar stops out of breath he is red faced and panting
bluepoint has put a gently restraining hand an his shoul
der

leo and tom stare at caspar impasssively

after a beat caspar shuts his mouth his eyes lose some of
their glaze he looks at bluepoints hand turns and
strides towards the door

caspar
   youse fuckin fancypants all of ya

he opens the docr but leos voice stops him

leo
softly
johnny youre exactly as big as i let you be
and no bigger and dont forget it ever

caspar looks at lea from the open doorway after a beat he
chuckles

caspar
ats right leo youre the bigshot around here

he dances over at tom again then back to leo

   and im just some schnook likes to get
slapped around

he leaves bluepoint following shutting the door

after a beat tom crosses in front of the desk and sits down
in the chair caspar has just vacated leo chuckles and
leans back in his chair

leo
twist a pigs ear watch him squeal

tom swallows the last of his drink and stares ruminatively
down at his glass

tom
   bad play leo

leo unfazed grins at tom

leo
got up on the wrong side huh

tom
same side as always

leo
thats what i mean still owe money towhos

tom grins back for the first time

tom
peoplell say i had it coming

leo
and theyll be right but that aint the point
call me a bighearted slob but im gonna square
it for ya

he picks up a phone on his desk and starts to dial

   yeah i think ill do that this very same
night looking at you moping around takes away
all my    what did you call it joy de veever

tom stands and walks over to the desk

tom
joi de vivre

he takes the receiver from leo and prongs the phone

leo
well look if your gonna laugh at me the hell
with you

tom walks to the door putting an his hat

tom
and with you ill square myself with lazarre if
you dont mind thats why god invented cards

he pauses in the doorway and turns back to leo

   there is something you can do for me

leo
name it

tom
think about what protecting bernie gets us
think about what offending caspar loses us

leo chuckles goodnaturedly

leo
come on tommy you know i dont like to think

tom has stepped into the hallway and just as he closes the
door

tom
yeah well think about whether you should start

the door clicks shut

cut to black

2 fade in
the woods credit sequence

although it is day the tree cover gives an effect of
almost cathedrallike darkness the sun filters down
through the leaves in gently shifting patterns

we hear only the sound of the wind and the creaking and
groaning of tree limbs in the breeze

head titles are supered over the dissolving series of woods
scenes

in the last woods scene the angle is lowalmost ground
level the sun dapples the floor of the forest which is
carpeted with pine needles

with a whoosh of rustling leaves the wind gusts a fedora
into frame for a moment it lies still in the foreground
sunlight rippling over it making it seem almost alive
then the wind picks up again and the hat tumbles away from
us end over end in slow motion into the background
impossibly far away until    it dissappears

as we fade out we hear a distant knocking

3 fade in
close shot tom

unshaven eyes closed motionless

the head credits continue over this oneshot scene

the knocking continues faintly offscreen as we hear a
door opening we pull back to a looser shot revealinq that
tom is slumped back on a tired green sofa

a fat hand enters to shake toms shoulder

voice
wake up tommy

without ocening his eyes

tom
im awake

voice
youre eyes were shut

tom
whore you gonna believe

tom sits up though it seems like an effort he looks
sick

from a small mirror behind the couch we see that we are in
the back room of a gambling establishment the leavings of
a card game litter a table in the middle background

tom
   howd i do

voice
what do you think youre a millionaire you
gonna remember your friends

tom reaches up to feel his head and looks stupidly about

tom
   wheres my hat

voice
you bet it ya moron good thing the game broke
up before you bet your shorts

after a beat of staring at nothing in particular tom
abruptly lurches to his feet and staggers out of frame

the other man sits heavily onto the couch that tom has just
vacated he is fat tony a big man wearing an apron

he watches as we hear tom offscreen staggering across the
room bumping into something which scrapes and then
clatters over opening a door staggering across tile and
then vomiting

fat tony watches with mild interest

finally

toms voice
   who left with my hat

tony
verna verna and mink

tom
   who

louder

tony
mink and verna

offscreen we hear a tap running

tom
   thunderclap running tonight

tony
yeah

tom

tony
threetoone moren likely lay off tom you
shouldnt go deeper in the hole

tom
tell lazarre i want five hundred on the nose

tony shrugs

tony
you would have it

tom
   somebody hit me

tony
yeah mink hit you

tom
   whyzat

tony inspects a hangnail on his thumb

tony
you asked him to

4 cut to
a hallway

a loose shot looking over toms shoulder as he knocks on an
partment door head credits continue

the door swings open and verna an attractive but hard
looking woman in her late twenties or early thirties looks
coldly out at tom

tom
still slightly woozy
miss me

verna
you again what now

tom
i want my hat

verna
   is that all you came for

tom
yeah i want my hat

verna
i won it its mine

tom
whatre you gonna do with it

verna
drop dead

she slams the door

there is a long motionless beat tom raises his hand and
knocks again missing the door completely on his first try

after a knock or two the door swings open again

tom
i need a drink

verna
why didnt you say so

she steps away from the door and tom enters the apartment
as the door clicks shut we cut to black and the last of
the movies head credits

music clays under the credits mixed in with the woods
sounds we heard earlier as the last of the credits is
fading to black we hear a distant knocking and from black
we

5 cut to
close shot a fedora

lying on a marble bureau top in a dark room a gently
rippling cookie plays over itlight from a streetlamp
thrown through a curtained window reflected in the bureau
mirror behind the fedora we see the soft glow of a burning
cigarette

reverse

tracking in on tom sitting in bed smoking staring at the
bureau the rippling street light plays over him from the
window we hear a distant knocking

wider

the bedroom as tom swings his legs around and gets out of
bed

tom throws on a dressing gown and leaves the bedroom
through its double oak pocket doors closing the doors
behind him

6 living room

also dark lit only by streetlight filtering in

the knocking is louder here tom crosses the room
silhouetted against the windows to the apartments front
door light fans in as he opens it

shiftng uncomfortably in the hallway is leo in an
overcoat and fedora

leo
lo tommy sorry about the hour

tom
ill live whats the rumpus

leo
can i come in

tom thinks about this for the slightest beat

tom
sure

he lets leo precede him into the living room

tom turns on a lamp that sits on a rolling bar

   drink

leo
i wouldnt mind   i tried calling earlier

tom
i got home late

as tom sits down facing leo with two drinks

leo
well   sorry about the hour

tom
uhhuh

he waits with no apparent impatience

the older man is uncomfortable he is having trouble
finding the words finally he lifts his glass and swallows
it in one gulp

leo
   not bad  

tom
better than the paint we sell at the club

leo
that it is   that it is  

tom
thought about cutting bernie loose

leo is shuffling his hat nervously from hand to hand

leo
cant do it tommy cant do it   thats sort
of why im   tommy   i dont know where
verna is

tom fixes him with a level stare then takes a sip of his
drink

tom
uhhuh

leo
i know what youre thinking what else is new
but the situation now im worried  

tom blows out air

tom
verna can take care of herself maybe better
than you can

leo
what does that mean

tom stands up takes leos glass and walks back over to the
bar

tom
want another

leo
no what does that mean

tom turns to look at leo pauses then decides to speak

tom
how far has she got her hooks into you

leo
thats a hell of a question

tom
its a grift leo if she didnt need you to
protect her brother from johnny caspar dyou
think shed still go with you on slow carriage
rides through the park that is the deal isnt
it you keep bernie under wraps till caspar
cools down

leo
jesus but youre a prickly pear whats wrong
with her wanting her brother taken care of

tom
not a thing i dont blame her she sees the
anglewhich is youand she plays it shes a
grifter just like her brother they probably
had grifter parents and grifter grandparents and
someday theyll each spawn little grifter kids

leo
stop it tommy i dont like to hear my friends
run down even by other friends

tom shrugs

tom
friendships got nothing to do with it

leo
the hell you say you do anything to help your
friends just like you do anything to kick your
enemies

tom
wrong leo you do things for a reason

leo
okay tom you know the angleschrist better
than anybody but youre wrong about this you
dont know whats in vernas heart  

tom stares down into his drink there is an awkward pause
then finally without looking up

tom
leo throw her down and her brother too dump
her

leo looks like he has just been stepped on

leo
jesus tom   vernas okay  

he nods to himself

shes a little wild but shes okay i
like her

tom smiles

tom
yeah you like her like the kaiser likes
cabbage youre dizzy for her

leo scowls at tom

leo
what of it jesus tom aint you ever been bit
by that bug

tom
leo if shes such an angel why are you looking
for her at four in the morning

leo digs his hands into his pockets and slouches back
profoundly embarassed

leo
i put a tail on her this afternoon

tom
hah

leo
yeah i asked rug daniels to follow her around
just you know just to keep her out of trouble

tom
and to tell you what trouble she was managing to
whip up herself

leo
it wasnt to spy tom i was worried after that
meeting with caspar wellyou cant be too
careful

tom
uhhuh and what did rug tell you that has you
scurrying over here

leo
thats just it nothing hes disappeared

tom laughs humorlessly

tom
so youve lost your ladyfriend and the tail you
put an her

leo
i guess it does sound pretty sorry at that  

he looks from his empty glass up to tom

   help me out tom i wouldnt know where to
start looking you know rugs crowd you know
the people verna runs with im just worried
now with things the way they are between me and
caspar

tom gives a wave of disgust

tom
you shouldnt be confronting johnny caspar its
what ive been trying to tell you you cant
trade body blows with him hes gotten too
strong

for the first time leo displays some testiness

leo
i reckon i can still trade body blows with any
man in this town  

he sighs looks back down at his drink

   except you tom

tom
and verna

leo smiles goodnaturedly

leo
okay give me the needle i am a sap i deserve
it  

he stands and walks to the door

tom doesnt move his eyes remain fixed on the chair leo
has just vacated

leo pauses in the open doorway

   thanks for the drink let me know if you
hear anything  

the door closes and he is gone

tom grimaces and stands up sunlight is just starting to
come in through the windows defining for the first time
the corners of the large semicircular room as tom walks
across it to the bedroom distant earlymorning traffic
noise is filtering up from the street

7 int bedroom

as tom opens the double oak doors and enters leaving them
open

he crosses to the bed and sits an its edge hunched
forward thinking behind him a woman stirs

woman
sleepily
who was that

tom
leo  

he takes a cigarette from the nightstand and lights it

   hes looking for you

verna stiffens

verna
did you tell him i was here

tom
no

verna relaxes

verna
did you put in a good word for my brother

tom
no

verna

tom
   i said id think about it

verna
what did you tell him

tom is lost in thought he exhales smoke

tom
   did you see rug daniels last night

verna
no what did you tell leo

tom finally turns to face her after looking at her for a
beat

tom
   i told him you were a tramp and he should
dump you

a shoe flies past his head and hits the wall behind him

verna
youre a son of a bitch tom

7 ext alleyway early morning

we are on an extreme close shot of a small dog behind
him in the distance we can see the mouth of the alley

the dog is on point perfectly still one front leg crooked
and raised off the ground his ears pointed straight up
his eyes in a fixed stare

a man

is slouched halfsitting against the wall of the alley
he is motionless his mouth is agape his eyes are rolled
up in a lifeless stare

he is wearing an overcoat but it is unbuttoned and reveals
a blood stain in the middle of his chest his fedora lies
on the ground near one of his splayed hands

there is something subtly odd about his hair

close shot a little boy

perhaps five years old he stares down at the dead man in
front of him

close shot the man

staring vacantly

the boy

after a moment he reaches forward

the man

as the boys hand enters frame the boy pokes once at the
mans shoulder

there is no reaction

the boy touches the top of the mans head

the mans hair slips forward a couple of inches over over his
forehead

the boy

staring

the man

also staring his skewed hairpiece ill becoming his stunned
expression

the boy reaches forward and takes the hairpiece off the
mans head now a bald man stares off into smace still
looking stunned still quite dead

wide shot the alley

the dead man and the little bov face each other in profile
in the middle foreground in the background between them
the little boys dog faces us still on point still
whining

the little boy is fascinated by the hairpiece he holds he
turns it over and around and looks from it to the dead
man

suddenly the boy turns and runs away from us towards the
mouth of the alley still clutching the hairpiece

as he passes the dog it turns and runs after him wagging
its tail happy to be leaving

fade out

9 fade in
int diner evening

a man sits facing us at the counter in the foreground his
face is hidden by the newspaper he is reading

the page of the newspaper being presented to the camera
bears a story headlined gangster slain the subhead
politicians aide found dead in alley

after a beat the diner drops the paper to the counter and
we see that it is tom wearing overcoat and hat he is
grimacing at whatever he was reading he stands and digs
into his pocket

reverse

looking down at the newspaper an the counter next to a
steaming cup of coffee toms hand enters to put some
change on the counter leaves and we hear his receding
footsteps

the headlined story on the page tom was reading is
thunderclap injured in racing mishap

   they dont seem too happy about it leo

ogar

tom ignores them

tom

this hornets nest wont be good for anyone and
itll mean killing

leo
well im not thrilled about it either but i
cant just lay down to caspar

tom
you could do worse you might not like it but
giving up bernie bernheim is a pretty small price
to pay for peace business is business and a
wars going to hurt everybody bernie plays with
fire hes got to deal with the consequences
even if that means he gets bumped off

leo

mayor

leo
siddown dale were all friends here

tom
and caspar hasnt broken the rules bernie has
and you too by helping him and if that isnt
enough consider that if you make it a war you
have more to lose than caspar

leo is getting up from behind the desk and walking over to
stare out the window

leo

two of usve faced worse odds

tom
but never without reason it helps to have one

leo doesnt reply tom is irritated but shrugs indif
ference

the hubbub of female voices evaporates as all turn to look
at the male intruder

the lounges decor is done in various shades of pink some
of the women apply makeup facing the large bulbencircled
mirrors on overstuffed seashell shaped pink chairs other
women sit smoking in the banquettes that line the other
wall

all react to toms entrance with surprise mixed with
various degrees of outrage and they hurry to gather their
things and leave the one exception is verna who looks at
tom with unperturbed distaste

as he crosses to her seashell chair

tom
whos the warpaint for

verna
go home and dry out

tom
you dont need it for leo believe me he
already thinks youre the original miss jesus

she glances hurriedly around the lounge but the last of
the women are already leaving

verna
   what the hells the matter with you

tom
whats the matter with you afraid people might
get the right idea

verna studies him for a beat

verna
leos got the right idea i like him hes
honest and hes got a heart

tom weaves a couple of steps closer to her

tom
then its true what they say opposites attract

verna
do me a favor and mind your own business

she turns back to the mirror and starts applying her
lipstick tom drops down to face her in the mirror

tom
this is my business intimidating helpless women is
part of what i do

verna
then find one and intimidate her

tom swallows the rest of his drink in one gulp

tom
leos upstairs getting ready to shoot himself in
the foot on your account

verna
i dont know what youre talking about

tom
hes gonna go to the mat for your brother and
its gonna hurt him

verna
i dont know leos business but hes a big boy

tom
he used to be

verna causes with the lipstick she looks at tom intently
but her tone softens

verna
look what do you want tom you want me to
pretend i dont care what happens to bernie
well i do hes my brother and i dont want him
to get hurt if leo wants to help him out ill
step out with him show him a good time in
return theres no harm in that

tom
theres a name for that kind of business arrange
ment

verna
ill do what i have to for bernie and theres no
reason for you to try and queer that regardless
of what you think of me bernies a decent guy

tom
a straight shooter huh a square gee

verna
yeah sneer at him like everyone else just
because hes different people think hes a
degenerate people think hes scum well hes

tom
poor misunderstood bernie

verna swivels around to stare quizzically at tom

verna
   what is this about you want me to stop
seeing leo    why dont you just say so

tom
i want you to quit spinning leo in circles and
pointing him where to go

verna
i forgotthats your job isnt it

tom

asking youpolitely for meto leave him alone
i dont have to ask if i told him about our
little dance last night your pull would dry up
pretty fast

now verna is irritated

verna

tom
i dont like being played for a sucker that
game might work with leo but it wont work with
me

verna
you think last night was just more campaigning
for my brother

tom
i can see the angles  

he grabs her by the arm and drags her roughly to her feet

   and i know if there was a market for little
old ladies youd have grandma bernheim first on
line

verna
struggling to get out of his grasp
youre a pathetic rumhead

tom
and i love you angel

tom takes her hat off tosses it onto the chair and kisses
her roughly on the lips

verna breaks away and socks him on the jaw tom staggers
back upsetting a table of toiletries and landing against a
banquette

he throws his empty whiskey glass at verna

she ducks and it smashes into the mirror

they stand staring at each other for a beat breathing
hard tom has a smear of lipstick near one side of his
mouth

finally

verna
   i suppose you think youve raised hell

she picks up her stole and heads for the door

tom stands staring at her back swaying ever so slightly

tom
sister when tve raised hell youll know it

16 cut to
int toms apartment

a wide shot facing the semicircular windows the door of
the apartment behind us a large easy chair in the middle
foreground faces away from us a smaller chair is at the
window end of the room facing us

at the cut we hear the ringing of the telephone

offscreen we can hear the unhurried scrape of a key in the
lock then the door opening then the door closing

toms back enters frame as he strolls into the room and
then disappears briefly through an open doorway to the
right we hear an icebox door opening and closing and
then tom reenters again still not reacting to the insis
tently ringing phone he is now holding a balledup towel

he walks over to the facing chair at the window end of the
room shrugs off his overcoat drapes it on the chair
sits crosses his legs takes off his hat tosses it onto
the upraised toes of his crossed leg tilts his head back
and presses the towel against his foreheadapparently it
is an icepack

we are beginning to track slowly towards him

after a beat he takes out a cigarette lights it and
reaches back for the phone that refuses to stop ringing

tom
yeah  

he casually looks forward just off to one side at a
specific point in space he does not react to whatever he
is hearing

   i need a couple days   because i dont
have it now  

we are almost in close shot now his gaze is still fixed
and emotionless

   because i say so   what would be good
enough   well if itll make him feel any
better tell lazarre he can send someone by to
break my legs i wont squawk

he prongs the earpiece still looking off the track has
stopped in close shot he exhales a stream of smoke then
after a beat

   lo bernie

slouched in a chair in the corner of the room facing tom
is bernie bernheim he is about thirty and wears his
overcoat and hat and a goodnatured smile he holds an
apple in one hand and a paring knife in the other the
long peel of the apple corkscrews down off the knife

bernie

caspar stares at him for a beat then slowly starts to tear
up the check

caspar

nice offer i get the high hat

he gets up and walks over to the door tictac opens it
for him and precedes him out

before following caspar out the door bluepoint grins at
tom

bluepoint
too bad for you smart guy

he leaves shutting the door

the room is quiet

tom looks at frankie the large man who looks back

frankie stands takes off his suit coat and hangs it
carefully on a rack by the door

he approaches tom

tom
hold it

frankie complies tom is standing and shrugging off his
coat he folds it neatly and turns to lay it on the chair
he was in

when he turns around again he is holding the chair and he
smashes it into frankies face

frankie staggers back but doesnt drop he reaches up to
his nose and his hand comes away bloody

frankie
   jesus tom

tom still holds the chair

frankie looks at him for a moment then walks over to the
door opens it and leaves shutting it behind him

the room is very quiet tom stands facing the door still
holding the chair after a beat or two he starts to put
it down

the door opens and he quickly raises the chair again

tictac the little man with the hawk nose is striding
into the room briskly approaching tom frankie the
gorilla follows cautiously

tictac blocks tons swing of the chair with his forearm
wraps both arms around it and pulls it awav from tom as
frankie circles tom tictac tosses the chair across the
room

frankie now behind tom wallops him in the small of the
back the blow sends him staggering towards tictac who
cracks him in the jaw

frankie grabs toms hair and yanks his head back as tictac
works on his midsection toms hands are reaching back to
grope for frankie

still holding his hair with one hand frankie cuffs tom
awkwardly on the side of the head tom staggers around and
tictac now behind him also hits him on the side of the
head

tom goes down his head hits the floor with a thunk

we are on a low angle an the floor behind toms head in
the background we see the door to the room

the door splinters in with a loud crash

frankies feet are walking up alongside toms head as blue
uniforms stream into the room

frankie
just in the nick of time huh

he brings his foot back to deliver a walloping kick to the
back of toms head on the impact we cut to

black

over black we hear the sound of running water

19 fade in
tom

gasping for air as his head is pulled out from under a
running faucet

the uniformed policeman who was holding him there and is
now pulling him back up grins at him

cop

tom is still woozy

tom
   wuzzit   how long   what day is it

cop

he is leading tom by the arm out of the cramped bathroom
back into the card room where he was beat up another cop

roundhouse swings at him he pauses breathing heavily

second cop

patrons and employees to the exit some wield axes on the
gaming equipment others are using nightsticks to smash the
bottles behind the bar tom winces at this and lights a
cigarette

antiques and collectibles

tom weaves across the street with his battle and glass
towards ogar the police chief leaning against a squad
car chewing a toothpick he is watching morosely as his
men load other men into paddywagons the street is clogged
with police vehicles

tom

ogar does not bother to look at tom as they talk he is
unhappily watching the spectacle

being chief and could swallow it clean

ogar looks chastened

ogar

he is interrupted by gunfire from an upper story of the
facing building

ogars men react finding cover returning the fire

ogar unholsters his gun as he and tom scramble for cover

   a goddamn mess

23 hallway

we are shooting over toms shoulder as he knocks at the
door to vernas apartment

after a beat verna opens the door

on seeing who it is she starts to swing the door shut

tom puts his toe in the doorway and leans into the door

as he pushes his way in

tom

24 int apartment

as verna gives up and tom enters

verna walks over to the phone as she dials tom tosses
his hat onto a chair and checks the apartment to see if
theyre alone

to the phone

tom

verna smiles

verna

point of pride

she turns to walk across the room

   though one day youll pay a crice for it

tom grabs her wrist

tom
okay verna but until then lets get stinko

he draws her close

verna
   lets do something else first

she reaches up takes off his hat and tosses it casually
away we pan with the hat to where it lands on the floor
in front of a curtained window

tom off
yeah lets do plenty

25 dissolve through to
another window night

a living room window open its white sheers billowing
lazily in the draft

faintly from another room in the house we can hear a
phonograph playing john mccormack singing danny boy

at the cut we hear a thump close by and briefly the
sounds of a struggle we then hear a breathy gurgling
sound which quickly subsides

the living room is latenight quiet

the shot is a lateral track which brings us off the window
to an end table in the foreground on the end table is a
pouch of bull durham a package of rolling papers a cup of
coffee with steaming rising off of it and a section of a
newspaper the draft gently lifts a couple rolling papers
off the table

the continuing track takes us off the end table and
booming down shows us an upset chair and the legs of the
man who occupied it

we track along the mans body to discover that he is face
down on the section of newspaper he was reading blood
oozing out of his slit throat onto the newspaper

the continuing track shows that between the fingers of one
outflung hand a cigarette burns it is resting on the
newspaper

we see the feet of another man who is turning and walking
away from the man on the floor into the background we
pan over to watch him recede framing out all of the dying
man except his outflung hand and cigarette

as the walking man recedes more and more of his topcoated
body crops in by the time he reaches the houses front
door in the deep background we can see him full figure

the newspaper in the foreground is crackling into flame
the rug it rests on is beginning to smoke and discolor

as the man in the background opens the front door we jump
in

over his shoulder

waiting in the darkness just outside is another man in a
topcoat and fedora he is holding two tommy guns

the men do not exchange words

the man outside hands his partner a tommy gun and follows
him as he walks back into the house

still faint we continue to hear danny boy we also hear
the lick of flames

26 a victrola

the song is louder at the cut we are in an upstairs
bedroom

leo

stretched out an his bed wearing a robe over his pyjamas
smoking a cigar listeningbut only to the phonograph
its sound covers any other noise in the house

27 stairway

a close track on the two pairs of feet climbing the stairs
we see only the feet the swaying hems of the topcoats and
occasionally dipping into frame the muzzles of the two
tommy guns

26 bedroom

leo is motionless looking down a puzzled expression

his pov

the floor

thin smoke is beginning to sift up through the floorboards

28 stairway

tracking on the approaching feet the song grows louder

26 bedroom

leo looking slowly taking the cigar from his mouth

bedroom door

from inside ascrashit is kicked in

leo

hitting the floor and rolling under the bed

the two gunmen

striding into the room

leo

on his belly under the bed facing the door swinging a
handgun in front of him

his pov

from floor level the bottom of the mattress above us the
floorboards stretching away

the bed crops the two gunmen midshin as they swing their
guns up firing

rattattattatthe hems of their coats sway as they fire

the floorboards in front of us are pocked by bullet hits
that walk across the floor towards the bed and hit the
mattress

the mattress above us dances under the gunfire as ticking
sprays down at the floor

smoke curls up throuch the floorboards

leo

jaw clamped on his cigar he starts firing

his pov

blood spurts as one gunman takes a hit in the ankle

he staggers and his tommy gun clatters to the floor

leo

still firing

his pov

the other gunman is ducking out the door

the injured gunman pitches forward head towards us his
hat rolling off

leo

firing

his pov

a bullet hit in the top of the fallen mans head

leo

rolling out from under the bed

he stoops to pick up the dead mans tommy gun thick smoke
seeps up through the floor

the phonograph plays

leo ducks through another door

28 hallway

facing down the length of the dark hallway towards the
mouth of the stairs

as leo leaps across frame in the foreground to enter a
facing room muzzle flashes erupt at the end of the hall
where the other gunman has been waiting in the darkness

29 second room

leo throws open a window

30 ext

as leo rolls out onto the long sloping eave of a front
porch

his gun skates down the eave and falls leo grabs the rain
gutter hangs by his hands and drops down to the front
lawn

the first floor of the house is in flames

from a high angle the camera swoops down on leo as he picks
up the gun and backs away from the house looking up at the
second story his open robe flaps in the breeze the dead
cigar is still clamped between his teeth

leos pov

the second floor window that he just emerged from
staccato gunfire erupts in the dark room

the strobing gunfire makes a strobing shadow of the gunman
whose back is to us as he rakes the room with fire

leo

firing the gun jumping and bucking in his hands

29 inside the room

the gunman riddled with bullets and showered with broken
glass spins around his thompson still firing uncontrol
lably

bullets dance across the walls and ceiling blast out the
remaining glass and sing harmlessly into the trees outside

back to leo

as we hear the screech of skidding tires a black coupe
takes a curve on the street behind him machine gun fire
spitting out of the back window

leo turns in the glow of the fanning flames walking
calmly into the street firing at the receeding car

on the car

growing smaller still snitting fire and lead

pulling leo

still walking calmly up the street the gun still bucking
in his hands bullets whistle by and claw up the pavement
around him

behind leo

his robe whips back in the breeze he fires again and we
hear the distant sound of shattering glass the car
weaves runs up off the road hits a tree and bursts into
flame

a figure emerges from the car and staggers off into the
darkness he is on fire

close on leo

as he stops squinting raising the gun

his pov

the burning gunman zigzagging into the darkness

back to leo

a faint smile curls around the cigar he drops the muzzle
of the gun

leo
huhh  

the shell of the car explodes in a fireball as we

31 cut to
upstairs hallway shenandoah club

the explosion echoes over the cut as we track up the
hallway behind tom and a tall cadaverous man with pre
maturely white hair this is dead terry mcgill

tom stares at him

tom

out for a guy whod chop you off at the heels if

leo leans back in his chair puts his feet up and gazes
out the window

leo

it   bernieswell hell you know about me
and verna   things now arenot that i havent
been a gentleman but   i uh   i plan to

but finally responds to the silence

   i guess you think thats a bonehead play

tom
do you think she wants you to

leo
how the hell do i know tom   i think she
does   yeah course she does i know i

differ on that

tom

tom takes a deep breath and exhales

   caspar didnt kill rug

absently

leo
course he did

tom
no think about it just this one time who
was rug following

this gets leos attention he turns to look at tom

leo
   huh

tom
it neednt have been that sinister a strange
man following her down a dark alley late at
night   ive told you leo she can take care
of herself

leo stares at tom he seems somewhat dazed

leo
   tom whyre you saying that christ tom
i just told you i plan to  

tom
they pulled a 22 slug out of him a pop gun
leoa womans gun

leo
   thats a whiskey dream verna wouldnt
panicshoot someonejust because he was
following her

he gazes off again shaking his head

   no   it wouldnt have happened that way
in the first place and if it had she would have
told me   i know you dont like her tom but
i trust verna as much as i trust you

tom
on her account youll burn the town down

leo
dont worry tom well still be standing when
the smoke clears

toms tone is gentle

tom
okay leo then maybe it wasnt that innocent
maybe rug knew something she didnt like him
knowing and wouldnt want you to know he was
following her he knew who she was seeing he
knew where she was sleeping and who with  

leo has taken his feet off the sill and has turned back to
face tom he studies him carefully

leo
maybes dont make it so

toms suddenly very earnest almost beseeching

tom
theyre more than maybes youve trusted me
before and never lost anything by it trust me
on this

leo
this is too important

tom
i dont ask much and i dont ask often trist
me on this

leo
tommy

tom
trust me on this or the hell with you

leo
you dont mean that

tom
   she was at my place the night rug was
following her the night you dropped by

leo is still staring impassively at tom tom doesnt
flinch from his gaze

after a long beat leo gets up slowly from his chair walks
over to the window shoves his hands in his pockets and
gazes out

for a moment tom looks at leos motionless back but he has
nothing left to say he rises plucks his hat from the
desk and goes to the door before exiting he looks back

leo in long shot is still gazing out the window

tom exits

33 hallway

pulling tom up the hall

behind him we can see the door to leos office opening and
leo coming out he strides up the hall after tom

tom turns as leo reaches him

leo without breaking stride seems to walk right into him
throwing a punch that catches tom on the chin and sends him
stumbling back his hat flying off

the men 1ining the hall watch with casual interest

tom staggers into one of the men who catches him another
man has picked up toms hat and now hands it to him the
first man shoves tom back into the middle of the hall just
in time for the approaching leo to land another punch
against his jaw

34 this blow sends tom rolling down the staircase still
clutching his hat

leo is clomping down the stairs his army of private
retainers clomp down behind him in his shirtsleeves and
chomping an unlit cigar leo looks like a labor leader
taking the rank and file to the barricades

tom claws himself up the wall to his feet

leo has reached the floor and still without breaking stride
uppercuts tom with a blow that straightens him up and sends
him staggering like a drunk into gamblers in evening
dresses and tuxedos

a path clears for leo and his entourage he has not
slackened his pace but is also not hurrying tom weaves
watching leo approach but makes no attempt to defend
himself

leo grabs his own wrist with one hand and swings his elbow
up to catch tom with a sharp blow on the side of his face

tom spins into a screaming lady in a sequined evening dress
and sinks to the floor grabbing at her bodice and skirt for
support she bats at him with her handbag as he slips
down

fat tony emerges from the crowd and helps tom to his feet
he raises his hand to stop leo

tony
okay leo ill throw him out

leo stops panting he is looking at tom but speaking to to
tony

leo
   yeah do that   its the kissoff if
i never see him again itll be soon enough

35 cut to
toms apartment

wide shot of his living room facing the windows it is
night

tom sits with his back to us at the window feet propped up
on the sill he is smoking a cigarette a full ashtray on
a table at his side indicates that he has been sitting
there for some time

we are slowly tracking in

the telephone sits on the the arm of his chair after a
moment he stubs out the cigarette picks up the phone and
dials

tom
  lo frankie its tom hows the flunky
business   ive had worse your ventilator
healing up

offscreen we hear a knocking at the door to the apartment
tom ignores it

   tell caspar its already forgotten id
like to see him  

the knocking continues

   all right do what you have to do and let
me know

he cradles the phone lights another cigarette takes a
drag blows a thoughtful cloud of smoke and turns to face
the door after a beat he rises and leaves frame

the door

as tom swings it open verna stands in the hallway
outside after a wordless beat she moves past him into the
apartment tom turns and follows her

he walks over to his bar pours two drinks then crosses
the room to verna who has seated herself hands her a drink
and sits down in a chair facing hers

verna
   it worked whatever you did leo told me
were quits but you know i didnt have anything
to do with rug

tom
maybe not   anyway that isnt what soured him
on you

the thought is bitter but her tone isnt

verna
oh you and me huh you always take the long
way around to get what you want dont you tom
   you could have just asked

tom looks at her

tom
   what did i want

verna returns his look then answers evenly

verna
me

after a beat tom his eyes still on verna brings the glass
to his lips and takes a sip the ice cubes clink

fade out

36 fade in
the bedroom

tom sits perched on the edge of the bed smoking a ciga
rette verna is in bed behind him the lamp on the
nightstand is burning a faint yellow

the telephone rings

as tom reaches for it verna stirs behind him

tom
yeah

he reaches over to switch off the light when he does the
room remains illuminated by dull gray light it is dawn

   yeah yeah when   okay

he hangs up and continues to smoke staring absently off

verna
   youre still up

tom answers without turning to face her

tom
yeah

verna
   whatre you chewing over

tom
   remembering something  

verna
what was it

tom turns to look at her then turns back and looks out the
window

tom
just a dream i was walking in the woods dont
know why   the wind came up and blew my hat
off  

verna
and you chased it right you ran and ran and
finally you caught up to it and picked it up but
it wasnt a hat anymore it had changed into
something elsesomething wonderful

tom
no it stayed a hat and no i didnt chase it
i watched it blow away  

he takes a drag an the cigarette

   nothing more foolish than a man chasing his
hat

tom rouses himself rises and we pan to follow as he picks
up a shirt and starts buttoning it in the bureau mirror

verna
wherere you going

tom
out

verna stares at him

verna
   dont let on more than you have to

tom shrugs

tom

verna

things up

tom grimaces into the mirror

tom
me and leo are finished nothings going to
change that

verna

tom

him and if leo did want me back hes an even
bigger sap than i thought

into a dark office behind him frankie his nose swathed
with bandages is closing the door from the outside

caspar off

couch to one side wearing his hat his hands jammed into
the pockets of his overcoat

against the drivers window tom still faces forward

bernie is wailing as he is muscled back away from the
window by two topcoated torsostheir faces above the car

flask

bernie stumbles off tom follows him

40 track

through the woods pulling the two men bernie in the
foreground tree limbs groan in the wind

bernie is stumbling his clothes rumpled and dirty his
face stained by tears and blood from the gun blow his
shaking voice strains for a tone of reasonableness

in front of him staring up at tom

   im praying to you look in your heart

slowly tom raises the gun and levels it at bernies head

boom the gun blast is deafening with it bernies
sobbing abruptly stops

the shot echoes away in the woods taking the wind with it
leaving silence

tracking

pulling bernie as he runs foreground trees flash by in
the background we see tom standing his gun dangling at his
side

boomanother gun blast running bernie reacts but tom
has only fired into the ground

on the echo of the shot we cut to

41 wide the road

tictac and frankie are leaning against the car trading
the flask back and forth

in the background tom emerges from the woods

frankie
put one in his brain

tom takes a few steps more before answering

tom
   yeah

frankie

fade out

over black we hear the sound of coins being dropped into a
phone box

42 fade in

looking down a deserted street towards a glowing phone
booth on a dark corner tom stands inside the booth
waiting the receiver to his ear

tom
mink tom duchaisne whereve you been  

close on tom

inside the phone booth

   well youre lucky bluepoints been looking

remember mink im the only one who can get you
out

tom hangs up the phone turns around and opens up the glass
door

whommmp a fist slams into his stomach driving him back
into the phone booth knocking his hat off of his head

the man who hit him leans down picks up the hat dusts it
off and hands it into the booth it is dead terry the
tall cadaverous man we saw earlier outside of leos office
a cigarette dangles from his lower lip

behind him a black sedan is parked at the curb three or
four gunmen stand on the sidewalk looking warily up and
down the road

tom looks up the color drained from his face and reaches
feebly out for his hat

tom
lo terry getting out the vote

dead terry flicks his cigarette away and smiles

terry
message from leo leo says if youre smart
youll sit this one outnot that he cares one
way or the other leo says if youre on the
wrong side you take your chances like anyone
else leo says he gives no special favors
thats all

tom
mm  

terry starts to turn away

   tell leo hes not god on the throne hes
just a cheap mick political boss with no brains
and an office that looks like a french whore
house

tom moves to exit the booth but terry lays a hand on his
shoulder

terry
one more thing  

he cracks tom across the chin with a clean left hook
knocking him back into the booth again

tom rubs his chin looking up at terry

tom
leo say that too   

as terry and the gunmen get into the car

terry
no i said that cross leo and next time ill
say plenty

we fade out as the door slams and the car roars off

over black we hear

caspar
when youre right youre right but you never say
i told you so

43 fade in

on tom sitting into frame in caspars office

tom
so whatm i right about

behind his desk caspar is smiling

caspar

toms eyes hold an caspars he is taking out a pack of
cigarettes

tom
i never say that and i dont like people who

caspar
mink was robbin me right along with the mptzah

tom
   what convinced you of that

caspar
mink larouie took a powder we cant find him
bluepoints makin excuses for him but personal
ly i think you were right i think mink and
bernie was in it together i think mink heard
youd bumped the motzah and lit out the lousy
sonofabitch

his eyes on caspar tom takes out a cigarette lights it
takes a deep drag

tom
   i told you so

caspar laughs

caspar

caspar
bluepoint cant find him

tom
so he says

caspar stares at tom

caspar

until now since a guy will say pretty much
anything when he knows his number is up but just
before i bumped bernie he swore to me that
bluepoint and mink were setting him up that
they were the ones that were selling out your
fix

caspar looks at tom

caspar

tom
   uhhuh so why isnt bluepoint here

caspar

he figdets

   he dont care for you kid maybe its
only fair to tell you   after you left us he
tried to sell me on a doublecross he says to
me why dont we doublecross you and give you
the bump once we get the motzah but i figure a
deals a deal youre square with me you bump the
motzah ill hold up my end question of ethics
everything above board thats how i like it so
everybody knows whos a friend and whos an
enemy   but bluepoint wouldnt cross me we
go back

tom
uhhuh   course theres always that wild card
when love is involved  

caspar is staring intently at tom after a beat

caspar
   i know mink is bluepoints boy but i still
dont make it that way

tom
mm well then theres nothing to worry about

caspar seems lost in thought

caspar

we hear the door to the office open offscreen and johnny
jr runs into frame clutching a scrolled piece of paper

johnny jr

looking at tom

caspar
just a minute

as tom rises to his feet

   course theres no reason not to be
careful

johnny jr

cascar has cuffed him sharply on the side of the head
he points at tom

caspar

cascar looks at tom and smiles

matter we aint friends anymore  

he picks up johnny jr who is crying softly and sets him
in his lap encouraged by the attention the child starts
wailing caspar bounces him on his knee and raises his
voice over the sobs

   if you find him i wanna talk to him alone
thats how you get the straight dope manto

tom takes a contemplative drag on his cigarette

tom
   it aint complicated

44 cut to
close shot a mans face

crunchbeing hit by a gloved hand

the blow and the mans grunt echo

close on a newspaper

as the noise of fists against flesh continues echoing in
the background

the newspaper headline reads party boss looses municipal
contract the subhead reads liam leo obannon removed
from city highway commission new construction contracts
to raffo bros

on tom

leaning against a pillar in a large bare room with a
hardwood floor he is reading the newspaper

we are in a gym in a ring in the background two boxers
are sparring as two or three old men with towels slung over
their shoulders and elbows hooked over the ropes idly
watch and offer occasional bits of halfhearted advice

we hear high heels echoing across the floor and verna
enters

tom

going to heat up here go out to the pallisades

she reaches out to touch his hand

verna

she leans in to embrace him

toms eyes drift up to the fighters

45 ext the gym

peeling paint on its blackenedout window reads gleasons
gym training in the sweet science

verna is exiting the gym in long shot

we pull back to bring bluepoint into frame he sits in the
drivers seat of a car watching through his side window as
verna recedes quietly

smashing the butt into a surprised face

with a loud crash the surprised man stumbles back into a

verna stops resisting and stares at him

bluepoint stares back at her thinking

we hear a footstep offscreen

reverse

facing the door from behind bluepoint and verna

bluepoint wheels swinging her body in front of his as two
topcoated men enter guns drawn

both intruders hold fire their shot blocked by verna the
gun in bluepoints hand barks once

the lead man pitches forward his gun clattering away

his partner is ducking back out the door

verna still struggles futilely bluepoint keeps his gun
peeking out from behind verna trained on the empty
doorway

the man an the floor still alive has started clawing
himself towards his gun a few paces away

bluepoint ignores him he stares at the open door

after a silent beat from the hall

man in hall
   let her go bluepoint theres nothing you
can do leave by the fire escape theres more
of us on the way

bangbluepoint fires

wood splinters in the door which shudders back a few more
inches towards the wall the voice from the hall has
stopped short

after a short silent beat we hear a gun clattering to the
floor outside in the hall

we hear fabric drag across wall and then see the dead man
drop to the floor just outside the door

bluepoint tosses verna away and saunters unhurriedly over
to the first man who has almost reached his gun

just as the mans hand closes over it bluepoint in stride
steps onto the hand and gun most of his weight is on it

head cocked he looks down at the man in front of him

bluepoint

bluepoint straightens up from the body and turns

low and wide on bluepoint

one corpse an the floor beside him the other corpse in the
doorway behind him

he absently wraps one hand around the warm barrel of the
gun then brings the hand up to blow against its open palm

bluepoint

tom

sitting up in bed smoking a cigarette thinking the
bedroom is dark

there is a knock at the apartments front door tom
reacts but does not immediately rise

the knock is repeated

tom finally throws the covers off and swings his feet
around to the floor

but the knocking stops and another sound brings him up
short the person at the door is now playing with the
lock

tom sits motionless listening

after some rattling we hear the lock spring then the door
swinging open then shut again we hear footsteps cross
the main room and then the squeak of chair springs

silence

tom rises and walks to the living room doorway he leans
against the jamb

51 his pov

the windows throw moonlit squares onto the floor we can
see only the legs of someone sitting in the armchair

tom
lo bernie come on in make yourself at home

bernie turns on the lamn on the table at his elbow he
holds a gun casually in his lap

bernie
lo tom thought id do that since you didnt
seem to be in figured it was a bad idea to wait
in the hall seeing as im supposed to be dead

tom
mm

bernie
howd you know it was me

tom
youre the only person i knowd knock and break
in

bernie
your other friends wouldnt break in huh

tom shakes his head

tom
my other friends wanna kill me so they wouldnt
knock

he crosses to the chair facing bernies

   whats on your mind bernie

bernie
things   i guess you must be kind of angry
im supposed to be gone far away i guess it
seems sort of irresponsible my being here  

bernie leaves room for a response but tom is only listen
ing

   and i was gonna leave honest i was but
then i started thinking if i stuck around that
would not be good for you and then i started
thinking that   that might not be bad for me

tom still doesnt answer

   i guess you didnt see the play you gave
me i mean whatm i gonna do if i leave i got
nothingno money no friends nothing if i
stay i got you anyone finds out im alive
youre dead so   i got you tommy

tom is silent

   whats the matter you got nothin to crack

bernies lip is quivering his voice is softer

   i guess i made kinda a fool a myself out
there   i was shittin myself tommy  
you didnt tell anyone about that

tom
no

bernie
course you know about it   its    its a
painful memory and i cant help remembering
that you put the finger on me and you took me
out there to whack me   i know you didnt 
 i know you didnt shoot me   but   but

tom
but what have i done for you lately

bernie
dont smart me

he stares hard at tom for a moment

   see i wanna watch you squirm i wanna see
you sweat a little and when you smart me it
ruins it

bernie gets to his feet keeping the gun trained on tom

   theres one other thing i want i wanna
see johnny caspar cold and stiff thats what
youll do for your friend bernie  

he has opened the door to the flat

   in the meantime ill stay outa sight but
if caspar aint stiff in a couple of days i start
eating in restaurants

the door shuts behind him

tom heretofore very still springs from the chair goes to
the bedroom and reemerges with a gun

he bolts for the door instinctively grabbing his hat off a
hook he is wearing only his boxer shorts a sleeveless
teeshirt and the hat jammed onto his head

he throws open the door

52 hallway

empty

tom runs to the bannister and looks down

his pov

a flight down a hand slides down along the railing
bernies trotting footsteps echo in the stairwell

tom

he runs back to his apartment

53 apartment

tom runs across to the open window and clambers out

54 fire escape

tom trots down his bare feet ring dully against the steel
of the fire escape

he reaches the bottom landing swings over the railing
hangs by his hands for one brief moment and then drops

the alley

as his bare feet hit the pavement tom is a silhouette in
the lamplight from the end of the alley

he straightens from his crouch and runs

back door

of his apartment buildingover toms shoulder as he enters
frame the empty brightly lit hall inside runs straight
the length of the building to the front door which is just
closing

tom throws open the back door

55 hallway

as tom runs through toward the front

before reaching the door he falls violently forward

his gun skates away from him across the floor

he starts to roll over to look behind him and a crunching
blow catches him on the chin snapping his head the rest of
the way around and sending him flat onto his back

bernie who has emerged from under the staircase towers
over him

bernie
you make me laugh tommy youre gonna catch
cold then youre no good to me  

he is walking over to toms gun which he picks up and
unloads into his hand

   what were you gonna do if you caught me
id just squirt a few and then youd let me go
again

he tosses tom the empty gun and walks out

tom whitefaced and shivering pulls himself up to sit
leaning against the wall

a firstfloor apartment door opens and a sixtyyearold
woman emerges pulling a housecoat tight she goggles at
tom

woman
why mr duchaisne what on earth  

tom tries a smile that looks idiotic

tom
they took everything  

long shot the hall

clucking sympathetically the old woman is leaning down to
help tom up as he drapes an arm over her shoulder

tom
   i fought like hell but there were too many
of em

of the club patrons start screaming tony looks off and
tom swivels to look

tony
oh jesus   you bring them with you

as he shoves off from the bar

tom
no

uniformed policemen are pouring into the club wielding
axes they destroy everything in their path sweeping the
elegantly dressed patrons before them

tom wades into the sea of blue and nods at delahanty the
policeman we know from the raid on caspars

the scene as he glumly chews on a toothpick the street is
clogged with police vehicles

tom approaches

tom

into the bargain

as he heads off

tom

59 pulling tom

as he walks along a nearby street we can still faintly
hear the sirens and police activity back at the club

a black touring car is tooling up alongside of him tic
tac leans out the drivers window he has welts around his
mouth and looks like he has been a little roughed up

tictac
hop in tom we been lookin for you

tom

tictac

tom

the car screeches over to put a wheel on the sidewalk and
block toms way the back door swings open and frankie
emerges to help tom in like tictac frankie looks a
little worked over

tom quickly sizes up the situation and decides to comply

60 int car

as tom sits into the back next to bluepoint frankie
slides in after him

bluepoint

defensively

tictac

the car

walk several steps ahead of them each off to one side
searching frankie is singing an old neapolitan song

bluepoint
yunderstand if we dont find a stiff out here

tom walks a little unsteadily his shoulders are hunched
and his hands are jammed into his overcoat packets he
stares woodenly forward bluepoint laughs softly

   wherere your friends when you need em
huh wheres leo now

tom tramps mechanically on his eyes drift up

his pov

tracking a canopy of leaves sprinkled by sunlight
the boughs of the trees sough quietly in the wind

we hear the unearthly groaning of the tree limbs

tom

looks forward

bluepoint calls out

bluepoint
hey tictac ever notice how the snappy dialogue
dries up once a guy starts soiling his union
suit

tom tramps on

his pov

the backs of frankie and tictac as they walk on ahead

frankie is still singing

tom

he looks stupidly at bluepoint he looks ahead

he stops abruptly

bluepoint
what

tom is still for a moment then with jerky movements gets
down on his knees hugs a tree with one arm for support
and vomits

bluepoint watches him then calls out to frankie and tic
tac

   okay theres nothing out here

he grabs toms hat off his head and flings it away then
he plants a foot against toms side and shoves him to the
ground

close on tom

as his face hits the ground

bluepoints foot enters he plants it an the side of toms
neck to keep him pinned

toms pov

skewed angle from the ground

frankie is ambling back singing

bluepoint

checking the open chamber of his gun he snaps it shut

as he levels the gun at tom

bluepoint
think about this smart guy

tom

closing his eyes

from offscreen

tictac
uhoh hankie time

frankie

he stops singing and turns to look

tom

the foot comes off his neck

bluepoint

looking towards tictac

tictac

taking a handkerchief out of his breast pocket and bringing
it to his face as he looks at something on the ground in
front of him

bluepoint

he hauls tom to his feet and pushes him towards tictac

we track behind the two men as they approach tictac and
frankie enters from the side

we cannot yet see what is on the ground in front of him

tictac
birds been at him

frankie is taking out his hankie as he draws near

frankie
jesus christ  

he looks up at tom as tom approaches

over tom and bluepoints shoulders stretching away from
us faceup is a body we cannot see much of its face
what we do see is pulp

tictac is laughing incredulously

tictac
   i said put one in his brain not in his
stinking face  

extreme long shot

four very small men in overcoats and fedoras looking down
at the ground they are dwarfed by the surrounding trees

very faintly we can hear

frankie
i told you bluepoint we heard two shots  

quick fade out

62 cut to
apartment building door buzzer

a beatup panel in the buildings entryway listing
tenants names and apartments opposite a row of buttons

a hand coasts along the names and stops at clarence
johnson4c then moves away and presses two other buzzers
on the fifth floor

after a beat we hear the front door buzz open

63 fourthfloor hallway

tom walks up to 4c unpocketing a gun he gently tries the
knob which turns and enters

64 drops apartment

as tom enters

drop johnson is sitting at a table in the living room
which also serves as kitchen and dining room he is a
large man with a thick neck a low forehead and rather
vacant eyes

he is looking up at tom a spoonful of cereal frozen
halfway to his mouth a foldedback newspaper in his other
hand opened to the funnies

tom
lo drop howre the katzenjammers

uncomfortably

drop
lo tom whats the rumpus

as he talks tom walks casually around the apartment
bumping open doors sticking his head in each room

tom
had any visitors

drops head swivels to follow tom around the room aside
from that he does not move he speaks cautiously

drop
no

tom

drop

tom nods

tom

drop doesnt respond

   so you didnt see bernie bernheim before

drop maintains a sullen silence

tom is picking up a hat from a clutter on top of a bureau

tom

of money on tomorrows fight is that your bet
or did you place it for a friend

drop

toms stroll through the apartment has brought him behind
where drop sits

tom

to your head

drop

tom puts the hat on top of drops head drops eyes roll
up to look at it but otherwise he still doesnt move

the hat too small sits ludicrously atop his head

tom starts toward the door

tom

thinking youve been doing  

he pauses with his hand on the knob

   tell bernie somethings come up he has to
get in touch therell be nothing stirring til i
talk to him

he slams the door

65 cut to
a large window

we are looking at the groundfloor window from the street
letters stencilled on the glass identify the sons of erin
social club

a topcoated man scurries into frame knocks out a pane with
the grip of a gun and tosses a small pipelike device
inside he scurries away and we pan with him across the
street to reveal a line of cars police and civilian
parked along the far curb no men are visible except the
scurrying man who takes cover behind one of the parked
cars

social club

a beat from inside we hear a pair of trotting footsteps

boom the window blows out spitting glass into the
street along with a large dark form

the street

glass showers the pavement and a charred ragdoll of a body
hits hard face down and skids a couple feet smoke wisps
from it

the club

a lick of flame from the bomb is already dying and heavy
grey smoke is billowing out

the street

men start cautiously rising from behind the cars a lot of
men some wear police uniforms some are civilians all
are armed

the club

billowing smoke

the street

the men have straightened up a policeman calls through a
bullhorn

policeman
all right anyone left in there come on out
grabbing air you know the drill

the club

after a beat the front door swings open a man emerges
one hand in the air one holding a handkerchief over his
mouth

he walks into the middle of the street

one of the civilians behind the cars fires

the man takes the bullet in the chest and drops to the
ground where he twitches

the man who fired in the foreground grins a ripple of
laughter runs down the line of men

the club window

smoke still pouring out

with a ratatattat muzzle flashes from inside illuminate
the smoke

the street

bullet hits chew up the cars and a few of the men the
others drop back down behind the cars and start returning
fire

tommy has joined the first to pour lead out into the
street

   there could be a damn good reason  

caspar squints at tom

   if youve got a fixed fight coming up do
you

caspar
   maybe okay yeah sure tomorrow night

caspar

fights and means to again hell have to be able
to point the finger at someone else

uncomfortably

caspar

tom
but with bernie dead there aint a hell of a
lot of people he can point to

caspar
yeah bluepoint sells me out makes pretend
bernies still doin it ats real pretty
bernie leaked the fix and you take the fall for
supposedly not killing him   

he leans back in the mayors chair and gazes off sucking
his lips in and out as he thinks finally

   but i dunno why would bluepoint cross me
like that money okay everybody likes money
but somehow it dont seem like him and i know
the bluepoint

tom
nobody knows anybody not that well

caspar shakes his head

caspar
money dont mean that much to him

tom shrugs

tom
then its not just money hes after hes got a
wart on his fanny

caspar
   huh

tom
a wart on his fanny giving him the fidgets
maybe hes sick of sitting on the couch and maybe
behind your desk dont look like a bad place to
move to maybe he figures the money can help
move him there

caspar studies tom

caspar

he looks off again

   i dont generally care for it but youre
honest and thats something we cant get enough

tom laughs bitterly

let him make it youre swimmin in it

caspars eyes flash toms tone softens

   johnny my chins hanging out right along

worrying enough

caspar miserable rubs his face from the distant street
we hear another booming explosion

caspar

68 cut to
toms apartment

the phone is ringing at the cut

we are looking at the window sill upon which the phone
sits with an empty chair facing

footsteps approach and tom sits into frame and takes the
phone

tom

tom
i was in stitches its mink isnt it

he hangs up

69 cut to
hallway

we are close on tom as in overcoat and hat he emerges
from his apartment and looks down at the keys in his hand

whapa fist swings into frame to connect with toms cheek
he falls back

three topcoated men loom over him

first man

tom is massaging his face

tom
   no

the first man nods at the other two

first man

the two men pick tom off the floor and start to work him
over he doesnt resist

the first man watches dispassionately

   third race tonight by the finish tailor
maid had a view of the field

he lights himself a cigarette

   you oughta lay off the ponies tom

the two men work in silence for a while tom too is
silent

the two men back away from tom breathing heavily he
slides down the wall to the floor

   lazarre said hes sorry about this its

tom speaks thickly his head propped against the baseboard

tom
   yeah

first man
christ tom he knows that

with a jerk of the head the first man signals the other two
and the trio turns to leave

first man
   take care now

70 cut to
doorway night

we are looking over toms shoulder as he waits in the rain
in front of a large oak doorway with wroughtiron fretwork
at the cut we hear chimes dying and the door swings open

there is a grand foyer with a parquet floor unsittable
furniture and a large chandelier a liveried butler looks
inquiringly out at tom

tom
tom duchaisne

butler
yes sir   

he steps back

   mr caspar is in the great room

tom is handing the butler his hat

tom
swell can you take this

int foyer

as tom starts to shrug out of his coat caspar is crossing
towards him

caspar
kid whats the rumpus

caspar seems as unhappy as last time we saw him

tom
i got news

caspar
yeah news at this end too my stomachs been
seazin up on me

tom
mink just told me that he

this has woken caspar up

caspar

tom

hes been right here in town

caspar

tom shrugs

tom

oclock this morning

having handed the butler his coat and hat tom lets caspar
lead him towards a pair of double doors

   hes afraid of a cross from bluepoint he
told me about the fix says hell sing for a
couple grand skip money tell us everyone
involved  

71 caspar opens one of the double doors and we continue
tracking behind the two men as they enter the trophy room
the room has the low warm light of a mens club outside
the dark windows the rain sheets down

caspar sits in behind his desk and swivels away to poke
morosely with a fire shovel at the blaze in the fireplace
in the foreground back to us tom rests his knuckles an
the desk to lean towards caspar

   but you better take care of bluepoint right
away mink says if he comes after us its going
to be tonight

as he looks into the fire

caspar
leos holed up at whiskey nicks dump

tom is momentarily taken aback

tom
   how dyou know

a chuckle comes from behind

reverse

on tom in the background bluepoint is walking over to
the door to the room to close it

bluepoint
that aint all we know smart guy

he points with a nod towards the couch

   recognize your playmate

on the couch sits drop johnson drops face looks worked
on and is beaded over with sweat

having shut the door bluepoint is sauntering over to tom

   yeah you thought id quit

he shakes his head

huhuh i followed you this afternoon and i
wondered why einstein would want to talk to a
gorilla  

he is nose to nose with tom smiling at him

   so i grabbed the gorilla   and i beat it
out of him

he shrugs

   give me a big guy every time they crack
easy not like you

tom holds bluepoints look

tom
is there a point or are you just brushing up on
your small talk

bluepoint
i like that cool under fire im impressed

very quickly he delivers two slapsforehand and backhand
toms head rocks but he recovers to stare back at blue
point

   the gorilla didnt know whose stiff we
found but i can fill that in you killed mink
you sonofabitch

he grabs tom by the lapels swings him away from the desk
and lands a punch on his chin

tom stumbles backs

caspar has turned from the fireplace watching the doings
across the room

bluepoint moves towards tom breathing hard with antici
pated pleasure

   come here bum im gonna send you to a
deep dark place and im gonna have fun doing
it

bluepoints hand snakes out and grabs tom by the front of
the coat hauling him close he slaps him savagely

   it was mink and by god ill hear you say
it

tom
is this how you taught drop his story

in one motion bluepoints hands wrap around toms throat
choking him off as the pressure increases tom purpling
sinks to his knees

bluepoint
i like the way you think maybe when youre dead
ill cut your head off put it on my mantle

whanga shovel blade swings into frame to smash bluepoint
in the face

he drops

from somewhere in the room a scream

bluepoint is on his hands and knees one hand pressed over
his ruined face blood pouring from between the fingers

caspar
sonafabitch  

he stands over bluepoint with the fireplace shovel

   if theres one thing i cant stand its a
doublecross artist i had a feeling bout this
sonofabitch

he swings the shovel back and delivers an overhand blow to
the top of bluepoints head

bluepoint drops to the floor instantly motionless

the scream however continues

drop johnson on the couch his eyes wide his hands
spastically squeezing his knees is looking down at
bluepoint drops mouth is stretched wide he is scream
ing

tom gets slowly to his feet

cascar looks at drop

   shut it you sonofabitch

he is striding over to him with the shovel

   ill give you something to holler about

tom intercepts him

tom
johnny its okay bluepoint made him its
okay its not important

caspar is panting

caspar
then have him shut it

drop does

there is a beat

incongruously caspars bellow breaks the silence

   and we do the same to mink this very same
night

another silence the rain the crackle of the fire

toms tone is soothing

tom
   johnny we cant doublecross him he
wants to spill the whole setup

caspar stares at him through glazed eyes

caspar
ive never let a sonofabitch walk

tom
youve never crossed anyone   

caspar is staring at him his eyes have lost some of their
glaze

tom
   four oclock my place minks coming in
on his own hook so i promised him the money
dont make me out a liar

drop is suddenly screaming again

caspar looks where drop is looking

bluepoint is raising his head moaning his face is a mask
of blood one hand gropes in his overcoat pocket for his
gun

caspar shouts over drops howl as he pulls something from
his desk drawer

caspar
   lookit this kid

he strides over to bluepoint

   something i try and teach all my boys  

with the gun point blank against the back of bluepoints
head he fires

tom recoils

   always put one inna brain

72 a clock

a large wall clock it is 330

we are pulling back and down to reveal that we are inside a
diner we are isolating on a section of counter on which
sits a halfempty cup of coffee and an ashtray halffilled
with butts a hand puts some change on the counter and
leaves frame

73 ext diner

as tom pushes the door open and exits he tucks his
overcoat collar up as he walks it is pouring rain

tom turns at the sound of approaching heels and recognizes
verna with some surprise he glances up and down the
street but it is deserted verna doesnt seem to much
notice the rain

tom
lo verna whats the rumpus

coldly as they walk on together

verna
i was just in the neighborhood feeling a little
daffy whatre you doing

tom
   walking

verna
dont let on more than you have to

tom
in the rain

tom glances at her

   whatre you doing out

verna
bernies dead isnt he

they walk on for a beat tom looking down at the sidewalk
finally

tom
   what makes you think that

verna
thats no answer

tom again glances around and escorts verna into a dark
doorway alcove it is very small they have to crowd into
each other to stay out of the rain water drops from the
brim of toms fedora he studies her for a beat

tom
i cant tell you anything yet

verna
nobody cares do they his friends didnt really
like him

tom shrugs

tom
he didnt like his friends

verna
youre a sonofabitch tom youre someone to
talk you got me to tell you where he was and
then you killed him

she is raising a gun into frame she presses it into his
stomach

tom stiffens but continues to stare at her calmly

   tell me why what was in it for you

tom
nothing for me

verna
then why

tom
   giving up bernie was the only way i could
see to straighten things out for leo

verna
you said you didnt care about leo

tom
i said we were through its not the same thing

verna looks at him

verna
i dont understand i dont care i dont
care what reason you had or thought you had

she raises the gun and presses its barrel into the under
side of toms chin tom stiffens but remains calm

tom
   hes still alive

verna stares at him

verna
you expect me to believe you

tom
   no

verna
thats you all over tom a lie and no heart

verna pulls back the hammer there is a long beat

vernas eves widen locked an toms

tom returns her look his is sympathetic

verna starts trembling

toms tone is soft understanding its the first time we
have ever seen compassion from him

tom
   it isnt easy is it verna

she abruptly lurches away and staggers a couple of paces
onto the sidewalk in the rain she hugs a lamppost for
support she is staring down at the street still trem
bling

tom walks up behind her and rests a hand an her shoulder

   are you all right

she doesnt look around after a moment

verna
   i dont know how you did it

she shrugs off his hand and stumbles off down the street

tom watches her dissappear into the rain

74 cut to
tree limbs

night but sometime laterit has stopped raining the
branches groan in the wind as they sway streetlight
glitters off the leaves still wet with rain

we are booming down to reveal that we are in front of toms
building its windows dark during the boom we hear the
rumble of an approaching car and the hiss of its tires on
wet asphalt

the boom down ends as the car pulls into frame to stop at
the curb with the camera framed on the drivers window
the driver has a small bandage on his left cheek we hear
caspars voice as we hear him getting out the back

caspar
ya put the razor in cold water not hotcause
metal does what in cold

driver
i dunno johnny

we hear the back door slam and caspar appears in the front
passenger window

   ats what im tellin ya it contracts
at way you get a first class shave

driver
okay johnny

as caspar walks off the driver slouches back pulls his
fedora over his eyes and folds his arms across his chest
a back enters frame in the foreground

toms voice
lo sal you can dangle

the driver looks up startled

driver
lo tom you sure you dont look so hot

we still dont see toms face

tom
im okay go ahead ill drive him home

the driver shrugs

reverse

wider from the other side of the car as the car pulls
away

tom walks into the foreground toward his house we tilt up
to hold him

the lowangle shows us the tree behind tom its branches
still creaking in the wind

crack crackwe hear two gunshots from inside the house

tom stops momentarily in close shot looking up and then
continues on out of frame

75 over toms shoulder

we follow him as he walks into the building and slowly down
the firstfloor hall

the hallway is quiet excent for a light moaning wind

beyond tom we see the door to the firstfloor apartment
crack open a slit hissing

voice
mr duchaisne  

the door opens wider mrs zarpmas wearing a housecoat
her gray hair down in braids sticks her head out

   there were shots

tom looks up towards the staircase then back at mrs
zarpas

tom
go down to the drugstore call the police

she stares at him nods as she drapes on a raincoat

mrs zarpas
yes mr duchaisne

tom
you better stay there til the officers arrive

mrs zarpas
yes   

she pauses

   will the cats be all right here

tom stares at her

finally he nods

tom
   theyll be fine

mrs zarpas returns his dazed nod and shuffles away

so far upstairs all is quiet

pulling tom

as he starts slowly towards the staircase

toms pov tracking forward

a small black object on the staircasean upsidedown
fedora blood drips with a hollow rattle down onto a step
a couple steps above the hat

pulling tom

he looks up

pov

a head sticks through the balusters of the second story
landing return the body is on its back the head lolls
back over the tip of the landing down towards the stair
case

our climbing low angle shows us mostly the back of the
head the bodys far shoulder has knocked out a baluster
whose splintered bottom juts down towards the stairs

pulling tom

still climbing looking at the body

his pov

climbing and panning as we draw even with the head

it is caspar blood has been expelled through his nostrils
over his mouth and chin his face is deep red his eyes
stare glassily at tom

pulling tom

as he reaches the top of the stairs and swings around to
face along the landing we hear a chuckle close by wind
is groaning through the hallway

pov

in the middle foreground caspar lies an the floor beyond
him bernie leans against the doorframe in toms open
doorway smiling his arms folded over his chest

the balusters stretch away in a regular line throwing
vertical shadows upwards against the opposite wall

bernie
i get it you set me up

tom leans against the wall and looks morosely down at
caspar

bernie
   anything to avoid a little dirty work
yourself huh

tom doesnt answer

   howd you know held get it and not me or
didnt you care

tom shrugs still staring down at caspar

tom
i figured youd come early and be looking for
blood he wouldnt so youd likely have the
drop on him

bernie takes his gun out of his overcoat packet and
saunters over

bernie
youre a sonofabitch tom i like the way you
think youre right the bonehead never knew
what hit him

he looks down at caspar unable to supress a smile

   but if you knew id come looking to kill
you how do you know i wont still

tom shrugs again

tom
nothing in it for you now with him dead we got
nothing on each other let me have the gun

bernie
why

tom jerks his head towards caspar

tom
pin this on bluepoint neither of us wants him
walking around after this

bernie shakes his head

bernie
the copsll be leos now they wont care what
they hang bluepoint for

tom shrugs again

tom
i guess thats so if you dont mind keeping the
gun that killed caspar and mink

he stoops down over caspars body and starts feeling
through caspars pockets looking for something

   why did mink shoot rug anyway

bernie is walking towards him emptying the bullets from
his gun

bernie
i dunno it was just a mixup here

tom looks back over his shoulder bernie hands him the
gun which tom slips into his overcoat packet

   so youre gonna say bluepoint did this

as he goes back to the body

tom
mink thought rug was tailing him

he finds caspars gun and sets it on the floor but keeps
looking

bernie
yeah yeah you know mink hysterical skin full
of hop head full of bogeymen comes home crying
one day said he had to pop a guy one of
bluepoints spies

tom
rug was following verna not mink mink just
happened to be with her

he has found a wallet and is thumbing through it

bernie
yeah funny aint it but you know mink was
terrified bluepointd find out me and him were
jungled up together

tom has taken out the money rifles it and replaces the
wallet

tom
and ill bet youd kept him plenty worried about
that to keep him under your thumb

bernie
yeah so what   

bernie is peering over toms shoulder at the monev

   scratch huh a little bonus

tom straightens up caspars gun in hand

tom
why did mink take rugs hair

bernie shrugs

bernie
beats me the kid was dizzy fiftyfifty on the
dough or maybe i should get a little more
since i did the deed

tom is stuffing the money into his pocket

   okay you keep it i want you to have it

tom
bernie  

he nods towards caspars body

   we cant hang this on bluepoint

bernie
huh why not

tom
bluepoints already dead halfway cross town

bernies smile is fading

bernie
what the hell are you talking about

tom
bluepoints dead its gotta be you i mean
hell its your gun

alarm is beginning to rise

bernie
what is this what the hell are you talking
about   

he looks down at caspar and then back at tom

   you took my gun just your word against
mine

tom pops the chamber of caspars gun glances in and snaps
it shut

tom
not necessarily

bernies eyes widen

bernie
are you crazy were square you said it
yourself we got nothing on each other

tom
yup

bernie fights against hysteria

bernie
so whats in it for you theres no angle you
cant just shoot me like that

he sinks to his knees his voice rising

   jesus christ it dont make sense tommy
look in your heart

tom
what heart

bangbernie splays backwards from the knees a bullet
drilled neatly through his forehead

tom drops the gun by caspars body

unpocketing bernies gun tom goes over to his corpse and
drops it there

we pan with toms legs to bring his doorway into view as he
walks into his apartment to the window chair in the
background and sits with his back to us

the windows show daylight breaking far away a clock
strikes the quarter hour

tom is picking up the phone and dialing waiting for an
answer he reaches over to turn off the feeble yellow lamp
burning chairside

as we start to fade out we can hear tom talking into the
phone

tom
   tony tom tell lazarre ive got his
money   yeah all of it and i want to place
a bet on tonights fight  

a beat of black

76 cut to
the hallway

of leos club leading to his office

we are tracking over toms shoulder as he walks down the
hall led by dead terry

terry
they set you up downstairs

tom
hows that

terry
hootch whatever

tom gestures with the drink he is carrying its ice cubes
clink

   well thanks for coming tom leos real
anxious to see you  

tom
yeah i happened to be near

we can hear muffled bellowing coming from leos office
growing louder as we approach

terry seems embarassed

terry
actually   this might not be the best time  

they have pulled up in front of the closed door to leos
office

leos bellowing inside abates for a moment we can hear
another voice muffled so that we dont hear words but
only the voices plaintive quality

leos bellowing cuts it short

tom
   whos he got in there

terry
ogar and the mayor

as he leaves frame

tom
ill try again

terry calls after him

terry
ill tell him you stopped by

77 downstatrs

pulling tom as he walks across the gambling floor drink
still in hand

behind him we can see workmen busily repairing the damage
done to the club in the police raid

halfway across the floor tom stiffens and slows seeing
something

verna is entering the club

the two meet

tom
lo verna

verna
see leo

they both lean against a counterstop and look out at the
floor

tom
he was busy

verna
you should see him he has something to tell
you

tom
maybe ill run into him

verna
bernies funeral is tomorrow you could stop by

tom

verna
   leo has something to tell you

tom
so you said

there is a silent beat verna scowls

verna
   tell me something tom why didnt you
tell me what was going on i thought he was
dead and you never

tom
there was no point in telling you it could only
have queered things if it had gotten out

verna
jesus tom you dont just talk to people for
the play it gives you or doesnt give you i
suffered you noheart son of a bitch

tom lets this drift

verna tries to compose herself

   im sorry its just that things mightve
been different with us if id known that you
hadnt   done anything to him  

tom
you know now

verna looks at him intently

verna
what happened that night

tom still looks at her evenly

tom
i went to a bar passed out when i got back to
my place they were both dead

verna studies him

verna
   passed out huh

tom
yeah

she looks at him a beat more then out at the floor

verna
its funny   ive never even seen you sleep
though you told me once about a dream you had

tom
maybe i lied

whap verna slaps him hard his head rocks under the
blow

verna
youve never been straight with me about any
thing you are a sonofabitch

she stalks off

tom watches her go

he raises the drink and rolls it across his slapped cheek

the ice cubes clink

78 cemetary

an small old marble orchard set on a hilltop cleared
against the woods stars of david adorn the headstones in
the foreground bernies funeral is ending present is a
rabbi just finishing the chanting of the liturgy verna
and leo

in the background on the road at the foot of the hill tom
is emerging from a taxi it rolls away as he starts up the
hill

just as he arrives leo and verna turn to leave

tom takes in the scene

tom
big turnout

verna
drop dead

she stalks off leaving leo and tom alone leo takes off
his yarmulke and fiddles with it uncomfortably the two
men start walking

leo
   shes under a lot of strain

tom
well at least she didnt hit me

leo chuckles

they walk on

leo
tommy im glad you came  

tom
shes taking the car

leo

leo looks up

verna is getting into the elegant black touringcar that
waits at the bottom of the hill it pulls away

leo looks at tom

   i guess were walking

tom
i guess we are

they walk in silence for a beat

leo
   were getting married

tom stiffens he brings out

tom
   congratulations leo

leo too is uncomfortable

leo
the funny thing is   she asked me to tie the
knot i guess youre not supposed to say that

tom
it doesnt matter congratulations

leo
thanks   hell tom why didnt you tell me
what you were up to i thought youd really
gone overnot that i didnt deserve it but you
could have told me

tom
telling you could onlyve queered things if it
had  

tom cuts himself off and walks in silence for a moment

   there just wasnt any point

leo wants to be encouraging he nods

leo
i can see that well it was a smart play all
around i guess you know im grateful

tom
no need

leo is grinning again

leo
i guess you picked that fight with me just to
tuck yourself in with caspar

tom
i dunno do you always know why you do things
leo

leo greets this with a puzzled smile

leo
course i do

he nods to himself

   it was a smart play

they walk on

tom
youll do fine

leo stops grabs toms arm and the words come cut in a
rush

leo
   jesus tom id give anything if youd
work for me again i know ive made some
bonehead plays i know i can be pigheaded but
damnit so can you i need your help and things
can be like they were i know it i just know
it as for you and vernawell i understand
youre both young andwell damnit tom i
forgive you

tom instantly bristles for the first time his tone is
sharp

tom
i didnt ask for that and i dont want it

the two men stare at each othertoms look angry leos
distraught

toms look softens

   goodbye leo

leo still stares at him waiting for something else

when nothing is forthcoming he turns and walks away

tom watches him go he unpockets a flask and raises it to
his lips

behind him a tree soughs in the wind
