verse 1
straight out of the poorhouse eating lobster for breakfast
two new tour buses cause my voice is infectious
now the super models never call me a sexist
i got the new style that is leaving them breathless
and im a born entertainer coming straight out of memphis
and if elvis was alive even he would admit this
im all over the world using you as a witness
test my drive sweetie cause my hungers relentless

and were bringing some friends

and we can let the damn thing begin
cause im back again and i came to win and i came to move you move you
so strike up the band and raise up your hands
i wanna feel it moving through you
