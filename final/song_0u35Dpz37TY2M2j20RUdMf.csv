look at earth from outer space
everyone must find a place
give me time and give me space
give me real dont give me fake
give me strength reserve control
give me heart and give me soul
give me time give us a kiss
tell me your own politik

chorus
and open up your eyes
open up your eyes
open up your eyes
open up your eyes

verse 2
give me one cause one is best
in confusion confidence
give me peace of mind and trust
dont forget the rest of us
give me strength reserve control
give me heart and give me soul
wounds that heal and cracks that fix
tell me your own politik

and open up your eyes
open up your eyes
open up your eyes
open up your eyes
just open up your eyes
