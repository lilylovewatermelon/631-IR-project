breathe trust bless me and release
climb hard or never be seen
closed off rescue to breathe
just bless me

twosided time
your rebirth cant hurt
branch out behind
the pain

closure has come to me myself
you will never belong to me
closure has come to me myself
you will never belong to me

verse 2
had to turn and lay down your sting of disease
phase you out shouldve seen this coming
go on confusing this soul
hold my breath til you rupture

three days aside
your rebirth cant hurt
branch out behind
