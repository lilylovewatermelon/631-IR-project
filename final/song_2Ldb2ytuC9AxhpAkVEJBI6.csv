you were loved before you had arrived
and every day that love just multiplies
daddy made your bed and your lullaby
and mumma made the mobile in the sky
and lovin you is easy
but life will not always be
fall into the world of your song
whatever you feel could never be wrong

prechorus
come along for the ride
and in the shake of a lambs tail well go
yeah be still now and close your eyes

chorus
and dream
hangin out with the sandman
you look so sweet my child
hangin out with the sandman
although theres rain outside youll bе warm and dry
the thunder and the lightning wont hurt you now
so go to sleep my lovе
hangin out with the sandman

verse 2
chocolatecovered roof and candy cars
rainbow sugar river we can sail upon
marshmallow books and strawberries
snowmen made of ice cream
over the flower fields well fly
well count the fish in the sky
honeybees and birds sing your song
whatever you feel can never be wrong
