push it out fake a smile
avert disaster just in time
i need a drink cause in a while
worthless answers from friends of mine
its dumb to ask cool to ignore
girls possess me but theyre never mine
i made my entrance avoided hazards
checked my engine i fell behind

prechorus tom delonge  mark hoppus
duh da duh da duh da duh da duh i fell behind
duh da duh da duh da duh da duh

chorus tom delonge
she makes me feel like its raining outside
and when the storms gone im all torn up inside
im always nervous on days like this like the prom
i get too scared to move cause im a fuckin boy

verse 2 tom delonge
remember when i was in
the grocery store nows my time
lost the words lost the nerve
lost the girl left the line
i would wish upon a star
but that star it doesnt shine
so read my book with a boring ending
a short story of a lonely guy
