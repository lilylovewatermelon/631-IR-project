we missed the movie an we never ate
it was freezin cold an the heater broke
i apologized you kissed me goodnight
an said it couldnt have been any better
girl if you like that youre gonna love forever

if you like that ring you saw in the window
in the jewellery store down town
if you like tuxedos an white satin dresses
maybe you better sit down
if you like driftin off to soft pillow talk
an wakin up together
girl if you like that youre gonna love forever

if you like livin on a rural route
fixin up an old farmhouse
hugs with your coffee and your good mornins with a kiss
if you like startin a fire on a cold winters night
an makin dreams come true together
girl if you like that youre gonna love forever

if you like that movie we saw last september
the one you cried half way through
if you liked that scene where he got down on one knee
girl have i got somethin for you
if you like love like wine that grows sweeter with time
