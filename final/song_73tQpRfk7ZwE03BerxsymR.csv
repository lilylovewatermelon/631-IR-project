aint nothing out here but me the road and the radio
looking for an exit and a song that i might know
counting down the memories and adding up the miles
searching for a feeling i aint felt in a while

chorus
clarity and inspiration
happiness is a destination thats hard to find
it may take some time
but in my mind theres something more
and ill open up a brand new door
and find the strength to close the ones i left behind
and ill get there leaning on some friends i know
the road and the radio

verse 2
spent the night in carolina got up early out of bed
bought a red bull and a road map and a old stones cassette
setting my sights south bound no reason or rhyme
threw up a prayer just looking just looking for a sign

chorus
and some clarity and inspiration
happiness is a destination thats hard to find
it may take some time
but in my mind theres something more
and ill open up a brand new door
and find the strength to close the ones i left behind
and ill get there leaning on some friends i know
the road and the radio

and ill open up a brand new door
and find the strength to close the ones i left behind
and ill get there leaning on some friends i know
the road and the radio
