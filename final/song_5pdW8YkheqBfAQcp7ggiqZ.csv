i feel like there is no need for conversation
some questions are better left without a reason
and i would rather reveal myself than my situation
now and then i consider my hesitation

chorus
the more the light shines through me
i pretend to close my eyes
the more the dark consumes me
i pretend im burning burning bright

verse 2
i wonder if the things i did were just to be different
to spare myself of the constant shame of my existence
and i would surely redeem myself in my desperation
here and now ill express my situation

chorus
the more the light shines through me
i pretend to close my eyes
the more the dark consumes me
i pretend im burning bright

chorus
the more the light shines through me
i pretend to close my eyes
the more the dark consumes me
i pretend im burning

theres nothing ever wrong but nothings ever right
such a cruel contradiction
i know i crossed the line its not easy to define
im born to indecision
theres always something new some path im supposed to choose
with no particular rhyme or reason

chorus
the more the light shines through me
i pretend to close my eyes
the more the dark consumes me
i pretend im burning bright

chorus
the more the light shines through me
i pretend to close my eyes
the more the dark consumes me
i pretend im burning

outro
i feel like there is no need for conversationembed"
