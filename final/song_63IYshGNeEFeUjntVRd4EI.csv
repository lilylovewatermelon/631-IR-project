it was three am when you woke me up
and we jumped in the car and drove as far as we could go
just to get away
we talked about our lives
until the sun came up
and now im thinking about
how i wish i could go back
just for one more day
one more day with you

chorus
every time i see your face
every time you look my way
its like it all falls into place
everything feels right
ever since you walked away
you left my life in disarray
all i want is one more day
its all i need one more day with you

verse 2
when the car broke down
we just kept walking along
til we hit this town
there was nothing there at all
but that was all okay
we spent all our money on stupid things
but if i looked back now id probably give it all away
just for one more day
one more day with you

every time i see your face
every time you look my way
its like it all falls into place
everything feels right
ever since you walked away
you left my life in disarray
all i want is one more day
its all i need one more day with you

bridge
now im sitting here like we used to do
i think about my life and how now theres nothing i wont do
just for one more day
one more day with you

chorus
every time i see your face
every time you look my way
its like it all falls into place
everything feels right everything feels right
every time i hear your name
every time i feel the same
its like it all falls into place
everything everything feels right
outro
you walked away
just one more day
its all i need just one more day with you1embed"
