silver bells ooh silver bells ooh
its christmas time in the city ooh

city sidewalks busy sidewalks
dressed in holiday style

children laughing people passing
meeting smile after smile
and on every street corner youll hear you can hear

silver bells ooh silver bells ooh
its christmas time in the city ooh
ringaling hear them sing
soon it will be christmas day

verse 2
strings of streetlights even stop lights
blink a bright red and green
as the shoppers rush home with their treasures
hear the snow crunch see the kids rush
