i still remember a year ago
the times we spent
i feel that im happier now
up from the down
by all means
its strange cause i feel the same way

i think of what it looks like i think of what it tastes like
i think of what it looks like i think of what it tastes tastes

chorus
same strange said its strange cause i feel the same
same strange said its strange cause i feel the same
still remember what it tastes like what it felt like
