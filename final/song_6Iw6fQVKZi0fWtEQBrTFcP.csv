you gotta trust me yeah

verse 1
thats right ima be okay
they be like do the task right dont make no mistakes
they negated what i sacrificed think i live a flashy life
but really life is flashin by twentytwo go get it now
twentyseven hold it down
i got several homies now but still i keep my bro around
crazy we both older now babies no they older now
plus i know they count on us to lend more than a shoulder
this world is growin colder
but i swear they never get the cold shoulder
sand drippin should i flip it ovеr
skimmin through this picture folder
wishin i could live it ovеr
but you wiser when you gettin old
normally im closed off but just for this specific song
i might try to let them in save lustin for a different song but

break
baby you gotta trust me

verse 2
thats right we gon be okay
you know im gon do that task right im gon make mistakes
but dont you forget what i sacrificed think i live a flashy life
but i aint never had this life
and im talkin about this rapper life
them flashin lights and catchin flights on pjs crazy right
but if i gave this life to who i was on god i would hate my life
and if jesus take my life at least i made it to the greatest heights
he said look son dont be afraid of the heights and dont take prayer light
keep me close and watch me change your life
maybe go take a risk maybe thatll make the whole situation flip
thats true but even if things dont end up cool
at least i know i can
i can trust in you

but i can trust in you i trust you1embed"
