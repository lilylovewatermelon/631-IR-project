people know that love is what they want
they get caught up and then it’s gone
they can’t get back the kiss they lost
they spend their whole life asking questions
not knowing what went wrong

chorus
but then the answers that you know just prove you wrong
gotta have a little faith to fall back on
and then all that youve got left is being strong
gotta find a little faith to fall back on

verse 2
i didnt treat my girl like she was mine
yeah i thought i didnt need her at the time
but i changed my way of thinkin when she left
yeah i finally learned my lesson but i learned it by myself

chorus
cause when the answers that you know just prove you wrong
gotta have a little faith to fall back on
and then all that youve got left is being strong
gotta find a little faith to fall back on

verse 3
these days im not sure if i know
what im doing here or where ill go
but every night i say the same old prayer
“god i don’t have to see you i know that you’re there
see hunter hayes liveget tickets as low as 41you might also likechorus
cause there were times i thought i wouldnt make it home
but i kept a little faith to fall back on
yeah and ive learned to put my trust where it belongs
and ive got a little faith to fall back on

outro
cause when the answers that you know just prove you wrong
oh you gotta have a little faith to fall back on
yeah you gotta be strong you gotta be strong
and find a little faith to fall back on1embed"
