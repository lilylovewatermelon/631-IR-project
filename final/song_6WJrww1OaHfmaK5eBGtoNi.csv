yesterday i got a call
someone i didnâ€™t know at all had passed away
mama said yeah you know him
you went to school with both his kids
they lived out on prescott lane
she said you shouldve seen the line
mrs johnson said to tell you hi

chorus
thank god for hometowns
and all the love that makes  em go round
thank god for the county lines that welcome you back in
when you were dying to get out
thank god for church pews
and all the faces that wont forget you
cause when youre lost out in this crazy world
you got somewhere to go and get found
thank god for hometowns
yeah

verse 2
last june my cousin tied the knot
didnt know if id go or not
but im sure glad i did
it was a pretty good haul but worth the drive
i could feel myself come back to life
the closer that id get
first red light i rolled the windows down
breathed it in and took a look around
see carrie underwood liveget tickets as low as 94you might also likechorus
thank god for hometowns
first kisses and touchdowns
thank god for the county lines that welcome you back in
when you were dying to get out
thank god for church pews
and all the faces that wont forget you
and when youre lost out in this crazy world
you got somewhere to go and get found
thank god for hometowns

bridge
i always find another piece of me
walking down these old familiar streets

chorus
thank god for hometowns
and all the love that makes em go round
thank god for the county lines that welcome you back in
when you were dying to get out
thank god for church pews
and all the faces that wont forget you
and when youre lost out in this crazy world
you got somewhere to go and get found
thank god for hometowns
thank god for hometownsembed"
