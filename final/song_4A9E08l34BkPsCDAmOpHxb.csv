over the sea and far away
shes waiting like an iceberg
waiting to change
but shes cold inside
she wants to be like the water

prechorus
all the muscles tighten in her face
buries her soul in one embrace
theyre one and the same
just like water

chorus
then the fire fades away
and most of everyday
is full of tired excuses
but its too hard to say
i wish it were simple
but we give up easily
youre close enough to see that
youre the other side of the world to me

verse 2
on comes the panic light
holding on with fingers
and feelings alike
but the time has come
to move along
you might also likechorus
then the fire fades away
and most of everyday
is full of tired excuses
but its too hard to say
i wish it were simple
but we give up easily
youre close enough to see that
youre the other side of the world

bridge
can you help me
can you let me go
and can you still love me
when you cant see me anymore

chorus
then the fire fades away
and most of everyday
is full of tired excuses
but its too hard to say
i wish it were simple
but we give up easily
youre close enough to see that
youre the other side of the world
youre the other side of the world
youre the other side of the world to meembed"
