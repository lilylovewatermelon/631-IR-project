woke up this morning with a smile on my face
jumped out of bed took a shower dressed cleaned up my place
made me some breakfast  toast two scrambled eggs grits
grabbed my keys grabbed my purse grabbed my jacket
off to work beaming all the way down 3rd

chorus
is it the way you love me baby
is it the way you love me baby yeah

verse 2
430 cant wait to get home
i know youre comin out with us
nah girl i got something else to do
damn jill dont be frontin on your girls for real
go ahead really get your groove on
cause tonight my mans coming through oh word yeah
we gonna have to connect some other time
its cool i understand
as much as i like to shake my thing on the dance floor
i got another nasty freaky justright way in mind
tonight im gonna beat the high score

chorus
is it the way you love me baby yeah
is it the way you love me baby baby
is it the way you love me baby is it is it the way
is it the way you love me babyyou might also likeembed"
