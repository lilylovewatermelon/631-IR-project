i hope that you like it in your little motel
and i hope that the suite sleeps and suits you well
well i can see it as time and a sight through smell and
thats why its nice to be by yourself

chorus
cause thats what im waitin for
thats what im waitin for
thats what im waitin for arent i
thats what im waitin for
thats what im waitin for
thats what im waitin for darlin

verse 2
we treat mishaps like sinking ships and
i know that i dont want to be out to drift
well i can see it in your eyes like i taste your lips and
they both tell me that were better than this

chorus
cause thats what im waitin for
thats what im waitin for
thats what im waitin for arent i
thats what im waitin for
thats what im waitin for
thats what im waitin for darlin

we trade tit for tat like that for this
and i dont think that there was an insult that was missed
i can see it in your eyes like i taste your lips and
im very sorry

chorus

thats what im waitin for

thats what im waitin for
thats what im waitin for
thats what im waitin for darlin

verse 4
remainders of a shooting star
landed directly on our broke down little car
before then we had made a wish
that we would be missed
if one or another just did not exist

chorus
cause thats what were waitin for
thats what were waitin for
thats what were waitin on arent we
thats what were waitin for
thats what were waitin for
thats what were waitin on are we
thats what were waitin for
thats what were waitin for
thats what were waitin for darling
outro
thats what were waitin for
thats what were waitin for
thats what were waitin for arent we6embed"
