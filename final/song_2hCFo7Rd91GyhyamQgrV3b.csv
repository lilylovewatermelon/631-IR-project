faster than light
to burn the stripes
they forged this heart
for you to play the part

chorus owain
have i been cut again
just to dodge sweet descent my friend

verse 2 owain
spit now the fire
fantasies desire
they forged this heart
for you to fall apart

chorus owain
have i been cut again
just to dodge sweet descent my friend

bridge owain
and i will reap what youve sown
just to play
these games we love

verse 3 owain
try to describe
the voices in your head
theyre hard to disguise
somebody said
come back to earth
youve gone too far this time
they cut you too deep
you tread these thin white lines
and we know the truth
we sit at home
we watch the girl in the booth
who gives her services for hundreds of yen
she wonders where all the happiness went
