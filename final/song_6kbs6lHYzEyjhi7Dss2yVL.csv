i just told myself uh
yeah uh yeah

chorus
welcome to la
the land of opportunity where everybody stay
the girls are pretty the sun will shine 360 days
but i dont always feel that way today i need some gray
yeah uh please protect my soul before they weather it away
the land of opportunity where everybody stay

verse 1
yeah
they move out to this town with dreams ambitions and get lost in the party
takes a toll on you man this shit will charge a large fee
just dont forget who you are g
staring at the man in the mirror like i recognize him hardly
burn my sins away and twist some parsley
stop and chill these days i do it sparsely
in another universe i coulda had a stroller and a car seat word
they tell me things will happen how they supposed to
but somehow it seems i hurt all the people i get close to
experiencing breakdowns a 27 goes through
cause you dont want to see heaven yet where janis joplin knows you
on phone calls with mama like she tryin to give me a earful
she said this is the town that happens in so just be careful
been tryin to keep your head straight
and deadoff all that bullshit thats just dead weight

the land of opportunity where everybody stay

but i dont always feel that way today i need some gray
yeah uh please protect my soul before they weather it away
the land of opportunity where everybody stay

verse 2
the whole worlds outside knocking at my door like gerald where the fuck that album at
but i aint home im on the road the stage is where they found me at
so my personal interests take a backseat to the business
but i balance like a gymnast like simone in the olympics
so please pardon my tardiness im tryin to put my heart in this
give this shit my everything every time when i start with this
hungry for the world thatâ€™s why i starve for this
yeah artists come and go these days its easy theyre not hard to miss
here today gone tomorrow they fade into a dark abyss
hollywood sold you a dream like how the fuck you fall for this
have to know yourself or you just really gon get lost in this sauce
i really paid the cost to be a boss
i paid in cash and skipped the tax aint asked for no receipt
when i get stressed i play the beat and split a swisher sweet
damn yeah uh

chorus
welcome to la
the land of opportunity where everybody stay
the girls are pretty the sun will shine 360 days
but i dont always feel that way today i need some gray
yeah uh please protect my soul before they weather it away
the land of opportunity yeah uh20embed"
