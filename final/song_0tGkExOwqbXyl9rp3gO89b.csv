verse 1
shes a weekend beauty queen
of the black light clubs wearing out the scene
you know her type
out all night
starry eyed for the dirty dream
always looking for the prince where the cash is king
on the boulevard
in a big black car
shes everywhere you are

i smell her sweet perfume
making rounds around the room
cause shes a downtown girl
a downtown girl
her lips are red
and those hips are turning heads
cause shes a downtown girl
a downtown girl
a downtown downtown girl girl
a downtown downtown girl girl oh

making rounds around the room
