theres frost on every window
oh i cant believe my eyes
and in my bones i feel the warmth
thats coming from inside

why that looks so unique inspired
theyre gathering around to hear a story
roasting chestnuts on a fire

in here theyve got a little tree how queer
and who would ever think

theyre covering it with tiny little things
theyve got electric lights on strings
and theres a smile on everyone

oh my what now
the children are asleep
but look theres nothing underneath
no ghouls no witches here to scream and scare them
or ensnare them only little cozy things
secure them in their dreamland

verse 9
the monsters are all missing
and the nightmares cant be found
and in their place there seems to be
good feeling all around
verse 10
instead of screams i swear
i can hear music in the air
the smell of cakes and pies
are absolutely everywhere

verse 11
the sights the sounds
theyre everywhere and all around
ive never felt this good before
this empty place inside of me has been filling up
i simply cannot get enough

outro

oh i want it for my own

ive got to know
what is this place that i have found
what is this9embed"
