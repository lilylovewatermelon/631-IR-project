verse 1
so you want to play games with my head
but you make me fall apart i wish that i was dead
i just cant believe i fell for such a blackened heart
you played me for a fool and used me from the start
fuck you fuck you i just want to know the truth
but the words from your mouth they just cloud
all the negativity forces me down into silence
but still i can dream
i want to know
i want to know

chorus
if i tear you open wide take a look inside
are you pretty
can i get inside your mind see what i can find
are you pretty
so just take off that disguise everyone knows that youre only
pretty on the outside

verse 2
now i fucking hate you with all of my heart
so just disappear and never will i fear for my life
i just want to be alone
and never no never will i be unhappy alone
i want to know
i want to know

if i tear you open wide take a look inside
are you pretty
can i get inside your mind see what i can find
are you pretty
so just take off that disguise everyone knows that youre only
pretty on the outside

bridge
youre so pretty on the outside
youre so pretty on the outside

so you want to play games with my head
but you make me fall apart and wish that i was dead
cant believe i fell for such a blackened heart
you played me for a fool and just used me from the start
i just want to know the truth but the words from your mouth
all your negativity you keep forcing me down
into silence i can dream into silence i can dream
into silence i can dream

chorus
if i tear you open wide take a look inside
are you pretty pretty
can i get inside your mind see what i can find
are you pretty pretty
so just take off that disguise everyone knows that youre only
pretty on the outside
