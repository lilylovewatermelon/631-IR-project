it took me and four of my buddies
half the night to pull out my truck
i stood there and proclaimed everybody
its the last time ill mess with this mud
the boys they all grinned and two nights from then

chorus
i did it again just one more time
even i swore that id lost my mind
but i turned right around and just like a fool
did what any old country boyd do i did it again

verse 2
i took my first sip of cold beer
and tried not to spit it back up
i set it back down on that tailgate
told myself id had enough
then like a real man i took hold of that can

chorus
and i did it again just one more time
even i swore that id lost my mind
but i turned right around and just like a fool
did what any old country boyd do i did it again
see luke bryan liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likebridge
i guess im a slow learner i ought to know better
than to do what i do but i arenâ€™t no quitter

verse 3
the other night we got a little rowdy
i woke up with one eye swole shut
yeah things got out of hand at that party
i said thats it its bout time i grow up
but that next weekend i called all my friends

chorus
and i did it again just one more time
even i swore that id lost my mind
but i turned right around and just like a fool
did what any old country boyd do

outro
yeah what any old country boyd do
i did it again i did it again
i done done it again i did it againembed"
