listen to the dark before i lie
looking to the city lights burning from afar
glowing at the bottom of the sky

i think nothing beautiful comes without a fight
of course theres no exception in us
ive come to love revolving doors and things that tend to shine
but you never really cared for that much

oh aint it just a shame
ending bout the same way that we started out
oh comin back around with just more jewelry
im afraid that weve departed now

you wont catch me trains are moving too fast
whats this railcar to some bits of broken glass
i had a box of pictures that i hid in tall grass
you wont find me ‘cause im already gone
you wont find me ‘cause im already gone

well i used to have love but i was stubborn and drunk
so i squandered it
and i got rid of your taste with some things in a place
because i wanted it

ending bout the same way that we started out
oh coming back around with just more jewelry
im afraid that weve departed now

you wont catch me trains are moving too fast
whats this railcar to some bits of broken glass
i had a box of pictures that i hid in tall grass
you wont find me ‘cause im already gone
you wont find me ‘cause im already gone

i walked out my house tonight just to hear the quiet
listen to the dark before i lieembed"
