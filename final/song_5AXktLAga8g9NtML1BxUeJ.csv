well alright
oh oh lord
well alright

well alright
oh lord
well aright

verse 1
drive your high heel into my heart
i dont even care
cause my pride is worth much more than your
your stupid little love
every word that you say keeps on bouncing around in my head
when all my delusions of grander have turned into bad jokes instead
youll be there pointing and laughing to prove you were wiser than i
well im just pretending perfection
im flying uncomfortably high

chorus
it feels like im falling
it feels like im falling
it feels like im all in
it feels like im falling
