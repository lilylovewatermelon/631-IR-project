one more time one more time
uh one more time
uh one more time

verse 1
i dream of the day i can go back to when i was born
layin in your arms wishin you was here today mom
wish youd appear just for a second from heaven
my tears would be gone i wouldnt be rappin this song
id be happy drivin up to your eightbedroom mansion
up late laughin about the hard times we faced
the galaxy is so enchantin beyond galileos understandin
past the milky way and all the planets
theres somethin out there greater but only god knows
scientists claim we came from apes but they lies though
that was part of our conversation
i spark one up and start blazin
thinkin of how amazin she was an angel gave me love
im thankful to ever know a woman so real
i pray when i marry my wifell have one of your skills
but mom you could never be replaced
id give my life up just to see you one more day to have—

chorus
one more dance with you momma
if i could only have
one more dance with you momma
praying wishing that i could have
one more dance with you momma
if i could only have
one more dance with you momma
see nas liveget tickets as low as 106you might also likeverse 2
i wish you were here i miss you more each second i breathe
you resting in peace forever i accepted you free
a blessing to me i see you dressed in all white
smilin at me happy knowin everythings all right
if only i could hear your voice and your laughter
just one more time my chest would be filled up with sunshine
april 7th 02 thats when the gates of heaven opened up
for you to stroll through beautiful anne jones
job is done raising ghetto kids in the hood
you was my strength to carry on and now im good
job well done you lived through your sons and grandchildren
jesus finally got his bride mommy dance with him
and youve been my guide through all the trouble i faced
they playin our song the lifebeat my hand on your waist
i grab your other hand im tryin not to step on your toes
spin you around with my eyes closed dreaming i can have—

chorus
one more dance with you momma
if i could only have
one more dance with you momma
praying wishing that i could have
one more dance with you momma
if i could only have
one more dance with you momma
outro
i love you forever mom
you will always live through me always
