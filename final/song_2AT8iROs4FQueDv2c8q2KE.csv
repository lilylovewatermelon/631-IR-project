im a puppet on a string
tracy island timetraveling
diamond cuttershaped heartaches
that come to find you four in some velvet morning
years too late shes a silver lining
lone ranger riding through an open space
in my mind when shes not right there beside me

chorus
i go crazy cause here isnt where i wanna be
and satisfaction feels like a distant memory
and i cant help myself all i
wanna hear her say is are you mine
well are you mine
are you mine
are you mine woah ah

verse 2
i guess what im trying to say is i need the deep end
keep imagining meeting wished away entire lifetimes
unfair were not somewhere misbehaving for days
great escape lost track of time and space
shes a silver lining climbing on my desire

chorus
and i go crazy cause here isnt where i wanna be
and satisfaction feels like a distant memory
and i cant help myself all i
wanna hear her say is are you mine
well are you mine are you mine tomorrow
are you mine or just mine tonight
are you mine are you mine mine
you might also likebridge
and the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
so in case im mistaken i
just wanna hear you say you got me baby
are you mine

breakdown
shes a silver lining
lone ranger riding through an open space
in my mind when shes not right there beside me

chorus
i go crazy cause here isnt where i wanna be
and satisfaction feels like a distant memory
and i cant help myself all i
wanna hear her say is are you mine
well are you mine are you mine tomorrow
are you mine or just mine tonight
are you mine are you mine tomorrow 
or just mine tonight218embed"
