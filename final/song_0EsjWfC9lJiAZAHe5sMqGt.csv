i woke up on my roof with my brothers
theres a whale in the pool with my mother
and my dad paints the house different colors
where would we be if we couldnt dream

chorus nick jonas
and i know we get a little crazy
and i know we get a little loud
and i know were never gonna fake it
we are wild we are free we are more than you think
so call us freaks but thats just the way we roll

verse 2 joe jonas
youve got moves ive got shoes lets go dancing
pop and lock battle dance against hanson
if we lose all the girls theyll be laughing
where would we be if we couldnt dream

chorus nick jonas
and i know we get a little crazy
and i know we get a little loud
and i know were never gonna fake it
we are wild we are free we are more than you think
so call us freaks but thats just the way we roll

and i know we get a little crazy
and i know we get a little loud
and i know were never gonna fake it
