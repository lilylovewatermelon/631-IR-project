i wish it was cooling me
but so far has not been good
its been shitty and i feel awkward as i should
this club has got to be the most pretentious thing
since i thought you and me
well i am imagining a dark lit place
or your place or my place

well im not paralyzed but i seem to be struck by you
i want to make you move because youre standing still
if your body matches what your eyes can do
youll probably move right through me on my way to you

i hold out for one more drink before i think
im looking too desperately
but so far has not been fun
i should just stay home if one thing really means one
this club will hopefully be closed in three weeks
that would be cool with me
well im still imagining a dark lit place
or your place or my place

well im not paralyzed but i seem to be struck by you
i want to make you move because youre standing still
if your body matches what your eyes can do
youll probably move right through me on my way to you

not paralyzed but i seem to be struck by you
i want to make you move because youre standing still
if your body matches what your eyes can do
youll probably move right through me on my way to you

youll probably move right through me on my way to you
youll probably move right through me on my way to youembed"
