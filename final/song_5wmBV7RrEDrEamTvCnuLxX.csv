and i swear theres a ghost on this island
and his hands all covered in blood
and my wife inquired of understanding
but of course my dear you cant
she said how can i relate to somebody who doesnt speak
i feel like im just treading water

chorus
is it the same for you
is it the same for you

verse 2
well he comes and he goes so capricious
and his work appears so rushed
well i love the house that we live in
and i love you all too much

chorus
is it the same for you
is it the same for you
is it the same for you
is it the same for you

verse 3
well the criminals and liars
keep them in your cells as a privilege of mine
and i love the house that we live in
and i love you all too much
