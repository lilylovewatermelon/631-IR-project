i wake up in the mornin
put on my face
the one thats gonna get me
through another day
doesnt really matter
how i feel inside
this life is like a game sometimes

verse 1
but then you came around me
the walls just disappeared
nothing to surround me
and keep me from my fears
im unprotected
see how ive opened up
oh youve made me trust

chorus
cause ive never felt like this before
im naked around you
does it show
you see right through me and i cant hide
im naked around you
and it feels so right
yeah yeah

why i was afraid
to be myself and let the
the covers fall away
guess i never had someone like you
to help me to help me fit
in my skin

chorus
ive never felt like this before
im naked around you
does it show
you see right through me and i cant hide
im naked around you
and it feels so right
