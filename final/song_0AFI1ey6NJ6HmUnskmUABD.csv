verse 1
i told you i would show up
screaming out fnf til the world blow up
they said i was so finished i told em its show business
meanin theres no business less fiascos in it
disrespect the dress code wear my street clothes in it
measured sold and clothed in it
opened up closed after i entered and drove in it like uhh

hook
only fear god
know the weapons of the weak
the weakness of the heart
and never fall asleep

verse 2
roll in it music bumpin windows tinted
through the good neighbourhoods and all of the woes in it
exerted control in it
seen it come and go stolen and sold in it
diamond and gold plated
fountain of youth dippin my toes in it
bounce in the booth spit it like skoal in it
putting my heart and my soul in it
cause

only fear god
know the weapons of the weak
the weakness of the heart
and never fall asleep

bridge
once upon a time not long ago
when the pusher man creep where they live life po

verse 3
with fifteen in the clip and one in the hole
hallway wall full of rips some some of us know
none of us know the makers of the toast
like the bottom of the stove that was used in the murderin of the scroll
heart colder than edys
wont let the seedy city defeat me
rub me out like genies wont concede til im graffiti
nigga what

hook
only fear god
know the weapons of the weak
the weakness of the heart
and never fall asleep
verse 4
i done bellowed said what up to the reaper
hell met like riddell then highwater hello
to the fiveyearold gunshot hearer i hear ya
clearer than the invisible man in the mirror
cheer up i put it on the bars like beer nuts
put a bug in they ear so from here up they hear us

hook
only fear god
know the weapons of the weak
the weakness of the heart
and never fall asleep

bridge
once upon a time not long ago
when the pusher man creep where they live life po

verse 5
i put it on my grandmommas daughter
i microphone control with the soul of slave hummin wadin in the water
i author like dw brother like a hustla
god place me in ya armor i prescribe no partners
i do it for the hood like a parka
but tell my niggas not to shiver
only time we quiver like a archer is
hook
only fear god
know the weapons of the weak
the weakness of the heart
and never fall asleep

verse 6
here we are now entertain us
change dont change us
ever since the game trained us
we came up like worms in the rain
i dream my chain became a loose noose that was used to hang us
so now my insane brain my 32 teeth
and two feet creep like its elm street
cause

hook
only fear god
know the weapons of the weak
the weakness of the heart
and never fall asleep

once upon a time not long ago
when the pusher man creep where they live life po6embed"
