im everything that i said id be
everything that i bet id be
all the kids that i grew up with
they see me out and congratulate me
couple of em just graduated
couple of em done had a baby
but all of em look at my life and say thats amazing
i say thank you like twenty times
try to talk about somethin else
reminisce on some funny time
truthfully im not comfortable with gettin all the praise
even more when yall get to drinkin and start tellin me all the things
that you really think
likе what i shouldve done differеntly
what you think of my energy
the downsides that come with being friends with me
i can tell you think this the realest that anybodys ever been with me
but luckily i got pg
and luckily i keep them with me

chorus
i keep it humble so you can have a good time
i keep it light so you can have a lil shine
and i sleep at night just fine
i tried to be kind
now im speakin my mind
you might also likeinterlude
time ahah
i like how you got the vocals in my time ahah
just make em like a little less harsh
thats the only thing
but its in that good world in my time ahah
in my time ahah

verse 2
once people lose touch with ya
they start to hate ya
start to show you they true nature
start to be the ones in the comments
thats talkin bout you like you a stranger
talkin bout ya like yall didnt have class together
talkin like you not humble now or you acting better
speakin on the things youve done that they havent ever
i play the game you watch the game like adam schefter
i created this added pressure
im the one that made jack get better
tone it down i could never ooh
all the greats caught all the hate
all the rappers i love most at one point got called a fake
everybody seem to know the song that i oughta make
know the route that i oughta take
i put too much work in to just call it fate
chorus
but i keep it humble so you can have a good time
i keep it light so you can have a lil shine
and i sleep at night just fine
i tried to be kind
now im speakin my mind

outro
time ahah
i told your brother this so ima tell you this
this is probably advice i keep giving you frequently
and probably will continue to give it to you frequently because
its made a difference in my life
take some moments today during the shoot to look around
look at the faces of all the people youve brought together
watch their reactions
look at the joy on their faces
take a moment to really absorb what youve created
what youre creating
and try to savor it
i know that you and i are built the same and that its never enough
theres always some other thing we want to accomplish but
just lean back for a moment today
and really comprehend the greatness that youve made
love you babe4embed"
