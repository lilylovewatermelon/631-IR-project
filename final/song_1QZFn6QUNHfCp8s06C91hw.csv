oh you know i did it its over and i feel fine
nothing you could say is gonna change my mind
waited and i waited the longest night
nothing like the taste of sweet decline

verse 1
i was down and i fell i fell so fast
droppin like the grains in an hourglass
never say forever cause nothing lasts
dancin with the bones of my buried past

prechorus
never mind theres nothing i could do
bet your life theres something killin you

chorus
its a shame we have to die my dear
no ones gettin out of here alive
this time
what a way to go but have no fear
no ones gettin out of here alive
this time

verse 2
im finished im gettin you off my chest
made you come clean in a dirty dress
a promise is a promise you kept in check
hard to cross a heart that beats this fast
see foo fighters liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likeverse 3
take a good hard look for the very last time
the very last one in a very long line
only took a second to say goodbye
been a pleasure but the pleasures been mine all mine

prechorus
never mind theres nothing i could do
bet your life theres something killin you

chorus
its a shame we have to die my dear
no ones gettin out of here alive
this time
what a way to go but have no fear
no ones gettin out of here alive
this time
