in the cold stone walls
house where the bleeding did fall
a mother is crying outside
in the darkest of hours
left with her perilous thoughts
they circle to squeeze dry her soul

chorus 1
she said lord imma lose my baby
lord imma lose my way
if living means im dead here
come hurry and resurrect me

bridge
ohohoh
ohohoh
ohohoh
ohohoh

verse 2
when the sun goes down
into another nights arms
were babies in a scavengers glimpse
then a neon cross shines
and shows us to tread on the low
of guilt trips while love grips the blind
see the temper trap liveget tickets as low as 210you might also likechorus 2
i said lord imma lose my head here
lord imma lose my way
if pushing means im stuck here
come hurry and resurrect me

bridge
imma drop my head before im ready to stop
imma drop my head before im ready to stop
imma dig that grave and fall in line for the chop
before im ready to stop if im ready or not
imma drop my head before im ready to stop
imma drop my head before im ready to stop
imma ride my time before they throw out the clock
charge my blood by the hour and make me pay for the talk

chorus 3
i said lord we gonna lose our heads here
lord we gonna lose our way

outro
imma dig that grave
imma dig that grave
baby blow this scene hang our boots up to lean
and die until the resurrection of the things we believe
imma dig that graveembed"
