my baby just cant take
her eyes off me

dont blame it on sunshine
dont blame it on moonlight
dont blame it on good times

dont blame it on good times
blame it on the boogie

the magic music grooves me
the dirty rhythm moves me
the devils gotten to me
through his dance

im full of funky fever
and fire burns inside me
boogies got me in a
super trance
