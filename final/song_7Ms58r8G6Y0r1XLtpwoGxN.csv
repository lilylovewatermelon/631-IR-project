you say that you wanna go to a land thats far away
how are we supposed to get there with the way that were living today
you talk lots about god
freedom comes from the call
but thats not what this bitch wants
not what i want at all

chorus
i want money power and glory
i want money and all your power all your glory
hallelujah i wanna take you for all that you got
hallelujah im gonna take them for all that they got

postchorus
baby

verse 2
the sun also rises on those who fail the call
my life it comprises of losses and wins and fails and falls
but i can do it if you really really like that
i know what you really want bbaby
i can do it if you think youll like that
you should run boy run

chorus
i want money power and glory
i want money and all your power all your glory
hallelujah i wanna take you for all that you got
hallelujah im gonna take them for all that they got
