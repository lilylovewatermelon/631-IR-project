so you tried to believe in the castle made of sand
when it falls to the sea
and your feet cant find dry land reach for my hand

verse 1 pitbull
id sacrifice my life to give you my life through speakers
i try to do good even though ive been crossed like jesus
god knows i got a good heart
but my bloods filled with demons im fighting myself hah
believe me im far from lingering far from ready
if you knew where i come from knew what ive been through
youd think there should have been another outcome
just like most kids a father i did it without one
come from the city where theyll x you like malcolm
then you wonder how come
i can move in a room full of wolves so swift so smooth
thank you mom for making me a man
let a motherfucker knock down my castle out of sand

chorus kelly rowland
so you tried to believe to believe in the castle made of sand
when it falls to the sea
and your feet cant find dry land reach for my hand
reach for my hand

woo
i lived my whole life with the world on my shoulders
so i couldnt care less what this music game throws us
i see them looking for the keys but they wont find em
i come from struggle im a fighter must she be reminded
my mothers past has her trapped has her blinded
but i took her past i took her pain i made it strength
i fought the game do or die pitbulls the name
now all i see is the future
mom i love you i salute ya
and no matter what happens just know youre the reason that im rappin

chorus kelly rowland
so you tried to believe to believe in the castle made of sand
when it falls to the sea
and your feet cant find dry land reach for my hand
reach for my hand

verse 3 jamie drastik
look
im from the home of the spitters the winners the big apple
came down to south beach to build a new castle
every day im hustlin and every day you hassle
doin what you can and im doin what i have to
throw me in the jungle and ill show you im a winner
im coming out with dinner and wearing a chinchilla
i did it for my town to show em the big picture
pit hit the switch i promise to never switch up
this is for my brother took three and went to jail
im sending all the pictures of my shows through the mail
he hit me with a letter said i knew youd never fail
so put me on the beach with a bucket and a pail
chorus kelly rowland
so you tried to believe to believe in the castle made of sand
when it falls to the sea
and your feet cant find dry land reach for my hand
reach for my hand15embed"
