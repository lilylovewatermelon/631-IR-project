i got something to say got something to say
alright can you fill me in
come on
can you fill me in
what you want what you want me to do baby
can you fill me in
lets talk about it

verse 1
i was checkin this girl next door when her parents went out
she phoned said hey boy come on right around
so i knock at the door
you were standin with a bottle of red wine ready to pour
dressed in long black satin and lace to the floor
so i went in then we sat down start kissing caressing
told me about jacuzzi sounded interesting
so we jumped right in
all calls diverted to answer phone
please leave a message after the tone
i mean me and her parents were kind of cool
but they were the fine line between me and you
we were just doing things young people in love do
parents tryna find out what we were up to

chorus
saying why were you creeping round late last night
why did i see two shadows moving in your bedroom light
now youre dressed in black
when i left you were dressed in white
can you fill me in
calls diverted to answer phone
red wine bottle half the contents gone
midnight return jacuzzi turned on
can you fill me in its another one its another one

whenever the coast was clear and shed ask me to come out
id say hey girl come on right around
so she knocked at the door
i was standing with the keys in my hand to the four by four
jumped in my ride checkin that nobody saw
the club we went in
we got down bounced bounced to the rhythm
saw it was early morning
thought wed better be leavin
so i gave you my jacket for you to hold
told you to wear it cause you felt cold
i mean me and her didnt mean to break the rules
i werent trying to play your mum and dad for fools
we were just doing things young people in love do
parents tryna find out what we were up to

chorus
saying why cant you keep your promises no more
say youll be home by twelve come strolling in at four
out with the girls but leaving with the boy next door
can you fill me in fill me in
wearing a jacket whose property
said youd been queuing for a taxi
but you left all your money on the tv can you tell me
can you fill me in can you fill me in
bridge
all they seem to do is be checking up on you baby
craig david
watchin our every move
think someday they might approve baby

chorus
why were you creeping round late last night
why did i see two shadows moving in your bedroom light
now youre dressed in black
when i left you were dressed in white
can you fill me in can you fill me in
calls diverted to answer phone
red wine bottle half the contents gone
midnight return jacuzzi turned on
can you fill me in can you fill me in17embed"
