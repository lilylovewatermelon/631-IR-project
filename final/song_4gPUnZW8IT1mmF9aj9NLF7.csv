wrap me in designer sheets and trace along this frame
ask me why they used to say that trouble was my name
ive been playin’ a fool since i stepped into the game
tell me im like heaven take the good lords name in vain

prechorus
but when i play my cards keep ’em close to my chest
never fall in love everybody loses their bet
but underneath i just need to forget
so come and get me undressed

chorus
well you can take off all my clothes
and never see me naked
see me for real
if you dont know my heart
youre never gonna break it
baby
tell me if its safe to bare my soul
i wanna show you my deepest secrets
i think im ready to be exposed
i want you watching me
when you take off all my clothes
and really see me naked
see me for real

if i let you leave the light on and i drop my guard
promise that youll see me for my truth and not my scars

prechorus
but when i play my cards keep em close to my chest
never fall in love everybody loses their bet
but underneath i just need to forget
so come and get me undressed

chorus
well you can take off all my clothes
and never see me naked
see me for real
if you dont know my heart
you’re never gonna break it
baby
tell me if it’s safe to bare my soul
i wanna show you my deepest secrets
i think im ready to be exposed
i want you watching me
when you take off all my clothes
and really see me naked

if i keep my distance i can’t connect with you
lay my head on your chest and just surrender
just surrender to you
chorus
well you can take off all my clothes
and never see me naked
if you dont know my heart
youre never gonna break it yeah
oh you tell me if its safe to bare my soul
i wanna show you my deepest secrets
