i feel like a beat up back road all full of potholes
man im on a hell of a ride
doing my best and i cant get a rest
and i cant get time on my side
down on my luck and im down on my knees
and im down to my last dirty dime
red sky morning it keeps on pouring
just like the tears in my eyes

chorus
im looking for smooth sailing
feeling the breeze on my back
get my blues fading
my weather and my wheels on track
come hell or high water
the suns gonna shine
might not be tomorrow but i know im gonna find
smooth sailing
watch me sail away

verse 2
the flowers are dying
my woman is crying herself to sleep every night
and people try to be nice and they give me advice
but they aint got a dog in this fight
whats left of my faith is a drop in the tank
here lately ive been running on fumes
but theres a new sun rising on the horizon
lord i hope i get there soon
see old dominion liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likechorus
im looking for smooth sailing
feeling the breeze on my back
get my blues fading
my weather and my wheels on track
come hell or high water
the suns gonna shine
might not be tomorrow but i know im gonna find
smooth sailing
im looking for smooth sailing

bridge
i could use it i could use it
i could use a little tide turn
i could use it before i lose it
i could use a little
i could use a little smooth sailing

chorus
im looking for smooth sailing
feeling the breeze on my back
get my blues fading
my weather and my wheels on track
come hell or high water
the suns gonna shine
might not be tomorrow but i know im gonna find
smooth sailing
im looking for smooth sailing
watch me sail awayembed"
