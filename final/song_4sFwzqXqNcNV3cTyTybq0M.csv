taylor swift my advice to firsttime songwriters would be you know the person youre writing the song about first know that and then write a letter to them like what you would say if you could cause thats why i listen to music its because it says how i feel better than i could and it says what i wish id said when that moment was there so i would say be as direct as you possibly can if you needed to rewrite it back later i guess do that but for me i think the more details the better the more it seems like a journal entry the better the more it seems like an open letter the better the more true and honest and real it gets where youre naming the places you were the times it happened all the things about a relationship if you can in your songwriting be as detailed as possible because for people to relate to it they may not have the same details in their relationship that you had in yours but they can relate in that they had these little details to their relationship too

becca in fact i know a lot of people connected to the details of this next song that were about to play off taylor swifts debut album this is stay beautiful on big machine radiosee taylor swift liveget tickets as low as 172embed"
