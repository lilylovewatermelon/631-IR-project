verse 1 swifty mcvay
its my attitude thats making me bust shit
i aint to be fucked with
so basically niggas wasting they time trying to touch swift
i run with a bunch of killers that dealt with punks
be turning ghost fore you be looking at yourself get stomped
im a dysfunctional bastard who will puncture your ass
with a mag and ill be glad to send another one after you
without no hesitation ill run up in your house and wake your spouse up
and give her gun to mouth resuscitation
a niggas information they haunted and they sad
got you mad cause they shitting through their stomach in a bag
we coming too strong so its irrelevant to blast you
we master ready slash like relatives of manson
when you hear us niggas think its elephants dancing
coming near us
is the worst mistake that could ever happen
when im in my vehicle im pulling you in
i guarantee the world will never see you again motherfucker

verse 2 kon artis
honest to god i usually try to keep to my self
but its kinda hard when you surrounded by ignorance well
let me explain something to ya
a real street nigga aint trying to get in the streets
hes trying to get out feel me
and he aint the type of dude to pop a e and get drunk
and wave his heat all in the air like hes some dumb ho punk
at least a soldier in the army lose his life over a cause
that niggas dying over pride just to prove he got balls
i play keyboards i dont play beef
you borrow guns i own shit that explode when it hit
you think its fun that you homesick and you cant really get sleep
cause you done laid a nigga down but that aint me
well my conscience wont allow me to make decisions in vain
im a man i do my bidding and i do it again
if you take it to that level i take it to whoever
want to harm me and my family runyon avenue forever
chorus eminem

verse 3 kuniva
now people know i live trifling i express it through writing
if you cant feel it then i must express it through fighting
and i just bought me a new gauge and added on a new knife
and i strike people so fast niggas think i threw lightning
clash with a few titans blasted a few hype men
been harassed by two dykes who wanted lou pikner
plus you know im too violent to be out with you whiling
cause as soon as you driving im a spit a few live ones
and i love to kuniv son and you love ya life run
i know how to hide guns from skinny to wide ones
go buy me a long sub and hide it inside buns
you looking for hoes and up in here you going find none
you niggas done tried once and you can kiss my nuts
you soft little dry cunts get stomped til your eyes shut
no time for the whywhats im writing these five words
fuck you dick riding niggas count it its five words
chorus eminem
yall better leave that boy alone
cause if they dont yall know he gon come back on em
and they dont want him to come back strong
i wouldnt dare get that boy going
