we all drink to forget
some of us more than most
when reality gets too real
and the fires of hell too close
but im here to let you know
that you can make it through
if you believe that someone is watching over you

chorus
and call it an angel call it a muse
and call it karma that youve got coming to you
whats the difference whats in a name
what matters most is never ever losin faith
cause its gonna be alright
youre not alone tonight

verse 2
we all have our days
when nothing goes as planned
not a soul in the world
seems to understand
and for someone to talk to
youd give anything
well go on and cry out loud
cause someones listening
