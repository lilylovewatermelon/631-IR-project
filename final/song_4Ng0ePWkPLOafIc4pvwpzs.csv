i hold you
i hold you closer than i ever knew
i could do
but im confused
i thought id recognize when love was true
but im confused

prechorus jack met
am i ready for love
or maybe just a best friend
should there be a difference
do you have instructions
maybe im stuck on what i see on tv
i grew up on disney
but this dont feel like disney

chorus jack met
you say i turned out fine
i think im still turning out
you say i turned out fine
i think im still turning out
i think im still turning out

verse 2 jack met
in my mind
i thought the birds would sing and sparks would fly
but its just quiet
am i cruel
or am i ignorant or was i fooled
by the stories i knew
see ajr liveget tickets as low as 10you might also likeprechorus jack met
am i ready for love
or maybe just a best friend
should there be a difference
do you have instructions
maybe im stuck on what i see on tv
i grew up on disney
but this dont feel like disney

chorus jack met
you say i turned out fine
i think im still turning out
you say i turned out fine
i think im still turning out
i hope you stick around
were gonna figure it out
who can i turn to now
when im still turning out
when im still turning out

bridge jack met
im a little kid and so are you
dont you go and grow up before i do
im a little kid with so much doubt
do you wanna be there to see how i turn out
im a little kid and so are you
dont you go and grow up before i do
im a little kid with so much doubt
do you wanna be there to see how i turn out
im a little kid and so are you
dont you go and grow up before i do
im a little kid with so much doubt
do you wanna be there to see how i turn out
im a little kid and so are you
dont you go and grow up before i do
im a little kid with so much doubt
do you want to be there to see how i turn out
