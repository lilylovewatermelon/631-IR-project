time to tell me the truth
to burden your mouth for what you say
no pieces of paper in the way
cause i cant continue pretending to choose
these opposite sides on which we fall
the lovingyoulaters if at all
no right minds could wrong be
this many times

verse 2
my memory is cruel
im queen of attention to details
defending intentions if he fails
until now he told me her name
it sounded familiar in a way
and i could have sworn id heard him say it
ten thousand times
oh if only i had been listening

chorus
leave unsaid unspoken
eyes wide shut unopened
you and me
always between the lines
between the lines

i thought i thought i was ready to bleed
that wed move from the shadows on the wall
and stand in the center of it all
too late two choices to stay or to leave
mine was so easy to uncover
hed already left with the other
so ive learned to listen through silence

chorus
leave unsaid unspoken
eyes wide shut unopened
you and me always be–
you and me always be–

bridge
i tell myself all the words he surely meant to say
ill talk until the conversation doesnt stay on
wait for me im almost ready
when he meant let go

chorus
leave unsaid unspoken
eyes wide shut unopened
you and me always be–
you and me always between the lines
between the lines
between the lines
