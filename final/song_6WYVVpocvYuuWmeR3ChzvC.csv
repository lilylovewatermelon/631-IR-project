spare me your judgements and spare me your dreams
cause recently mine have been tearing my seams
i sit alone in this winter clarity which clouds my mind
alone in the wind and the rain you left me
its getting dark darling too dark to see
and im on my knees and your faith in shreds it seems

verse 2
corrupted by the simple sniff of riches blown
i know you have felt much more love than youve shown
and im on my knees and the water creeps to my chest

chorus
but plant your hope with good seeds
dont cover yourself with thistle and weeds
rain down rain down on me
look over your hills and be still
the sky above us shoots to kill
rain down rain down on me

bridge
but i will hold on i will hold on hope
but i will hold on i will hold on hope
oh i will hold on i will hold on hope
but i will hold on i will hold on hope
i will hold on i will hold on
you might also likeverse 3
i begged you to hear me theres more than flesh and bones
let the dead bury the dead they will come out in droves
but take the spade from my hands and fill in the holes youve made

chorusoutro
but plant your hope with good seeds
dont cover yourself with thistle and weeds
rain down rain down on me3embed"
