im halfway gone
sleepless im battle worn
and youre all i want
so bring me the dawn

chorus
i need the sun to break
youve woken up my heart im shaking oh
my luck could change
been in the dark for weeks
and ive realized youre all i need i hope
that im not too late
i hope im not too late

verse 2
back of the room
how come my friends already know you
i feel like a kid
too shy to speak up so i keep it hid
oh butterflies
you steal my sleep each night

chorus
i need the sun to break
youve woken up my heart im shaking oh
my luck could change
been in the dark for weeks
and ive realized youre all i need i hope
that im not too late
i hope im not too late
