hey i love the night life yes i do its so much fun
and before you know it ah here comes the sun
sweetheart its been real but the thrill is gone
mmmhmm and inside us
is like a spirit that picked my house to haunt
but i know its there so i am nonchalant
now the question is just what do i want

well i want you
to run away with me and experience something new
anything youve already done just wont do
i want you

would a trip to a remoted island ease your mind
oh you look like a solitaire in the sunshine
i like her cause shes fun
shes fearless shes a friend of mine
oh and im not trying to say you need any help
you can have anything you want witcho bad self
i like her cause shes smart but shes still sexy
she is something else ooh

and thats why i want you
to run away with me and experience something new
anything youve already done just wont do
i want you
you might also likeand i want you
to tenderly and sincerely want me too
you can believe in me baby dont be cruel
i want you

oh one rarely finds a lady
that happens to be three times a lady
god is good but he took his time when he designed you baby
thats why i want you and
oh ill even quit my job
loving you ill make it my job
thank you lord thank you lord this is it my god
thank you lord this is it my god

and thats why i want you
and i want you
sail away and experience something new
anything youve already done just wont do
i want you
and i want you
to genuinely and sincerely want me too
you can believe in me baby dont be cruel
i want youembed"
