its a really big part
of a really big heart
are you really there

are you really there

its a really big van
for a really big band
theyre not goin anywhere
are you really there

are you really there

im sure sorry about your son
i heard he was a lot of fun
and im sorry bout the way
that he ran away

are you really there
its a really great place
way up here in outer space
you know its all just a race
you can let it go
you can let it go
you can let it go
you can let it goyou might also likeembed"
