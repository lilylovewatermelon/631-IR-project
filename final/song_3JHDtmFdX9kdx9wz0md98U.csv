if i had no more time
no more time left to be here
would you cherish what we had
was i everything that you were looking for
if i couldnt feel your touch
and no longer were you with me
id be wishing you were here
to be everything that ive been looking for

prechorus
i dont wanna forget the present is a gift
and i dont wanna take for granted
time you may have here with me
cause lord only knows another day heres not really guaranteed

chorus
so every time you hold me
hold me like this is the last time
every time you kiss me
kiss me like youll never see me again
every time you touch me
touch me like this is the last time
promise that youll love me
love me like youll never see me again
oh oh oh

how many really know what love is
many of you never will
do you know until you lose it
that its everything that we are looking for
when i wake up in the morning
and youre beside me
im so thankful that i found
everything that ive been looking for

prechorus
i dont wanna forget the present is a gift
and i dont wanna take for granted
the time you may have here with me
cause lord only knows another day heres not really guaranteed

chorus
so every time you hold me
hold me like this is the last time
every time you kiss me
kiss me like youll never see me again
every time you touch me
touch me like this is the last time
promise that youll love me
love me like youll never see me again
so every time you hold me
hold me like this is the last time
every time you kiss me
kiss me like youll never see me again
can you do that for me baby
every time you touch me
see we dont really know
touch me like this is the last time
say every day we never know
promise that youll love me
i want you to run with me
love me like youll never see me again
like youll never see me again
