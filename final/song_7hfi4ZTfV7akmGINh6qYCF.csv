when all the worst we fear lets fall its weight
when the gyre widens on and when the wave breaks
when st peter loses cool and bars the gates
when atlas acts the maggot makes his arms shake
when the birds are heard again in their singin
once atrocity is hoarse from voicin’ shame
and when the earth is trembling on some new beginnin
with the same sweet shock of when adam first came

prechorus
be be be be be
be as youve always been
be be be be be
be as you’ve always been
lover be good to me

chorus
be as youve always been lover be good to me
be like the love that discovered the sin lover be good to me
that freed the first man and will do so again
and lover be good to me lover be good to me
be that hopeful feeling when eden was lost lover be good to me
its been deaf to our laughter since the master was crossed lover be good to me
which side of the wall really suffers that cost
oh lover be good to me

when the man who gives the order
is born next time round on the boat sent back
when the bodies starvin at the border
are on tv givin people the sack
oh when the sea rises to meet us
oh when theres nothin left for you and i to do
oh when there’s nobody upstairs to receive us
when i have no kind words left love for you

prechorus
be be be be be
be as you’ve always been
be be be be be
be as youve always been
lover be good to me

chorus
ah be love in its disrepute lover be good to me
that scorches the hillside and salts every root lover be good to me
and watches the slowin’ and starvin of troops
and lover be good to me lover be good to me
be there and just as you stand lover be good to me
or be like the rose that you hold in your hand lover be good to me
that will grow bold in a barren and desolate land
oh lover be good to me
outro
love wont you be
love wont you be
be as you’ve always been
love wont you be
love wont you be
be as youve always been
love wont you be
love wont you be
be as youve always been
love wont you be
love wont you be
be as youve always been10embed"
