ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy thats probably tago
tahj money
pipe that shit up tnt
i remember shit bitch i felt so stuck bro
you feel me
niggas still get to the shit you know life comes with up and downs
you know what im sayin but
from where i was at you know i hit my licks even when your back against the
now i see that its just—

chorus
even when your back against the wall
phone keep ringing but no one you can call
just know its gon get rough its gon be tough
just when you had enough you cant give up
you gotta tell yourself
forget about the pain you felt
every move is a counted step
i know you got a little more left

verse
sometimes i sit and wonder will it change
it be hard not to go under tryna maintain
then i be feeling like they phone dont work both ways
cause they can call but i cant call no one for a thing
remember when they told me we was gon see better days
a week later deja died and now im full of pain
remember when they told me that we finally made it through the rain
a month later phone ring and now bang out in the grave
bitch its crazy it be tearing me apart
i be feeling like its no one there to talk
and i be feeling like its no one i can call
it be so much on my mind but i cannot get it off
but that money make me happy im so thankful for my team
cause now we statetostate i finally get to live my dream
so even though youre broken and your past is full of pain
you gotta keep moving towards better days

even when your back against the wall
phone keep ringing but no one you can call
just know its gon get rough its gon be tough
just when you had enough you cant give up
you gotta tell yourself
forget about the pain you felt
every move easy count each step
i know you gotta live one out
even when your back against the wall
phone keep ringing but no one you can call
just know its gon get rough its gon be tough
just when you had enough you cant give up
you gotta tell yourself
forget about the pain you felt
every move is a counted step
i know you got a little more left6embed"
