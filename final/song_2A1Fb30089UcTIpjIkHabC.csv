hey boys look where we are
this town aint big enough for the both of us
so get ready to run
this all goes to show
just how little you really know
about the way that we are

prechorus
i notice everything
like every single rumor that you spread today
youre never gonna change
lets set this record straight
i know all your dirty secrets that you kept from me
this conversations over

chorus
watch your step watch your step
this town can chew you up and spit you out
so pardon me but you shouldnt be so proud
watch your step watch your step
this town can chew you up and spit you out
so pardon me but you shouldnt be so proud

verse 2
youre all the same
you think that everyone around you cares about what you think
no one knows your name
its about that time
take everyone you know and get as far across my states line
as you possibly can
