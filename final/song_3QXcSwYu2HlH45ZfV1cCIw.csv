the hating
its pulled inside of me
the trying
to test my sanity
its in your waiting
its all make believe
and the ripping
the child within me

verse 1
cheating the time that i had left needing
my soul cause thats the bed giving
all that that i can give
controlling my mind that is diseased
holding my hate that is really scolding
the hand that keeps me fed
that keeps me fed
fed
that keeps me fed
fed
that keeps me

chorus
i feel it all come crashing down on me
i feel alone and torn apart
a wasted time to let it get to me
an angry mouth with a broken heart
see korn liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likeverse 2
searching for something that is safe
hurting my pride that is the test
turning my anger towards your flesh
rotting we hold the end of bag
spurting the blood thats on the bed
scolding the hand that keeps me fed
that keeps me fed
fed
that keeps me fed

chorus
i feel it all come crashing down on me
i feel alone and torn apart
a wasted time to let it get to me
an angry mouth with a broken heart

outro
the hating
its pulled inside of me
the trying
to test my sanity
its in you waiting
its all make believe
and the ripping
the child from within me
the hating
its pulled inside of me
the trying
to test my sanity
its in you waiting
its all make believe
and the ripping
the child from within me2embed"
