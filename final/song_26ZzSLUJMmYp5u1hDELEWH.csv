are from the start
the chosen few
out of the youth
are from the start
oh i’ll lie with you
out in the dew

verse 2
intimacy
real love true
regarding a deal
is it really true
i love you
is it really you
cause i
have some news for you

prechorus
you
will you ever preserve
will you ever exhume
will you watch petals shed
from flowers in bloom

chorus
nothing can live up to promise
nothing can stop its narrative
nothing in place of catalysts
and youll never be pure again
