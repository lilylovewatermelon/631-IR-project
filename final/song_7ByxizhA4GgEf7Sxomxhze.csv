okay

verse 1
how have things been well love now that you mention it
my folks still talk but they speak in these twoword sentences
im sayin too much but you know how it gets out here
no winter coat could keep out all the cold of your atmosphere

chorus
we once sang
retrograde wed shake the frame of your car
now i know your name but not who you are
its all okay there aint a drop of bad blood
its all my love you got all my love
im still out here with the pills and the dogs
if you need me dear im the same as i was
its all okay there aint a drop of bad blood
its all my lovе you got all my love
you got all my love

verse 2
write mе a list of how it is of how it was of how it has to be
you burrowed in under my skin what id give to have you out from me
but i still recall how the leather in your car feels
and at the end of it all i just hope that your scars heal

bridge
well i leaned in for a kiss thirty feet from where your parents slept
and i looked so confident babe i swear i was scared to death
my hands gripped the wheel i smiled stupid the whole way home
well those five words in my head you said ill never let you go

chorus
oh i sang
retrograde wed shake the frame of your car
now i know your name but not who you are
its all okay there aint a drop of bad blood
its all my love you got all my love
and its still out here with the pills and the dogs
wind chill this year stole the words from my tongue
its all okay there aint a drop of bad blood
its all my love you got all my love
you got all my love
you got all my love
you got all my love
you got all my love1embed"
