i got those jet pack blues
just like judy
the kind that makes june
feel like september
im the last one that youll ever remember
and im trying to find my peace of mind
behind these two white highway lines
when the city goes silent
the ringing in my ears gets violent

prechorus
shes in a long black coat tonight
waiting for me in the downpour outside
shes singing baby come home in a melody of tears
while the rhythm of the rain keeps time

chorus
and i remember baby come home i remember
baby come home i remember
baby come home i remember
baby come home i remember
did you ever love her do you know i remember
or did you never want to be alone i remember
and she was singing baby come home i remember
baby come home
see fall out boy liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likeverse 2
ive got those jet pack blues
fight off the light tonight
and just stay with me
honey dont you leave
dont you remember how we used to split a drink
it never mattered what it was i think
our heads were just that close
the sweetness never lasts you know
prechorus
shes in a long black coat tonight
waiting for me in the downpour outside
shes singing baby come home in a melody of tears
while the rhythm of the rain keeps time

chorus
and i remember baby come home i remember
baby come home i remember
baby come home i remember
baby come home i remember
did you ever love her do you know i remember
or did you never want to be alone i remember
and she was singing baby come home i remember
baby come home
bridge
shes in a long black coat tonight
waiting for me in the downpour outside
shes singing baby come home in a melody of tears
while the rhythm of the rain keeps time

chorus
and i remember baby come home i remember
baby come home i remember
baby come home i remember
baby come home i remember
did you ever love her do you know i remember
or did you never want to be alone i remember
and she was singing baby come home i remember
baby come home57embed"
