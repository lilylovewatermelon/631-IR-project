my name is kodak but you know that already
i dont want the wap baby i just want the fetty
polo to the socks homie this aint perry ellis

i dont want no head lately ive been getting becky
i just want the bread keep the peanut butter jelly

verse 1
she walked up to me i was by the bar she like hello
she rolled up on me i was rollin up my cigarillo
no i dont fuck with grabba leaf im breaking down the elpo
im always smoking loud i cant keep it on the lo
girl i dont like the way your booty flop its like jello
and now im rockin robin jeans remember wearing ecko
she say she just came to chill look bitch this aint a getty
i told that bitch get outta here act like you never met me
im up the road im lurking for them books no library

boy i need that green bought my green no asparagus
lord forgive me please cut the money i just cherished it
hit a mean lick i took that money and i buried it
she get on her knees omg thats embarrassing
i dont need no record deal but you gon hear my record still
me and dj on the pill we spinning like a ferris wheel
oh thats kodak black who they be talking bout thats the nigga
first i had to grow to be the man like a caterpillar
once that jit was old enough to thug it he was thuggin
he just found a strap now he clutch it like its nothing
i use to pour fours now i pour a whole dozen
bumped into lil wally in the hood hey cousin
