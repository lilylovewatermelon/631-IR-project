well be roadtripping rolling with the top down
southbound little bikinis in white sand

verse 1
i cant sleep gotta leave
the summer sun is starting to peak
through my window lettin me know
times up its time that we go
got a lead foot waiting and a pocket full of cash
cooler full of beer and a little something stashed
in the back of the car
so relax there aint a beach too far

chorus
well be roadtripping rolling with the top down
southbound little bikinis in white sand hell yeah
in a tank top gonna let the guns out
all about rocking that farmers tan
got the chev going seventy
all the girls looking heavenly
bunch of hey kick back and chill out ahead of me
gettin wild raisin hell and leavin this town
like there aint no stopping us now

verse 2
oh tellin no tellin
bet them lips taste like watermelon
got that daiquiri kiss the kind when it hits
makes you wanna get goin there wherever that is

well be roadtripping rolling with the top down
southbound little bikinis in white sand hell yeah
in a tank top gonna let the guns out
all about rocking that farmers tan

bunch of hey kick back and chill out ahead of me
gettin wild raisin hell and leavin this town
