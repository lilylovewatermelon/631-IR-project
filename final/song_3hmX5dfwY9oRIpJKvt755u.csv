we keep writing talking and planning but everythings changing
we all know what to do but no one does it
now this time has passed and full of regret
two in my heart have left me a while i stand alone
when they get back it wont be the same
never be the same

verse 2
my life  youve always been there
now youre gone and my heads spinning
left the childhood left the memories left the good times in the past
moving on  your time has run out
wishing the clock would stand still the world can wait
wasting away once again once lived as friends

chorus
as time pass us by regrets for the rest of my life
the ones who i confide were gone in the black of the night

verse 3
never will i forget you and all the memories past
so rarely i get to see your face
growing i looked to you in guidance
we knew that time would kill us but youre still so close to me
to me you were my life
to me you were my soul companion
now you are so far away
nothing can take away the times and the memories we had

come back  to the days when we were young
come back  to the days when nothing mattered
to the days when nothing mattered

chorus
and i feel time pass us by regrets for the rest of my life
the ones who i confide were gone in the black of the night

chorus
as time pass us by regrets for the rest of my life
the ones who i confide were gone in the black of the night2embed"
