the drops of rain they fall all over
this awkward silence makes me crazy
the glow inside burns light upon her
ill try to kiss you if you let me
this cant be the end

chorus tom delonge
tidal waves they rip right through me
tears from eyes worn cold and sad
pick me up now i need you so bad

postchorus mark hoppus
down down down down
down down down down
down down down down
down down down down it gets me so
down down down down
down down down down
down down down down
down down down down it gets me so

verse 2 tom delonge travis barker
your vows of silence fall all over
the look in your eyes makes me crazy
i feel the darkness break upon her
ill take you over if you let me
you did this

tidal waves they rip right through me
tears from eyes worn cold and sad
pick me up now i need you so bad

down down down down
down down down down it gets me so
down down down down
down down down down
down down down down
down down down down it gets me so
