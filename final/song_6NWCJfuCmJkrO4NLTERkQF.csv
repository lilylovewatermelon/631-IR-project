feeling like a bag of bones
shriveled up and cold
nineteen years old

verse 1
is draining out all of my insides
on the floor every night
supposed to make me feel alive
what would things be like
if i told you i wouldnt mind
swinging from the tree outside
would that be alright
hope you dont mind

hook
feeling like a bag of bones
shriveled up and cold
nineteen years old

verse 2
a train nearby reminds me im not the only one
who feels left alone
at least hes got some place to go
a train nearby reminds me im not the only one
who feels left alone
at least hes got some place to goyou might also like1embed"
