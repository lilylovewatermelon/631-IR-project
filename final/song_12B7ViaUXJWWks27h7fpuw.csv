i give my all my everything
anything you want ive tried to be
i tried god knows i tried
or am i stuck somewhere between
who i am and who i hope to be
am i fighting the good fight

chorus
keep pressing on
fight the good fight
fight what you know is wrong
keep pressing on
fight the good fight
fight what you know is wrong

verse 2
ive come so far to fall too fast
eyes forward i cant look back i try
god knows i try
i shift my eyes to the sky
in the distance see the horizon line
she waits for me
fighting the good fight

sometimes i fall in between
the nights blue moon and the shadows

what you know is wrong
ill keep fighting
fight on keep fighting the good fight
