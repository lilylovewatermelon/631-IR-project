ooh ah hey
hey
ooh ah
hey

verse 1
he comes from a foreign place an island far away
intrigues me with every move
til im breathless im helpless cant keep my cool
steals my heart when he takes my hand
and we dance to the rhythm of the band
i feel his fingertips grip my hips
and i slip as we dip into a state of bliss

prechorus
mama used to warn me to beware those latin lovers
she said i gave my heart too soon
and thats how i became your mother
i said ay mama you seem to forget im not in love yet
sweet talk dont win me over
but i realize big brown eyes can hypnotize when he says

chorus
i am full blood boricua
reads the tattoo on his arm oh
he tells me mami i need ya
and my heartbeat pumps so strong oh
getting lost in el ritmo
he whispers te quiero te quiero
i begin to give in with no hesitation
cant help my infatuation
its pure infatuation hey

skin the color of cinnamon
his eyes light up and i melt within melt within
feels so good it must be a sin
i cant stop what i started im givin in givin in
he brings life to my fantasies fantasies
sparks a passion inside of me inside of me
finds the words when i cannot speak
in the silence silence his heartbeat is music to me music to me

prechorus
mama used to warn me not to rush love with another
she said im not trying to lecture i just care about my daughter
ay mama you seem to forget
i never will let a man control my emotions
but when he smiles when he smiles
i feel like a little child when he says

chorus
i am full blood boricua
reads the tattoo on his arm whoa oh
he tells me mami i need ya
and my heartbeat pumps so strong so strong
getting lost in el ritmo
he whispers te quiero te quiero
i begin to give in with no hesitation
cant help my infatuation
its pure infatuation
bridge
caught between my mamas words and what i feel inside
im wanting to explore his world but part of me wants to hide
should i risk it cant resist it
this has caught me by surprise
should i let him take me to puerto rico
i cant hold back no more
lets go tonight
woo hey

interlude

never leave me lonely leave me lonely
papi hold me
say that you adore me oh
never let go
never leave me lonely

chorus
i am full blood boricua boricua
reads the tattoo on his arm on his arm
he tells me mami i need ya
and my heartbeat pumps so strong so strong
getting lost in el ritmo
he whispers te quiero te quiero oh
i begin to give in with no hesitation
cant help my infatuation
i cant help what im feelin im infatuated
its pure infatuation oh
