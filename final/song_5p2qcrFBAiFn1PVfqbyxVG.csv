verse 1
heres your standing o
boy you remind
me of a love that seemed so sublime
your kisses told me oh so many lies
shades on like
i am stuntin through the night
but im
just hiding puffy eyes
to keep the world
from knowing whats inside

and your words they had no meaning
how didnt i foresee this

heres your standing ovation
doctor i was too patient
even when you wasnt enough
im the one that taught you how to love
and boy i gave you all of me
the parts of affection you couldnt see
as you embrace her in your arms
give her my all
give her more than you gave to me
when you had nothing i gave
when you were weak i made you brave
you wanna leave me
with the scars on my heart
its funny how yall forget it all
