my insides all turned to ash so slow
and blew away as i collapsed so cold

prechorus
a black wind took them away from sight
and held the darkness over day that night

chorus
and the clouds above move closer
lookin so dissatisfied
but the heartless wind kept blowing blowing

verse 2
i used to be my own protection but not now
cause my path has lost direction somehow

prechorus
a black wind took you away from sight
and held the darkness over day that night

chorus
and the clouds above move closer
lookin so dissatisfied
and the ground below grew colder
as they put you down inside
but the heartless wind kept blowing blowing
you might also likebridge
so now youre gone and i was wrong
i never knew what it was like to be alone

outro
on a valentines day on a valentines day
on a valentines day on a valentines day
on a valentines day on a valentines day
i used to be my own protection but not now
on a valentines day on a valentines day
cause my mind has lost direction somehow
on a valentines day on a valentines day
i used to be my own protection but not now
on a valentines day on a valentines day
cause my mind has lost direction somehow18embed"
