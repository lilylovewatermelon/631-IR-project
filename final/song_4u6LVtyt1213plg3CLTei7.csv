hi my little naked man
i saw you there looking sad
face so lost petrified
timid twitch in your wide eyes
my oh my such strange supplies
many spoons all in a pile
did you bend ‘em with your mind
precious precious right right right

chorus
honey honey don’t you cry
it’s a ruse all these creatures are a lie
funny bunny it’s alright
i clap my hands and they’re gone into the night

verse 2
wiggle toes on wicker braids
hanging with their nails so frayed
mini fruits all bone dry
and a cape black tiedyed
i bet i can make you smile
in the pools of moonlight
watch this little trick of mine
say with me this tiny rhyme
you might also likechorus
honey honey don’t you cry
it’s a ruse all these creatures are a lie
funny bunny it’s alright
i clap my hands and they’re gone into the night

outro
take my hand take my hand take my hand take my hand
take my hand take my hand take my hand take my hand
take my hand take my hand take my hand take my hand
take my hand take my hand take my hand take my hand

take my hand take my hand take my hand take my hand
take my hand take my hand take my hand take my hand
take my hand take my hand take my hand take my hand
take my hand take my hand take my hand take my hand5embed"
