flashing fever from your eyes
hey baby

hold my hand
dont let me fall
youve such amazing grace
ive never felt this way

ohhh show me heaven
cover me
leave me breathless
ohh show me heaven please x3

here i go
im shaking just like the breeze
hey baby
i need your hand to steady me
im not denying
im frightened as much as you
though im barely touching you
ive shivers down my spine and it feels divine

ohh show me heaven
cover me
leave me breathless
ohh show me heaven please

ohh show me heaven

leave me breathless
ohh show me heaven please
