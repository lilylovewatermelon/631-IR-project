seven weeks have passed now since she left me
she shows her face to ask me how i am
she says the kids are fine and that they miss me
maybe i could come and babysit sometime

she says are you ok i was worried about you
can you forgive me i hope that you will be happy
i am so happy that i cannot stop crying
i am so happy i am laughing through my tears

chorus
i saw a friend of mine he said i was worried about you
i heard she had another man i wondered how you felt about i
i am so happy that i cannot stop crying
i am so happy i am laughing through my tears

verse 2
saw my lawyer mr good news he got me
joint custody and legal separation
i am so happy that i cannot stop crying
i am laughing through my tears
i am laughing through my tears

i took a walk alone last night
i looked up at the stars
to try to find an answer in my life

i chose a star for me i chose a star for him
i chose two stars for my kids and one star for my wife
something made me smile
something seemed to ease the pain
something about the universe and how it is all connected

the park is full of sunday fathers and melted ice cream
we try to do the best within the giving time
a kid should be with his mother everybody knows that
what can a father do but babysit sometimes

chorus
i saw that friend of mine he said you look different somehow
i said everybody is got to leave this darkness sometime
i am so happy that i cannot stop crying
i am laughing through my tears
i am laughing through my tears
i am so happy that i cannot stop crying
i am laughing through my tears
i am laughing through my tearsembed"
