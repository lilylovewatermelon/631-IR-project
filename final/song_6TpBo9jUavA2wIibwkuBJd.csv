heaven help the child who never had a home
heaven help the girl who walks the streets alone
heaven help the roses if the bombs begin to fall
heaven help us all
heaven help the black man if he struggles one more day
heaven help the white man if he turns his back away
heaven help the man who kicks the man who has to crawl
heaven help us all

chorus

heaven help us lord hear our call when we fall
oh yeah help us all

verse 2
heaven help the boy who wont reach twentyone
heaven help the man who gave that boy a gun
heaven help the people with their backs against the wall

heaven help us all yeah oh hurry

chorus
heaven help us all lord heaven help us all help us all
heaven help us lord hear our call when we fall
oh help us all
