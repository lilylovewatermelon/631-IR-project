bathroom stalls for the powder nose she loves
high heel shoes with the open toes she loves
shes got a good time wrapped in gold  she loves
for you for you
all red dress with the devil eyes she loves
so obsessed with the camera lights she loves
you love her but you cant deny she loves
the truth the truth

prechorus
she loves everybody
cant you tell by the signs
she loves everybody
she gets off all the time
its a dark philosophy
and it haunts her constantly
its a false alarm to me
shes a false alarm
