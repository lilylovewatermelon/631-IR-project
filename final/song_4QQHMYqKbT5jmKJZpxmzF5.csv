palm trees salt in the air
a little white sand under my chair
got a room key some pesos in my pocket alright
i traded my old boots for these flip flops
takin it easy like its my job
aint got a single bar on my phone
aint got any plans all i know

chorus
is theres a lot of rum in my coke rum in my coke
got a tiki bar bartender floatin my boat
a lotta blue in the sky blue in the sky
all the waves just wavin my worries goodbye
a lotta fish in the sea fish in the sea
oh theres a pretty one lookin at me alright

verse 2
theres a shrimp boat named silver linin
and a beach band with pretty good timin
got a couple scratches on my shades
but its all gonna be okay cause hey

chorus
theres a lot of rum in my coke rum in my coke
