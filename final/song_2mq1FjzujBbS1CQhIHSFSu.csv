take a look at my life all black
take a look at my clothes all black
like johnny cash all black
like the rolling stones want to paint it black
like the night that we met all black
like the colour of your dress all black
like the seats in my cadillac
i used to see red now its just all black

verse 1
as long as i could remember
i dreamed in black and white
as i grew up and the sun went down
i never felt more alright
my mother she used to tell me
son you better get to church
its a dark dark world and theres evil out there
and you know its only getting worse
yeah ive never been much for weddings
or anniversaries
but ill go to a funeral if im invited
any day of the week
some people say that i sound strange
some say that im not right
but i find beauty in this world
every single night

verse 2
i sat down at her table
at the end of the night
she was having black coffee and a cigarette
she wasnt wearing white
she said people tell me that im strange
they say that im not right
she said the only time i feel alive is in the dead of night
i think i found the one for me
