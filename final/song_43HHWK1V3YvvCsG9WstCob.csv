saddness swirls within me like the snow
ive frozen out the only friend ill ever know
theres no way i can win but i wish that i had been there for her long ago

lifes too short

anna
to be such an oblivious fool
so reckless that i couldnt see
lifes too short to be so desperate to be loved
that i only ever thought of me
i wish i saw things clearly
i guess im just not the sort
now all i know
is lifes too shortyou might also likeembed"
