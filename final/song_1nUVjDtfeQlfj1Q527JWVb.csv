verse 1
if i had the moment id capture that moment
you would be right here next to me
if i had the secret the secret to your love
i would place the treasure beneath my heart

prechorus
lock it all up and throw away the key
i would never give it it up
cause i was just a fool a fool for you
when i loved you so childishly

chorus
and i want it all back
i want it all i want it all girl i want it all back
i want it all back
i want it all i want it all girl i want it all
you never miss a good thing til its gone
i want it all now i want it all back

verse 2
if there is a green light and it starts to turn yellow
pedal to the floor cause i know your heart is turning red
if i had the minutes i would turn em into hours
and make love to your mind and not your body instead
