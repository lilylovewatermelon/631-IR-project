its in the air
so get your head right
crawling through the sand
making noise crackin dynamite
and ive been thinkin bout the past i cant ignore
nothing less nothing more
its all the same as before
im just feeding my appetite
im just feeding my appetite

verse 2
its in the ground
underneath
tied up tweaked out
inherently
and ive been swimming
in the new millennium
run run here i come
im just having some fun
im just feeding my appetite

prechorus
dont you know i broke the mold
like a hammer to a landmine
you better stick to what you know
cause i aint playing just to rewind

to outlast every outcast

verse 3
its all around
but youre in no shape
pacing back and forth
looking low feeling out of place
and i been watching every minute
like a casualty
bona fide misery
its no conspiracy
im just feeding my appetite
im just feeding my appetite

prechorus
dont you know i broke the mold
like a hammer to a landmine
you better stick to what you know
cause i aint playing just to rewind
i got it

im comin back

to outlast every outcast
