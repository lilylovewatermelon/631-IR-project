verse 1 julia lena
im in serious shit i feel totally lost
if im asking for help its only because
being with you has opened my eyes
could i ever believe such a perfect surprise
i keep asking myself wondering how
i keep closing my eyes but i cant block you out
wanna fly to a place where its just you and me
nobody else so we can be free
nobody else so we can be free

verse 2 julia lena
and im all mixed up feeling cornered and rushed
they say its my fault but i want her so much
wanna fly her away where the sun and rain
come in over my face wash away all the shame
when they stop and stare dont worry me
cause im feeling for her what shes feeling for me
i can try to pretend i can try to forget
but its driving me mad going out of my head
