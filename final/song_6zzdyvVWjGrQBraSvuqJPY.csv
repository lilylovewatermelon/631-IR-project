when i was young and alone in the world
you were there when i needed someone
to call my girl
and now youre my reality
and i wanna feel you close
but youre defeated baby
broken hurtin sufferin from a shattered soul
oh woah a shattered soul
oh ohoh

let me be there
let me be there for your heart
let me be there
i can be there til youre whole
you werent touched by a man in so long
cause the last time it was way too strong
let me be there
let me be there for your heart
let me love you
let me love you like you need
and ill make it
make it my responsibility
ill be there every step of the way uh
ill get you back on your feet
let me love you
let me love you like you need
and you can kick me
kick me to the curb
its okay baby
i promise that i felt worse
back then i was starry eyed
and now im so cynical
baby break me
kick me to the curb
oh woah
