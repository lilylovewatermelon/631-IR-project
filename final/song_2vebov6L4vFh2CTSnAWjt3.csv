countin the lines on a highway road
a mile one by one
flyin through the midnight rain
like a bullet from a gun
i lay down but i cant sleep
cause i still feel the band
still on a high from the crowd and the lights
with a cold one in my hand singin

chorus
here i go
down this road
another town another state
i wouldnt have it any other way
all i want
is to sing my songs
hearing that crowd keeps me goin
guitars are rockin wheels are rollin

verse 2
i step up the lights go down
i hear that first chord ring
its where i go to lose myself
forget about everything
its my home away from home
hanging with my friends
its a crazy life but every night
i get to do it again and again and again
