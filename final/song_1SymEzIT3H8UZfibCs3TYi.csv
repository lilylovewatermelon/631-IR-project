i blew things out of proportion now youre blue
put you in jail for something you didn’t do
i pinned your hands behind your back oh
thought i had reason to attack but no

prechorus 1
fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
chemistry til it blows up til there’s no us
whyd i have to break what i love so much
its on your face and im to blame i need to say

chorus
hey its all me in my head
im the one who burned us down
but its not what i meant
sorry that i hurt you
i dont wanna do i don’t wanna do this to you ooh
i don’t wanna lose i dont wanna lose this with you ooh
i need to say hey it’s all me just dont go
meet me in the afterglow

verse 2
its so excruciating to see you low
just wanna lift you up and not let you go
this ultraviolet morning light below
tells me this love is worth the fight oh
