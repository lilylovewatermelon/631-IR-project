i watched the proverbial sunrise
coming up over the pacific and
you might think im losing my mind
but i will shy away from the specifics

prechorus 1
cause i dont want you to know where i am
cause then youll see my heart
in the saddest state its ever been
and this is no place to try and live my life

refrain
stop right there thats exactly where i lost it
see that line well i never should have crossed it
stop right there well i never should have said
that its the very moment that i wish that i could take back

chorus
im sorry for
the person i became
im sorry that
it took so long for me to change
im ready to
be sure i never become that way again
cause who i am hates who ive been
who i am hates who ive been

i talk to absolutely no one
couldnt keep to myself enough
and the things bottled inside have finally begun
to create so much pressure that ill soon blow up
and i heard the reverberating footsteps
syncing up to the beating of my heart
and i was positive that unless
i got myself together i would watch me fall apart

prechorus 2
and i cant let that happen again
cause then youll see my heart
in the saddest state its ever been
this is no place to try and live my life

refrain
stop right there thats exactly where i lost it
see that line i never should have crossed it
stop right there i never should have said
that its the very moment that i wish that i could take back
stop right there thats exactly where i lost it
see that line well i never should have crossed it
stop right there well i never should have said
that its the very moment that i wish that i could take back
chorus
im sorry for
the person i became
im sorry that
it took so long for me to change
im ready to
be sure i never become that way again
cause who i am hates who ive been
who i am hates who ive been

bridge
who i am hates who ive been
and who i am will take the second chance you gave me
who i am hates who ive been
cause who ive been only ever made me

chorus
so sorry for
the person i became
im sorry that
it took so long for me to change
im ready to
be sure i never become that way again
cause who i am hates who ive been
who i am hates who ive been5embed"
