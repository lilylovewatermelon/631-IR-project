there was a time i used to look into my fathers eyes
in a happy home i was a king i had a golden throne
those days are gone now the memorys on the wall
i hear the songs from the places where i was born

prechorus
up on that hill across the blue lake
thats where i had my first heartbreak
i still remember how it all changed
my father said

chorus
dont you worry dont you worry child
see heavens got a plan for you
dont you worry dont you worry now
yeah

drop
dont you worry dont you worry child
see heavens got a plan for you
dont you worry dont you worry now
yeah

verse 2
there was a time i met a girl of a different kind
we ruled the world i thought id never lose her out of sight
we were so young i think of her now and then
i still hear the songs remindin me of a friend
