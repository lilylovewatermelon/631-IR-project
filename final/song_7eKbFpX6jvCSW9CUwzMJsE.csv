never thought that we would end up here
shouldve known it from the start
i know you mean it when you say you love me
but were trying way too hard
used to think that we would last forever
how could i have been so wrong
never thought id be the one to say this
what if our time has come and gone

chorus shawn mendes  astrid s
you you dont mean no harm
but youre stringing me along and i dont have the time to spare
and i im trying hard to breathe
but youre suffocating me this time im coming up for air
air air air air air air

verse 2 astrid s  shawn mendes
always tryna put your two cents in
and expecting me to change
tried to fix me up but im not broken
all you do is leave me stained
told you not to tie me down too quickly
take it slow its not a race
and you keep on tryna reel me in but
all i really need is space
