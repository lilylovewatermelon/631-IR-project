i see the bruise i see the truth
i see what he been doin to you
blood on the shoes whats his excuse
he says hes doing some new kung fu
you always use his bullshit excuse
but i see what he been doin to you

prechorus
whyd you put up with that shit
whyd you go back for that kiss
maybe it tastes like him when youve got tears on your lips
whyd you put up with that shit
why dont we pack and leave this
why do you smile when he cries
why do you cry when he wins

chorus
fight for me
we can leave im beggin please
on myon my knees go to hawaii
fight for me say we can leave im beggin please
on myon my knees
