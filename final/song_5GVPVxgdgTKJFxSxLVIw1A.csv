let me tell you a story about a boy and a girl
its kinda short kinda boring but the end is a whirl
they were just sixteen when the people were mean
so they didnt love themselves and now theyre gone
headstones on a lawn

verse 2
and when i was younger i knew a boy and a boy
best friends with each other but always wished they were more
cause they loved one another but never discovered
cause they were too afraid of what theyd say
moved to different states

chorus
oh and im afraid thats just the way the world works
it aint funny it aint pretty it aint sweet
oh and im afraid thats just the way the world works
but i think that it could work for you and me
just wait and see
its not the end of the story

verse 3
now its on to the sequel about me and my friend
both our parents were evil so we both made a bet
if we worked and we saved we could both run away
and wed have a better life and i was right
i wonder if shes alright

oh and im afraid thats just the way the world works
it aint funny it aint pretty it aint sweet
oh and im afraid thats just the way the world works
but i think that it could work for you and me
just wait and see
its not the end of the story
okay

bridge
and the movies always runnin in my head
all the people all the lovers all my friends
and i hope that they all get their happy end
in the end

chorus
oh and im afraid thats just the way the world works
it aint funny it aint pretty it aint sweet
oh and im afraid thats just the way the world works
but i think that it could work for you and me
just wait and see
it’s not the end of the story hmm hmm36embed"
