youre walkin on hot coals now you fuck
cause youre a joke yeah youre a hoax and now i found you out
cause you think the brains in your head are worth
breathing this smoke and itchy throats and being happy
and i could be your man all day and you could look inside my brain and see this one thing
but then it disappears like smoke and youre alone
i forget
how to play
the game
everyone
wants to come
along
i dont know
where you are

one two three okay
youre starting to look really weird oh yeah
your face is out of place and i cant make you out
and i forget just what you said
yeah its not clear it was about fear and getting out of here
but youre okay with me
