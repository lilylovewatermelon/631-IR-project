when you think of all the late nights
lame fights over the phone
wake up in the mornin with someone
but feelin alone

refrain
a heart is drawn around your name
in someones handwriting not mine
sneakin out into town
holdin hands just killin time

prechorus
your past and mine are parallel lines
stars all aligned and they intertwined
and taught you
the way you call me baby
treat me like a lady
all that i can say is

chorus
all of the girls you loved before ooh
made you the one ive fallen for
every deadend street led you straight to me
now youre all i need im so thankful for
all of the girls you loved before
but i love you more

when i think of all the makeup
fake love out on the town ooh
cryin in the bathroom for some dude
whose name i cannot remember now

refrain
secret jokes all alone
no ones home sixteen and wild ooh
breakin up makin up
leave without sayin goodbye ooh

prechorus
and just know that
its everything that made me
now i call you baby
its why youre so amazing

chorus
all of the girls you loved before ooh
made you the one ive fallen for
every deadend street led you straight to me
now youre all i need im so thankful for
all of the girls you loved before
but i love you more
bridge
your mother brought you up loyal and kind
teenage love taught you theres good in goodbye
every woman that you knew brought you here
i wanna teach you how forever feels

chorus
like the girls you loved before ooh
made you the one ive fallen for
every deadend street deadend street led you straight to me straight to me
now youre all i need all i need im so thankful for
all of the girls you loved before
but i love you more
