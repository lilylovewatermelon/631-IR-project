its four oclock in the mornin
and she aint feelin right
im on a first class trip
through this place called life
i dont know what to do
cause my bodys still shakin
i know its time to man up
and start my education
i need someone to call on
so i called on my best friend
i said bro i cant take it
he said boy stop trippin
so i hung up the phone
packed my shit and got right
i know what i gotta do now
be a man and face life
