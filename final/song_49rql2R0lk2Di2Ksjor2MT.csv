its shit like this i kick to these rich white kids
who just might see how fucked up their sick life is
oops i did it again didnt i
my shits harder to figure out than what britneys tit size is
ooh i probably pissed you off again didnt i bitch
so what you and christina gaguilera kiss my grits
you know how many shits i give i wish i did
so i can quit giving these twisted little kids ideas
this just in britney just dissed justin
she just fucked ben got titfucked and dicksucked him
if affleck can get his ass licked how come i cant
shit god damn bitch im rich i cant understand this

as close as im ever gonna get to hitting it from the back
and shit when it comes to that i hit harder from the back

just give me one more chance britney hit me one more time
let me know whats on your mind whitney give me one more line
