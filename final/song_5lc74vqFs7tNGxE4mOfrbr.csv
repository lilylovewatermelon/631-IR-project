im on the guest list down at pauls baby grand
that hipster doorman he dont know who i am
but my studied aloofness is proof i belong so i pass
some girls are pieced like krylon bombs on the walls
some cut the line to cut the lines in the stalls
on the floor is the border between paradise and the fall

chorus
im leaving los feliz
day after tomorrow
im over the scenesters
im leaving los feliz
day after tomorrow
im leaving los feliz

verse 2
i cruise the room without attracting a glance
my ksubi jeans are more like armor than pants
but i dont want to go just yet so i suppose i should dance
the music wobbles between rapture and dread
like a divine name that can never be said
and i shoot a pretend documentary inside my head

chorus
im leaving los feliz
day after tomorrow
im over the scenesters
im leaving los feliz
day after tomorrow
im leaving los feliz

im young enough to know im too young to quit
im old enough to want to get over it
but the yearning is timeless and mine is as deep as the pit

chorus
im leaving los feliz
day after tomorrow
im over the scenesters
im leaving los feliz
day after tomorrow
im leaving los feliz1embed"
