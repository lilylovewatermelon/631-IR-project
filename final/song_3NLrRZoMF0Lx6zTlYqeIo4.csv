a hundred days have made me older
since the last time that i saw your pretty face
a thousand lies have made me colder
and i dont think i can look at this the same
but all the miles that separate
disappear now when im dreaming of your face

chorus
im here without you baby
but youre still on my lonely mind
i think about you baby
and i dream about you all the time
im here without you baby
but youre still with me in my dreams
and tonight its only you and me yeah

verse 2
the miles just keep rolling
as the people leave their way to say hello
ive heard this life is overrated
but i hope that it gets better as we go
oh yeah yeah

chorus
im here without you baby
but youre still on my lonely mind
i think about you baby
and i dream about you all the time
im here without you baby
but youre still with me in my dreams
and tonight girl its only you and me yeah
