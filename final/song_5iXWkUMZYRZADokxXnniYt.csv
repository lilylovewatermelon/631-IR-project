i woke up stronger than ever
driven by big waves of fire
to run and yell all the way
nothing can hurt me today

chorus
theres a magic inside
just waiting to burst out
the world is a goldmine
that will melt tomorrow

verse 2
i just cant recognize myself
tears of joy run all over my face
my sensations reach the limit
nothing can hurt me today

chorus
theres a magic inside
just waiting to burst out
the world is a goldmine
that will melt tomorrow

outro
living for living for a thrill
just waiting just waiting
just waiting just waiting
just waiting just waiting
just waiting just waiting
just waiting just waitingyou might also like9embed"
