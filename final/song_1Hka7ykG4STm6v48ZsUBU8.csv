verse
its just the thug life baby the bottom made me crazy
daddy gone and mama couldnt save me
so hard times made me i done spinned the block in my mercedes
reminiscing on the times we didnt have shit
even was i broke i knew that i wasnt average
mixed with passion aint no recipe
this thug life shit might be the death of me
and i say that selfishly rellymade
because im grown now kids of my own now
mama hold on now your baby boy strong now
money getting long now got a reason to live
they dont know the route that we took to get here
cause where i come from they aint chasing a dream
where i come from it aint safe to believe
where i come from its a race to eighteen
they jump straight off the porch and land straight in the streets goddamn
heard you keep the glizzy in your pants goddamn
i heard you have plans to be the man goddamn
i wont let a nigga get a chance thug life bitch until the end end

come and take a walk in my shoes if you can
