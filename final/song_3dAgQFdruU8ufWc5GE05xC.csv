shes a yellow pair of running shoes
a holey pair of jeans
she looks great in cheap sunglasses
she looks great in anything
shes i want a piece of chocolate
take me to a movie
shes i cant find a thing to wear
now and then shes moody

verse 2
shes a saturn with a sunroof
with her brown hair ablowing
shes a soft place to land
and a good feeling knowing
shes a warm conversation
that i wouldnt miss for nothing
shes a fighter when shes mad
and shes a lover when shes loving

chorus
and shes everything i ever wanted
and everything i need
i talk about her i go on and on and on
cause shes everything to me

shes a saturday out on the town
and a church girl on sunday
shes a cross around her neck
and a cuss word cause its monday
shes a bubble bath and candles
baby come and kiss me
shes a one glass of wine
and shes feeling kinda tipsy

verse 4
shes the giver i wish i could be
and the stealer of the covers
shes a picture in my wallet
and my unborn childrens mother
shes the hand that im holding
when im on my knees and praying
shes the answer to my prayer
and shes the song that im playing

chorus
and shes everything i ever wanted
and everything i need
i talk about her i go on and on and on
cause shes everything to me
verse 5
shes the voice i love to hear
someday when im ninety
shes that wooden rocking chair
i want rocking right beside me
everyday that passes
i only love her more
yeah shes the one
that id lay down my own life for

verse 6
and shes everything i ever wanted
and everything i need
shes everything to me
yeah shes everything to me

outro
everything i ever wanted
and everything i need
shes everything to me7embed"
