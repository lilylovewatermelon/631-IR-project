i wake up every morning and do what the fuck i want
and i dont deal with nobody til i smoke my blunt
i take his last meal if he assuming im a punk
you get yo ass caught inside my cage then we done
these niggas talking shit with no metals on they arms
but bitch im laid out whole suit made of armor
captain mobile suit let blood wings fly out my armor
let me catch him slipping ima drag him to his momma
i cant ever fall boy i run the whole tundra
you bring a fool to me ill breathe some ice in his stomach
now he cant bare the pain you see blood when he vomit
i told this boy ahead of time that he aint even want it
now ill be smoking blunts that make me think im in dubai
and im still moving forward with my fleet on the right
my whole squad healthy looking up to the sky
and we gon sail forever we wont ever lose a fight
nowadays labels hit us up and we know why
cuz we killing all them signed artists on sight
and bitch we gon decline til the situation right
i let hollow squad the coffin fleet sink a nigga life
