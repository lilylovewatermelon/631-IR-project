shes the dirty daughter of the devil
teach her something new then send her right back
since we seem to share everything in this bubble
i hope she does that thing she likes shell want to impress you
do anything for a little attention
my time is up your time is due
so dont be shy of your intentions
oh i wont mind no i wont trip
no dealing with my jealousness
dig right in and grab those hips
pull right in and let it rip
take a ticket for your number
take a ticket for what your number
if i find the one who means the world to me
the truth wont come so easily
round and round she goes she keeps it a secret but we all knowyou might also likeembed"
