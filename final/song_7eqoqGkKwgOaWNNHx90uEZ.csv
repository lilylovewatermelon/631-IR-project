verse 1
round your city round the clock
everybody needs you
no you cant make everybody equal
although you got beaucoup family
you dont even got nobody bein honest with you
breathe til i evaporated
my whole body see through
transportation handmade g
and i know it better than most people
i dont trust em anyways
you cant break the law with them
get some gushy have a calm night
shooters killin left and right
workin through your worst night
if i get my money right
you know i wont need you
and i tell you bitch

every day patches the night up
on god you should match it its that ko
no white lighters til i fuck my twentyeighth up fire
1998 my family had that acura fire
oh the legend fire
kept at least six discs in the changer
back when boswell and percy had it active massive
couple bishops in the city buildin mansions massive
all the reverends
preachin selfmade millionaire status
when we could only eat at shoneys on occasion
after trina hit i had to transfer campus
your apartment out in houstons where i waited
stayin with you when i didnt have a address
fuckin on you when i didnt own a mattress
workin on a way to make it outta texas every night

chorus
droppin baby off at home before my night shift yeah
you know i cant hear none of that spend the night shit
that kumbaya shit
want to see nirvana but dont wanna die yet
wanna feel that nana though could you come by
fuck with me after my shift
know them boys wanna see me broke down
see me bummed out stressed out
thats just every day shit
shut the fuck up i dont want your conversation
rollin marijuana thats a cheap vacation
every day shit every day shit
