you know some times me and my lady have these crazy fights and when we do it makes me wonder
are were ever going to get it right

verse 1
when i think about leaving i think about me
what my life would be like if i were back to being free
go where i want to go do what i want to do wouldnt have a soul i had to answer to
when i think about leaving i think about me

interlude
you know i got a friend him and his wife just couldnt see eye to eye he had all he could
stand one day and just packed up and said goodbye

verse 2
when i think about leaving i think about him
that little apartment cross town hes living in
got an old corvette got a new girlfriend but only sees his kids every other weekend
when i think about leaving oh i think about him

interlude
i never will forget her face or the day she told me about her dad how he walked out on her
and her mom when she was just a kid

verse 3
when i think about leaving oh i think about her
only five years old and her heart filled up with hurt
with her little arms wrapped around his neck saying daddy where you going are you coming
back
when i think about leaving i think about her
see kenny chesney liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likeyou know the truth is most of the time things were really great and i know we got something
special
when i think about leaving i think about us
how we build this love we share on faith and trust honest way we talk tender way we touch
all those nights we spent making love
when i think about leaving oh i think about us

when i think about leaving i think again
even though that thought crosses my mind every now and then
in my heart i know i would never leave theres nowhere else on earth i would rather be
when i think about leaving i think again

outro
when i think about leaving
when i think about leaving
when i think about leaving i think againembed"
