verse 1
you such a fuckin lame
its what they used to yell back in seventh grade
my mama said shed get me that new jacket when the cost go down
hit the office stole some tommy hil from lost and found
not bad for a family of foster child
lookin fly man im flossin now
but them niggas saw through me
are you serious what is this
took the jacket off third period ellipsis
listening to sky is the limit on my walkman
thinking if biggie can make it through it man then i can
dopeboy swag i always wanted that
but my persona was always more of that arthur ashe
but no love for the son of a commuter who was a radio head
and okay at them computers at the post office
its funny how you smoke niggas then you start coffins
all my people need throat lozenge
my fear is dead ambition drove the hearse
but niggas got me feelin i aint black enough to go to church
culture shock at barber shops cause i aint hood enough
we all look the same to the cops aint that good enough
the black experience is black and serious
cause being black my experience is no one hearin us
white kids get to wear whatever hat they want
when it comes to black kids one size fits all

verse 2
the reason that they say im nothin what they seen or heards
the same reason will smith always opposite latino girls
they only see you how they wanna see you
til you make them see you in some other way
im trippin off the other day
cause god knows what these white kids sayin dude
youre not not racist cause the wires in your netflix queue
subtle racism its hard to pin it
cause youd only understand if you were me for just a minute
this one kid said somethin that was really bad
he said i wasnt really black because i had a dad
i think thats kinda sad
mostly cause a lot of black kids think they should agree with that
if youre a father you should stick around if you could
cause even if youre bad at it you could tiger woods or mj
we warriors we all need senseis
change everything that weve done so far
i dont mean makin bet ter
i mean just the way that we see each other
i wont stop until they say
james franco is the white donald glover
yeah these niggas wanted cookie but instead i gave em loch ness
sick boi for life my swag is in a hospice
aimin for the throne jay and ye said to watch that
they ask me what im doin and i said im stealin rock back
