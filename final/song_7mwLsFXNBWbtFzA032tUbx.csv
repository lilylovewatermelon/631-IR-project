verse 1
cause the sex was good you had my mind
and i let you come back every time
you would violate and cross the line
and you knew that i would be the type to
always wait so patiently thinkin
you was comin home to me
well damn i never heard the keys
or felt your taps sayin are you asleep
rewind that
cause the sex was good you had my mind
and i i let you come back every time
you would violate and cross the line
and you knew that i would be the type to
always wait so patiently thinkin
you was comin home to me
well damn i never heard the keys
or felt your taps sayin are you asleep

chorus
dont wanna play house no more
youre so dumb to think you gon marry me
i got to be out my mind to think i need someone to carry me
ive done enough cryin cryin cryin cryin cryin cryin
its time to say bye bye bye

time i choose my clothes
choose my friends be with my family
they been askin girlfriend where you been
we aint seen you in weeks
been chasin this fool around
thinkin he gon hold me down
i would follow his lead
thinkin i would be the one he keep around
when i aint need it not your finance
and all that i needed real commitment
i really couldnt see it not the real man
you said you would be in this relationship
so many men think these men
that all a girl needs they think
is to be sold a dream a dream
but i wont fall for it

chorus
dont wanna play house no more
youre so dumb to think you gon marry me
i got to be out my mind to think i need someone to carry me

verse 3
you turned your back and back i came running
but the simple fact is that you aint want me
done enough lying and crying to myself
nothing left to do but move
what else can i do but leave
i believed that you would marry me but now i gotta breeze
i bes with lt when you come to your senses
but then its too late
thats always how it be
catch me with the bs on the wheels giuseppes on the hills
shoulda marc jacob fe fe bagged me when you had me
next dude will gladly pick up where you left off
ice me wife me you aint gonna have me

chorus
cryin cryin cryin cryin cryin cryin
its time to say bye bye bye
its time i do something for me
dont wanna play house no more
youre so dumb to think you gon marry me
to think that you would marry me
i got to be out my mind to think
i need someone to carry me
ive done enough cryin cryin cryin cryin cryin cryin
its time to say bye bye bye
its time i do something for me
dont wanna play house no more
youre so dumb to think you gon marry me
i got to be out my mind to think i need someone to carry me
ive done enough cryin cryin cryin cryin cryin cryin
its time to say bye bye bye
