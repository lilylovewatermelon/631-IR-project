girl i know i don’t know you
but your pretty little eyes so blue
are pulling me in
like the moon on your skin
i’m so glad you trusted me
to slide up on this dusty seat
and let your hair down
get out of town

prechorus 1
got the stars coming out over my hood
and all i know now is its going good

chorus
you got your hands up
you’re rocking in my truck
you got the radio on
you’re singing every song
i’m set on cruise control
i’m slowly losing hold
of everything i got
you’re looking so damn hot

postchorus
and i don’t know what road we’re on
or where we’ve been
from staring at you girl
all i know is i don’t want this night to end
see luke bryan liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likeverse 2
going to cuss the morning when it comes
cause i know that the rising sun
ain’t no good for me
cause you’ll have to leave
going to make the most of every mile
do anything to make your smile
land on my lips
get drunk on your kiss

prechorus 2
clock on the dash says 335
there’s plenty of gas and the night’s still alive

chorus
you got your hands up
you’re rocking in my truck
you got the radio on
you’re singing every song
i’m set on cruise control
i’m slowly losing hold
of everything i got
you’re looking so damn hot

postchorus
and i don’t know what road we’re on
or where we’ve been
from staring at you girl
all i know is i don’t want this night to end
instrumental break

chorus
you got your hands up
you’re rocking in my truck
you got the radio on
you’re singing every song
i’m set on cruise control
i’m slowly losing hold
of everything i got
you’re looking so damn hot

postchorus
and i don’t know what road we’re on
or where we’ve been
from staring at you girl
all i know is i don’t want this night to end
i don’t want this night to end
no i don’t want this night to end7embed"
