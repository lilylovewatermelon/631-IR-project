down came the rain and washed the spider out
out came the sun and dried up all the rain
and the itsy bitsy spider went up the spout again
pounding sound
ralph whats that sound sounds big
everybody go so big
children so big
ralph well parking his harley davidson in the alley behind the garage
wearing a black leather biker jacket with a tattoo of a fly on his arm
and a tattoo of a fly on his other arm
and a tattoo of a fly on his other arm
and a tattoo that said mom on the other arm
it was the great big hairy spider and you know what happened
children what
ralph the great big hairy spider went up the waterspout
down came the rain and washed the spider out
out came the sun and dried up all the rain
and the great big hairy spider went up the spout again
tiny sounds
ralph whats that sound sounds tiny
everybody go shhhh for the baby
children shhhh
ralph well peering out from under a leaf in the backyard
so small you could barely see her
wearing a size xxxxxxxxxxsmall old town school of folk music tshirt
was the teensy weensy spider and you know what happened
children what
ralph the teensy weensy spider went up the waterspout
down came the rain and washed the spider out
out came the sun and dried up all the rain
and the teensy weensy spider went up the spout again
and you know what that song is about
