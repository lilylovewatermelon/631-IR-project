its been a long time
and seeing the shape of your name
still spells out pain
it wasnt right
the way it all went down
looks like you know that now

chorus
yes i got your letter
yes im doing better
it cut deep to know ya right to the bone
yes i got your letter
yes im doing better
i know that its over i dont need your
closure your closure

verse 2
dont treat me like
some situation that needs to be handled
im fine with my spite
and my tears and my beers and my candles
i can feel you smoothing me over

chorus
yes i got your letter
yes im doing bettеr
it cut deep to know ya right to the bone
yes i got your lеtter
yes im doing better
i know that its over i dont need your
closure your closure
your closure your closure

i know im just a wrinkle in your new life
staying friends would iron it out so nice
guilty guilty reaching out across the sea
that you put between you and me
but its fake and its ohso unnecessary

chorus
yes i got your letter
yes im doing better
it cut deep to know ya right to the bone
yes i got your letter
yes im doing better
i know that its over i dont need your
closure closure your closure
