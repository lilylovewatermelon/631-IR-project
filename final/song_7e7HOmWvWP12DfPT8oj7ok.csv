i stare at the girl in the mirror
tshirt torn up jeans no beauty queen
but the way that you see me
you get underneath me
and all my defenses just fall away
fall away

chorus
i am beautiful with you
even in the darkest part of me
i am beautiful with you
make it feel the way its supposed to be
youre here with me
just show me this and ill believe
i am beautiful with you

verse 2
i stand naked before you now
no walls to hide behind
so here am i see all of my scars
still here you are
i bare my soul and im not afraid
not afraid

chorus
i am beautiful with you
even in the darkest part of me
i am beautiful with you
make it feel the way its supposed to be
youre here with me
just show me this and ill believe
i am beautiful with you
