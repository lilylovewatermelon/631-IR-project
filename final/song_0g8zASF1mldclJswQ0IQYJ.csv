ey
im tired of waiting
put it on the mantle or trash it face it
itll never happen unless we make it
i guess you could say that im just impatient
wasting light in a vacant place is a space a timeline i can taste
and i find my eyesight often raised to embrace a fading skyline
wait
let me catch up a little bit
ive been baited on a breath i held to reel in the bigger fish
im insatiable at best and my patience is iffy
debilitatingly self critical with narcissistic tendencies
one more last time
yes please thank you
whats another hair of the dog that spanks you
just another customary tough luck bad news some one in cemetery digging up a sad tune
what little ditty is playing through his head as he drudges out the humble work of making his own bed
which lullaby to lay rockabye baby when the bough breaks
classical or heavy metal
soft and sweet or fast paced
maybe just the echoes of the sentiments he misplaced in instances that distanced him from figuring his which ways
you could ask him but i doubt out he even knows and if he does he’ll probably take it with him down into that hole
shit

hook x2
lazy days
castaways and hazy haste
an absence in the afternoons from basking with the vain and dazed
ambrosia in the amylase
ashes in the aftertaste
you might also likebridge
complacent but a skipping stone throw from comfortability
trying to maintain the latter while i squash the formers killing me
i swear
that ill probably be the death of me
in fact i swear upon my life that ill be the death of me
fairs fair
point blank or poison in the recipe
some choices will last you for more or less a century
either way when i finally retired of flying
i wanna go out like a second hand lion

verse 2
tired of tired tonight i’m stapling open both my eye lids
wide
tight and wired ill doodle on some cataracts for blind spots
admittedly ignorant but i know what im missing
billions of simians kissing a ringed fist in submission
ill kill the king
and wouldn’t think to fill the position uphold my kindred as the pillars of this intimate system
well still sing
even when the neighbours are wincing because they bump a lot of trash that i put with willingly
it’s win win
just another print in asymmetry so lets swig another batch of the mix and match chemistry
clink clink
to fill another glass with memory
do what thou wilt
up like a stem down like a hilt
hook x3
lazy days
castaway in hazy haste
an absence in the afternoons from basking with the vain and dazed
ambrosia in the amylase
ashes in the aftertaste1embed"
