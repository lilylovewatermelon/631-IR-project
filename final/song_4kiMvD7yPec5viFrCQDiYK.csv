henrietta we got no flowers for you
just these three miserable cunts
sitting on the back seat tapping on the off beat
we know you love us and you probably do
although your husband may cut us
hes an animal though anything is possible

prechorus
give us a kiss and maybe we can go out
its hard to miss you when you follow us about
buy us some shoes and maybe take us for cola
well get you there in some filthy big gondola

chorus
and its clean out the bank and bump off your daddy you can
come live with us amongst the hasbeens and the addicts these are
crazy times down at costello music you can
answer the phone and talk anyway you choose it come on

postchorus
oh come on
oh come on
ohohohohohohohoh
woohoohoohoo
