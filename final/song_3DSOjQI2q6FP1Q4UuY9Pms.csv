well we always seem to worry
lifes becoming such a flurry
cant you see that theres light in the dark
nothings quite what it seems in the city of dreams

verse 2
rainbows tinted with gold
all the stories weve been told
still her love is yours to behold
nothings quite what it seems in the city of dreams

chorus
you say its not the real world
though it seems so real to me
and i know that were never turnin back
can you see what i see girl

postchorus
i had a vision
of festive days
shes like an eagle
in the misted haze oh

verse 2
and sit and wonder at the sky
watch the river flowing by by
now it ends and were here at the start
nothings quite what it seems in the city of dreams

oh you say its not the real world
though it seems so real to me
and i know that were never turnin back
can you see what i see girl

postchorus
i had a vision
of festive days oh
shes like an eagle
in the misted haze oh
oh break my chains girl
show me to the land oh
where people live together
try to understand
