lately ive been looking through the windows of my soul
and i can see theres not much left to hold
just an empty space surrounded by the pieces of
a badly broken heart thats forgotten how to love

chorus
what my heart needs is a womans touch
a tender hand to fix it up
its rough and ragged edges sure could use some love
what my heart needs is a womans touch

verse 2
when i look in the mirror the only thing i see
are traces of the man i used to be
late at night i hear it it cannot be denied
a lonely voice is crying out from somewhere deep inside

chorus
what my heart needs is a womans touch
a tender hand to fix it up
its rough and ragged edges sure could use some love
what my heart needs is a womans touch
what my heart needs is a womans touch
a tender hand to fix it up
its rough and ragged edges sure could use some love
what my heart needs is a womans touch

yeah its rough and ragged edges
sure could use some love
what my heart needs is a womans touch

outro
what my poor heart needs is a womans touch
a womans touchembed"
