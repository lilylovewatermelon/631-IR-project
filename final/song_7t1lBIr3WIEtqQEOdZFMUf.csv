verse 1
its like 09 in your basement and im in love with nebby
and i still love her but it fell through because i wasnt ready
and your back hurt and your neck hurt and you smokin heavy
and i sit next to you and i lecture you because those are deadly
and then you ash it and we argue about spendin money on bullshit
and you tell me im just like my father my one button you push it
now its fuck you i hate you ill move out in a heartbeat
and i leave out and you call me and you tell me that you sorry
and you love me and i love you and your heart hurts mine does too
and its just words and they cut deep but its our world its just us two
i see painkillers on the kitchen counter i hate to see it all hurt so bad
but maybe i wouldnt have worked this hard if you were healthy and it werent so bad uh
maybe i should walk up the street
and try and get a job at the bank
cause leave it up to me j and neeks
well probably end up robbin a bank
then wayne calls up my phone
conversation wasnt that long
gets me a flight to houston in the morning
oh its my time yeah its on

and almost get a grammy off of that thing

and im still in love cause when its that real is when it doesnt fade
and my father living in memphis now he cant come this way
over some minor charges and child support that just wasnt paid damn
boohoo sad story black american dad story

i remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
damn your house felt like the hamptons
for all of my summer romances
i never really had no one like you man this all new shit
made the world i know bigger
changed the way that i viewed it
had all this fightin going on at the crib
you would calm me down when i lose it
told you i think im done acting
now im more in touch with the music
you said either way id be a star i could go so far
talked to me then you got to me
then youd toss the keys and loan me your car yeah
just a young kid in a droptop lexus hopin that i dont get arrested
just another kid thats going through life so worried that i wont be accepted
but i could do anything
you said that and you meant that
you took me places you spent that
they said no we went back
checks bounced but we bounced back
i put all the money in your accounts back
and i thank you i dont know where id really be without that
it worked out man you deserve it
