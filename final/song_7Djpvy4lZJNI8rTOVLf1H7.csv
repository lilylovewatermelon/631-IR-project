verse 1
youre walkin down a horror corridor
its almost four in the mornin and youre in a
nightmare its horrible right theres the coroner
waiting for ya to turn the corner so he can corner ya
youre a goner hes onto ya
out the corner of his cornea he just saw ya run
all you want is to rest cause you cant run anymore youre done
all he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
while everybody is watching in the party applauding it
here i sit while im caught up in deep thought again
contemplating my next plot again
swallowin a klonopin while im noddin in and out on the ottoman
at the ramada inn holding onto the pill bottle then
lick my finger and swirl it round the bottom
and make sure i got all of it
wake up naked at mcdonalds with
blood all over me dead bodies behind the counter shit
guess i mustve just blacked out again—not again

its 3 am in the mornin
put my key in the door and
bodies layin all over the floor and
i dont remember how they got there
but i guess i mustve killed em killed em
i said its 3 am in the mornin
put my key in the door and
bodies layin all over the floor and
i dont remember how they got there
but i guess i mustve killed em killed em

verse 2
sitting nude in my living room its almost noon
i wonder whats on the tube maybe theyll show some boobs
surfing every channel until i find hannah montana then
i reach for the aloe and lanolin bust all over the wall panellin
dismantlin every candle on top of the fireplace mantel and
grab my flannel and my bandana then
kiss the naked mannequin man again
you can see him standin in my front window if you look in
im just a hooligan whos used to using hallucinogens
causin illusions again brain contusions again
cutting and bruising the skin razors scissors and pins
jesus when does it end phases that i go through
dazed and im so confused
days that i dont know who gave these molecules to
me what am i gon do
hey the prodigal son the diabolical one
very methodical when i slaughter them
chorus
its 3 am in the mornin
put my key in the door and
bodies layin all over the floor and
i dont remember how they got there
but i guess i mustve killed em killed em
i said its 3 am in the mornin
put my key in the door and
bodies layin all over the floor and
i dont remember how they got there
but i guess i mustve killed em killed em

bridge
she puts the lotion in the bucket
it puts the lotion on the skin
or else it gets the hose again
she puts the lotion in the bucket
it puts the lotion on the skin
or else it gets the hose again

verse 3
i cut and i slash slice and gash last night was a blast
i cant quite remember when i had that
much fun off a halfpint of the jack my last vic andahalf
a flashlight up kim kardashians ass
i remember the first time i dismembered a family member
december i think it was i was having drinks with my cousin
i wrapped him in christmas lights
pushed him into the stinkin tub cut him up into pieces
and just when i went to drink his blood
i thought i oughta drink his bathwater that oughta be fun
thats when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun
the sight of blood excites me that might be an artery son
your bloodcurdling screams just dont seem to bother me none
its 3 am and here i come so you should probably run
a secret passageway around here man theres got to be one
oh no theres probably none
he can scream all that he wants top of his lungs
but aint no stopping me from chopping him upup cause…
chorus
its 3 am in the mornin
put my key in the door and
bodies layin all over the floor and
i dont remember how they got there
but i guess i mustve killed em killed em
i said its 3 am in the mornin
put my key in the door and
bodies layin all over the floor and
i dont remember how they got there
but i guess i mustve killed em killed em
