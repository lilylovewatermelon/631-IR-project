and were stomping our feet
to the electric magnetic mechanical beat
weve got light bulbs for eyes
and aluminum noses
were busting chillin moves with our robot poses
busting chillin moves with our robot poses
phinedroids and ferbots word
phinedroids and ferbots
were phinedroids and ferbots
and were here to stay
now our work is done
were shutting down for the day
weve learned our lesson were switching to decaf all day

 our imaginations
were phinedroids and ferbots
and were here to stay
now our work is done
were shutting down for the day
