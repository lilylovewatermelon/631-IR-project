hes put the makeup on packed the bag of tricksincluding the rabbit that he calls chichi and the bird the attention getter witch hes to do a birthday party for some fiveyearold on the other side of the river a crowd of babies and the adults waiting around for him to screw upthis is going to be one of those tough ones
he has fortified himself and he feels ready he isnt particularly worried about it but theres a little something else he has to do first something on the order of the embarrassingly ridiculous he has to make a delivery

this morning at the local bakery he picked up a big pink wedding cake with its six tiers and scalloped edges and its miniature bride and groom on top hed ordered it on his own hed taken the initiative planning to offer it to a young woman he works with he managed somehow to set the thing on the back seat of the car and when he got home he found a note from her announcing excited and happy that shes engaged the man shed had such difficulty with has had a change of heart he wants to get married after all shes going off to houston to live she loves her dear old tandolfo with a big kiss and a hug always and she knows hell have every happiness shes so thankful for his friendship her magic man her sweet clown she actually drove over here and finding him gone left the note for him folded under the door knockerher notepaper with the tangle of flowers at the top she wants him to call her come by as soon as he can to help celebrate please she says i want to give you a big hug he read this and then walked out to stand on the sidewalk and look at the cake in its place on the back seat of the car

good god he said

hed thought he would put the clown outfit on deliver the cake in person an elaborate proposal to a girl hes never even kissed hes a little unbalanced and he knows it over the months of their working together at bailey  brecht department store hes built up tremendous feelings of loyalty and yearning toward her he thought she felt it too he interpreted gesturesher hand lingering on his shoulder when he made her laugh her endearments tinged as they seemed to be with a kind of sadness as if she were afraid for what the world might do to someone so romantic

you sweet clown she said she said it a lot and she talked to him about her ongoing sorrows the man shed been in love with who kept waffling about getting married wanting no commitments tandolfo aka rodney wilbury told her that he hated men who werent willing to run the risks of love why he personally was the type whod always believed in marriage and children lifelong commitments it was true that he had caused difficulties for himself and life was a disappointment so far but he believed in falling in love and starting a family she didnt hear him it all went right through her like white noise on the radio for weeks he had come around to visit her had invited her to watch him perform she confided in him and he thought of movies where the friend stays loyal and is a good listener and eventually gets the girl they fall in love he put his hope in that he was optimistic hed ordered and bought the cake and apparently the whole time all through the listening and being noble with her she thought of it as nothing more than friendship accepting it from him because she was accustomed to being offered friendship

now he leans close to the mirror to look at his own eyes through the makeup they look clear enough loves you absolutely not you must be crazy you must be the great tandolfo

yes

twentysix years old outofluck tandolfo in love with a great oversized cake in the back seat of his car its sunday a cool april day hes a little inebriated thats the word he prefers its polite it suggests something faintly silly nothing could be sillier than to be dressed like this in broad daylight and to go driving across the bridge into virginia to put on a magic show nothing could be sillier than to have spent all that money on a completely useless purchasea cake six tiers high maybe fifteen pounds of sugar

when he has made his last inspection of the clown face in the mirror and checked the bag of tricks and props he goes to his front door and looks through the screen at the architectural shadow of the cake in the back seat the inside of the car will smell like icing for days hell have to keep the windows open even if it rains hell go to work smelling like confectionary delights the whole thing makes him laugh a wedding cake he steps out of the house and makes his way in the late afternoon sun down the sidewalk to the car as if they have been waiting for him three boys come skating down from the top of the hill he has the feeling that if he tried to sneak out like this at two in the morning someone would come by and see him anyway hey rodney one boy says i mean tandolfo

tandolfo recognizes him a neighborhood boy a tough just the kind to make trouble just the kind with no sensitivity to the suffering of others leave me alone or ill turn you into spaghetti he says

hey guys its tandolfo the great the boys hair is a bright blond color and you can see through it to his scalp
scram tandolfo says really

aw whats your hurry man

ive just set off a nuclear device tandolfo says with grave seriousness its on a timer poof

do a trick for us the blond one says wheres the scurvy rabbit of yours

i gave it the week off someone last winter poisoned the first chichi he keeps the cage indoors now im in a hurry no rabbit to help with the driving

but theyre interested in the cake now hey whats that jesus is that real

just stay back tandolfo gets his cases into the trunk and hurries to the drivers side door the three boys are peering into the back seat to the blond boy he says youre going to go bald arent you

hey man a cake can we have a piece of it one of them says

back off tandolfo says

another says come on tandolfo

hey tandolfo i saw some guys looking for you man they said you owed them money

he gets in ignoring them and starts the car

sucker the blond one says
hey man whos the cake for

he drives away thinks of himself leaving them in a cloud of exhaust riding through the green shade he glances in the rearview mirror and sees the clown face the painted smile it makes him want to laugh he tells himself hes his own clichea clown with a broken heart looming behind him is the cake like a passenger in the back seat the people in the cake store had offered it to him in a box he had made them give it to him like this on a cardboard slab it looks like it might melt

he drives slow worried that it might sag or even fall over he has always believed viscerally that gestures mean everything when he moves his hands and brings about the effects that amaze little children he feels larger than life unforgettable he learned the magic while in high school as a way of making friends and though it didnt really make him any friends hes been practicing it ever since its an extra source of income and lately income has had a way of disappearing too quickly he has been in some travail betting the horses betting the sports events hes hung over all the time there have been several polite warnings at work he has managed so far to tease everyone out of the serious looks the cool study of his face the fact is people like him in an abstract way the way they like distant clownish figures the comedian whose name they cant remember he can see it in their eyes even the rough characters after his loose change have a certain sense of humor about it

hes a phenomenon a subject of conversation

theres traffic on key bridge and hes stuck for a while it becomes clear that hell have to go straight to the birthday party sitting behind the wheel of the car with the cake behind him he becomes aware of people in other cars noticing him in the car to his left a girl stares chewing gum she waves rolls her window down two others are with her one in the back seat hey she says he nods smiles inside what he knows is the clown smile his teeth will look dark against the makeup

wheres the party she says

but the traffic moves again he concentrates the snarl is on the other side of the bridge construction of some kind he can see the cars in a line waiting to go up the hill into roslyn and beyond time is beginning to be a consideration in his glove box he has a flask of bourbon more fortification he reaches over and takes it out looks around himself no police anywhere just the idling cars and people tuning their radios or arguing or simply staring out as if at some distressing event the smell of the cake is making him woozy he takes a swallow of the bourbon then puts it away the car with the girls in it goes by in the left lane and they are not looking at him he watches them go on ahead hes in the wrong lane again he cant remember a time when his lane was the only one moving he told her once that he considered himself of the race of people who gravitate to the nonmoving lanes of highways and who cause green lights to turn yellow merely by approaching them she took the idea and ran with it saying she was of the race of people who emit enzymes which instill a sense of impending doom in marriageable young men

no tandolforodney said im living proof that isnt so i have no such fear and im with you

but youre of the race of people who make mine relax all the enzymes

youre not emitting the enzymes now i see

no she said its only with marriageable young men

i emit enzymes that prevent people like you from seeing that im a marriageable young man

im too relaxed to tell she said and touched his shoulder a plain affectionate moment that gave him tossing nights and fever
because of the traffic hes late to the birthday party he gets out of the car and tow men come down to greet him he keeps his face turned away remembering too late the breath mints in his pocket

jesus one of the men says look at this hey who ordered the cake im not paying for the cake

the cake stays tandolfo says

what does he mean it stays is that a trick

theyre both looking at him the one spoken to must be the birthday boys fatherhes wearing a party cap that says dad he has long dirtylooking strands of brown hair jutting out from the cap and there are streaks of sweaty grit on the sides of his face so youre the great tandolfo he says extending a meaty red hand isnt it hot in that makeup

no sir

weve been playing volleyball

youve exerted yourselves

they look at him what do you do with the cake the one in the dad cap asks

cakes not part of the show actually

you just carry it around with you

the other man laughs hes wearing a tshirt with a smiley face on the chest this ought to be some show he says

they all make their way across the lawn to the porch of the house its a big party bunting everywhere and children gathering quickly to see the clown

ladies and gentlemen says the man in the dad cap i give you tandolfo the great

tandolfo isnt ready yet hes got his cases open but he needs a table to put everything on the first trick is where he releases the bird hell finish with the best trick in which the rabbit appears as if from a pan of flames this always draws a gasp even from the adults the fire blooms in the pan down goes the lidits the rabbits tight containerthe latch is tripped and the skin of the lid lifts off voila rabbit the fire is put out by the fireproof cage bottom hes gotten pretty good at making the switch and if the crowd isnt too attentiveas children often are nothe can perform certain sleightofhand tricks with some style but he needs a table and he needs time to set up

the whole crowd of children is seated in front of their parents on either side of the doorway into the house tandolfo is standing on the porch his back to the stairs and hes been introduced

hello boys and girls he says and bows tandolfo needs a table

a table one of the women says the adults simply regard him he sees light sweaters shapely hips and wild hair he sees beer cans in tight fists heavy jowls bright iceblue eyes a little row of faces and one elderly face he feels more inebriated than he likes and tries to concentrate

mommy i want to touch him one child says

look at the cake says another who gets up and moves to the railing on tandolfos right and trains a new pair of shiny binoculars on the car do we get some cake

theres cake says the man in the dad cap but not that cake get down ethan

i want that cake

get down this is teddys birthday

mommy i want to touch him

i need a table folks i told somebody that over the telephone

he did say he needed a table im sorry says a woman who is probably the birthday boys mother shes quite pretty leaning in the door frame with a sweater tied to her waist

a table says still another woman tandolfo sees the birthmark on her mouth which looks like a stain he thinks of this woman as a child in school with this difference from other children and his heart goes out to her

i need a table he says to her his voice as gentle as he can make it

whats he going to do perform an operation says dad

it amazes tandolfo how easily people fall into talking about him as though he were an inanimate object or something on a television screen the great tandolfo can do nothing until he gets a table he says with as much mysteriousness and drama as he can muster under the circumstances

i want that cake out there says ethan still at the porch railing the other children start talking about cake and ice cream and the big cake ethan has spotted theres a lot of confusion and restlessness one of the smaller children a girl in a blue dress approaches tandolfo whats your name she says swaying slightly her hands behind her back

go sit down he says to her we have to sit down or tandolfo cant do his magic

in the doorway two of the men are struggling with a folding card table its one of those rickety ones with the skinny legs and it probably wont do

thats kind of shaky isnt it says the woman with the birthmark

i said tandolfo needs a sturdy table boys and girls

theres more confusion the little girl has come forward and taken hold of his pant leg shes just standing there holding it looking up at him we have to go sit down he says bending to her speaking sweetly clownlike we have to do what tandolfo wants

her small mouth opens wide as if shes trying to yawn and with pale eyes quite calm and staring she emits a screech an earpiercing nonhuman shriek that brings everything to a stop tandolforodney steps back with his amazement and his inebriate heart everyone gathers around the girl who continues to scream less piercing now her hands fisted at her sides those pale eyes closed tight

what happened the man in the dad cap wants to know where the hells the magic tricks

i told you all i needed is a table

whatd you say to her to make her cry dad indicates the little girl who is giving forth a series of broken griefstricken howls

i want magic tricks the birthday boy says loud wheres the magic tricks

perhaps if we moved the whole thing inside the woman with the birthmark says fingering her left ear and making a face

the card table has somehow made its way to tandolfo through the confusion and grief the man in the dad cap sets it down and opens it

there he says as if his point has been made

in the next moment tandolfo realizes that someones removed the little girl everythings relatively quiet again though her cries are coming through the walls of one of the rooms inside the house there are perhaps fifteen children mostly seated before him and five or six men and women behind them or kneeling with them okay now dad says tandolfo the great

hello little boys and girls tandolfo says deciding that the table will have to suffice im happy to be here are you glad to see me a general uproar commences well good he says because just look what i have in my magic bag and with a flourish he brings out the hat that he will release witch from the bird is encased in a fold of shiny cloth pulsing there he can feel it he rambles on talking fast or trying to and when the time comes to reveal the bird he almost flubs it but witch flaps his wings and makes enough of a commotion to distract even the adults who applaud and urge the stunned children to follow suit isnt that wonderful tandolfo hears out of nowhere

he had it hidden away says the birthday boy managing to temper his astonishment hes clearly the type who heaps scorn on those things he cant understand or own

now tandolfo says for my next spell i need a helper from the audience he looks right at the birthday boyround face short nose freckles bright red hair little green eyes the whole countenance speaks of glutted appetites and sloth this kid could be on roman coins an emperor hes not used to being compelled to do anything but he seems eager for a chance to get into the act how about you tandolfo says to him

the others led by their parents cheer

the birthday boy gets to his feet and makes his way over to the bodies of the other children to stand with tandolfo in order for the trick to work tandolfo must get everyone watching the birthday boy and theres a funny hat he keeps in the bag for this purpose now he says to the boy since youre part of the show you have to wear a costume he produces the hat as if from behind the boys ear another cheer goes up he puts the hat on the boys head and adjusts it crouching down the green eyes stare impassively at him theres no hint of awe or fascination in them there we are he says what a handsome fellow

but the birthday boy takes the hat off

we have to wear the hat to be onstage

aint a stage the boy says

well but hey tandolfo says for the benefit of the adults didnt you know that all the worlds a stage he tries to put the hat on him again but the boy moves from under his reach and slaps the hand away we have to wear the hat tandolfo says trying to control his anger we cant do the magic without our magic hats he tries once more and the boy waits until the hat is on then simply removes it and holds it behind him shying away when tandolfo tries to retrieve it the noise of the others now sounds like the crowd at a prizefight theres a contest going on and theyre enjoying it give tandolfo the hat we want magic dont we

do the magic the boy demands

ill do the magic if you give me the hat

i wont

nothing no support from the adults perhaps if he werent a little tipsy perhaps if he didnt feel ridiculous and sick at heart and forlorn with his wedding cake and his odd mistaken romance his loneliness which he has always borne gracefully and with humor and his general dismay perhaps if he were to find it in himself to deny the sudden overwhelming sense of the unearned affection given this lumpish slovenly version of a stupid complacent spoiled satiation standing before himhe might have simply gone on to the next trick

instead at precisely the moment when everyone seems to pause he leans down and says give me the hat you little prick

the green eyes widen

the quiet is heavy with disbelief even the small children can tell that somethings happened to change everything

tandolfo has another trick rodney says loud where he makes the birthday boy pop like a balloon especially if hes a fat birthday boy

a stirring among the adults

especially if hes an ugly slab of gross flesh like this one here

now just a minute says dad

pop rodney says to the birthday boy who drops the hat and then seeming to remember that defiance is expected makes a face sticks out his tongue rodneytandolfo is quick with his hands by training and he grabs the tongue

awk the boy says awawaw

abracadabra rodney lets go and the boy falls backward onto the lap of one of the other children more cries whoops time to sit down says rodney sorry you had to leave so soon

very quickly hes being forcibly removed theyre rougher than gangsters they lift him punch him tear at his costumeeven the women someone hits him with a spoon the whole scene boils over onto the lawn where someone has released chichi from her case chichi moves about wideeyed hopping between running children evading them as tandolfo the great cannot evade the adults hes being pummeled because he keeps trying to return for his rabbit and the adults wont let him off the curb okay he says finally collecting himself he wants to let them know hes not like this all the time wants to say its circumstances grief personal pain hidden inside seeming brightness and cleverness hes a man in love humiliated wrong about everything he wants to tell them but he cant speak for a moment cant even quite catch his breath he stands in the middle of the street his funny clothes torn his face bleeding all his magic strewn everywhere i would at least like to collect my rabbit he says and is appalled at the absurd sound of itits huge difference from what he intended to say he straightens pushes the grime from his face adjusts the clown nose and looks at them i would say that even though i wasnt as patient as i couldve been the adults have not comported themselves well here he says

drunk one of the women says

almost everyones chasing chichi now one of the older boys approaches carrying witchs case witch looks out the air hole impervious quiet as an idea and now one of the men someone rodney hasnt noticed before an older man clearly wearing a hairpiece brings chichi to him bless you rodney says staring into the mans sleepy deploring eyes

i dont think well pay you the man says the others are filing back into the house herding the children before them

rodney speaks to the man the rabbit appears out of fire

the man nods go home and sleep it off kid

right thank you

he puts chichi in his compartment stuffs everything in its place in the trunk then he gets in the car and drives away around the corner he stops wipes off what he can of the makeup its as if hes trying to remove the stain of bad opinion and disapproval nothing feels any different he drives to the suburban street where she lives with her parents and by the time he gets there its almost dark

the houses are set back in the trees he sees lighted windows hears music the sound of children playing in the yards he parks the car and gets out a breezy april dusk i am tandolfo the softhearted he says hearken to me then he sobs he cant believe it jeez he says lord he opens the back door of the car leans in to get the cake hed forgot how heavy it is staggering with it making his way along the sidewalk intending to leave it on her doorstep he has an inspiration hesitating only for the moment it takes to make sure there are no cars coming he goes out and sets it down in the middle of the street part of the top sags from having bumped his shoulder as he pulled it off the back seat the bride and groom are almost supine one on top of the other he straightens them steps back and looks at it in the dusky light it looks blue it sags just right with just the right angle expressing disappointment and sorrow yes he thinks this is the place for it the aptness of it sitting out like this where anyone might come by and splatter it all over creation makes him feel a faint sense of release as if he were at the end of a story everything will be all right if he can think of it that way hes wiping his eyes thinking of moving to another town failures are beginning to catch up to him and hes still aching in love he thinks how he has suffered the pangs of failure and misadventure but in this painful instance theres symmetry and he will make the one eloquent gestureleaving a wedding cake in the middle of the road like a sugaricinged pylon yes

he walks back to the car gets in pulls around and backs into the driveway of the house across the street from hers leaving the engine idling he rolls the window down and rests his arm on the sill gazing at the incongruous shape of the cake there in the falling dark he feels almost glad almost in some strange inexpressible way vindicated he imagines what she might do if she saw him here imagines that she comes running from her house calling his name looking at the cake and admiring it he conjures a picture of her attacking the tiers of pink sugar and the muscles of his abdomen tightened but then this all gives way to something else images of destruction of flying dollops of icing hes surprised to find that he wants her to stay where she is doing whatever shes doing he realizes that what he wantsand for the moment all he really wantsis what he now has a perfect vantage point from which to watch oncoming cars turning the engine off he waits concentrating on the one thing hes a man imbued with interest almost peaceful with italmost in fact happy with itsitting there in the quiet car and patiently awaiting the results of his labor2embed"
