as i drove across on the highway my jeep began to rock
i didnt know what to do so i stopped
then got out and looked down i noticed ive got a flat
so i walked out parked the car like sideways
so i can find what i can fix
i looked around there were no cars on the highway
i felt a strange feeling like a mist
so i walked down towards the end of the road
and in the fog a woman appeared
she said dont you worry my friend ill take care
take my hand ill take you there

chorus
oh take me to a place without no name
take me to a place without no name yeah oh
take me to a place without no name
take me to oh a place without yeah no name

verse 2
as she took me right through the fog
i seen a beautiful city appear
at where kids are playin
and people are laughin and smilin and nothin to fear
she said this is the place where no people have pain
with love and happiness
she turned around looked down in my eyes
and started cryin
grab my hand youve got a friend oh

she started liking me kissing me and hugging me
she didnt really really want me to leave
she showed me places ive never seen
and things ive never done this really looks like a lot of fun
ive seen the grass and the skies and the birds
and the flowers surrounded by the trees
this place is filled with love and happiness
how in the world could i wanna leave
so then i went in my pocket took my wallet all out
with my pictures of my family and girl
this is the place that you choose to be with me
when you thought you could be in another world oh
