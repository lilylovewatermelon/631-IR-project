i wanna be the minority
i dont need your authority
down with the moral majority
cause i wanna be the minority

verse 1
i pledge allegiance to the underworld
one nation under dog there of which i stand alone
a face in the crowd unsung against the mold
without a doubt singled out the only way i know

chorus
cause i wanna be the minority
i dont need your authority
down with the moral majority
cause i wanna be the minority

bridge
stepped out of the line
like a sheep runs from the herd
marchin out of time
to my own beat now
the only way i know

verse 2
one light one mind flashin in the dark
blinded by the silence of a thousand broken hearts
for cryin out loud she screamed unto me
a freeforall fuck em all you are your own sight

cause i wanna be the minority
i dont need your authority
down with the moral majority
cause i wanna be the minority hey
