where oh where have you been my love
where oh where can you be
its been so long since the moon has gone
and oh what a wreck you made me

chorus 1
are you there over the ocean
are you there up in the sky
until the return of my love this lullaby

verse 2
my hope is on the horizon
every face your eyes i can see
i plead and pray though each night and day
our embrace is only a dream

chorus 2
and as sure as days come from moments
each hour becomes a lifes time
when shed left id only begun this lullabysee queens of the stone age liveget tickets as low as 51you might also like5embed"
