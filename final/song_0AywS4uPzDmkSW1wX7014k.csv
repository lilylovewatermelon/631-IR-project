hey you
so you never really found your way
stay true
did you ever make it through today
you never make it through the day

prechorus
i know that when i think about a day without it
everydays the same
you wish that you could find someone
but im the only one to blame

chorus
cant you see i beg and plead
cause when your eyes light up the skies at night
i know youre gonna find your way back to me

verse 2
no dont
dont you ever let a piece of me down
oohooh oohooh oohooh oohooh
cause time wont
get back when im never around
thats when im coming around
see the allamerican rejects liveget tickets as low as 245you might also likeprechorus
when we live between so many walls
that i can barely breathe
you say that you just want someone
but im the only one you need

chorus
cant you see i beg and plead
cause when your eyes light up the skies at night
i know youre gonna find your way
if its me that you dont need
then when the lights go out tonight i know
youre never gonna find your way

bridge
soon when i get you i wont let you go
ooh if i let you you can take away
all that i thought was wrong
and if you hear me theres not much to say
theres gotta be a better way

chorus
cant you see i beg and plead
cause when your eyes light up the sky tonight
i know youre going to find your way back to me
cant you see i beg and plead
cause when the lights go out tonight i know
youre never gonna find your way
if its me that you dont need
then when the lights go out tonight i know
youre never gonna find a way
you can pace around the world til youre with me
and when your eyes light up the skies at night
i know youre gonna find your way back to me1embed"
