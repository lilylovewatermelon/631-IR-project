well you know that im cold
black on constellations gold
and you know that your souls
black top under lacing wont let it go
it was all for you all for you and more
she wont chase him anymore

chorus
to the end never leave
fall asleep on the first i face
and they say play the game
you and me found love lost under the shade

verse 2
well you know im a ghost
pull the note out of my throat
and leave me alone
but its all for you all for you and more
he wont take her anymore

chorus
to the end ever leave
fall asleep on the first i face
and they say play the game
you and me found love lost under the shade
