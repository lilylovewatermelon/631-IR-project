if i be so inclined to climb up beside you
would you tell me that the time just isnt right
and if i ever find the key you hide so well
will you tell me that i can spend the night

chorus 1
leaving your smell on my coat
leaving your taste on my shoulder
i still fail to understand what it is about this woman

verse 2
if i could bottle up the chills that you give me
i would keep them in a jar next to my bed
and if i should ever draw a picture of a woman
it is you that would come flowing from my pen

chorus 2
leaving your clothes on the floor
making me walk out the door
and i still fail to understand what it is about this woman

verse 3
helplessly melting as i stand next to the sun
as she burns me i am screaming out for more
drink every drop of liquid heat that ive become
pop me open spill me out onto the floor
see maroon 5 liveget tickets as low as 100you might also likechorus 1

leaving your smell on my coat
leaving your taste on my shoulder
i still fail to understand what it is about this womanembed"
