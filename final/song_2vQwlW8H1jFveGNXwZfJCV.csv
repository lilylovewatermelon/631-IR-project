dead inside
spend a lot of time stuck in this head of mine
under the assumption love is dead already
just let me be here
where was i
when he was feeling on you with his hands at night
seen the vivid pictures in my head at night
it left me in tears
where was i
when he was feeling on you with his hands
seen the vivid pictures in my head
im under the assumption love is dead
where was i
when he was feeling on you with his hands
i’m under the assumption love is dead
