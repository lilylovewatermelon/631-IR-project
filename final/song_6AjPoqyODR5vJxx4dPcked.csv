you thought id die when you said goodbye
for a minute i thought that i would
and there for awhile couldnt even fake a smile
even if the bad joke sounded good
i went off the rails
thought hell might as well
rock bottom was callin my name
but lookin back now i oughta be
in the movin on halloffame

chorus
it wasnt my buddies
it wasnt my mama
it wasnt no selfhelp howto
it wasnt old records
it wasnt old flings
or dancin with somebody new
tequila made me crazy
cold beer wouldnt do
so i whiskeyd my way over you

verse 2
you saw me out on a friday downtown
with a smile that came stumblin back in
guess that killed your mood cause you did what you do
turned around and walked out again
so pour a little more bourbon
oh its the only thing been workin
see morgan wallen liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likechorus
it wasnt my buddies
it wasnt my mama
it wasnt no selfhelp howto
it wasnt old records
it wasnt old flings
or dancin with somebody new
tequila made me crazy
cold beer wouldnt do
so i whiskeyd my way over you
whiskeyd my way
whiskeyd my way

bridge
oh oh keep the bar keep workin
oh oh pour it on this hurtin

chorus
it wasnt my buddies
it wasnt my momma
it wasnt no selfhelp howto
it wasnt old records
and it wasnt old flings
or dancin with somebody new
tequila made me crazy
cold beer wouldnt do
so i whiskeyd my way over you
outro
tequila didnt cut it
cold beer was no use
so i whiskeyd my way over youembed"
