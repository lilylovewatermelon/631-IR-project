i hope you see me there

its in the water its where you came from
its in the water its where you came from

when the crowd begins to wonder
and they cry to see your face

its in the water its in the story of where you came from
your sons and daughters in all their glory its gonna shape her
and when they clash and come together and start rising
just drink the water where you came from where you came from

so the roll it was called from yonder
never sold yourself away

its in the water its in the story its where you came from
the sons and daughters in all their glory its gonna shape them
and when they clash and come together and start rising
just drink the water where you came from where you came from

and when they clash and come together and start rising
just drink the water where you came from where you came fromsee kings of leon liveget tickets as low as 117you might also likeembed"
