yeah

verse 1
i am a product of your conduct
the uncontrollable urges that made me
have made us all are you proud do you even care
you taught us all to lie thats how we made it here
you shouldve buried the truth with your secrets
but you were far too impressed with your pretense
now as far as i know i dont know anything
cause you made damn sure i wasnt anything

chorus

before i let you go you have to let me
yeah

verse 2
clawed away from human clay
we are the broken shards the art disarray
before you condemn you rape them feed us meconium
stunt our growth from our souls to our throat cut
you shouldnt wall us up with your apathy
but you did and now youre only growing enemies
this is the catalyst the alpha the first breed
cause you made damn sure now were everything

verse 3
ensconced onch in all thats wrong wrong
i slam you shut shut i can only take so much
how many times do i have to mistreat you
constantly biting my hand as i feed you
maybe now youll understand severity
ill sum it up with the best of amount of brevity
welcome to the transformation
welcome to annihilation
welcome to the man that wanted
everything but couldnt have it
