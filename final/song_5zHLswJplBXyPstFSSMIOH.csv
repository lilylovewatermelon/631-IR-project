i wish you bluebirds in the spring
to give your heart a song to sing
and then a kiss but more than this
i wish you love

verse 2
and in july a lemonade
to cool you in some leafy glade
i wish you health and more than wealth
i wish you love

bridge
my breaking heart and i agree
that you and i could never be
so with my best my very best
i set you free

chorus
i wish you shelter from the storm
a cozy fire to keep you warm
but most of all when snowflakes fall
i wish you love
