no wonder im scared to look in your eyes
youve turned me away so many times
you can take it away at any given moment
its hard to believe while youre in this disguise

prechorus
so would you hold me please
im trying hard to breathe
im just surviving
so would you hold me please
im trying hard to breathe
stop me from crying

chorus
when i see you walking with her
i have to cover my eyes
i have to cover my eyes
every time you leave with her
something inside me dies
something inside of me dies

verse 2
no wonder it hurts to sit by your side
turned me away so many times
theres a different song i can play you tonight
we dont have to sit here in silence
we can break the pattern we can change the colour
its just a little sacrifice
you dont need to worry about the others
its all in your mind

when i see you walking with her

i have to cover my eyes
every time you leave with her

when i see you walking with her

something inside of me dies
something inside me diesembed"
