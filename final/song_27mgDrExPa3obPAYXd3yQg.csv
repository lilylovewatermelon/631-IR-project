dosido oh yo ho hello there

go to beirut and do a show there haha
yeah you laugh til your mothafuckin ass gets drafted
while youre at bandcamp thinkin that crap cant happen
til you fuck around get an anthrax napkin
inside a package wrapped in saran wrap wrappin
open the plastic and then you stand back gaspin
fuckin assassins hijackin amtraks crashin
all this terror america demands action
next thing you know youve got uncle sams ass askin
to join the army or what youll do for their navy

dont be scared ‘cause there aint nothin to worry bout
let your hair down and square dance with me
verse 3 eminem
nothin moves me more than a groove that soothes me
nothin soothes me more than a groove that boosts me
nothin boosts me more or suits me beautifully
