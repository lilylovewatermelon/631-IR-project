its not just a phase now let me explain
im working through some shit sometimes im medicated
its hard to relay the thoughts in my brain
im working for a life thats not domesticated

prechorus
it never goes the way that you planned
success is a door that always slams
im trying to break it
im trying to break it
searching for words and praying for signs
i struggle to find the rhythm and rhyme
dont know how to say it
dont know how to say it

chorus
that im losing my mind
trying to find the perfect line
i think im running out of time
i need a miramiracle a miramiracle
yeah im losing my mind
counting seconds passing by
and i dont know when ill be fine
i need a miramiracle a miramiracle
a miracle
