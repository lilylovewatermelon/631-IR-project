i love makin you believe what you get is what you see
but im so fake happy i feel so fake happy
and i bet everybody here is just as insincere
were all so fake happy and i know fake happy

verse 1

im quite alright better hope i dont blink
you see its easy when im stompin on a beat
but no one sees me when i crawl back underneath

i bet you believe me
if i smile with my teeth
i think i believe me

chorus
oh please dont ask me how ive been
dont make me play pretend oh no

verse 2
and if i go out tonight dress up my fears
you think i look alright with these mascara tears
see im gonna draw my lipstick wider than my mouth
and if the lights are low theyll never see me frown
