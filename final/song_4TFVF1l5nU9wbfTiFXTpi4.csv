straight up out the motel
hock my guitar out of a pawn shop jail
if i quit im just rolling the dice
couldnt pass up the red beans and rice
singing

oh my my
see them girls shake their ass
underneath the sunrise
oh my my
taste the sugar on their lips
underneath that moonlight

well ive never met the devil with a oneeyed dog
you can lead a blind man out of vietnam
everybodys beggin everybody wants a chance
stuck in a storm well do a rain dance

oh my my
see them girls shake their ass
underneath the sunrise
oh my my
taste the sugar on their lips
underneath that moonlight
see ryan bingham liveget tickets as low as 142you might also likeim taking my chances
im taking my sins
throwin em down the hill and ill watch em come around again
watched em fall watched em rise up to the sky
a hundred miles an hour across the river to the other side

oh my my
see them girls shake their ass
underneath the sunrise
oh my my
taste the sugar on their lips
underneath that moonlight

well ive never met the devil with a oneeyed dog
you can lead a blind man out of vietnam
everybodys beggin everybody wants a chance
stuck in a storm well do a rain danceembed"
