i cant remember when it was good
moments of happiness elude
maybe i just misunderstood
all of the love we left behind
watching the flashbacks intertwine
memories i will never find
so ill love whatever you become
and forget the reckless things weve done
i think our lives have just begun
i think our lives have just begun

chorus
and ill feel my world crumbling
ill feel my life crumbling
ill feel my soul crumbling away
and falling away
falling away with you

verse 2
staying awake to chase a dream
tasting the air youre breathing in
i know i wont forget a thing
promise to hold you close and pray
watching the fantasies decay
nothing will ever stay the same
and all of the love we threw away
and all of the hopes weve cherished fade
making the same mistakes again
making the same mistakes again

and ill feel my world crumbling
ill feel my life crumbling
ill feel my soul crumbling away
and falling away
falling away with you

outro
all of the love we left behind
watching the flashbacks intertwine
memories i will never find
memories i will never find12embed"
