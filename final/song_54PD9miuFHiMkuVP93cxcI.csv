i thought about calling you when i got off the plane
every time i see this city through the clouds i get that way
call me crazy for missing you like this but i do
by now i figured you had all your numbers changed
its been at least a year since i called you up to say
we need to talk i got this job and i think im going to take it

chorus
because i been waiting all my life for a break like this
its my chance of a lifetime i just know it is
i gotta go find these dreams was the last thing that i said
and then i did

verse 2
i can see clear to the mountains as i head up our old street
i remember how wed call in sick on days like these
and turn the music up roll the windows down and just drive
you talked me outta givin up on myself so many times
convinced me to get in while i could regrets hang heavy on the mind
but you never doubted me
you kept pushing me

chorus
saying youve been waiting all your life for a break like this
its your chance of a lifetime you just know it is
you gotta go find those dreams was the last thing that you said
and then i did
you might also likebridge
but you were wrong
love was what i wanted all along
and now youre gone
i thought about calling you when i got off the plane
every time i see this city through the clouds i get that way

outro
but you were wrong
love was what i wanted all along oh yeah
but you were wrong
yeah love was what i wanted all along
cause ive been waiting all my life
you gotta go and find those dreams find those dreams
you gotta go and find those dreams
find those dreams love was what i wanted love was what i wanted
youve been waiting all your lifeembed"
