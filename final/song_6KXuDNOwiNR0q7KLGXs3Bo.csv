two could be complete without the rest of the world
two could be complete without the rest of the world
do it for the people that have died for your sake
an entire generation that has nothing to say
howd you make your way to me

chorus 1
oh lets say you made a deal with me
and i got your name and your home address
oh youre all trashed up with your big red belt
i would almost say that you might need help
i could drop you off at the next red light
if it dont make sense or it dont feel right
all the girls could never make me love them the way i love you

verse 2
cant you see the sky is not the limit no more
i can see the elevator crash through the floor
i can still see yesterday sailing away
seven billion people who got nothing to say
are you coming on to me

chorus 2
well i saw your face then i heard that song
it was so inviting it hurt my bones
well it looks like you but your eyes are gray
and your hair is gone but your minds okay
yes i like your smile but your foreheads cold
i dont want you to be afraid and go
i would cheat and lie and steal now ill stay at home and kneel for you
see the strokes liveget tickets as low as 122you might also likebridge
i was waiting for my baby to arrive
right by my side
oh please leave me alone tonight
forget the past

verse 3
two could be complete without the rest of the world
oh you know i said it just to get you to laugh
do it for the people that have died for your sake
an entire generation of entertainers to blame
the light is red the cameras on

outro
get yourself a lawyer and a gun
hate your friends new friends like everyone
childhoods end can be so competitive
oh the skys not the limit and youre never gonna guess what is oh16embed"
