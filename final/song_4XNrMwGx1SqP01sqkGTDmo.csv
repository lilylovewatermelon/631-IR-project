verse 1
you and i go hard at each other like were going to war
you and i go rough we keep throwing things and slamming the doors
you and i get so damn dysfunctional we stopped keeping score
you and i get sick yeah i know that we cant do this no more

prechorus
yeah but baby there you go again there you go again
making me love you
yeah i stopped using my head using my head
let it all go
got you stuck on my body on my body like a tattoo
and now im feeling stupid feeling stupid crawling back to you

chorus
so i cross my heart and i hope to die
that ill only stay with you one more night
and i know ive said it a million times
but ill only stay with you one more night

verse 2
try to tell you no but my body keeps on telling you yes
try to tell you stop but your lipstick got me so out of breath
ill be waking up in the morning probably hating myself
and ill be waking up feeling satisfied but guilty as hell
