yeahyeaheaheah
for real though
its so wild now
this shit crazy yeah

verse 1
woke up in the hills this morning
asking myself how did i get here this morning
vante parker in that teal and orange
and russell in that gold and purple
youngest from the ville important
i used to sit up in my room and ponder
finished school and get a doctors
im twentytwo i gotta get it now
man who knew hed have it figured out
trapsoul man i crack codes
crack cocaine thats what we putting out
these fuck niggas saying
dont forget when you was broke i was looking out
and some say theres levels to this shit
damn look at all the levels that i skipped
feeling like theres a medal i should get
all these haters getting heavy on my dick
look at my niggas chasing paper
getting books with my niggas
so how the fuck can people back home say i shook on my niggas
your two cents aint working for me
all you niggas sound commercial to me man
i dont like commercial niggas
please shut the fuck up before i hurt you fuck your feelings
dont take it personal its nothing personal
this a derby city come up this a derby city vertical
first 48 straight murder you
see bryson tiller liveget tickets as low as 57you might also likeinterlude
for years and years we waited on this living in a place folks didnt know exist
surprise motherfucker we up in this bitch
i said im back and im so much better
im so so much better and i wont stop louis
i cant stop not now louis not ever louis louis

verse 2
louis slugger with the hits
knock them out the park then im knocking down your bitch
im watching how you pitch
im not from houston no im not from round the six
got the four series i should cop the six after the world series
i just talked to rich bout palm trees and bad bitches
and how these snakes can harm me with bad business
damn fuck out of here nigga
its very rare for young black men to come up out of here nigga
some will call it luck and some will call me up i aint heard from you in years
please get the fuck out my ear nigga
my peers get it only god can judge me fuck the jurisdiction
im working aint got time for thirsting over how these chicks appear in pictures
im just painting crystalclear pictures brushing up on my lyrics nigga
i just wish momma was here to live up under chandeliers with us
i guess all i ever had to do was take this shit a little more serious
lets get it
outro
theres not much to say
woah im from the southside
