out on the sea wed be forgiven
our bodies stopped the spirit leavin
wouldnt you like to know
how far youve got left to go

verse 2
somebodys child nobody made you
its not what you stole its what they gave you
in or out you go
in your silence your soul

verse 3
would you rather go unwillin
the heart is full and now its spillin
barrelin down the steps
only a moment left

chorus
in hind of sight no peace of mind
where you begin and im defined
daughter of unconscious fate
time will tell in spite of me
in hind of sight no peace of mind
where it begins and were defined
shadows bend and suddenly
the world becomes and swallows me yeah
yeah

anyway in a name
she takes shape just the same28embed"
