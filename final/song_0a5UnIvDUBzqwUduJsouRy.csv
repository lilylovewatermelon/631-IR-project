we could just go home right now
or maybe we could stick around
for just one more drink oh yeah
get another bottle out
lets shoot the shit
sit back down
for just one more drink oh yeah

chorus 1
heres to us
heres to love
all the times that we fucked up
heres to you
fill the glass
cause the last few days
have kicked my ass
so lets give em hell
wish everybody well
heres to us
heres to us

verse 2
stuck it out this far together
put our dreams through the shredder
let’s toast cause things got better
and everything could change like that
and all these years go by so fast
but nothing lasts forever

heres to all that we kissed
and to all that we missed
to the biggest mistakes
that we just wouldn’t trade

without us breaking down
to whatevers coming our way
