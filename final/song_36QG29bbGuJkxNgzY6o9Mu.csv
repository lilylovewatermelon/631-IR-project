in this life im me just sitting here alone
by the way i tried to say id be there for you
walk the silent emptiness that leads me by my hands
and throw away what i dont understand as a man

chorus
lovehatesexpain
its complicating me sometimes
this lovehatesexpain
its underestimated lies

verse 2
and i wonder as i tear away my skin
its taken me so long to stitch these wounds from where ive been
and mother please dont bury me im begging for my life
its hard to say that i will be complete before i die

chorus
lovehatesexpain
its complicating me sometimes
this lovehatesexpain
its underestimated lies

bridge
dont you worry please
dont you leave me
because i surely slip away
though love hate sex and pain
i fall away into
love hate sex and pain
