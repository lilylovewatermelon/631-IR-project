verse 2
the streets dont love you they just take you away from who do i swear
niggas dont even fuck with they self but want you to right
really was just thinking out loud when when i made that tweet
and i still feel like a pandemic dont exist to me true
real niggas dead why cause the scared niggas shooting no lie
boy dont go against this money dont do that ill make the nigga poof voilà
all these bitches thirsty now open drinkin semen like its juice slowly
told ari that id be there they just wanna know the scoop know the scoop
dont come round me with that fake love show me the real you hoe
catch me pourin my problems pineapple fanta and mountain dew slowly
i saw niggas get some money and start actin brand new forget
solidified my spot they cant take it if they wanted to get the last
