drivin faster in my car
fallin farther from just what we are
smoke a cigarette and lie some more
these conversations kill
fallin faster in my car

chorus
time to take her home her dizzy head is conscienceladen
time to take a ride it leaves today no conversation
time to take her home her dizzy head is conscienceladen
time to wait too long to wait too long to wait too long

verse 2
too much walkin shoes worn thin
too much trippin and my souls worn thin
time to catch a ride it leaves today
her name is what it means
too much walkin shoes worn thin

chorus
time to take her home her dizzy head is conscienceladen
time to take a ride it leaves today no conversation
time to take her home her dizzy head is conscienceladen
time to wait too long to wait too long to wait too long
