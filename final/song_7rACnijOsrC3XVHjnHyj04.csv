ive been trying to develop an alternative fuel from a mix of all natural substances
but the mix was highly volatile until we found a catalyst
to help stabilize the compound and supercharge the fuel
im sorry what was this magical catalyst
marijuana motherfucker
uh ladies and gentlemen players and playettes teachers staff and students
i am very honored to welcome you to the high school annual talent show
brought to you by the makers of wiz khalifa premium rolling papers
and the qualified growers of snoop dogg master kush
so without further a due lets get this show on the road
first contestant bring your talent to the foreground and let your smoke be the background

hook wiz khalifa
everytime i go out im blowing that smoke out
i buy it dont even know the price
i talk cause i live it come pay me a visit
and ill be somewhere up in the sky
my nigga its about to go down
we fly its no lie that we high til we die
all we need up in heres hoes now
roll one up clean the ride uh case them hoes wanna jump inside

verse 1 wiz khalifa
got a joint filled with quality shit
my bottom bitch smoking with me niggas talk shit

roll a joint lick it once tell you hit this
groupies on my dick several kushes on my hitlist

you probably went to class while i was in the hallway skipping
yeah i hear what they saying just be to high to listen
bout my money tripping if i even fold it wrong
you aint smoking this good if its fire tell you i sold it all
or wait til one of my hoes come round to roll it all
or say fuck it and cuff it til i go smoke with dogg

and blow circles around you suckas like a marathon
my gym teacher told me but i didnt listen
my bitch did my homework and now im in detention

so play your position get the picture i envision
did she mention snoop dogg was made for kissing
a barracuda fishing she on a mission for me
pleasure pain and glory in my inventory
my sats my little bitch she did em for me
and now we prancing on stage at the talent show
we flossing my clothes my chain and my knapsack
full of that hand me that can you see my telescope
