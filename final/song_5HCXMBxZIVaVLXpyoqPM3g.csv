im tired of tending to this fire
ive used up all ive collected
i have singed my hands
its glowing embers barely showing
proof of life in the shadows
dancing on my plans

chorus
they know that its almost
they know that its almost over
they know that its almost
they know that its almost over

verse 2
the burning is so low its concerning
cause they know that when it goes out
its a glorious gone
its only time before they show me
why no one ever comes back
with details from beyond

chorus
they know that its almost
they know that its almost over
they know that its almost
they know that its almost over
they know
they know that its almost over
they know
they know that its almost over
they know
they know
they know
they know

for now i will stay alive
