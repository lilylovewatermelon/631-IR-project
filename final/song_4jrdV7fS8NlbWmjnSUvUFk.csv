theres no survivors just the blood scattered up all over the place
we built our smoked out loced out in the fucking chevrolet
theres no survivors just the blood scattered up all over the place
we built our smoked out loced out in the fucking chevrolet
theres no survivors just the blood scattered up all over the place
we built our smoked out loced out in the fucking chevrolet
theres no survivors just the blood scattered up all over the place

verse 1 yung mutt
ruby steady swervin down this muddy road whip got like a hunnid spokes
my gas tank needle doesnt show how much gas im about to blow
told lick dont roll down the windows
well probably drown just for your info
he rolled the bitch down and let in the minnows
the velvet seats ruined they used to be pimp though
swam out the whip hold my breath count to ten
guess this it so we left
got to swim to the surface before we start breathin in water
looked up and saw the sun fade – im a goner
bitch lay me down along the bottom of the lake
forever hauntin pontchartrain until i rise up out my grave
chorus lord infamous
theres no survivors just the blood scattered up all over the place
we built our smoked out loced out in the fucking chevrolet
theres no survivors just the blood scattered up all over the place
we built our smoked out loced out in the fucking chevrolet
theres no survivors just the blood scattered up all over the place
we built our smoked out loced out in the fucking chevrolet

comin up out them ditches under bridges in the 7th ward
lurkin back out the cut creepin with mutt ridin down st bernard
xanax bars chevy cars plenty broads curve em all
was born to fall on a good day i crawl
that cocaína drippin out my nose pour my fours in aquafina
it aint no secret everybody know that im a fienda
that weapon keepin always sleepin with my loaded nina
yung emphysema always smokin on that hiroshima
outro lord infamous
theres no survivors just the blood scattered up all over the place
