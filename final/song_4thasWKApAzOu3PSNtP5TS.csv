hey thats a trip
why dont you wait a little bit for the acid to kick in
learn to love
that old come down
itll spread you so thin
go and take the millions
take the derby hats
and stick em up your ass
ill take the cheap seats
for my company dont come served inside a glass

chorus
old man and the sea
doin what you were born to
shrapnel in my knee
i cant walk and i dont care to

verse 2
i met a strange bird
her legs they were skinny like a child
she roamed this land
strong willed free and wild
all the notables and their spying wives
three hipsters two merchants and kontiki
they saw the black down off in the midnight skies
man you shouldve seen them
they were so down in the dumps that evening
you might also likechorus
old man and the sea
doin what you were born to
shrapnel in my knee
i cant walk and i dont care to
id do it all for you
but id do it for no one
sing a song for you
but i sing for no one4embed"
