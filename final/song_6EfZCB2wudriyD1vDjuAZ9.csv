well i didnt tell anyone but a bird flew by
saw what id done he set up a nest outside
and he sang about what id become
he sang so loud sang so clear
i was afraid all the neighbours would hear
so i invited him in just to reason with him
i promised i wouldnt do it again
but he sang louder and louder inside the house
and no i couldnt get him out
so i trapped him under a cardboard box
stood on it to make him stop
i picked up the bird and above the din i said
thats the last song youll ever sing
held him down broke his neck
taught him a lesson he wouldnt forget
but in my dreams began to creep
that old familiar tweet tweet tweet

chorus 1
i opened my mouth to scream and shout
i waved my arms and flapped about
but i couldnt scream and i couldnt shout
couldnt scream and i couldnt shout

chorus 2
i opened my mouth to scream and shout
i waved my arms and flapped about
but i couldnt scream and i couldnt shout
the song was coming from my mouth
