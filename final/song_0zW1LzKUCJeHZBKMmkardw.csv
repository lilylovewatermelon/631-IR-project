we dont care what people say we know the truth
enough is enough of this horse shit
i am not a freak i was born with my free gun
dont tell me im less than my freedom

verse 1
im a bitch
im a loser baby maybe i should quit
im a jerk
wish i had the money but i cant find work
im a brat
im a selfish punk i really should be smacked
my parents tried
til they got divorced cause i ruined their lives

prechorus
im a bad kid and i will survive
oh im a bad kid
dont know wrong from right know wrong from right
im a bad kid and this is my life one of the bad kids
dont know wrong from right this is my life

chorus
dont be insecure if your heart is pure
youre still good to me if youre a bad kid baby
dont be insecure if your heart is pure
youre still good to me if youre a bad kid baby
a bad kid baby
a bad kid baby
dont be insecure
