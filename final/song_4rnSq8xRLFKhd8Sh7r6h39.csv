love love love love
love love love love

verse 1
you say you aint got time for games
no more games
but the world got time for games with you
play your own
playing with your money and your heart
just admit you dont know what to do
ive seen a lot of things come and go
lots of pimps and tons of hoes
how this ends well never know

chorus
a king in his castle
a king of the hill
wasting his time
chasing cheap thrills
he knows its gonna cost him
god knows how much

verse 2
but you know you gotta pay to play pay to play
at the end of the day at the end of the day
playing with your money and your heart
theres got to be another way
see thundercat liveget tickets as low as 54you might also likechorus
a king in his castle
a king of the hill
wasting his time
chasing cheap thrills
he knows its gonna cost him
god knows how much

love love love love
