staring out into the wild blue yonder
so many thoughts to sit and ponder
bout life and love and lack of
and this emptiness in my heart
too old to be wild and free still
too young to be over the hill
should try to grow up
but who knows where to start

chorus
so i just sit right here and have another beer in mexico
do my best to waste another day
sit right here and have another beer in mexico
let the warm air melt these blues away

verse 2
sun comes up and sun sinks down
and i seen them both in this tourist town
up for days in a rage
just trying to search my soul
from the answers and the reasons why
im at these crossroads in my life
and i really dont know
which way to go

so i just sit right here and have another beer in mexico
do my best to waste another day
sit right here and have another beer in mexico
let the warm air melt these blues away

bridge
maybe ill settle down get married
or stay single and stay free
which road i travel
is still a mystery to me

chorus
so i just sit right here and have another beer in mexico
do my best to waste another day
sit right here and have another beer in mexico
let the warm air melt these blues away
