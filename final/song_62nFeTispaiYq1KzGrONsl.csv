i was born on a saturday
my dad he held me screaming in his arms
and he can talk like it was yesterday
when i got that holy water in my eye

prechorus
its alright is it just alright
see all those faces coming down
im trying not to let them down this time
babe is that alright
well i can still see the sun on the water
i can still feel your sunlight

chorus
and all i ever wanted was time
you know that all i ever wanted was time

verse 2
and i know that i come on strong
forgive me i just couldnt help myself
and i have changed but im better now
and i see you in this new and perfect light

prechorus
youre so fine youre oh so fine
see all those faces coming down
im trying not to let them down this time
babe is that alright
well i can still see the sun on the water
i can still feel your sunlight
