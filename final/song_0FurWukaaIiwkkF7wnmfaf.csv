wrote a letter to you and threw it away
spirit tried to call me i had no words to say
oh sister can you tell me if its gonna be okay

prechorus
the chains and bangles were ringing aloud
calling out without a sound

chorus
and she had witchcraft
and she drank from the craft

verse 2
her eyes are the opening to a soul
spirits lie where secrets can be told
yeah make her an offer your fortune can be sold

prechorus
the chains and bangles were ringing aloud
calling out without a sound

chorus
and she had witchcraft
and she drank from the craft
see wolfmother liveget tickets as low as 60you might also likeflute solo

prechorus
the chains and bangles were ringing aloud
calling out without a sound

chorus
and she had witchcraft
and she drank from the craft1embed"
