it doesnt mean youre weak
or that you got low self esteem
we all got hearts that forget why they beat
we are brilliant
we are unique
but we forget so effortlessly

prechorus
and when youre questioning your worth
in the way that we all do
and your version of amnesia starts to seep on through
and you know that you are great but you cant remember why
i will be there by your side

chorus
i will remind you i will remind you
i will be ill be your memory
i will remind you i will remind you
all you need is someone else to see
i will remind you i will remind you
i will be ill be your memory
i will remind you i will remind you
all you need is someone else to see
and it reminds you

we get a little bit lost
like ships at sea
we dont remember
were right where were supposed to be

and when youre questioning your worth
in the way that we all do

chorus
i will remind you i will remind you

a little bit of love from someone you trust
can bring you back to life a little bit of love
a little bit of love from someone you trust
can bring you back to life a little bit of love

can bring you back to life a little bit of love
a little bit of love from someone you trust
can bring you back to life a little bit of love
