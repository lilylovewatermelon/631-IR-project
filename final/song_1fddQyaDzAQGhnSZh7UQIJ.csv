i wanna start from the top
maybe like a doover
replace the voices in my head
with blind innocence

verse 1
i want a complete redo
maybe change my name
report the losses grab the claim
its a shame its such a shame
were pissing away our time
cause were pissing away these beers
no monumental moment ever came from saying
come on dude just take one more shot

chorus
try to try to forget
that your bones will dismantle
and the dreams you had
theyll collide with time
your unrequited love for life will surely
halt that im thinking way too much at night

verse 2
maybe i could just move away
or go extinct like triceratops
but i love loving watching movies
sitting back and also breathing
my family and friends would be crushed
but is it enough oh no its not enough
oh the future freaks me out but i guess i could just
curl up in a ball and think
you might also likechorus
try to try to forget
that your bones will dismantle
and the dreams you had
theyll collide with time
your unrequited love for life will surely
halt that im thinking way too much at night

outro
try to try to forget i wont be breaking any barriers
that your bones will dismantle ill keep thinking the future the future freaks me out
and the dreams you had
theyll collide with time
your unrequited love for life will surely i wont judge you if you think the same
halt that im thinking way too much at night so lets keep thinking well the future the future freaks us out2embed"
