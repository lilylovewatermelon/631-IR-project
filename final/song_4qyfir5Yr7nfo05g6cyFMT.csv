meet me there
with bundles of flowers
well wade through the hours
of cold winter
shell howl at the walls
tearing down doors
of time shelter as we go

verse 2
and promise me this
youll wait for me only
scared of the lonely arms
that surface far below these birds

bridge
and maybe just maybe ill come home

hook
oh who am i darling to you
who am i
will tell you stories of mine
who am i
oh who am i darling for you
who am i
could be a burden in time lonely
who am i to you
and who am i darling for you
who am i
could be a burden
and who am i darling to you
who am i
