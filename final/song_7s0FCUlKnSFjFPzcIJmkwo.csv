drip drop
gimme what you got
your talk is incredible
so so so unusual
you taste like surfing videos

verse 1
im going to read your mind
big dicks and big ol titties on the sly
say i got aries eyes
fuck no im a bonafide aquemini
ooh who are you hiding
white russians and dirty diamonds
you fake your shyness
i just wish that i could see through you

verse 2
cheap booze pepsi blue
you got bottles in from 2002
hot glue vape juice
hit undo how the hell are you so cool

chorus
drip drop
gimme what you got

waterfalls tearing you apart
