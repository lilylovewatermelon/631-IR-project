take the light
and darken everything around me
call the clouds
and listen closely im lost without you

chorus
call your name every day
when i feel so helpless
ive fallen down
but ill rise above this rise above this doubt

verse 2
hate the mind
regrets are better left unspoken
for all we know
this void will grow and everythings
in vain
distressing you though it leaves me open
feels so right
but ill end this all before it gets me

chorus
call your name every day
when i feel so helpless
ive fallen down
but ill rise above this rise above this
call your name every day
when i feel so helpless
ive fallen down
but ill rise above this rise above this doubt

ill mend myself before it gets me
ill mend myself before it gets me
ill mend myself before it gets me
ill mend myself before it gets me

chorus
call your name every day
when i feel so helpless
ive fallen down
and ill rise above this rise above this

that im feeling helpless
ive fallen down fallen down
but ill rise above this rise above this
rise above this rise above this doubt3embed"
