so i took my medication and i poured my trauma out
on some sadeyed middleaged mans overpriced new leather couch
and we argued about jesus finally found some middle ground
i said im cured

verse 2
and i divvied up my anger into thirty separate parts
keep the bad shit in my liver and the rest around my heart
im still angry at my parents for what their parents did to them
but its a start

prechorus
but i ignore things and i move sideways
til i forget what i felt in the first place
at the end of the day i know there are worse ways to stay alive

chorus
cause everyones growing and everyones healthy
im terrified that i might never have met me
oh if my engine works perfect on empty
i guess ill drive
i guess ill drive

verse 3
so i forgot my medication fell into a manic high
spent my savings at a lulu now im sufferin in style
why is pain so damn impatient aint like its got a place to be
keeps rushin me

but i ignore things and i move sideways
til i forget what i felt in the first place
at the end of the day i know there are worse ways to stay alive

chorus
cause everyones growing and everyones healthy
im terrified that i might never have met me
oh if my engine works perfect on empty
i guess ill drive

bridge
and if all my life was wasted
i dont mind ill watch it go
yeah its better to die numb than feel it all
oh if all my time was wasted
i dont mind ill watch it go
yeah its better to die numb than feel it all

prechorus
but i ignore things and i move sideways
until i forget what i felt in the first place
at the end of the day lord knows there are worse ways to stay alive

chorus
cause everyones growing and everyones healthy
im terrified that i might never have met me
oh if my engine works perfect on empty
i guess ill drive
i guess ill driveembed"
