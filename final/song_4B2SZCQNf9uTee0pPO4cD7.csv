verse
face down in the brown grass
shame shame on my brown ass
birds in the trees as we run through
and if im dead to the world what you gon do
what you gon do like i cant remember
shots fired rewind please girl be mine
email denied talk to me baby
before i go crazy might do it maybe
we were so jay z beyoncé
my aunt say keep the sex game picante
the aunt may and mary jane that i was hitting on
to make me try and forget that there was something wrong
love is russian roulette i had the safety on
we popped pills at the coachella
hold my head in the weeds man i cant tell her
the fear that i feel man it might kill her
man it might kill her its the prep school mic killer
with the drums and the groove so it feel dilla
i dont care what he say
ima get my platinum back like im a halfton gorilla
you can hang with homie on the low
but your boy so weak like a week ago
but we aint speaking though
we aint speaking we aint speaking though
you might also likechorus
tuesday afternoon i aint got shit to do
but fall in love with you she said she said she said
tuesday afternoon i aint got shit to do
but fall in love with you she said she said she said
love me better kiss me back
listen more oh she said she said she said
love me better kiss me back listen–

bridge
the attitude
the attitude
and i hope you understand
and i hope you understand
we were never friends
and i hope you understand now
but i miss them
and i hope you understand
and i hope you understand
oh no no no
and i hope you understand
and i hope you understand
and i hope you understand

outro
i hope you understand i hope you understand
cause everywhere i go
everything i see
i just hope you understand
