this point niggas aint catchin up get over that
touch me and we make you an organ donor
boy we overstrapped

verse 1
my niggas was broke we used to steal out the store
buyin and sharin our clothes

and i handle that wet like im back in the pit

verse 2
you niggas bug why niggas hittin me up
knowin i aint tryna talk dont hold bitches up
like baby right after we fuck
get up and go straight to the car
keep me low key
and control your nigga or that boy gon die in your arms
when i drop you off
dont expect a call until the next time i get hard
we aint gotta kick it
i dont owe yall niggas yall dont owe me shit
eight katanas with the steak and chicken
i was just choppin up meat sticks
i was just in a room with a nigga thatd kill over 34 cent
now im sittin in the coup with a nigga
just ran up 30 more strips bitch

refrain
count the money by myself
i dont need help with them bands

bulletproof all in the benz

uncomfortable with you behind me
my uncle got hit in the back of his head
verse 3
