youre a million miles away
but i can still see your face
i can still taste your lips from the kiss yesterday
i heard you left the other day
took another trip to outer space
i will chase you around the world

prechorus
i can still heal you
i can still feel you
i can still hear you
calling my name

chorus
ive been thinking about you
ive been dreaming about you
every night and everyday
i keep waiting on you
been praying for you
that maybe youll come back again someday
come back again someday

verse 2
should of been a piece of cake
but i guess it had to end this way
why is everything such a waste
i wanna keep holding on
holding on to what we got
but everything that we had is already gone
