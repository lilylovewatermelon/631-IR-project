now i dont wanna hate you
just wish youd never gone for the man
and waited two weeks at least
before youd let him take you
i stayed true kind of knew
you liked the dude from private school
hes waitin for the time to move
i knew he had his eyes on you
hes not the right guy for you
dont hate me cause i write the truth
no i would never lie to you
but it was never fine to lose you
and what a way to find out
it never came from my mouth
you never changed your mind
but you were just afraid to mind out
but  it
i wont be changin the subject i love it
ill make your little secret public
its nothin im just disgusted with the skeletons
you sleep with in your closet to get back at me
trapped and im lacking sleep
fact is youre mad at me
because i backtrack so casually
youre practically my family
if we married then ill guess youd have to be
but tragically our love just lost the will to live
but would it kill to give it one more shot
i think not

i dont love you baby
i dont need you baby
i dont want you no
anymore
i dont love you baby
i dont need you baby
i dont wanna love you no
anymore

verse 2
recently ill tend to zone out
up in my headphones to holocene
you promised your body but im away so much
i stay more celibate than in a monastery
im not cut out for life on the road
cause i didnt know id miss you this much
and at the time wed just go so sue me
i guess im not the man that you need
ever since you went to uni
ive been sofa surfing with a rucksack
full of less cash and i guess that could get bad
but when i broke the industry
thats when i broke your heart
i was supposed to chart and celebrate
but good things are over fast
i know its hard to deal with and see this
i tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
then i turn the music off
and all im left with is to pick up my personal pieces jesus
i never really want to believe this
got advice from my dad
and he told me that family is all ill ever have and need
i guess im unaware of it
success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with
chorus
i dont love you baby
i dont need you baby
i dont want you no
anymore
i dont love you baby
i dont need you baby
i dont wanna love you no
anymore

verse 3
and since you left ive given up my days off
its what i need to stay strong
i know you have a day job but mine is 247
i feel like writin a book i guess i lied in the hook
cause i still love you and i need you by my side if i could
the irony is if my career in music didnt exist
in six years yeah youd probably be my wife with a kid
im frightened to think if i depend on cider and drink
and lighting a spliff i fall into a spiral
and its just hidin my misguiding thoughts that im trying to kill
and ill be writin my will before im twentyseven ill die from a thrill
go down in history as just a wasted talent
can i face the challenge or did i make a mistake erasing 
its only therapy my thoughts just get ahead of me
eventually ill be fine i know that it was never meant to be
either way i guess im not prepared but ill say this
these things happen for a reason and you cant change 
take my apology im sorry for the honesty
but i had to get this off my chest
chorus
i dont love you baby
i dont need you baby
i dont want you no
anymore
i dont love you baby
i dont need you baby
i dont wanna love you no
anymore51embed"
