she don’t like small places
give her highways and byways
and don’t get stuck in her head
and it’s been so long
and i will read into everything you don’t say
all of your silent ways

prechorus
i’m a dog lying down on a warm bit of pavement
checking this collar you see what the name is
think that it’s worth it well i hope that you’re right
you’re falling asleep on the red eye tonight

chorus
and you know that you’re looking well
won’t you come through my door asking how was your day
and you know that i’m still a dog
and i’m trusting my nose will it show me the way

verse 2
i’m glad that you’re still here
won’t you hold up a candle
i’m stumbling in the dark
and when i needed hope
i remind myself that at least i got one thing right
itll always be right

chorus
and you know that you’re looking well
won’t you come through my door asking how was your day
well you know that i’m still a dog
and i’m trusting my nose will it show me the way

postchorus
won’t you get out while you can
won’t you cover your eyes if you’re tired of seeing
won’t you get out while you can
and try saving yourself

outro
can we talk in the morning
oh baby it’s late
can we talk in the morning
oh baby it’s late
can we talk in the morning
tell me when tell me when
oh baby it’s late

tell me when tell me when
