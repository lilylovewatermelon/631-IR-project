the mysteries of albertine — the girls whom she sees reflected in the glass — the other woman — the liftboy — madame de cambremer — the pleasures of m nissim bernard — outline of the strange character of morel — m de charlus dines with the verdurins

   in my fear lest the pleasure i found in this solitary excursion might weaken my memory of my grandmother i sought to revive this by thinking of some great mental suffering that she had undergone in response to my appeal that suffering tried to build itself in my heart threw up vast pillars there but my heart was doubtless too small for it i had not the strength to bear so great a grief my attention was distracted at the moment when it was approaching completion and its arches collapsed before joining as before they have perfected their curve the waves of the sea totter and break

   and yet if only from my dreams when i was asleep i might have learned that my grief for my grandmother’s death was diminishing for she appeared in them less crushed by the idea that i had formed of her nonexistence i saw her an invalid still but on the road to recovery i found her in better health and if she made any allusion to what she had suffered i stopped her mouth with my kisses and assured her that she was now permanently cured i should have liked to call the sceptics to witness that death is indeed a malady from which one recovers only i no longer found in my grandmother the rich spontaneity of old times her words were no more than a feeble docile response almost a mere echo of mine she was nothing more than the reflexion of my own thoughts

   incapable as i still was of feeling any fresh physical desire albertine was beginning nevertheless to inspire in me a desire for happiness certain dreams of shared affection always floating on the surface of our minds ally themselves readily by a sort of affinity with the memory provided that this has already become slightly vague of a woman with whom we have taken our pleasure this sentiment recalled to me aspects of albertine’s face more gentle less gay quite different from those that would have been evoked by physical desire and as it was also less pressing than that desire i would gladly have postponed its realisation until the following winter without seeking to see albertine again at balbec before her departure but even in the midst of a grief that is still keen physical desire will revive from my bed where i was made to spend hours every day resting i longed for albertine to come and resume our former amusements do we not see in the very room in which they have lost a child its parents soon come together again to give the little angel a baby brother i tried to distract my mind from this desire by going to the window to look at that day’s sea as in the former year the seas from one day to another were rarely the same nor however did they at all resemble those of that first year whether because we were now in spring with its storms or because even if i had come down at the same time as before the different more changeable weather might have discouraged from visiting this coast certain seas indolent vaporous and fragile which i had seen throughout long scorching days asleep upon the beach their bluish bosoms only faintly stirring with a soft palpitation or as was most probable because my eyes taught by elstir to retain precisely those elements that before i had deliberately rejected would now gaze for hours at what in the former year they had been incapable of seeing the contrast that used then to strike me so forcibly between the country drives that i took with mme de villeparisis and this proximity fluid inaccessible mythological of the eternal ocean no longer existed for me and there were days now when on the contrary the sea itself seemed almost rural on the days few and far between of really fine weather the heat had traced upon the waters as it might be across country a dusty white track at the end of which the pointed mast of a fishingboat stood up like a village steeple a tug of which one could see only the funnel was smoking in the distance like a factory amid the fields while alone against the horizon a convex patch of white sketched there doubtless by a sail but apparently a solid plastered surface made one think of the sunlit wall of some isolated building an hospital or a school and the clouds and the wind on days when these were added to the sun completed if not the error of judgment at any rate the illusion of the first glance the suggestion that it aroused in the imagination for the alternation of sharply defined patches of colour like those produced in the country by the proximity of different crops the rough yellow almost muddy irregularities of the marine surface the banks the slopes that hid from sight a vessel upon which a crew of nimble sailors seemed to be reaping a harvest all this upon stormy days made the ocean a thing as varied as solid as broken as populous as civilised as the earth with its carriage roads over which i used to travel and was soon to be travelling again and once unable any longer to hold out against my desire instead of going back to bed i put on my clothes and started off to incarville to find albertine i would ask her to come with me to douville where i would pay calls at féterne upon mme de cambremer and at la raspelière upon mme verdurin albertine would wait for me meanwhile upon the beach and we would return together after dark i went to take the train on the local light railway of which i had picked up the time before from albertine and her friends all the nicknames current in the district where it was known as thetwister because of its numberless windings the crawler because the train never seemed to move the transatlantic because of a horrible siren which it sounded to clear people off the line the decauville and the funi albeit there was nothing funicular about it but because it climbed the cliff and although not strictly speaking a decauville had a 60 centimetre gauge the b a g because it ran between balbec and grattevast via angerville the tram and the t s n because it was a branch of the tramways of southern normandy i took my seat in a compartment in which i was alone it was a day of glorious sunshine and stiflingly hot i drew down the blue blind which shut off all but a single ray of sunlight but immediately i beheld my grandmother as she had appeared sitting in the train on our leaving paris for balbec when in her sorrow at seeing me drink beer she had preferred not to look to shut her eyes and pretend to be asleep i who in my childhood had been unable to endure her anguish when my grandfather tasted brandy i had inflicted this anguish upon her not merely of seeing me accept at the invitation of another a drink which she regarded as bad for me i had forced her to leave me free to swill it down to my heart’s content worse still by my bursts of passion my choking fits i had forced her to help to advise me to do so with a supreme resignation of which i saw now in my memory the mute despairing image her eyes closed to shut out the sight so vivid a memory had like the stroke of a magic wand restored the mood that i had been gradually outgrowing for some time past what had i to do with rosemondé when my lips were wholly possessed by the desperate longing to kiss a dead woman what had i to say to the cambremers and verdurins when my heart was beating so violently because at every moment there was being renewed in it the pain that my grandmother had suffered i could not remain in the compartment as soon as the train stopped at mainevillelateinturiere abandoning all my plans i alighted maineville had of late acquired considerable importance and a reputation all its own because a director of various casinos a caterer in pleasure had set up just outside it with a luxurious display of bad taste that could vie with that of any smart hotel an establishment to which we shall return anon and which was to put it briefly the first brothel for ‘exclusive’ people that it had occurred to anyone to build upon the coast of france it was the only one true every port has its own but intended for sailors only and for lovers of the picturesque whom it amuses to see next door to the primeval parish church the bawd hardly less ancient venerable and mossgrown standing outside her illfamed door waiting for the return of the fishing fleet

   hurrying past the glittering house of ‘pleasure’ insolently erected there despite the protests which the heads of families had addressed in vain to the mayor i reached the cliff and followed its winding paths in the direction of balbec i heard without responding to it the appeal of the hawthorns neighbours in humbler circumstances of the blossoming apple trees they found them very coarse without denying the fresh complexion of the rosypetalled daughters of those wealthy brewers of cider they knew that with a lesser dowry they were more sought after and were attractive enough by themselves in their tattered whiteness

   on my return the hotel porter handed me a blackbordered letter in which the marquis and the marquise de gonneville the vicomte and the vicomtesse d’amfreville the comte and the comtesse de berneville the marquis and the marquise de graincourt the comte d’amenoncourt the comtesse de maineville the comte and the comtesse de franquetot the comtesse de chaverny née d’aigleville begged to announce and from which i understood at length why it had been sent to me when i caught sight of the names of the marquise de cambremer née du mesnil la guichard the marquis and the marquise de cambremer and saw that the deceased a cousin of the cambremers was named eléonoreeuphrasiehumbertine de cambremer comtesse de criquetot in the whole extent of this provincial family the enumeration of which filled the closely printed lines not a single commoner and on the other hand not a single title that one knew but the entire musterroll of the nobles of the region who made their names — those of all the interesting spots in the neighbourhood — ring out their joyous endings in ville in court sometimes on a duller note in tot garbed in the rooftiles of their castle or in the roughcast of their parish church their nodding heads barely reaching above the vault of the nave or banqueting hall and then only to cap themselves with the norman lantern or the dovecot of the pepperpot turret they gave the impression of having sounded the rallying call to all the charming villages straggling or scattered over a radius of fifty leagues and to have paraded them in massed formation without one absentee one intruder on the compact rectangular draughtboard of the aristocratic letter edged with black

   my mother had gone upstairs to her room meditating the phrase of madame de sévigné “i see nothing of the people who seek to distract me from you the truth of the matter is that they are seeking to prevent me from thinking of you and that annoys me”— because the chief magistrate had told her that she ought to find some distraction to me he whispered “that’s the princesse de parme” my fears were dispelled when i saw that the woman whom the magistrate pointed out to me bore not the slightest resemblance to her royal highness but as she had engaged a room in which to spend the night after paying a visit to mme de luxembourg the report of her coming had the effect upon many people of making them take each newcomer for the princesse de parme — and upon me of making me go and shut myself up in my attic

   i had no wish to remain there by myself it was barely four o’clock i asked françoise to go and find albertine so that she might spend the rest of the afternoon with me

   it would be untrue i think to say that there were already symptoms of that painful and perpetual mistrust which albertine was to inspire in me not to mention the special character emphatically gomorrhan which that mistrust was to assume certainly even that afternoon — but this was not the first time — i grew anxious as i was kept waiting françoise once she had started stayed away so long that i began to despair i had not lighted the lamp the daylight had almost gone the wind was making the flag over the casino flap and fainter still in the silence of the beach over which the tide was rising and like a voice rendering and enhancing the troubling emptiness of this restless unnatural hour a little barrel organ that had stopped outside the hotel was playing viennese waltzes at length françoise arrived but unaccompanied “i have been as quick as i could but she wouldn’t come because she didn’t think she was looking smart enough if she was five minutes painting herself and powdering herself she was an hour by the clock you’ll be having a regular scentshop in here she’s coming she stayed behind to tidy herself at the glass i thought i should find her here” there was still a long time to wait before albertine appeared but the gaiety the charm that she shewed on this occasion dispelled my sorrow she informed me in contradiction of what she had said the other day that she would be staying for the whole season and asked me whether we could not arrange as in the former year to meet daily i told her that at the moment i was too melancholy and that i would rather send for her from time to time at the last moment as i did in paris “if ever you’re feeling worried or feel that you want me do not hesitate” she told me “to send for me i shall come immediately and if you are not afraid of its creating a scandal in the hotel i shall stay as long as you like” françoise in bringing her to me had assumed the joyous air she wore whenever she had gone out of her way to please me and had been successful but albertine herself contributed nothing to her joy and the very next day françoise was to greet me with the profound observation “monsieur ought not to see that young lady i know quite well the sort she is she’ll land you in trouble” as i escorted albertine to the door i saw in the lighted diningroom the princesse de parme i merely gave her a glance taking care not to be seen but i must say that i found a certain grandeur in the royal politeness which had made me smile at the guermantes’ it is a fundamental rule that sovereign princes are at home wherever they are and this rule is conventionally expressed in obsolete and useless customs such as that which requires the host to carry his hat in his hand in his own house to shew that he is not in his own home but in the prince’s now the princesse de parme may not have formulated this idea to herself but she was so imbued with it that all her actions spontaneously invented to suit the circumstances pointed to it when she rose from table she handed a lavish tip to aimé as though he had been there solely for her and she were rewarding before leaving a country house a footman who had been detailed to wait upon her nor did she stop at the tip but with a gracious smile bestowed on him a few friendly flattering words with a store of which her mother had provided her another moment and she would have told him that just as the hotel was perfectly managed so normandy was a garden of roses and that she preferred france to any other country in the world another coin slipped from the princess’s fingers for the wine waiter for whom she had sent and to whom she made a point of expressing her satisfaction like a general after an inspection the liftboy had come up at that moment with a message for her he too received a little speech a smile and a tip all this interspersed with encouraging and humble words intended to prove to them that she was only one of themselves as aimé the wine waiter the liftboy and the rest felt that it would be impolite not to grin from ear to ear at a person who smiled at them she was presently surrounded by a cluster of servants with whom she chatted kindly such ways being unfamiliar in smart hotels the people who passed by not knowing who she was thought they beheld a permanent resident at balbec who because of her humble origin or for professional reasons she was perhaps the wife of an agent for champagne was less different from the domestics than the really smart visitors as for me i thought of the palace at parma of the counsels partly religious partly political given to this princess who behaved towards the lower orders as though she had been obliged to conciliate them in order to reign over them one day all the more as if she were already reigning

   i went upstairs again to my room but i was not alone there i could hear some one softly playing schumann no doubt it happens at times that people even those whom we love best become saturated with the melancholy or irritation that emanates from us there is nevertheless an inanimate object which is capable of a power of exasperation to which no human being will ever attain to wit a piano

   albertine had made me take a note of the dates on which she would be going away for a few days to visit various girl friends and had made me write down their addresses as well in case i should want her on one of those evenings for none of them lived very far away this meant that when i tried to find her going from one girl to another she became more and more entwined in ropes of flowers i must confess that many of her friends — i was not yet in love with her — gave me at one wateringplace or another moments of pleasure these obliging young comrades did not seem to me to be very many but recently i have thought it over their names have recurred to me i counted that in that one season a dozen conferred on me their ephemeral favours a name came back to me later which made thirteen i then with almost a child’s delight in cruelty dwelt upon that number alas i realised that i had forgotten the first of them all albertine who no longer existed and who made the fourteenth

   i had to resume the thread of my narrative written down the names and addresses of the girls with whom i should find her upon the days when she was not to be at incarville but privately had decided that i would devote those days rather to calling upon mme verdurin in any case our desire for different women varies in intensity one evening we cannot bear to let one out of our sight who after that for the next month or two will never enter our mind then there is the law of change for a study of which this is not the place under which after an overexertion of the flesh the woman whose image haunts our momentary senility is one to whom we would barely give more than a kiss on the brow as for albertine i saw her seldom and only upon the very infrequent evenings when i felt that i could not live without her if this desire seized me when she was too far from balbec for françoise to be able to go and fetch her i used to send the liftboy to egreville to la sogne to saintfrichoux asking him to finish his work a little earlier than usual he would come into my room but would leave the door open for albeit he was conscientious at his ‘job’ which was pretty hard consisting in endless cleanings from five o’clock in the morning he could never bring himself to make the effort to shut a door and if one were to remark to him that it was open would turn back and summoning up all his strength give it a gentle push with the democratic pride that marked him a pride to which in more liberal careers the members of a profession that is at all numerous never attain barristers doctors and men of letters speaking simply of a ‘brother’ barrister doctor or man of letters he employing and rightly a term that is confined to close corporations like the academy would say to me in speaking of a page who was in charge of the lift upon alternate days “i shall get my colleagueto take my place” this pride did not prevent him from accepting with a view to increasing what he called his ‘salary’ remuneration for his errands a fact which had made françoise take a dislike to him “yes the first time you see him you would give him the sacrament without confession but there are days when his tongue is as smooth as a prison door it’s your money he’s after” this was the category in which she had so often included eulalie and in which alas when i think of all the trouble that was one day to come of it she already placed albertine because she saw me often asking mamma on behalf of my impecunious friend for trinkets and other little presents which françoise held to be inexcusable because mme bontemps had only a general servant a moment later the liftboy having removed what i should have called his livery and he called his tunic appeared wearing a straw hat carrying a cane holding himself stiffly erect for his mother had warned him never to adopt the ‘workingclass’ or ‘pageboy’ style just as thanks to books all knowledge is open to a working man who ceases to be such when he has finished his work so thanks to a ‘boater’ hat and a pair of gloves elegance became accessible to the liftboy who having ceased for the evening to take the visitors upstairs imagined himself like a young surgeon who has taken off his overall or serjeant saintloup out of uniform a typical young man about town he was not for that matter lacking in ambition or in talent either in manipulating his machine and not bringing you to a standstill between two floors but his vocabulary was defective i credited him with ambition because he said in speaking of the porter under whom he served “my porter” in the same tone in which a man who owned what the page would have called a ‘private mansion’ in paris would have referred to his footman as for the liftboy’s vocabulary it is curious that anybody who heard people fifty times a day calling for the ‘lift’ should never himself call it anything but a ‘left’ there were certain things about this boy that were extremely annoying whatever i might be saying to him he would interrupt with a phrase “i should say so” or “i say” which seemed either to imply that my remark was so obvious that anybody would have thought of it or else to take all the credit for it to himself as though it were he that was drawing my attention to the subject “i should say so” or “i say” exclaimed with the utmost emphasis issued from his lips every other minute over matters to which he had never given a thought a trick which irritated me so much that i immediately began to say the opposite to shew him that he knew nothing about it but to my second assertion albeit it was incompatible with the first he replied none the less stoutly “i should say so” “i say” as though these words were inevitable i found it difficult also to forgive him the trick of employing certain terms proper to his calling which would therefore have sounded perfectly correct in their literal sense in a figurative sense only which gave them an air of feeble witticism for instance the verb to pedal he never used it when he had gone anywhere on his bicycle but if on foot he had hurried to arrive somewhere in time then to indicate that he had walked fast he would exclaim “i should say i didn’t half pedal” the liftboy was on the small side clumsily built and by no means good looking this did not prevent him whenever one spoke to him of some tall slim handsome young man from saying “oh yes i know a fellow who is just my height” and one day when i was expecting him to bring me the answer to a message hearing somebody come upstairs i had in my impatience opened the door of my room and caught sight of a page as beautiful as endymion with incredibly perfect features who was bringing a message to a lady whom i did not know when the liftboy returned in telling him how impatiently i had waited for the answer i mentioned to him that i had thought i heard him come upstairs but that it had turned out to be a page from the hôtel de normandie “oh yes i know” he said “they have only the one a boy about my build he’s so like me in face too that we’re always being mistaken anybody would think he was my brother” lastly he always wanted to appear to have understood you perfectly from the first second which meant that as soon as you asked him to do anything he would say “yes yes yes yes i understand all that” with a precision and a tone of intelligence which for some time deceived me but other people as we get to know them are like a metal dipped in an acid bath and we see them gradually lose their good qualities and their bad qualities too at times before giving him my instructions i saw that he had left the door open i pointed this out to him i was afraid that people might hear us he acceded to my request and returned having reduced the gap “anything to oblige but there’s nobody on this floor except us two” immediately i heard one then a second then a third person go by this annoyed me partly because of the risk of my being overheard but more still because i could see that it did not in the least surprise him and was a perfectly normal occurrence “yes that’ll be the maid next door going for her things oh that’s of no importance it’s the bottler putting away his keys no no it’s nothing you can say what you want it’s my colleague just going on duty” then as the reasons that all these people had for passing did not diminish my dislike of the thought that they might overhear me at a formal order from me he went not to shut the door which was beyond the strength of this bicyclist who longed for a ‘motor’ but to push it a little closer to “now we shall be quite quiet” so quiet were we that an american lady burst in and withdrew with apologies for having mistaken the number of her room “you are going to bring this young lady back with you” i told him after first going and banging the door with all my might which brought in another page to see whether a window had been left open “you remember the name mlle albertine simonet anyhow it’s on the envelope you need only say to her that it’s from me she will be delighted to come” i added to encourage him and preserve a scrap of my own selfesteem “i should say so” “not at all there is not the slightest reason to suppose that she will be glad to come it’s a great nuisance getting here from berneville” “i understand” “you will tell her to come with you” “yes yes yes yes i understand perfectly” he replied in that sharp precise tone which had long ceased to make a ‘good impression’ upon me because i knew that it was almost mechanical and covered with its apparent clearness plenty of uncertainty and stupidity “when will you be back” “haven’t any too much time” said the liftboy who carrying to extremes the grammatical rule that forbids the repetition of personal pronouns before coordinate verbs omitted the pronoun altogether “can go there all right leave was stopped this afternoon because there was a dinner for twenty at luncheon and it was my turn off duty today so it’s all right if i go out a bit this evening take my bike with me get there in no time” and an hour later he reappeared and said “monsieur’s had to wait but the young lady’s come with me she’s down below” “oh thanks very much the porter won’t be cross with me” “monsieur paul doesn’t even know where i’ve been the head of the door himself can’t say a word” but once after i had told him “you absolutely must bring her back with you” he reported to me with a smile “you know i couldn’t find her she’s not there couldn’t wait any longer was afraid of getting it like my colleague who was ‘missed from the hotel” for the liftboy who used the word ‘rejoin’ of a profession which one joined for the first time “i should like to rejoin the postoffice” to make up for this or to mitigate the calamity were his own career at stake or to insinuate it more delicately and treacherously were the victim some one else elided the prefix and said “i know he’s been ‘missed” it was not with any evil intent that he smiled but from sheer timidity he thought that he was diminishing the magnitude of his crime by making a joke of it in the same way if he had said to me “you know i couldn’t find her” this did not mean that he really thought that i knew it already on the contrary he was all too certain that i did not know it and what was more was afraid to tell me and so he said ‘you know’ to ward off the terror which menaced him as he uttered the words that were to bring me the knowledge we ought never to lose our tempers with people who when we find fault with them begin to titter they do so not because they are laughing at us but because they are trembling lest we should be angry let us shew all pity and tenderness to those who laugh for all the world like a stroke the liftboy’s anxiety had wrought in him not merely an apoplectic flush but an alteration in his speech which had suddenly become familiar he wound up by telling me that albertine was not at egreville that she would not be coming back there before nine o’clock and that if betimes which meant by chance she came back earlier my message would be given her and in any case she would be with me before one o’clock in the morning
    translator’s note in the french text of sodome et gomorrhe volume i ends at this point

   it was not this evening however that my cruel mistrust began to take solid form no to make no mystery about it although the incident did not occur until some weeks later it arose out of a remark made by cottard albertine and her friends had insisted that day upon dragging me to the casino at incarville where as luck would have it i should not have joined them having intended to go and see mme verdurin who had invited me again and again had i not been held up at incarville itself by a breakdown of the tram which it would take a considerable time to repair as i strolled up and down waiting for the men to finish working at it i found myself all of a sudden face to face with doctor cottard who had come to incarville to see a patient i almost hesitated to greet him as he had not answered any of my letters but friendship does not express itself in the same way in different people not having been brought up to observe the same fixed rules of behaviour as wellbred people cottard was full of good intentions of which one knew nothing even denying their existence until the day when he had an opportunity of displaying them he apologised had indeed received my letters had reported my whereabouts to the verdurins who were most anxious to see me and whom he urged me to go and see he even proposed to take me to them there and then for he was waiting for the little local train to take him back there for dinner as i hesitated and he had still some time before his train  for there was bound to be still a considerable delay i made him come with me to the little casino one of those that had struck me as being so gloomy on the evening of my first arrival now filled with the tumult of the girls who in the absence of male partners were dancing together andrée came sliding along the floor towards me i was meaning to go off with cottard in a moment to the verdurins’ when i definitely declined his offer seized by an irresistible desire to stay with albertine the fact was i had just heard her laugh and her laugh at once suggested the rosy flesh the fragrant portals between which it had just made its way seeming also as strong sensual and revealing as the scent of geraniums to carry with it some microscopic particles of their substance irritant and secret

   one of the girls a stranger to me sat down at the piano and andrée invited albertine to waltz with her happy in the thought that i was going to remain in this little casino with these girls i remarked to cottard how well they danced together but he taking the professional point of view of a doctor and with an illbreeding which overlooked the fact that they were my friends although he must have seen me shaking hands with them replied “yes but parents are very rash to allow their daughters to form such habits i should certainly never let mine come here are they nicelooking though i can’t see their faces there now look” he went on pointing to albertine and andrée who were waltzing slowly tightly clasped together “i have left my glasses behind and i don’t see very well but they are certainly keenly roused it is not sufficiently known that women derive most excitement from their breasts and theirs as you see are completely touching” and indeed the contact had been unbroken between the breasts of andrée and of albertine i do not know whether they heard or guessed cottard’s observation but they gently broke the contact while continuing to waltz at that moment andrée said something to albertine who laughed the same deep and penetrating laugh that i had heard before but all that it wafted to me this time was a feeling of pain albertine appeared to be revealing by it to be making andrée share some exquisite secret thrill it rang out like the first or the last strains of a ball to which one has not been invited i left the place with cottard distracted by his conversation thinking only at odd moments of the scene i had just witnessed this does not mean that cottard’s conversation was interesting it had indeed at that moment become bitter for we had just seen doctor du boulbon go past without noticing us he had come down to spend some time on the other side of balbec bay where he was greatly in demand now albeit cottard was in the habit of declaring that he did no professional work during the holidays he had hoped to build up a select practice along the coast a hope which du boulbon’s presence there doomed to disappointment certainly the balbec doctor could not stand in cottard’s way he was merely a thoroughly conscientious doctor who knew everything and to whom you could not mention the slightest irritation of the skin without his immediately prescribing in a complicated formula the ointment lotion or liniment that would put you right as marie gineste used to say in her charming speech he knew how to ‘charm’ cuts and sores but he was in no way eminent he had indeed caused cottard some slight annoyance the latter now that he was anxious to exchange his chair for that of therapeutics had begun to specialise in toxic actions these a perilous innovation in medicine give an excuse for changing the labels in the chemists’ shops where every preparation is declared to be in no way toxic unlike its substitutes and indeed to be disintoxicant it is the fashionable cry at the most there may survive below in illegible lettering like the faint trace of an older fashion the assurance that the preparation has been carefully disinfected toxic actions serve also to reassure the patient who learns with joy that his paralysis is merely a toxic disturbance now a grand duke who had come for a few days to balbec and whose eye was extremely swollen had sent for cottard who in return for a wad of hundredfranc notes the professor refused to see anyone for less had put down the inflammation to a toxic condition and prescribed a disintoxicant treatment as the swelling did not go down the grand duke fell back upon the general practitioner of balbec who in five minutes had removed a speck of dust the following day the swelling had gone a celebrated specialist in nervous diseases was however a more dangerous rival he was a rubicund jovial person since for one thing the constant society of nervous wrecks did not prevent him from enjoying excellent health but also so as to reassure his patients by the hearty merriment of his ‘good morning’ and ‘goodbye’ while quite ready to lend the strength of his muscular arms to fastening them in straitwaistcoats later on nevertheless whenever you spoke to him at a party whether of politics or of literature he would listen to you with a kindly attention as though he were saying “what is it all about” without at once giving an opinion as though it were a matter for consultation but anyhow he whatever his talent might be was a specialist and so the whole of cottard’s rage was heaped upon du boulbon but i soon bade goodbye to the verdurins’ professional friend and returned to balbec after promising him that i would pay them a visit before long

   the mischief that his remarks about albertine and andrée had done me was extreme but its worst effects were not immediately felt by me as happens with those forms of poisoning which begin to act only after a certain time

   albertine on the night after the liftboy had gone in search of her did not appear notwithstanding his assurances certainly personal charm is a less frequent cause of love than a speech such as “no this evening i shall not be free” we barely notice this speech if we are with friends we are gay all the evening a certain image never enters our mind during those hours it remains dipped in the necessary solution when we return home we find the plate developed and perfectly clear we become aware that life is no longer the life which we would have surrendered for a trifle the day before because even if we continue not to fear death we no longer dare think of a parting

   from however not one o’clock in the morning the limit fixed by the liftboy but three o’clock i no longer felt as in former times the anguish of seeing the chance of her coming diminish the certainty that she would not now come brought me a complete refreshing calm this night was simply a night like all the rest during which i did not see her such was the idea from which i started after which the thought that i should see her in the morning or some other day outlining itself upon the blank which i submissively accepted became pleasant sometimes during these nights of waiting our anguish is due to a drug which we have taken the sufferer misinterpreting his own symptoms thinks that he is anxious about the woman who fails to appear love is engendered in these cases as are certain nervous maladies by the inaccurate explanation of a state of discomfort an explanation which it is useless to correct at any rate so far as love is concerned a sentiment which whatever its cause is invariably in error

   next day when albertine wrote to me that she had only just got back to epreville and so had not received my note in time and was coming if she might to see me that evening behind the words of her letter as behind those that she had said to me once over the telephone i thought i could detect the presence of pleasures of people whom she had preferred to me once again i was stirred from head to foot by the painful longing to know what she could have been doing by the latent love which we always carry within us i almost thought for a moment that it was going to attach me to albertine but it confined itself to a stationary throbbing the last echo of which died away without the machine’s having been set in motion

   i had failed during my first visit to balbec — and perhaps for that matter andrée had failed equally — to understand albertine’s character i had put it down as frivolous but had not known whether our combined supplications might not succeed in keeping her with us and making her forego a gardenparty a donkey ride a picnic during my second visit to balbec i began to suspect that this frivolity was only for show the gardenparty a mere screen if not an invention she shewed herself in various colours in the following incident by which i mean the incident as seen by me from my side of the glass which was by no means transparent and without my having any means of determining what reality there was on the other side albertine was making me the most passionate protestations of affection she looked at the time because she had to go and call upon a lady who was at home it appeared every afternoon at five o’clock at infreville tormented by suspicion and feeling at the same time far from well i asked albertine i implored her to remain with me it was impossible and indeed she could wait only five minutes longer because it would annoy the lady who was far from hospitable highly susceptible and said albertine a perfect nuisance “but one can easily cut a call” “no my aunt has always told me that the chief thing is politeness” “but i have so often seen you being impolite” “it’s not the same thing the lady would be angry with me and would say nasty things about me to my aunt i’m pretty well in her bad books already she expects me to go and see her” “but if she’s at home every day” here albertine feeling that she was caught changed her line of argument “so she is at home every day but today i’ve made arrangements to meet some other girls there it will be less boring that way” “so then albertine you prefer this lady and your friends to me since rather than miss paying an admittedly boring call you prefer to leave me here alone sick and wretched” “i don’t care if it is boring i’m going for their sake i shall bring them home in my trap otherwise they won’t have any way of getting back” i pointed out to albertine that there were trains from infreville up to ten o’clock at night “quite true but don’t you see it is possible that we may be asked to stay to dinner she is very hospitable” “very well then you won’t” “i should only make my aunt angry” “besides you can dine with her and catch the ten o’clock train” “it’s cutting it rather fine” “then i can never go and dine in town and come back by train but listen albertine we are going to do something quite simple i feel thatthe fresh air will do me good since you can’t give up your lady i am going to come with you to infreville don’t be alarmed i shan’t go as far as the tour elisabeth” the lady’s villa “i shall see neither the lady nor your friends” albertine started as though she had received a violent blow for a moment she was unable to speak she explained that the sea bathing was not doing her any good “if you don’t want me to come with you” “how can you say such a thing you know there’s nothing i enjoy more than going out with you” a sudden change of tactics had occurred “since we are going for a drive together” she said to me “why not go out in the other direction we might dine together it would be so nice after all that side of balbec is much the prettier i’m getting sick of infreville and all those little spinachbed places” “but your aunt’s friend will be annoyed if you don’t go and see her” “very well let her be” “no it is wrong to annoy people” “but she won’t even notice that i’m not there she has people every day i can go tomorrow the next day next week the week after it’s exactly the same” “and what about your friends” “oh they’ve cut me often enough it’s my turn now” “but from the side you suggest there’s no train back after nine” “well what’s the matter with that nine will do perfectly besides one need never think about getting back we can always find a cart a bike if the worse comes to the worst we have legs” “we can always find albertine how you go on out infreville way where the villages run into one another well and good but the other way it’s a very different matter” “that way too i promise to bring you back safe and sound” i felt that albertine was giving up for my sake some plan arranged beforehand of which she refused to tell me and that there was some one else who would be as unhappy as i was seeing that what she had intended to do was out of the question since i insisted upon accompanying her she gave it up altogether she knew that the loss was not irremediable for like all women who have a number of irons in the fire she had one resource that never failed suspicion and jealousy of course she did not seek to arouse them quite the contrary but lovers are so suspicious that they instantly scent out falsehood with the result that albertine being no better than anyone else knew by experience without for a moment imagining that she owed her experience to jealousy that she could always be certain of meeting people again after she had failed to keep an appointment the stranger whom she was deserting for me would be hurt would love her all the more for that though albertine did not know that this was the reason and so as not to prolong the agony would return to her of his own accord as i should have done but i had no desire either to give pain to another or to tire myself or to enter upon the terrible course of investigation of multiform unending vigilance “no albertine i do not wish to spoil your pleasure go to your lady at infreville or rather to the person you really mean to see it is all the same to me the real reason why i am not coming with you is that you do not wish it the outing you would be taking with me is not the one you meant to take which is proved by your having contradicted yourself at least five times without noticing it” poor albertine was afraid that her contradictions which she had not noticed had been more serious than they were not knowing exactly what fibs she had told me “it is quite on the cards that i did contradict myself the sea air makes me lose my head altogether i’m always calling things by the wrong names” and what proved to me that she would not now require many tender affirmations to make me believe her i felt a stab in my heart as i listened to this admission of what i had but faintly imagined “very well that’s settled i’m off” she said in a tragic tone not without looking at the time to see whether she was making herself late for the other person now that i had provided her with an excuse for not spending the evening with myself “it’s too bad of you i alter all my plans to spend a nice long evening with you and it’s you that won’t have it and you accuse me of telling lies i’ve never known you to be so cruel the sea shall be my tomb i will never see you any more” my heart leaped at these words albeit i was certain that she would come again next day as she did “i shall drown myself i shall throw myself into the water” “like sappho” “there you go insulting me again you suspect not only what i say but what i do” “but my lamb i didn’t mean anything i swear to you you know sappho flung herself into the sea” “yes yes you have no faith in me” she saw that it was twenty minutes to the hour by the clock she was afraid of missing her appointment and choosing the shortest form of farewell for which as it happened she apologised by coming to see me again next day the other person presumably not being free then she dashed from the room crying “goodbye for ever” in a heartbroken tone and perhaps she was heartbroken for knowing what she was about at that moment better than i being at the same time more strict and more indulgent towards herself than i was towards her she may all the same have had a fear that i might refuse to see her again after the way in which she had left me and i believe that she was attached to me so much so that the other person was more jealous than i was

   some days later at balbec while we were in the ballroom of the casino there entered bloch’s sister and cousin who had both turned out quite pretty but whom i refrained from greeting on account of my girl friends because the younger one the cousin was notoriously living with the actress whose acquaintance she had made during my first visit andrée at a murmured allusion to this scandal said to me “oh about that sort of thing i’m like albertine there’s nothing we both loathe so much as that sort of thing” as for albertine on sitting down to talk to me upon the sofa she had turned her back on the disreputable pair i had noticed however that before she changed her position at the moment when mlle bloch and her cousin appeared my friend’s eyes had flashed with that sudden close attention which now and again imparted to the face of this frivolous girl a serious indeed a grave air and left her pensive afterwards but albertine had at once turned towards myself a gaze which nevertheless remained singularly fixed and meditative mlle bloch and her cousin having finally left the room after laughing and shouting in a loud and vulgar manner i asked albertine whether the little fair one the one who was so intimate with the actress was not the girl who had won the prize the day before in the procession of flowers “i don’t know” said albertine “is one of them fair i must confess they don’t interest me particularly i have never looked at them is one of them fair” she asked her three girl friends with a detached air of inquiry when applied to people whom albertine passed every day on the front this ignorance seemed to me too profound to be genuine “they didn’t appear to be looking at us much either” i said to albertine perhaps on the assumption which i did not however consciously form that albertine loved her own sex to free her from any regret by pointing out to her that she had not attracted the attention of these girls and that generally speaking it is not customary even for the most vicious of women to take an interest in girls whom they do not know “they weren’t looking at us” was albertine’s astonished reply “why they did nothing else the whole time” “but you can’t possibly tell” i said to her “you had your back to them” “very well and what about that” she replied pointing out to me set in the wall in front of us a large mirror which i had not noticed and upon which i now realised that my friend while talking to me had never ceased to fix her troubled preoccupied eyes

   ever since the day when cottard had accompanied me into the little casino at incarville albeit i did not share the opinion that he had expressed albertine had seemed to me different the sight of her made me lose my temper i myself had changed quite as much as she had changed in my eyes i had ceased to bear her any good will to her face behind her back when there was a chance of my words being repeated to her i spoke of her in the most insulting language there were however intervals of calmer feeling one day i learned that albertine and andrée had both accepted an invitation to elstir’s feeling certain that this was in order that they might on the return journey amuse themselves like schoolgirls on holiday by imitating the manners of fast young women and in so doing find an unmaidenly pleasure the thought of which wrung my heart without announcing my intention to embarrass them and to deprive albertine of the pleasure on which she was reckoning i paid an unexpected call at his studio but i found only andrée there albertine had chosen another day when her aunt was to go there with her then i said to myself that cottard must have been mistaken the favourable impression that i received from andrée’s presence there without her friend remained with me and made me feel more kindly disposed towards albertine but this feeling lasted no longer than the healthy moments of delicate people subject to passing maladies who are prostrated again by the merest trifle albertine incited andrée to actions which without going very far were perhaps not altogether innocent pained by this suspicion i managed in the end to repel it no sooner was i healed of it than it revived under another form i had just seen andrée with one of those graceful gestures that came naturally to her lay her head coaxingly on albertine’s shoulder kiss her on the throat half shutting her eyes or else they had exchanged a glance a remark had been made by somebody who had seen them going down together to bathe little trifles such as habitually float in the surrounding atmosphere where the majority of people absorb them all day long without injury to their health or alteration of their mood but which have a morbid effect and breed fresh sufferings in a nature predisposed to receive them sometimes even without my having seen albertine again without anyone’s having spoken to me about her there would flash from my memory some vision of her with gisèle in an attitude which had seemed to me innocent at the time it was enough now to destroy the peace of mind that i had managed to recover i had no longer any need to go and breathe dangerous germs outside i had as cottard would have said supplied my own toxin i thought then of all that i had been told about swann’s love for odette of the way in which swann had been tricked all his life indeed when i come to think of it the hypothesis that made me gradually build up the whole of albertine’s character and give a painful interpretation to every moment of a life that i could not control in its entirety was the memory the rooted idea of mme swann’s character as it had been described to me these accounts helped my imagination in after years to take the line of supposing that albertine might instead of being a good girl have had the same immorality the same faculty of deception as a reformed prostitute and i thought of all the sufferings that would in that case have been in store for me had i ever really been her lover

   one day outside the grand hotel where we were gathered on the front i had just been addressing albertine in the harshest most humiliating language and rosemonde was saying “oh how you have changed your mind about her why she used to be everything it was she who ruled the roost and now she isn’t even fit to be thrown to the dogs” i was beginning in order to make my attitude towards albertine still more marked to say all the nicest things i could think of to andrée who if she was tainted with the same vice seemed to me to have more excuse for it since she was sickly and neurasthenic when we saw emerging at the steady trot of its pair of horses into the street at right angles to the front at the corner of which we were standing mme de cambremer’s barouche the chief magistrate who at that moment was advancing towards us sprang back upon recognising the carriage in order not to be seen in our company then when he thought that the marquise’s eye might catch his bowed to her with an immense sweep of his hat but the carriage instead of continuing as might have been expected along the rue de la mer disappeared through the gate of the hotel it was quite ten minutes later when the liftboy out of breath came to announce to me “it’s the marquise de camembert she’s come here to see monsieur i’ve been up to the room i looked in the readingroom i couldn’t find monsieur anywhere luckily i thought of looking on the beach” he had barely ended this speech when followed by her daughterinlaw and by an extremely ceremonious gentleman the marquise advanced towards me coming on probably from some afternoon teaparty in the neighbourhood and bowed down not so much by age as by the mass of costly trinkets with which she felt it more sociable and more befitting her rank to cover herself in order to appear as ‘well dressed’ as possible to the people whom she went to visit it was in fact that ‘landing’ of the cambremers at the hotel which my grandmother had so greatly dreaded long ago when she wanted us not to let legrandin know that we might perhaps be going to balbec then mamma used to laugh at these fears inspired by an event which she considered impossible and here it was actually happening but by different channels and without legrandin’s having had any part in it “do you mind my staying here if i shan’t be in your way” asked albertine in whose eyes there lingered brought there by the cruel things i had just been saying to her a pair of tears which i observed without seeming to see them but not without rejoicing inwardly at the sight “there is something i want to say to you” a hat with feathers itself surmounted by a sapphire pin was perched haphazard upon mme de cambremer’s wig like a badge the display of which was necessary but sufficient its place immaterial its elegance conventional and its stability superfluous notwithstanding the heat the good lady had put on a jet cloak like a dalmatic over which hung an ermine stole the wearing of which seemed to depend not upon the temperature and season but upon the nature of the ceremony and on mme de cambremer’s bosom a baronial torse fastened to a chain dangled like a pectoral cross the gentleman was an eminent lawyer from paris of noble family who had come down to spend a few days with the cambremers he was one of those men whom their vast professional experience inclines to look down upon their profession and who say for instance “i know that i am a good pleader so it no longer amuses me to plead” or “i’m no longer interested in operating i know that i’m a good operator” men of intelligence artists they see themselves in their maturity richly endowed by success shining with that intellect that artistic nature which their professional brethren recognise in them and which confer upon them a kind of taste and discernment they form a passion for the paintings not of a great artist but of an artist who nevertheless is highly distinguished and spend upon the purchase of his work the large sums that their career procures for them le sidaner was the artist chosen by the cambremers’ friend who incidentally was a delightful person he talked well about books but not about the books of the true masters those who have mastered themselves the only irritating habit that this amateur displayed was his constant use of certain ready made expressions such as ‘for the most part’ which gave an air of importance and incompleteness to the matter of which he was speaking madame de cambremer had taken the opportunity she told me of a party which some friends of hers had been giving that afternoon in the balbec direction to come and call upon me as she had promised robert de saintloup “you know he’s coming down to these parts quite soon for a few days his uncle charlus is staying near here with his sisterinlaw the duchesse de luxembourg and m de saintloup means to take the opportunity of paying his aunt a visit and going to see his old regiment where he is very popular highly respected we often have visits from officers who are never tired of singing his praises how nice it would be if you and he would give us the pleasure of coming together to féterne” i presented albertine and her friends mme de cambremer introduced us all to her daughterinlaw the latter so frigid towards the petty nobility with whom her seclusion at féterne forced her to associate so reserved so afraid of compromising herself held out her hand to me with a radiant smile safe as she felt herself and delighted at seeing a friend of robert de saintloup whom he possessing a sharper social intuition than he allowed to appear had mentioned to her as being a great friend of the guermantes so unlike her motherinlaw mme de cambremer employed two vastly different forms of politeness it was at the most the former kind dry insupportable that she would have conceded me had i met her through her brother legrandin but for a friend of the guermantes she had not smiles enough the most convenient room in the hotel for entertaining visitors was the readingroom that place once so terrible into which i now went a dozen times every day emerging freely my own master like those mildly afflicted lunatics who have so long been inmates of an asylum that the superintendent trusts them with a latchkey and so i offered to take mme de cambremer there and as this room no longer filled me with shyness and no longer held any charm for me since the faces of things change for us like the faces of people it was without the slightest emotion that i made this suggestion but she declined it preferring to remain out of doors and we sat down in the open air on the terrace of the hotel i found there and rescued a volume of madame de sévigné which mamma had not had time to carry off in her precipitate flight when she heard that visitors had called for me no less than my grandmother she dreaded these invasions of strangers and in her fear of being too late to escape if she let herself be seen would fly from the room with a rapidity which always made my father and me laugh at her madame de cambremer carried in her hand with the handle of a sunshade a number of embroidered bags a holdall a gold purse from which there dangled strings of garnets and a lace handkerchief i could not help thinking that it would be more convenient for her to deposit them on a chair but i felt that it would be unbecoming and useless to ask her to lay aside the ornaments of her pastoral visitation and her social priesthood we gazed at the calm sea upon which here and there a few gulls floated like white petals because of the ‘mean level’ to which social conversation reduces us and also of our desire to attract not by means of those qualities of which we are ourselves unaware but of those which we suppose ought to be appreciated by the people who are with us i began instinctively to talk to mme de cambremer née legrandin in the strain in which her brother might have talked “they appear” i said referring to the gulls “as motionless and as white as waterlilies” and indeed they did appear to be offering a lifeless object to the little waves which tossed them about so much so that the waves by contrast seemed in their pursuit of them to be animated by a deliberate intention to have acquired life the dowager marquise could not find words enough to do justice to the superb view of the sea that we had from balbec or to say how she envied it she who from la raspelière where for that matter she was not living that year had only such a distant glimpse of the waves she had two remarkable habits due at once to her exalted passion for the arts especially for the art of music and to her want of teeth whenever she talked of aesthetic subjects her salivary glands — like those of certain animals when in rut — became so overcharged that the old lady’s edentulous mouth allowed to escape from the corners of her faintly moustached lips a trickle of moisture for which that was not the proper place immediately she drew it in again with a deep sigh like a person recovering his breath secondly if her subject were some piece of music of surpassing beauty in her enthusiasm she would raise her arms and utter a few decisive opinions vigorously chewed and at a pinch issuing from her nose now it had never occurred to me that the vulgar beach at balbec could indeed offer a ‘seascape’ and mme de cambremer’s simple words changed my ideas in that respect on the other hand as i told her i had always heard people praise the matchless view from la raspelière perched on the summit of the hill where in a great drawingroom with two fireplaces one whole row of windows swept the gardens and through the branches of the trees the sea as far as balbec and beyond it and the other row the valley “how nice of you to say so and how well you put it the sea through the branches it is exquisite one would say    a painted fan” and i gathered from a deep breath intended to catch the falling spittle and dry the moustaches that the compliment was sincere but the marquise née legrandin remained cold to shew her contempt not for my words but for those of her motherinlaw besides she not only despised the other’s intellect but deplored her affability being always afraid that people might not form a sufficiently high idea of the cambremers “and how charming the name is” said i “one would like to know the origin of all those names” “that one i can tell you” the old lady answered modestly “it is a family place it came from my grandmother arrachepel not an illustrious family but a decent and very old country stock” “what not illustrious” her daughterinlaw tartly interrupted her “a whole window in bayeux cathedral is filled with their arms and the principal church at avranches has their tombs if these old names interest you” she added “you’ve come a year too late we managed to appoint to the living of criquetot in spite of all the difficulties about changing from one diocese to another the parish priest of a place where i myself have some land a long way from here combray where the worthy cleric felt that he was becoming neurasthenic unfortunately the sea air was no good to him at his age his neurasthenia grew worse and he has returned to combray but he amused himself while he was our neighbour in going about looking up all the old charters and he compiled quite an interesting little pamphlet on the place names of the district it has given him a fresh interest too for it seems he is spending his last years in writing a great work upon combray and its surroundings i shall send you his pamphlet on the surroundings of féterne it is worthy of a benedictine you will find the most interesting things in it about our old raspelière of which my motherinlaw speaks far too modestly” “in any case this year” replied the dowager mme de cambremer “la raspelière is no longer ours and does not belong to me but i can see that you have a painter’s instincts i am sure you sketch and i should so like to shew you féterne which is far finer than la raspelière” for as soon as the cambremers had let this latter residence to the verdurins its commanding situation had at once ceased to appear to them as it had appeared for so many years past that is to say to offer the advantage without parallel in the neighbourhood of looking out over both sea and valley and had on the other hand suddenly and retrospectively presented the drawback that one had always to go up or down hill to get to or from it in short one might have supposed that if mme de cambremer had let it it was not so much to add to her income as to spare her horses and she proclaimed herself delighted at being able at last to have the sea always so close at hand at féterne she who for so many years forgetting the two months that she spent there had seen it only from up above and as though in a panorama “i am discovering it at my age” she said “and how i enjoy it it does me a world of good i would let la raspelière for nothing so as to be obliged to live at féterne”

    “to return to more interesting topics” went on legrandin’s sister who addressed the old marquise as ‘mother’ but with the passage of years had come to treat her with insolence “you mentioned waterlilies i suppose you know claude monet’s pictures of them what a genius they interest me particularly because near combray that place where i told you i had some land    ” but she preferred not to talk too much about combray “why that must be the series that elstir told us about the greatest painter of this generation” exclaimed albertine who had said nothing so far “ah i can see that this young lady loves the arts” cried mme de cambremer and drawing a long breath recaptured a trail of spittle “you will allow me to put le sidaner before him mademoiselle” said the lawyer smiling with the air of an expert and as he had enjoyed or seen people enjoy years ago certain ‘daring’ work by elstir he added “elstir was gifted indeed he was one of the advance guard but for some reason or other he never kept up he has wasted his life” mme de cambremer disagreed with the lawyer so far as elstir was concerned but greatly to the annoyance of her guest bracketed monet with le sidaner it would be untrue to say that she was a fool she was overflowing with a kind of intelligence that meant nothing to me as the sun was beginning to set the seagulls were now yellow like the waterlilies on another canvas of that series by monet i said that i knew it and continuing to copy the diction of her brother whom i had not yet dared to name added that it was a pity that she had not thought of coming a day earlier for at the same hour there would have been a poussin light for her to admire had some norman squireen unknown to the guermantes told her that she ought to have come a day earlier mme de cambremerlegrandin would doubtless have drawn herself up with an offended air but i might have been far more familiar still and she would have been all smiles and sweetness i might in the warmth of that fine afternoon devour my fill of that rich honey cake which mme de cambremer so rarely was and which took the place of the dish of pastry that it had not occurred to me to offer my guests but the name of poussin without altering the amenity of the society lady called forth the protests of the connoisseur on hearing that name she produced six times in almost continuous succession that little smack of the tongue against the lips which serves to convey to a child who is misbehaving at once a reproach for having begun and a warning not to continue “in heaven’s name after a painter like monet who is an absolute genius don’t go and mention an old hack without a vestige of talent like poussin i don’t mind telling you frankly that i find him the deadliest bore i mean to say you can’t really call that sort of thing painting monet degas manet yes there are painters if you like it is a curious thing” she went on fixing a scrutinous and ecstatic gaze upon a vague point in space where she could see what was in her mind “it is a curious thing i used at one time to prefer manet nowadays i still admire manet of course but i believe i like monet even more oh the cathedrals” she was as scrupulous as she was condescending in informing me of the evolution of her taste and one felt that the phases through which that taste had evolved were not in her eyes any less important than the different manners of monet himself not that i had any reason to feel flattered by her taking me into her confidence as to her preferences for even in the presence of the narrowest of provincial ladies she could not remain for five minutes without feeling the need to confess them when a noble dame of avranches who would have been incapable of distinguishing between mozart and wagner said in mme de cambremer’s hearing “we saw nothing of any interest while we were in paris we went once to the opéracomique they were doing pelléas et mélisande it’s dreadful stuff” mme de cambremer not only boiled with rage but felt obliged to exclaim “not at all it’s a little gem” and to ‘argue the point’ it was perhaps a combray habit which she had picked up from my grandmother’s sisters who called it ‘fighting in the good cause’ and loved the dinnerparties at which they knew all through the week that they would have to defend their idols against the philistines similarly mme de cambremer liked to ‘fly into a passion’ and wrangle about art as other people do about politics she stood up for debussy as she would have stood up for a woman friend whose conduct had been criticised she must however have known very well that when she said “not at all it’s a little gem” she could not improvise in the other lady whom she was putting in her place the whole progressive development of artistic culture on the completion of which they would come naturally to an agreement without any need of discussion “i must ask le sidaner what he thinks of poussin” the lawyer remarked to me “he’s a regular recluse never opens his mouth but i know how to get things out of him”

    “anyhow” mme de cambremer went on “i have a horror of sunsets they’re so romantic so operatic that is why i can’t abide my motherinlaw’s house with its tropical plants you will see it it’s just like a public garden at montecarlo that’s why i prefer your coast here it is more sombre more sincere there’s a little lane from which one doesn’t see the sea on rainy days there’s nothing but mud it’s a little world apart it’s just the same at venice i detest the grand canal and i don’t know anything so touching as the little alleys but it’s all a question of one’s surroundings” “but” i remarked to her feeling that the only way to rehabilitate poussin in mme de cambremer’s eyes was to inform her that he was once more in fashion “m degas assures us that he knows nothing more beautiful than the poussins at chantilly” “indeed i don’t know the ones at chantilly” said mme de cambremer who had no wish to differ from degas “but i can speak about the ones in the louvre which are appalling” “he admires them immensely too” “i must look at them again my impressions of them are rather distant” she replied after a moment’s silence and as though the favourable opinion which she was certain before very long to form of poussin would depend not upon the information that i had just communicated to her but upon the supplementary and this time final examination that she intended to make of the poussins in the louvre in order to be in a position to change her mind contenting myself with what was a first step towards retraction since if she did not yet admire the poussins she was adjourning the matter for further consideration in order not to keep her on tenterhooks any longer i told her motherinlaw how much i had heard of the wonderful flowers at féterne in modest terms she spoke of the little presbytery garden that she had behind the house into which in the mornings by simply pushing open a door she went in her wrapper to feed her peacocks hunt for newlaid eggs and gather the zinnias or roses which on the sideboard framing the creamed eggs or fried fish in a border of flowers reminded her of her garden paths “it is true we have a great many roses” she told me “our rose garden is almost too near the house there are days when it makes my head ache it is nicer on the terrace at la raspelière where the breeze carries the scent of the roses but it is not so heady” i turned to her daughterinlaw “it is just like pelléas” i said to her to gratify her taste for the modern “that scent of roses wafted up to the terraces it is so strong in the score that as i suffer from hayfever and rosefever it sets me sneezing every time i listen to that scene”
    “what a marvellous thing pelléas is” cried mme de cambremer “i’m mad about it” and drawing closer to me with the gestures of a savage woman seeking to captivate me using her fingers to pick out imaginary notes she began to hum something which i supposed represented to her the farewells of pelléas and continued with a vehement persistence as though it had been important that mme de cambremer should at that moment remind me of that scene or rather should prove to me that she herself remembered it “i think it is even finer than parsifal” she added “because in parsifal the most beautiful things are surrounded with a sort of halo of melodious phrases which are bad simply because they are melodious” “i know you are a great musician madame” i said to the dowager “i should so much like to hear you play” mme de cambremerlegrandin gazed at the sea so as not to be drawn into the conversation being of the opinion that what her motherinlaw liked was not music at all she regarded the talent a sham talent according to her though in reality of the very highest order that the other was admitted to possess as a technical accomplishment devoid of interest it was true that chopin’s only surviving pupil declared and with justice that the master’s style of playing his ‘feeling’ had been transmitted through herself to mme de cambremer alone but to play like chopin was far from being a recommendation in the eyes of legrandin’s sister who despised nobody so much as the polish composer “oh they are flying away” exclaimed albertine pointing to the gulls which casting aside for a moment their flowery incognito were rising in a body towards the sun “their giant wings from walking hinder them” quoted mme de cambremer confusing the seagull with the albatross “i do love them i used to see them at amsterdam” said albertine “they smell of the sea they come and breathe the salt air through the paving stones even” “oh so you have been in holland you know the vermeers” mme de cambremer asked imperiously in the tone in which she would have said “you know the guermantes” for snobbishness in changing its subject does not change its accent albertine replied in the negative thinking that they were living people but her mistake was not apparent “i should be delighted to play to you” mme de cambremer said to me “but you know i only play things that no longer appeal to your generation i was brought up in the worship of chopin” she said in a lowered tone for she was afraid of her daughterinlaw and knew that to the latter who considered that chopin was not music playing him well or badly were meaningless terms she admitted that her motherinlaw had technique was a finished pianist “nothing will ever make me say that she is a musician” was mme de cambremerlegrandin’s conclusion because she considered herself ‘advanced’ because hi matters of art only “one could never move far enough to the left” she said she maintained not merely that music progressed but that it progressed along one straight line and that debussy was in a sense a superwagner slightly more advanced again than wagner she did not take into account the fact that if debussy was not as independent of wagner as she herself was to suppose in a few years’ time because we must always make use of the weapons that we have captured to free ourselves finally from the foe whom we have for the moment overpowered he was seeking nevertheless after the feeling of satiety that people were beginning to derive from work that was too complete in which everything was expressed to satisfy an opposite demand there were theories of course to support this reaction for the time being like those theories which in politics come to the support of the laws against religious communities of wars in the east unnatural teaching the yellow peril etc etc people said that an age of speed required rapidity in art precisely as they might have said that the next war could not last longer than a fortnight or that the coming of railways would kill the little places beloved of the coaches which the motorcar for all that was to restore to favour composers were warned not to strain the attention of their audience as though we had not at our disposal different degrees of attention among which it rests precisely with the artist himself to arouse the highest for the people who yawn with boredom after ten lines of a mediocre article have journeyed year after year to bayreuth to listen to the ring besides the day was to come when for a season debussy would be pronounced as trivial as massenet and the trills of mélisande degraded to the level of manon’s for theories and schools like microbes and corpuscles devour one another and by their warfare ensure the continuity of existence but that time was still to come

   as on the stock exchange when a rise occurs a whole group of securities benefit by it so a certain number of despised composers were gaining by the reaction either because they did not deserve such scorn or simply — which enabled one to be original when one sang their praises — because they had incurred it and people even went the length of seeking out in an isolated past men of independent talent upon whose reputation the present movement did not seem calculated to have any influence but of whom one of the new masters was understood to have spoken favourably often it was because a master whoever he may be however exclusive his school judges in the light of his own untutored instincts does justice to talent wherever it be found or rather not so much to talent as to some agreeable inspiration which he has enjoyed in the past which reminds him of a precious moment in his adolescence or it may be because certain artists of an earlier generation have in some fragment of their work realised something that resembles what the master has gradually become aware that he himself meant at one time to create then he sees the old master as a sort of precursor he values in him under a wholly different form an effort that is momentarily partially fraternal there are bits of turner in the work of poussin we find a phrase of flaubert in montesquieu sometimes again this rumoured predilection of the master was due to an error starting heaven knows where and circulated through the school but in that case the name mentioned profited by the auspices under which it was introduced in the nick of time for if there is an element of free will some genuine taste expressed in the master’s choice the schools themselves go only by theory thus it is that the mind following its habitual course which advances by digression inclining first in one direction then in the other had brought back into the light of day a number of works to which the need for justice or for a renewal of standards or the taste of debussy or his caprice or some remark that he had perhaps never made had added the works of chopin commended by the judges in whom one had entire confidence profiting by the admiration that was aroused by pelléas they had acquired a fresh lustre and even the people who had not heard them again were so anxious to admire them that they did so in spite of themselves albeit preserving the illusion of free will but mme de cambremerlegrandin spent part of the year in the country even in paris being an invalid she was largely confined to her own room it is true that the drawbacks of this mode of existence were noticeable chiefly in her choice of expressions which she supposed to be fashionable and which would have been more appropriate to the written language a distinction that she did not perceive for she derived them more from reading than from conversation the latter is not so necessary for an exact knowledge of current opinion as of the latest expressions unfortunately this revival of the nocturnes had not yet been announced by the critics the news of it had been transmitted only by word of mouth among the ‘younger’ people it remained unknown to mme de cambremerlegrandin i gave myself the pleasure of informing her but by addressing my remark to her motherinlaw as when at billiards in order to hit a ball one aims at the cushion that chopin so far from being out of date was debussy’s favourite composer “indeed that’s quaint” said the daughterinlaw with a subtle smile as though it had been merely a deliberate paradox on the part of the composer of pelléas nevertheless it was now quite certain that in future she would always listen to chopin with respect and even pleasure moreover my words which had sounded the hour of deliverance for the dowager produced on her face an expression of gratitude to myself and above all of joy her eyes shone like the eyes of latude in the play entitled latude or thirtyfive years in captivity and her bosom inhaled the sea air with that dilatation which beethoven has so well described in fidelio at the point where his prisoners at last breathe again ‘this lifegiving air’ as for the dowager i thought that she was going to press her hirsute lips to my cheek “what you like chopin he likes chopin he likes chopin” she cried with a nasal trumpettone of passion she might have been saying “what you know mme de franquetot too” with this difference that my relations with mme de franquetot would have left her completely indifferent whereas my knowledge of chopin plunged her in a sort of artistic delirium her salivary supersecretion no longer sufficed not having attempted even to understand the part played by debussy in the rediscovery of chopin she felt only that my judgment of him was favourable her musical enthusiasm overpowered her “elodie elodie he likes chopin” her bosom rose and she beat the air with her arms “ah i knew at once that you were a musician” she cried “i can quite understand an artist such as you are liking him he’s so lovely” and her voice was as pebbly as if to express her ardour for chopin she had copied demosthenes and filled her mouth with all the shingle on the beach then came the turn of the tide reaching as far as her veil which she had not time to lift out of harm’s way and which was flooded and lastly the marquise wiped away with her embroidered handkerchief the tidemark of foam in which the memory of chopin had steeped her moustaches

    “good heavens” mme de cambremerlegrandin remarked to me “i’m afraid my motherinlaw’s cutting it rather fine she’s forgotten that we’ve got my uncle de ch’nouville dining besides cancan doesn’t like to be kept waiting” the word ‘cancan’ was beyond me and i supposed that she might perhaps be referring to a dog but as for the ch’nouville relatives the explanation was as follows with the lapse of time the young marquise had outgrown the pleasure that she had once found in pronouncing their name in this manner and yet it was the prospect of enjoying that pleasure that had decided her choice of a husband in other social circles when one referred to the chenouville family the custom was whenever that is to say the particle was preceded by a word ending in a vowel sound for otherwise you were obliged to lay stress upon the de the tongue refusing to utter madam’ d’ch’nonceaux that it was the mute e of the particle that was sacrificed one said “monsieur d’chenouville” the cambremer tradition was different but no less imperious it was the mute e of chenouville that was suppressed whether the name was preceded by mon cousin or by ma cousine it was always de chenouvilleand never de chenouville of the father of these chenouvilles one said ‘our uncle’ for they were not sufficiently ‘smart set’ at féterne to pronounce the word ‘unk’ like the guermantes whose deliberate jargon suppressing consonants and naturalising foreign words was as difficult to understand as old french or a modern dialect every newcomer into the family circle at once received in the matter of the ch’nouvilles a lesson which mme de cambremerlegrandin had not required when paying a call one day she had heard a girl say “my aunt d’uzai” “my unk de rouan” she had not at first recognised the illustrious names which she was in the habit of pronouncing uzès and rolîan she had felt the astonishment embarrassment and shame of a person who sees before him on the table a recently invented implement of which he does not know the proper use and with which he dares not begin to eat but during that night and the next day she had rapturously repeated “my aunt uzai” with that suppression of the final s a suppression that had stupefied her the day before but which it now seemed to her so vulgar not to know that one of her friends having spoken to her of a bust of the duchesse d’uzès mlle legrandin had answered her crossly and in an arrogant tone “you might at least pronounce her name properly mme d’uzai” from that moment she had realised that by virtue of the transmutation of solid bodies into more and more subtle elements the considerable and so honourably acquired fortune that she had inherited from her father the finished education that she had received her regular attendance at the sorbonne whether at caro’s lectures or at brunetiere’s and at the lamoureux concerts all this was to be rendered volatile to find its utmost sublimation in the pleasure of being able one day to say “my aunt d’uzai” this did not exclude the thought that she would continue to associate in the earlier days at least of her married life not indeed with certain women friends whom she liked and had resigned herself to sacrificing but with certain others whom she did not like and to whom she looked forward to being able to say since that after all was why she was marrying “i must introduce you to my aunt d’uzai” and when she saw that such an alliance was beyond her reach “i must introduce you to my aunt de ch’nouville” and “i shall ask you to dine to meet the uzai” her marriage to m de cambremer had procured for mlle legrandin the opportunity to use the former of these phrases but not the latter the circle in which her parentsinlaw moved not being that which she had supposed and of which she continued to dream after saying to me of saintloup adopting for the occasion one of his expressions for if in talking to her i used those expressions of legrandin she by a reverse suggestion answered me in robert’s dialect which she did not know to be borrowed from rachel bringing her thumb and forefinger together and halfshutting her eyes as though she were gazing at something infinitely delicate which she had succeeded in capturing “he has a charming quality of mind” she began to extol him with such warmth that one might have supposed that she was in love with him it had indeed been alleged that some time back when he was at doncières robert had been her lover in reality simply that i might repeat her words to him and ended up with “you are a great friend of the duchesse de guermantes i am an invalid i never go anywhere and i know that she sticks to a close circle of chosen friends which i do think so wise of her and so i know her very slightly but i know she is a really remarkable woman” aware that mme de carnbremer barely knew her and anxious to reduce myself to her level i avoided the subject and answered the marquise that the person whom i did know well was her brother m legrandin at the sound of his name she assumed the same evasive air as myself over the name of mme de guermantes but combined with it an expression of annoyance for she supposed that i had said this with the object of humiliating not myself but her was she gnawed by despair at having been born a legrandin so at least her husband’s sisters and sistersinlaw asserted ladies of the provincial nobility who knew nobody and nothing and were jealous of mme de cambremer’s intelligence her education her fortune the physical attractions that she had possessed before her illness “she can think of nothing else that is what is killing her” these slanderers would say whenever they spoke of mme de cambremer to no matter whom but preferably to a plebeian whether were he conceited and stupid to enhance by this affirmation of the shamefulness of a plebeian origin the value of the affability that they were shewing him of if he were shy and clever and applied the remark to himself to give themselves the pleasure while receiving him hospitably of insulting him indirectly but if these ladies thought that they were speaking the truth about their sisterinlaw they were mistaken she suffered not at all from having been born legrandin for she had forgotten the fact altogether she was annoyed at my reminding her of it and remained silent as though she had not understood not thinking it necessary to enlarge upon or even to confirm my statement

    “our cousins are not the chief reason for our cutting short our visit” said the dowager mme de cambremer who was probably more satiated than her daughterinlaw with the pleasure to be derived from saying ‘ch’nouville’ “but so as not to bother you with too many people monsieur” she went on indicating the lawyer “was afraid to bring his wife and son to the hotel they are waiting for us on the beach and they will be growing impatient” i asked for an exact description of them and hastened in search of them the wife had a round face like certain flowers of the ranunculus family and a large vegetable growth at the corner of her eye and as the generations of mankind preserve their characteristic like a family of plants just as on the blemished face of his mother an identical mole which might have helped one in classifying a variety of the species protruded below the eye of the son the lawyer was touched by my civility to his wife and son he shewed an interest in the subject of my stay at balbec “you must find yourself rather out of your element for the people here are for the most part foreigners” and he kept his eye on me as he spoke for not caring for foreigners albeit he had many foreign clients he wished to make sure that i was not hostile to his xenophobia in which case he would have beaten a retreat saying “of course mme x——may be a charming woman it’s a question of principle” as at that time i had no definite opinion about foreigners i shewed no sign of disapproval he felt himself to be on safe ground he went so far as to invite me to come one day in paris to see his collection of le sidaner and to bring with me the cambremers with whom he evidently supposed me to be on intimate terms “i shall invite you to meet le sidaner” he said to me confident that from that moment i would live only in expectation of that happy day “you shall see what a delightful man he is and his pictures will enchant you of course i can’t compete with the great collectors but i do believe that i am the one that possesses the greatest number of his favourite canvases they will interest you all the more coming from balbec since they are marine subjects for the most part at least” the wife and son blessed with a vegetable nature listened composedly one felt that their house in paris was a sort of temple of le sidaner temples of this sort are not without their use when the god has doubts as to his own merits he can easily stop the cracks in his opinion of himself with the irrefutable testimony of people who have devoted their lives to his work

   at a signal from her daughterinlaw mme de cambremer prepared to depart and said to me “since you won’t come and stay at féterne won’t you at least come to luncheon one day this week tomorrow for instance” and in her bounty to make the invitation irresistible she added “you will find the comte de crisenoy” whom i had never lost for the simple reason that i did not know him she was beginning to dazzle me with yet further temptations but stopped short the chief magistrate who on returning to the hotel had been told that she was on the premises had crept about searching for her everywhere then waited his opportunity and pretending to have caught sight of her by chance came up now to greet her i gathered that mme de cambremer did not mean to extend to him the invitation to luncheon that she had just addressed to me and yet he had known her far longer than i having for years past been one of the regular guests at the afternoon parties at féterne whom i used so to envy during my former visit to balbec but old acquaintance is not the only thing that counts in society and hostesses are more inclined to reserve their luncheons for new acquaintances who still whet their curiosity especially when they arrive preceded by a glowing and irresistible recommendation like saintloup’s of me mme de cambremer decided that the chief magistrate could not have heard what she was saying to me but to calm her guilty conscience began addressing him in the kindest tone in the sunlight that flooded on the horizon the golden coastline invisible as a rule of rivebelle we could just make out barely distinguishable from the luminous azure rising from the water rosy silvery faint the little bells that were sounding the angélus round about féterne “that is ratherpelléas too” i suggested to mme de cambremerlegrandin “you know the scene i mean” “of course i do” was what she said but “i haven’t the faintest idea” was the message proclaimed by her voice and features which did not mould themselves to the shape of any recollection and by a smile that floated without support in the air the dowager could not get over her astonishment that the sound of the bells should carry so far and rose reminded of the time “but as a rule” i said “we never see that part of the coast from balbec nor hear it either the weather must have changed and enlarged the horizon in more ways than one unless that is to say the bells have come to look for you since i see that they are making you leave to you they are a dinner bell” the chief magistrate little interested in the bells glanced furtively along the front on which he was sorry to see so few people that evening “you are a true poet” said mme de cambremer to me “one feels you are so responsive so artistic come i will play you chopin” she went on raising her arms with an air of ecstasy and pronouncing the words in a raucous voice like the shifting of shingle on the beach then came the deglutition of spittle and the old lady instinctively wiped the stubble of her moustaches with her handkerchief the chief magistrate did me unconsciously a great service by offering the marquise his arm to escort her to her carriage a certain blend of vulgarity boldness and love of ostentation prompting him to actions which other people would have hesitated to risk and which are by no means unsuccessful in society he was moreover and had been for years past far more in the habit of these actions than myself while blessing him for what he did i did not venture to copy him and walked by the side of mme de cambremerlegrandin who insisted upon seeing the book that i had in my hand the name of madame de sévigné drew a grimace from her and using a word which she had seen in certain newspapers but which used in speech and given a feminine form and applied to a seventeenth century writer had an odd effect she asked me “do you think her really masterly” the marquise gave her footman the address of a pastrycook where she had to call before taking the road rosy with the evening haze through which loomed one beyond another the dusky walls of cliff she asked her old coachman whether one of the horses which was apt to catch cold had been kept warm enough whether the other’s shoe were not hurting him “i shall write to you and make a definite engagement” she murmured to me “i heard you talking about literature to my daughterinlaw she’s a darling” she went on not that she really thought so but she had acquired the habit — and kept it up in her kindness of heart — of saying so in order that her son might not appear to have married for money “besides” she added with a final enthusiastic gnashing of her teeth “she’s so harttissttick” with this she stepped into her carriage nodding her head holding the crook of her sunshade aloft like a crozier and set off through the streets of balbec overloaded with the ornaments of her priesthood like an old bishop on a confirmation tour

    “she has asked you to luncheon” the chief magistrate said to me sternly when the carriage had passed out of sight and i came indoors with the girls “we’re not on the best of terms just now she feels that i neglect her gad i’m easy enough to get on with if anybody needs me i’m always there to say adsum but they tried to force my hand that now” he went on with an air of subtlety holding up his finger as though making and arguing a distinction “that is a thing i do not allow it is a threat to the liberty of my holidays i was obliged to say stopl you seem to be in her good books when you reach my age you will see that society is a very trumpery thing and you will be sorry you attached so much importance to these trifles well i am going to take a turn before dinner goodbye children” he shouted back at us as though he were already fifty yards away

   when i had said goodbye to rosemonde and gisèle they saw with astonishment that albertine was staying behind instead of accompanying them “why albertine what are you doing don’t you know what time it is” “go home” she replied in a tone of authority “i want to talk to him” she added indicating myself with a submissive air rosemonde and gisèle stared at me filled with a new and strange respect i enjoyed the feeling that for a moment at least in the eyes even of rosemonde and gisèle i was to albertine something more important than the time than her friends and might indeed share solemn secrets with her into which it was impossible for them to be admitted “shan’t we see you again this evening” “i don’t know it will depend on this person anyhow tomorrow” “let us go up to my room” i said to her when her friends had gone we took the lift she remained silent in the boy’s presence the habit of being obliged to resort to personal observation and deduction in order to find out the business of their masters those strange beings who converse among themselves and do not speak to them develops in ‘employees’ as the liftboy styled servants a stronger power of divination than the ‘employer’ possesses our organs become atrophied or grow stronger or more subtle accordingly as our need of them increases or diminishes since railways came into existence the necessity of not missing the train has taught us to take account of minutes whereas among the ancient romans who not only had a more cursory science of astronomy but led less hurried lives the notion not of minutes but even of fixed hours barely existed and so the liftboy had gathered and meant to inform his comrades that albertine and i were preoccupied but he talked to us without ceasing because he had no tact and yet i could see upon his face in place of the customary expression of friendliness and joy at taking me up in his lift an air of extraordinary depression and uneasiness as i knew nothing of the cause of this in an attempt to distract his thoughts and albeit i was more preoccupied than albertine i told him that the lady who had just left was called the marquise de cambremer and not de camembert on the landing at which we were pausing at the moment i saw carrying a pair of pails a hideous chambermaid who greeted me with respect hoping for a tip when i left i should have liked to know if she were the one whom i had so ardently desired on the evening of my first arrival at balbec but i could never arrive at any certainty the liftboy swore to me with the sincerity of most false witnesses but without shedding his expression of despair that it was indeed by the name of camembert that the marquise had told him to announce her and as a matter of fact it was quite natural that he should have heard her say a name which he already knew besides having those very vague ideas of nobility and of the names of which titles are composed which are shared by many people who are not liftboys the name camembert had seemed to him all the more probable inasmuch as that cheese being universally known it was not in the least surprising that people should have acquired a marquisate from so glorious a distinction unless it were the marquisate that had bestowed its renown upon the cheese nevertheless as he saw that i refused to admit that i might be mistaken and as he knew that masters like to see their most futile whims obeyed and their most obvious lies accepted he promised me like a good servant that in future he would say cambremer it is true that none of the shopkeepers in the town none of the peasants in the district where the name and persons of the cambremers were perfectly familiar could ever have made the liftboy’s mistake but the staff of the ‘grand hotel of balbec’ were none of them natives they came direct with the furniture and stock from biarritz nice and montecarlo one division having been transferred to deauville another to dinard and the third reserved for balbec

   but the liftboy’s pained anxiety continued to grow that he should thus forget to shew his devotion to me by the customary smiles some misfortune must have befallen him perhaps he had been ‘‘missed’ i made up my mind in that case to try to secure his reinstatement the manager having promised to ratify all my wishes with regard to his staff “you can always do just what you like i rectify everything in advance” suddenly as i stepped out of the lift i guessed the meaning of the boy’s distress his panicstricken air because albertine was with me i had not given him the five francs which i was in the habit of slipping into his hand when i went up and the idiot instead of understanding that i did not wish to make a display of generosity in front of a third person had begun to tremble supposing that it was all finished that i would never give him anything again he imagined that i was ‘on the rocks’ as the duc de guermantes would have said and the supposition inspired him with no pity for myself but with a terrible selfish disappointment i told myself that i was less unreasonable than my mother thought when i dared not one day refrain from giving the extravagant but feverishly awaited sum that i had given the day before but at the same time the meaning that i had until then and without a shadow of doubt ascribed to his habitual expression of joy in which i had no hesitation in seeing a sign of devotion seemed to me to have become less certain seeing the liftboy ready in his despair to fling himself down from the fifth floor of the hotel i asked myself whether if our respective social stations were to be altered in consequence let us say of a revolution instead of politely working his lift for me the boy grown independent would not have flung me down the well and whether there was not in certain of the lower orders more duplicity than in society where no doubt people reserve their offensive remarks until we are out of earshot but where their attitude towards us would not be insulting if we were reduced to poverty

   one cannot however say that in the balbec hotel the liftboy was the most commercially minded from this point of view the staff might be divided into two categories on the one hand those who drew distinctions between the visitors and were more grateful for the modest tip of an old nobleman who moreover was in a position to relieve them from 28 days of military service by saying a word for them to general de beautreillis than for the thoughtless liberalities of a cad who by his very profusion revealed a want of practice which only to his face did they call generosity on the other hand those to whom nobility intellect fame position manners were nonexistent concealed under a cash valuation for these there was but a single standard the money one has or rather the money one bestows possibly aimé himself albeit pretending in view of the great number of hotels in which he had served to a great knowledge of the world belonged to this latter category at the most he would give a social turn shewing that he knew who was who to this sort of appreciation as when he said of the princesse de luxembourg “there’s a pile of money among that lot” the question mark at the end being to ascertain the facts or to check such information as he had already ascertained before supplying a client with a ‘chef for paris or promising him a table on the left by the door with a view of the sea at balbec in spite of this and albeit not free from sordid considerations he would not have displayed them with the fatuous despair of the liftboy and yet the latter’s artlessness helped perhaps to simplify things it is the convenience of a big hotel of a house such as rachel used at one time to frequent that without any intermediary the face frozen stiff until that moment of a servant or a woman at the sight of a hundredfranc note still more of one of a thousand even although it is being given to some one else will melt in smiles and offers of service whereas in the dealings in the relations between lover and mistress there are too many things interposed between money and docility so many things that the very people upon whose faces money finally evokes a smile are often incapable of following the internal process that links them together believe themselves to be and indeed are more refined besides it rids polite conversation of such speeches as “there’s only one thing left for me to do you will find me tomorrow in the mortuary” and so one meets in polite society few novelists or poets few of all those sublime creatures who speak of the things that are not to be mentioned

   as soon as we were alone and had moved along the corridor albertine began “what is it you have got against me” had my harsh treatment of her been painful to myself had it been merely an unconscious ruse on my part with the object of bringing my mistress to that attitude of fear and supplication which would enable me to interrogate her and perhaps to find out which of the alternative hypotheses that i had long since formed about her was correct however that may be when i heard her question i suddenly felt the joy of one who attains to a long desired goal before answering her i escorted her to the door of my room opening it i scattered the roseate light that was flooding the room and turning the white muslin of the curtains drawn for the night to golden damask i went across to the window the gulls had settled again upon the waves but this time they were pink i drew albertine’s attention to them “don’t change the subject” she said “be frank with me” i lied i declared to her that she must first listen to a confession that of my passionate admiration for some time past of andrée and i made her this confession with a simplicity and frankness worthy of the stage but seldom employed in real life except for a love which people do not feel harking back to the fiction i had employed with gilberte before my first visit to balbec but adapting its terms i went so far in order to make her more ready to believe me when i told her now that i was not in love with her as to let fall the admission that at one time i had been on the point of falling in love with her but that too long an interval had elapsed that she could be nothing more to me now than a good friend and comrade and that even if i wished to feel once again a more ardent sentiment for her it would be quite beyond my power as it happened in taking my stand thus before albertine on these protestations of coldness towards her i was merely — because of a particular circumstance and with a particular object in view — making more perceptible accentuating more markedly that dual rhythm which love adopts in all those who have too little confidence in themselves to believe that a woman can ever fall in love with them and also that they themselves can genuinely fall in love with her they know themselves well enough to have observed that in the presence of the most divergent types of woman they felt the same hopes the same agonies invented the same romances uttered the same words to have deduced therefore that their sentiments their actions bear no close and necessary relation to the woman they love but pass by her spatter her surround her like the waves that break round upon the rocks and their sense of their own instability increases still further their misgivings that this woman by whom they would so fain be loved is not in love with them why should chance have brought it about when she is simply an accident placed so as to catch the ebullience of our desire that we should ourselves be the object of the desire that is animating her and so while we feel the need to pour out before her all those sentiments so different from the merely human sentiments that our neighbour inspires in us those so highly specialised sentiments which are a lover’s after we have taken a step forward in avowing to her whom we love our affection for her our hopes overcome at once by the fear of offending her ashamed too that the speech we have addressed to her was not composed expressly for her that it has served us already will serve us again for others that if she does not love us she cannot understand us and we have spoken in that case with the want of taste of modesty shewn by the pedant who addresses an ignorant audience in subtle phrases which are not for them this fear this shame bring into play the counterrhythm the reflux the need even by first drawing back hotly denying the affection we have already confessed to resume the offensive and to recapture her esteem to dominate her the double rhythm is perceptible in the various periods of a single love affair in all the corresponding periods of similar love affairs in all those people whose selfanalysis outweighs their selfesteem if it was however somewhat more vigorously accentuated than usual in this speech which i was now preparing to make to albertine that was simply to allow me to pass more speedily and more emphatically to the alternate rhythm which should sound my affection

   as though it must be painful to albertine to believe what i was saying to her as to the impossibility of my loving her again after so long an interval i justified what i called an eccentricity of my nature by examples taken from people with whom i had by their fault or my own allowed the time for loving them to pass and been unable however keenly i might have desired it to recapture it i thus appeared at one and the same time to be apologising to her as for a want of courtesy for this inability to begin loving her again and to be seeking to make her understand the psychological reasons for that incapacity as though they had been peculiar to myself but by explaining myself in this fashion by dwelling upon the case of gilberte in regard to whom the argument had indeed been strictly true which was becoming so far from true when applied to albertine all that i did was to render my assertions as plausible as i pretended to believe that they were not feeling that albertine appreciated what she called my ‘frank speech’ and recognising in my deductions the clarity of the evidence i apologised for the former by telling her that i knew that the truth was always unpleasant and in this instance must seem to her incomprehensible she on the contrary thanked me for my sincerity and added that so far from being puzzled she understood perfectly a state of mind so frequent and so natural

   this avowal to albertine of an imaginary sentiment for andrée and towards herself an indifference which that it might appear altogether sincere and without exaggeration i assured her incidentally as though by a scruple of politeness must not be taken too literally enabled me at length without any fear of albertine’s suspecting me of loving her to speak to her with a tenderness which i had so long denied myself and which seemed to me exquisite i almost caressed my confidant as i spoke to her of her friend whom i loved tears came to my eyes but coming at last to the point i said to her that she knew what love meant its susceptibilities its sufferings and that perhaps as the old friend that she now was she might feel it in her heart to put a stop to the bitter grief that she was causing me not directly since it was not herself that i loved if i might venture to repeat that without offending her but indirectly by wounding me in my love for andrée i broke off to admire and point out to albertine a great bird solitary and hastening which far out in front of us lashing the air with the regular beat of its wings was passing at full speed over the beach stained here and there with reflexions like little torn scraps of red paper and crossing it from end to end without slackening its pace without diverting its attention without deviating from its path like an envoy carrying far afield an urgent and vital message “he at least goes straight to the point” said albertine in a tone of reproach “you say that because you don’t know what it is i was going to tell you but it is so difficult that i prefer to give it up i am certain that i should make you angry and then all that will have happened will be this i shall be in no way better off with the girl i really love and i shall have lost a good friend” “but when i swear to you that i will not be angry” she had so sweet so wistfully docile an air as though her whole happiness depended on me that i could barely restrain myself from kissing — with almost the same kind of pleasure that i should have taken in kissing my mother — this novel face which no longer presented the startled blushing expression of a rebellious and perverse kitten with its little pink tiptilted nose but seemed in the fulness of its crushing sorrow moulded in broad flattened drooping slabs of pure goodness making an abstraction of my love as of a chronic mania that had no connexion with her putting myself in her place i let my heart be melted before this honest girl accustomed to being treated in a friendly and loyal fashion whom the good comrade that she might have supposed me had been pursuing for weeks past with persecutions which had at last arrived at their culminating point it was because i placed myself at a standpoint that was purely human external to both of us at which my jealous love dissolved that i felt for albertine that profound pity which would have been less profound if i had not loved her however in that rhythmical oscillation which leads from a declaration to a quarrel the surest the most certainly perilous way of forming by opposite and successive movements a knot which will not be loosed and attaches us firmly to a person by the strain of the movement of withdrawal which constitutes one of the two elements of the rhythm of what use is it to analyse farther the refluences of human pity which the opposite of love though springing perhaps unconsciously from the same cause produces in every case the same effects when we count up afterwards the total amount of all that we have done for a woman we often discover that the actions prompted by the desire to shew that we love her to make her love us to win her favours bulk little if any greater than those due to the human need to repair the wrongs that we have done to the creature whom we love from a mere sense of moral duty as though we were not in love with her “but tell me what on earth have i done” albertine asked me there was a knock at the door it was the liftboy albertine’s aunt who was passing the hotel in a carriage had stopped on the chance of finding her there to take her home albertine sent word that she could not come that they were to begin dinner without her that she could not say at what time she would return “but won’t your aunt be angry” “what do you suppose she will understand all right” and so at this moment at least a moment such as might never occur again — a conversation with myself was proved by this incident to be in albertine’s eyes a thing of such selfevident importance that it must be given precedence over everything a thing to which referring no doubt instinctively to a family code enumerating certain crises in which when the career of m bontemps was at stake a journey had been made without a thought my friend never doubted that her aunt would think it quite natural to see her sacrifice the dinnerhour that remote hour which she passed without my company among her own people albertine having brought it to me bestowed it on me i might make what use of it i chose i ended by making bold to tell her what had been reported to me about her way of living and that notwithstanding the profound disgust that i felt for women tainted with that vice i had not given it a thought until i had been told the name of her accomplice and that she could readily understand loving andrée as i did the grief that the news had caused me it would have been more tactful perhaps to say that i had been given the names of other women as well in whom i was not interested but the sudden and terrible revelation that cottard had made to me had entered my heart to lacerate it complete in itself but without accretions and just as before that moment it would never have occurred to me that albertine was in love with andrée or at any rate could find pleasure in caressing her if cottard had not drawn my attention to their attitude as they waltzed together so i had been incapable of passing from that idea to the idea so different for me that albertine might have with other women than andrée relations for which affection could not be pleaded in excuse albertine before even swearing to me that it was not true shewed like everyone upon learning that such things are being said about him anger concern and with regard to the unknown slanderer a fierce curiosity to know who he was and a desire to be confronted with him so as to be able to confound him but she assured me that she bore me at least no resentment “if it had been true i should have told you but andrée and i both loathe that sort of thing we have not lived all these years without seeing women with cropped hair who behave like men and do the things you mean and nothing revolts us more” albertine gave me merely her word a peremptory word unsupported by proof but this was just what was best calculated to calm me jealousy belonging to that family of sickly doubts which are better purged by the energy than by the probability of an affirmation it is moreover the property of love to make us at once more distrustful and more credulous to make us suspect more readily than we should suspect anyone else her whom we love and be convinced more easily by her denials we must be in love before we can care that all women are not virtuous which is to say before we can be aware of the fact and we must be in love too before we can hope that is to say assure ourselves that some are it is human to seek out what hurts us and then at once to seek to get rid of it the statements that are capable of so relieving us seem quite naturally true we are not inclined to cavil at a sedative that acts besides however multiform may be the person with whom we are in love she can in any case offer us two essential personalities accordingly as she appears to us as ours or as turning her desires in another direction the former of these personalities possesses the peculiar power which prevents us from believing in the reality of the other the secret remedy to heal the sufferings that this latter has caused us the beloved object is successively the malady and the remedy that suspends and aggravates it no doubt i had long since been prepared by the strong impression made on my imagination and my faculty for emotion by the example of swann to believe in the truth of what i feared rather than of what i should have wished and so the comfort brought me by albertine’s affirmations came near to being jeopardised for a moment because i was reminded of the story of odette but i told myself that if it was only right to allow for the worst not only when in order to understand swann’s sufferings i had tried to put myself in his place but now when i myself was concerned in seeking the truth as though it referred to some one else still i must not out of cruelty to myself a soldier who chooses the post not where he can be of most use but where he is most exposed end in the mistake of regarding one supposition as more true than the rest simply because it was more painful was there not a vast gulf between albertine a girl of good middleclass parentage and odette a courtesan bartered by her mother in her childhood there could be no comparison of their respective credibility besides albertine had in no respect the same interest in lying to me that odette had had in lying to swann moreover to him odette had admitted what albertine had just denied i should therefore be guilty of an error in reasoning as serious — though in the opposite direction — as that which had inclined me towards a certain hypothesis because it had caused me less pain than the rest were i not to take into account these material differences in their positions but to reconstruct the real life of my mistress solely from what i had been told about the life of odette i had before me a new albertine of whom i had already it was true caught more than one glimpse towards the end of my previous visit to balbec frank and honest an albertine who had out of affection for myself forgiven me my suspicions and tried to dispel them she made me sit down by her side upon my bed i thanked her for what she had said to me assured her that our reconciliation was complete and that i would never be horrid to her again i suggested to her that she ought at the same time to go home to dinner she asked me whether i was not glad to have her with me drawing my head towards her for a caress which she had never before given me and which i owed perhaps to the healing of our rupture she passed her tongue lightly over my lips which she attempted to force apart at first i kept them tight shut “you are a great bear” she informed me

   i ought to have left the place that evening and never set eyes on her again i felt even then that in a love which is not reciprocated — i might as well say in love for there are people for whom there is no such thing as reciprocated love — we can enjoy only that simulacrum of happiness which had been given me at one of those unique moments in which a woman’s good nature or her caprice or mere chance bring to our desires in perfect coincidence the same words the same actions as if we were really loved the wiser course would have been to consider with curiosity to possess with delight that little parcel of happiness failing which i should have died without ever suspecting what it could mean to hearts less difficult to please or more highly favoured to suppose that it formed part of a vast and enduring happiness of which this fragment only was visible to me and — lest the next day should expose this fiction — not to attempt to ask for any fresh favour after this which had been due only to the artifice of an exceptional moment i ought to have left balbec to have shut myself up in solitude to have remained so in harmony with the last vibrations of the voice which i had contrived to render amorous for an instant and of which i should have asked nothing more than that it might never address another word to me for fear lest by an additional word which now could only be different it might shatter with a discord the sensitive silence in which as though by the pressure of a pedal there might long have survived in me the throbbing chord of happiness
   soothed by my explanation with albertine i began once again to live in closer intimacy with my mother she loved to talk to me gently about the days in which my grandmother had been younger fearing that i might reproach myself with the sorrows with which i had perhaps darkened the close of my grandmother’s life she preferred to turn back to the years when the first signs of my dawning intelligence had given my grandmother a satisfaction which until now had always been kept from me we talked of the old days at combray my mother reminded me that there at least i used to read and that at balbec i might well do the same if i was not going to work i replied that to surround myself with memories of combray and of the charming coloured plates i should like to read again the thousand and one nights as long ago at combray when she gave me books for my birthday so it was in secret as a surprise for me that my mother now sent for both the thousand and one nights of galland and the thousand nights and a night of mardrus but after casting her eye over the two translations my mother would have preferred that i should stick to galland’s albeit hesitating to influence me because of the respect that she felt for intellectual liberty her dread of interfering with my intellectual life and the feeling that being a woman on the one hand she lacked or so she thought the necessary literary equipment and on the other hand ought not to condemn because she herself was shocked by it the reading of a young man happening upon certain of the tales she had been revolted by the immorality of the subject and the crudity of the expression but above all preserving like precious relics not only the brooch the sunshade the cloak the volume of madame de sévigné but also the habits of thought and speech of her mother seeking on every occasion the opinion that she would have expressed my mother could have no doubt of the horror with which my grandmother would have condemned mardrus’s book she remembered that at combray while before setting out for a walk méséglise way i was reading augustin thierry my grandmother glad that i should be reading and taking walks was indignant nevertheless at seeing him whose name remained enshrined in the hemistich ‘then reignèd mérovée’ called merowig refused to say ‘carolingians’ for the ‘carlovingians’ to which she remained loyal and then i told her what my grandmother had thought of the greek names which bloch following leconte de lisle gave to the gods of homer going so far in the simplest matters as to make it a religious duty in which he supposed literary talent to consist to adopt a greek system of spelling having occasion for instance to mention in a letter that the wine which they drank at his home was real nectar he would write ‘real nektar’ with a k which enabled him to titter at the mention of lamartine and if an odyssey from which the names of ulysses and minerva were missing was no longer the odyssey to her what would she have said upon seeing corrupted even upon the cover the title of her thousand and one nights upon no longer finding exactly transcribed as she had all her life been in the habit of pronouncing them the immortally familiar names of scheherazade of dinarzade in which debaptised themselves if one may use the expression of musulman tales the charming caliph and the powerful genies were barely recognisable being renamed he the ‘khalifat’ and they the ‘gennis’ still my mother handed over both books to me and i told her that i would read them on the days when i felt too tired to go out

   these days were not very frequent however we used to go out picnicking as before in a band albertine her friends and myself on the cliff or to the farm called marieantoinette but there were times when albertine bestowed on me this great pleasure she would say to me “today i want to be alone with you for a little it will be nicer if we are just by ourselves” then she would give out that she was busy not that she need furnish any explanation and so that the others if they went all the same without us for an excursion and picnic might not be able to find us we would steal away like a pair of lovers all by ourselves to bagatelle or the cross of heulan while the band who would never think of looking for us there and never went there waited indefinitely in the hope of seeing us appear at marieantoinette i recall the hot weather that we had then when from the brow of each of the farmlabourers toiling in the sun a drop of sweat would fall vertical regular intermittent like the drop of water from a cistern and alternate with the fall of the ripe fruit dropping from the tree in the adjoining ‘closes’ they have remained to this day with that mystery of a woman’s secret the most substantial part of every love that offers itself to me a woman who has been mentioned to me and to whom i would not give a moment’s thought — i upset all my week’s engagements to make her acquaintance if it is a week of similar weather and i am to meet her in some isolated farmhouse it is no good my knowing that this kind of weather this kind of assignation are not part of her they are still the bait which i know all too well by which i allow myself to be tempted and which is sufficient to hook me i know that this woman in cold weather in a town i might perhaps have desired but without the accompaniment of a romantic sentiment without becoming amorous my love for her is none the less keen as soon as by force of circumstances it has enthralled me — it is only the more melancholy as in the course of life our sentiments for other people become in proportion as we become more clearly aware of the ever smaller part that they play in our life and that the new love which we would like to be so permanent cut short in the same moment as life itself will be the last

   there were still but a few people at balbec hardly any girls sometimes i saw some girl resting upon the beach devoid of charm and yet apparently identified by various features as one whom i had been in despair at not being able to approach at the moment when she emerged with her friends from the riding school or gymnasium if it was the same and i took care not to mention the matter to albertine then the girl that i had thought so exciting did not exist but i could not arrive at any certainty for the face of any one of these girls did not fill any space upon the beach did not offer a permanent form contracted dilated transformed as it was by my own observation the uneasiness of my desire or a sense of comfort that was selfsufficient by the different clothes that she was wearing the rapidity of her movements or her immobility all the same two or three of them seemed to me adorable whenever i saw one of these i longed to take her away along the avenue des tamaris or among the sandhills better still upon the cliff but albeit into desire as opposed to indifference there enters already that audacity which is a first stage if only unilateral towards realisation all the same between my desire and the action that my request to be allowed to kiss her would have been there was all the indefinite blank of hesitation of timidity then i went into the pastrycook’s bar i drank one after another seven or eight glasses of port wine at once instead of the impassable gulf between my desire and action the effect of the alcohol traced a line that joined them together no longer was there any room for hesitation or fear it seemed to me that the girl was about to fly into my arms i went up to her the words came spontaneously to my lips “i should like to go for a walk with you you wouldn’t care to go along the cliff we shan’t be disturbed behind the little wood that keeps the wind off the wooden bungalow that is empty just now” all the difficulties of life were smoothed away there was no longer any obstacle to the conjunction of our two bodies no obstacle for me at least for they had not been volatilised for her who had not been drinking port wine had she done so had the outer world lost some of its reality in her eyes the long cherished dream that would then have appeared to her to be suddenly realisable might perhaps have been not at all that of falling into my arms

   not only were the girls few in number but at this season which was not yet ‘the season’ they stayed but a short time there is one i remember with a reddish skin green eyes and a pair of ruddy cheeks whose slight symmetrical face resembled the winged seeds of certain trees i cannot say what breeze wafted her to balbec or what other bore her away so sudden was her removal that for some days afterwards i was haunted by a grief which i made bold to confess to albertine when i realised that the girl had gone for ever

   i should add that several of them were either girls whom i did not know at all or whom i had not seen for years often before addressing them i wrote to them if their answer allowed me to believe in the possibility of love what joy we cannot at the outset of our friendship with a woman even if that friendship is destined to come to nothing bear to part from those first letters that we have received from her we like to have them beside us all the time like a present of rare flowers still quite fresh at which we cease to gaze only to draw them closer to us and smell them the sentence that we know by heart it is pleasant to read again and in those that we have committed less accurately to memory we like to verify the degree of affection in some expression did she write ‘your dear letter’ a slight marring of our bliss which must be ascribed either to our having read too quickly or to the illegible handwriting of our correspondent she did not say ‘your dear letter’ but ‘from your letter’ but the rest is so tender oh that more such flowers may come tomorrow then that is no longer enough we must with the written words compare the writer’s eyes her face we make an appointment and — without her having altered perhaps — whereas we expected from the description given us or our personal memory to meet the fairy viviane we encounter pussinboots we make an appointment nevertheless for the following day for it is after all she and the person we desired is she and these desires for a woman of whom we have been dreaming do not make beauty of form and feature essential these desires are only the desire for a certain person vague as perfumes as styrax was the desire of prothyraia saffron the ethereal desire aromatic scents the desire of hera myrrh the perfume of the magi manna the desire of nike incense the perfume of the sea but these perfumes that are sung in the orphic hymns are far fewer in number than the deities they worship myrrh is the perfume of the magi but also of protogonos neptune nereus leto incense is the perfume of the sea but also of the fair dike of themis of circe of the nine muses of eos of mnemosyne of the day of dikaiosyne as for styrax manna and aromatic scents it would be impossible to name all the deities that inhale them so many are they amphietes has all the perfumes except incense and gaia rejects only beans and aromatic scents so was it with these desires for different girls that i felt fewer in number than the girls themselves they changed into disappointments and regrets closely similar one to another i never wished for myrrh i reserved it for jupien and for the prince de guermantes for it is the desire of protogonos “of twofold sex who roars like a bull of countless orgies memorable unspeakable descending joyous to the sacrifices of the orgiophants”

   but presently the season was in full swing every day there was some fresh arrival and for the sudden increase in the frequency of my outings which took the place of the charmed perusal of the thousand and one nights there was a reason devoid of pleasure which poisoned them all the beach was now peopled with girls and since the idea suggested to me by cottard had not indeed furnished me with fresh suspicions but had rendered me sensitive and weak in that quarter and careful not to let any suspicion take shape in my mind as soon as a young woman arrived at balbec i began to feel ill at ease i proposed to albertine the most distant excursions in order that she might not make the newcomer’s acquaintance and indeed if possible might not set eyes on her i dreaded naturally even more those women whose dubious ways were remarked or their bad reputation already known i tried to persuade my mistress that this bad reputation had no foundation was a slander perhaps without admitting it to myself from a fear still unconscious that she might seek to make friends with the depraved woman or regret her inability to do so because of me or might conclude from the number of examples that a vice so widespread was not to be condemned in denying the guilt of each of them my intention was nothing less than to pretend that sapphism did not exist albertine adopted my incredulity as to the viciousness of this one or that “no i think it’s just a pose she wants to look the part” but then i regretted almost that i had pleaded the other’s innocence for it distressed me that albertine formerly so severe could believe that this ‘part’ was a thing so flattering so advantageous that a woman innocent of such tastes could seek to ‘look it’ i would have liked to be sure that no more women were coming to balbec i trembled when i thought that as it was almost time for mme putbus to arrive at the verdurins’ her maid whose tastes saintloup had not concealed from me might take it into her head to come down to the beach and if it were a day on which i was not with albertine might seek to corrupt her i went the length of asking myself whether as cottard had made no secret of the fact that the verdurins thought highly of me and while not wishing to appear as he put it to be running after me would give a great deal to have me come to their house i might not on the strength of promises to bring all the guermantes in existence to call on them in paris induce mme verdurin upon some pretext or other to inform mme putbus that it was impossible to keep her there any longer and make her leave the place at once notwithstanding these thoughts and as it was chiefly the presence of andrée that was disturbing me the soothing effect that albertine’s words had had upon me still to some extent persisted — i knew moreover that presently i should have less need of it as andrée would be leaving the place with rosemonde and gisèle just about the time when the crowd began to arrive and would be spending only a few weeks more with albertine during these weeks moreover albertine seemed to have planned everything that she did everything that she said with a view to destroying my suspicions if any remained or to prevent them from reviving she contrived never to be left alone with andrée and insisted when we came back from an excursion upon my accompanying her to her door upon my coming to fetch her when we were going anywhere andrée meanwhile took just as much trouble on her side seemed to avoid meeting albertine and this apparent understanding between them was not the only indication that albertine must have informed her friend of our conversation and have asked her to be so kind as to calm my absurd suspicions

   about this time there occurred at the grand hotel a scandal which was not calculated to modify the intensity of my torment bloch’s cousin had for some time past been indulging with a retired actress in secret relations which presently ceased to satisfy them that they should be seen seemed to them to add perversity to their pleasure they chose to flaunt their perilous sport before the eyes of all the world they began with caresses which might after all be set down to a friendly intimacy in the cardroom by the baccarattable then they grew more bold and finally one evening in a corner that was not even dark of the big ballroom on a sofa they made no more attempt to conceal what they were doing than if they had been in bed two officers who happened to be near with their wives complained to the manager it was thought for a moment that their protest would be effective but they had this against them that having come over for the evening from netteholme where they were staying they could not be of any use to the manager whereas without her knowing it even and whatever remarks the manager may have made to her there hovered over mlle bloch the protection of m nissim bernard i must explain why m nissim bernard carried to their highest pitch the family virtues every year he took a magnificent villa at balbec for his nephew and no invitation would have dissuaded him from going home to dine at his own table which was in reality theirs but he never took his luncheon at home every day at noon he was at the grand hotel the fact of the matter was that he was keeping as other men keep a chorusgirl from the opera an embryo waiter of much the same type as the pages of whom we have spoken and who made us think of the young israelites inesther and athalie it is true that the forty years’ difference in age between m nissim bernard and the young waiter ought to have preserved the latter from a contact that was scarcely pleasant but as racine so wisely observes in those same choruses

   great god with what uncertain tread
   a budding virtue ‘mid such perils goes
   what stumblingblocks do lie before a soul
   that seeks thee and would fain be innocent

   the young waiter might indeed have been brought up ‘remote from the world’ in the templecaravanserai of balbec he had not followed the advice of joad

   in riches and in gold put not thy trust

   he had perhaps justified himself by saying “the wicked cover the earth” however that might be and albeit m nissim bernard had not expected so rapid a conquest on the very first day

   were’t in alarm or anxious to caress
   he felt those childish arms about him thrown

   and by the second day m nissim bernard having taken the young waiter out

   the dire assault his innocence destroyed

   from that moment the boy’s life was altered he might indeed carry bread and salt as his superior bade him his whole face sang

   from flowers to flowers from joys to keener joys
   let our desires now range
   uncertain is our tale of fleeting years
   haste we then to enjoy this life
   honours and fame are the reward
   of blind and meek obedience
   for moping innocence
   who now would raise his voice

since that day m nissim bernard had never failed to come and occupy his seat at the luncheontable as a man would occupy his in the stalls who was keeping a dancer a dancer in this case of a distinct and special type which still awaits its degas it was m nissim bernard’s delight to follow over the floor of the restaurant and down the remote vista to where beneath her palm the cashier sat enthroned the evolutions of the adolescent hurrying in service in the service of everyone and less than anyone of m nissim bernard now that the latter was keeping him whether because the young chorister did not think it necessary to display the same friendliness to a person by whom he supposed himself to be sufficiently well loved or because that love annoyed him or he feared lest if discovered it might make him lose other opportunities but this very coldness pleased m nissim bernard because of all that it concealed whether from hebraic atavism or from profanation of the christian spirit he took a singular pleasure were it jewish or catholic in the racinian ceremony had it been a real performance of esther or athalie m bernard would have regretted that the gulf of centuries must prevent him from making the acquaintance of the author jean racine so that he might obtain for his protégé a more substantial part but as the luncheon ceremony came from no author’s pen he contented himself with being on good terms with the manager and aimé so that the ‘young israelite’ might be promoted to the coveted post of underwaiter or even full waiter to a row of tables the post of wine waiter had been offered him but m bernard made him decline it for he would no longer have been able to come every day to watch him race about the green diningroom and to be waited upon by him like a stranger now this pleasure was so keen that every year m bernard returned to balbec and took his luncheon away from home habits in which m bloch saw in the former a poetical fancy for the bright sunshine the sunsets of this coast favoured above all others in the latter the inveterate mania of an old bachelor

   as a matter of fact the mistake made by m nissim bernard’s relatives who never suspected the true reason for his annual return to balbec and for what the pedantic mme bloch called his absentee palate was really a more profound and secondary truth for m nissim bernard himself was unaware how much there was of love for the beach at balbec for the view one enjoyed from the restaurant over the sea and of maniacal habits in the fancy that he had for keeping like a dancing girl of another kind which still lacks a degas one of his servants the rest of whom were still girls and so m nissim bernard maintained with the director of this theatre which was the hotel at balbec and with the stagemanager and producer aimé— whose part in all this affair was anything but simple — excellent relations one day they would intrigue to procure an important part a place perhaps as headwaiter in the meantime m nissim bernard’s pleasure poetical and calmly contemplative as it might be reminded one a little of those womenloving men who always know — swann for example in the past — that if they go out to a party they will meet their mistress no sooner had m nissim bernard taken his seat than he would see the object of his affections appear on the scene bearing in his hand fruit or cigars upon a tray and so every morning after kissing his niece bothering my friend bloch about his work and feeding his horses with lumps of sugar from the palm of his outstretched hand he would betray a feverish haste to arrive in time for luncheon at the grand hotel had the house been on fire had his niece had a stroke he would doubtless have started off just the same so that he dreaded like the plague a cold that would confine him to his bed — for he was a hypochondriac — and would oblige him to ask aimé to send his young friend across to visit him at home between luncheon and teatime

   he loved moreover all the labyrinth of corridors private offices receptionrooms cloakrooms larders galleries which composed the hotel at balbec with a strain of oriental atavism he loved a seraglio and when he went out at night might be seen furtively exploring its passages while venturing down to the basement and endeavouring at the same time to escape notice and to avoid a scandal m nissim bernard in his quest of the young lévites put one in mind of those lines in la juive

   o god of our fathers come down to us again
   our mysteries veil from the eyes of wicked men

   i on the contrary would go up to the room of two sisters who had come to balbec as her maids with an old lady a foreigner they were what the language of hotels called ‘couriers’ and that of françoise who imagined that a courier was a person who was there to run his course two ‘coursers’ the hotels have remained more nobly in the period when people sang “c’est un courrier de cabinet”

   difficult as it was for a visitor to penetrate to the servants’ quarters i had very soon formed a mutual bond of friendship as strong as it was pure with these two young persons mademoiselle marie gineste and madame céleste albaret born at the foot of the high mountains in the centre of france on the banks of rivulets and torrents the water passed actually under their old home turning a millwheel and the house had often been damaged by floods they seemed to embody the features of that region marie gineste was more regularly rapid and abrupt céleste albaret softer and more languishing spread out like a lake but with terrible boiling rages in which her fury suggested the peril of spates and gales that sweep everything before them they often came in the morning to see me when i was still in bed i have never known people so deliberately ignorant who had learned absolutely nothing at school and yet whose language was somehow so literary that but for the almost savage naturalness of their tone one would have thought their speech affected with a familiarity which i reproduce verbatim notwithstanding the praises which i set down here in praise not of myself but of the strange genius of céleste and the criticisms equally unfounded in which her remarks seem to involve me while i dipped crescent rolls in my milk céleste would say to me “oh little black devil with hair of jet o profound wickedness i don’t know what your mother was thinking of when she made you for you are just like a bird look marie wouldn’t you say he was preening his feathers and turning his head right round so light he looks you would say he was just learning to fly ah it’s fortunate for you that those who bred you brought you into the world to rank and riches what would ever have become of you so wasteful as you are look at him throwing away his crescent because it touched the bed there he goes now look he’s spilling his milk wait till i tie a napkin round you for you could never do it for yourself never in my life have i seen anyone so helpless and so clumsy as you” i would then hear the more regular sound of the torrent of marie gineste who was furiously reprimanding her sister “will you hold your tongue now céleste are you mad talking to monsieur like that” céleste merely smiled and as i detested having a napkin tied round my neck “no marie look at him bang he’s shot straight up on end like a serpent a proper serpent i tell you” these were but a few of her zoological similes for according to her it was impossible to tell when i slept i fluttered about all night like a butterfly and in the day time i was as swift as the squirrels “you know marie the way we see them at home so nimble that even with your eyes you can’t follow them” “but céleste you know he doesn’t like having a napkin when he’s eating” “it isn’t that he doesn’t like it it’s so that he can say nobody can make him do anything against his will he’s a grand gentleman and he wants to shew that he is they can change the sheets ten times over if they must but he won’t give way yesterday’s had served their time but today they have only just been put on the bed and they’ll have to be changed already oh i was right when i said that he was never meant to be born among the poor look his hair’s standing on end swelling with rage like a bird’s feathers poor ploumissou” here it was not only marie that protested but myself for i did not feel in the least like a grand gentleman but céleste would never believe in the sincerity of my modesty and cut me short “oh the storyteller oh the flatterer oh the false one the cunning rogue oh molière” this was the only writer’s name that she knew but she applied it to me meaning thereby a person who was capable both of writing plays and of acting them “céleste” came the imperious cry from marie who not knowing the name of molière was afraid that it might be some fresh insult céleste continued to smile “then you haven’t seen the photograph of him in his drawer when he was little he tried to make us believe that he was always dressed quite simply and there with his little cane he’s all furs and laces such as no prince ever wore but that’s nothing compared with his tremendous majesty and kindness which is even more profound” “so then” scolded the torrent marie “you go rummaging in his drawers now do you” to calm marie’s fears i asked her what she thought of m nissim bernard’s behaviour    “ah monsieur there are things i wouldn’t have believed could exist one has to come here to learn” and for once outrivalling céleste by an even more profound observation “ah you see monsieur one can never tell what there may be in a person’s life” to change the subject i spoke to her of the life led by my father who toiled night and day “ah monsieur there are people who keep nothing of their life for themselves not one minute not one pleasure the whole thing is a sacrifice for others they are lives that are given away” “look marie he has only to put his hand on the counterpane and take his crescent what distinction he can do the most insignificant things you would say that the whole nobility of france from here to the pyrenees was stirring in each of his movements”

   overpowered by this portrait so far from lifelike i remained silent céleste interpreted my silence as a further instance of guile “oh brow that looks so pure and hides so many things nice cool cheeks like the inside of an almond little hands of satin all velvety nails like claws” and so forth “there marie look at him sipping his milk with a devoutness that makes me want to say my prayers what a serious air they ought really to take his portrait as he is just now he’s just like a child is it drinking milk like them that has kept you their bright colour oh youth oh lovely skin you will never grow old you are a lucky one you will never need to raise your hand against anyone for you have a pair of eyes that can make their will be done look at him now he’s angry he shoots up straight as a signpost”

   françoise did not at all approve of what she called the two ‘tricksters’ coming to talk to me like this the manager who made his staff keep watch over everything that went on even gave me a serious warning that it was not proper for a visitor to talk to servants i who found the ‘tricksters’ far better than any visitor in the hotel merely laughed in his face convinced that he would not understand my explanations and the sisters returned “look marie at his delicate lines oh perfect miniature finer than the most precious you could see in a glass case for he can move and utters words you could listen to for days and nights”

   it was a miracle that a foreign lady could have brought them there for without knowing anything of history or geography they heartily detested the english the germans the russians the italians all foreign vermin and cared with certain exceptions for french people alone their faces had so far preserved the moisture of the pliable clay of their native river beds that as soon as one mentioned a foreigner who was staying in the hotel in order to repeat what he had said céleste and marie imposed upon their faces his face their mouths became his mouth their eyes his eyes one would have liked to preserve these admirable comic masks céleste indeed while pretending merely to be repeating what the manager had said or one of my friends would insert in her little narrative fictitious remarks in which were maliciously portrayed all the defects of bloch the chief magistrate etc while apparently unconscious of doing so it was under the form of the delivery of a simple message which she had obligingly undertaken to convey an inimitable portrait they never read anything not even a newspaper one day however they found lying on my bed a book it was a volume of the admirable but obscure poems of saintléger léger céleste read a few pages and said to me “but are you quite sure that these are poetry wouldn’t they just be riddles” obviously to a person who had learned in her childhood a single poem “down here the lilacs die” there was a gap in evolution i fancy that their obstinate refusal to learn anything was due in part to the unhealthy climate of their early home they had nevertheless all the gifts of a poet with more modesty than poets generally shew for if céleste had said something noteworthy and unable to remember it correctly i asked her to repeat it she would assure me that she had forgotten they will never read any books but neither will they ever write any

   françoise was considerably impressed when she learned that the two brothers of these humble women had married one the niece of the archbishop of tours the other a relative of the bishop of rodez to the manager this would have conveyed nothing céleste would sometimes reproach her husband with his failure to understand her and as for me i was astonished that he could endure her for at certain moments raging furious destroying everything she was detestable it is said that the salt liquid which is our blood is only an internal survival of the primitive marine element similarly i believe that céleste not only in her bursts of fury but also in her hours of depression preserved the rhythm of her native streams when she was exhausted it was after their fashion she had literally run dry nothing could then have revived her then all of a sudden the circulation was restored in her large body splendid and light the water flowed in the opaline transparence of her bluish skin she smiled at the sun and became bluer still at such moments she was truly celestial

   bloch’s family might never have suspected the reason which made their uncle never take his luncheon at home and have accepted it from the first as the mania of an elderly bachelor due perhaps to the demands of his intimacy with some actress everything that concerned m nissim bernard was tabu to the manager of the balbec hotel and that was why without even referring to the uncle he had finally not ventured to find fault with the niece albeit recommending her to be a little more circumspect and so the girl and her friend who for some days had pictured themselves as excluded from the casino and the grand hotel seeing that everything was settled were delighted to shew those fathers of families who held aloof from them that they might with impunity take the utmost liberties no doubt they did not go so far as to repeat the public exhibition which had revolted everybody but gradually they returned to their old ways and one evening as i came out of the casino which was half in darkness with albertine and bloch whom we had met there they came towards us linked together kissing each other incessantly and as they passed us crowed and laughed uttering indecent cries bloch lowered his eyes so as to seem not to have recognised his cousin and as for myself i was tortured by the thought that this occult appalling language was addressed perhaps to albertine

   another incident turned my thoughts even more in the direction of gomorrah i had noticed upon the beach a handsome young woman erect and pale whose eyes round their centre scattered rays so geometrically luminous that one was reminded on meeting her gaze of some constellation i thought how much more beautiful this girl was than albertine and that it would be wiser to give up the other only the face of this beautiful young woman had been smoothed by the invisible plane of an utterly low life of the constant acceptance of vulgar expedients so much so that her eyes more noble however than the rest of her face could radiate nothing but appetites and desires well on the following day this young woman being seated a long way away from us in the casino i saw that she never ceased to fasten upon albertine the alternate circling fires of her gaze one would have said that she was making signals to her from a lighthouse i dreaded my friend’s seeing that she was being so closely observed i was afraid that these incessantly rekindled glances might have the conventional meaning of an amorous assignation for the morrow for all i knew this assignation might not be the first the young woman with the radiant eyes might have come another year to balbec it was perhaps because albertine had already yielded to her desires or to those of a friend that this woman allowed herself to address to her those flashing signals if so they did more than demand something for the present they found a justification in pleasant hours in the past

   this assignation in that case must be not the first but the sequel to adventures shared in past years and indeed her glance did not say “will you” as soon as the young woman had caught sight of albertine she had turned her head and beamed upon her glances charged with recollection as though she were terribly afraid that my friend might not remember albertine who could see her plainly remained phlegmatically motionless with the result that the other with the same sort of discretion as a man who sees his old mistress with a new lover ceased to look at her and paid no more attention to her than if she had not existed

   but a day or two later i received a proof of this young woman’s tendencies and also of the probability of her having known albertine in the past often in the hall of the casino when two girls were smitten with mutual desire a luminous phenomenon occurred a sort of phosphorescent train passing from one to the other let us note in passing that it is by the aid of such materialisations even if they be imponderable by these astral signs that set fire to a whole section of the atmosphere that the scattered gomorrah tends in every town in every village to reunite its separated members to reform the biblical city while everywhere the same efforts are being made be it in view of but a momentary reconstruction by the nostalgic the hypocritical sometimes by the courageous exiles from sodom

   once i saw the stranger whom albertine had appeared not to recognise just at the moment when bloch’s cousin was approaching her the young woman’s eyes flashed but it was quite evident that she did not know the israelite maiden she beheld her for the first time felt a desire a shadow of doubt by no means the same certainty as in the case of albertine albertine upon whose comradeship she must so far have reckoned that in the face of her coldness she had felt the surprise of a foreigner familiar with paris but not resident there who having returned to spend a few weeks there on the site of the little theatre where he was in the habit of spending pleasant evenings sees that they have now built a bank

   bloch’s cousin went and sat down at a table where she turned the pages of a magazine presently the young woman came and sat down with an abstracted air by her side but under the table one could presently see their feet wriggling then their legs and hands in a confused heap words followed a conversation began and the young woman’s innocent husband who had been looking everywhere for her was astonished to find her making plans for that very evening with a girl whom he did not know his wife introduced bloch’s cousin to him as a friend of her childhood by an inaudible name for she had forgotten to ask her what her name was but the husband’s presence made their intimacy advance a stage farther for they addressed each other as tu having known each other at their convent an incident at which they laughed heartily later on as well as at the hoodwinked husband with a gaiety which afforded them an excuse for more caresses

   as for albertine i cannot say that anywhere in the casino or on the beach was her behaviour with any girl unduly free i found in it indeed an excess of coldness and indifference which seemed to be more than good breeding to be a ruse planned to avert suspicion when questioned by some girl she had a quick icy decent way of replying in a very loud voice “yes i shall be going to the tennis court about five i shall bathe tomorrow morning about eight” and of at once turning away from the person to whom she had said this — all of which had a horrible appearance of being meant to put people off the scent and either to make an assignation or the assignation already made in a whisper to utter this speech harmless enough in itself aloud so as not to attract attention and when later on i saw her mount her bicycle and scorch away into the distance i could not help thinking that she was hurrying to overtake the girl to whom she had barely spoken

   only when some handsome young woman stepped out of a motorcar at the end of the beach albertine could not help turning round and she at once explained “i was looking at the new flag they’ve put up over the bathing place the old one was pretty motheaten but i really think this one is mouldier still”

   on one occasion albertine was not content with cold indifference and this made me all the more wretched she knew that i was annoyed by the possibility of her sometimes meeting a friend of her aunt who had a ‘bad style’ and came now and again to spend a few days with mme bontemps albertine had pleased me by telling me that she would not speak to her again and when this woman came to incarville albertine said “by the way you know she’s here have they told you” as though to shew me that she was not seeing her in secret one day when she told me this she added “yes i ran into her on the beach and knocked against her as i passed on purpose to be rude to her” when albertine told me this there came back to my mind a remark made by mme bontemps to which i had never given a second thought when she had said to mme swann in my presence how brazen her niece albertine was as though that were a merit and told her how albertine had reminded some official’s wife that her father had been employed in a kitchen but a thing said by her whom we love does not long retain its purity it withers it decays an evening or two later i thought again of albertine’s remark and it was no longer the ill breeding of which she was so proud — and which could only make me smile — that it seemed to me to signify it was something else to wit that albertine perhaps even without any definite object to irritate this woman’s senses or wantonly to remind her of former proposals accepted perhaps in the past had swiftly brushed against her thought that i had perhaps heard of this as it had been done in public and had wished to forestall an unfavourable interpretation

   however the jealousy that was caused me by the women whom albertine perhaps loved was abruptly to cease

                                                                  

   we were waiting albertine and i at the balbec station of the little local railway we had driven there in the hotel omnibus because it was raining not far away from us was m nissim bernard with a black eye he had recently forsaken the chorister from athalie for the waiter at a much frequented farmhouse in the neighbourhood known as the ‘cherry orchard’ this rubicund youth with his blunt features appeared for all the world to have a tomato instead of a head a tomato exactly similar served as head to his twin brother to the detached observer there is this attraction about these perfect resemblances between pairs of twins that nature becoming for the moment industrialised seems to be offering a pattern for sale unfortunately m nissim bernard looked at it from another point of view and this resemblance was only external tomato ii shewed a frenzied zeal in furnishing the pleasures exclusively of ladies tomato i did not mind condescending to meet the wishes of certain gentlemen now on each occasion when stirred as though by a reflex action by the memory of pleasant hours spent with tomato i m bernard presented himself at the cherry orchard being shortsighted not that one need be shortsighted to mistake them the old israelite unconsciously playing amphitryon would accost the twin brother with “will you meet me somewhere this evening” he at once received a resounding smack in the face it might even be repeated in the course of a single meal when he continued with the second brother the conversation he had begun with the first in the end this treatment so disgusted him by association of ideas with tomatoes even of the edible variety that whenever he heard a newcomer order that vegetable at the next table to his own in the grand hotel he would murmur to him “you must excuse me sir for addressing you without an introduction but i heard you order tomatoes they are stale today i tell you in your own interest for it makes no difference to me i never touch them myself” the stranger would reply with effusive thanks to this philanthropic and disinterested neighbour call back the waiter pretend to have changed his mind “no on second thoughts certainly not no tomatoes” aimé who had seen it all before would laugh to himself and think “he’s an old rascal that monsieur bernard he’s gone and made another of them change his order” m bernard as he waited for the already overdue tram shewed no eagerness to speak to albertine and myself because of his black eye we were even less eager to speak to him it would however have been almost inevitable if at that moment a bicycle had not come dashing towards us the liftboy sprang from its saddle breathless madame verdurin had telephoned shortly after we left the hotel to know whether i would dine with her two days later we shall see presently why then having given me the message in detail the liftboy left us and being one of these democratic ‘employees’ who affect independence with regard to the middle classes and among themselves restore the principle of authority explained “i must be off because of my chiefs”

   albertine’s girl friends had gone and would be away for some time i was anxious to provide her with distractions even supposing that she might have found some happiness in spending the afternoons with no company but my own at balbec i knew that such happiness is never complete and that albertine being still at the age which some of us never outgrow when we have not yet discovered that this imperfection resides in the person who receives the happiness and not in the person who gives it might have been tempted to put her disappointment down to myself i preferred that she should impute it to circumstances which arranged by myself would not give us an opportunity of being alone together while at the same time preventing her from remaining in the casino and on the beach without me and so i had asked her that day to come with me to doncières where i was going to meet saintloup with a similar hope of occupying her mind i advised her to take up painting in which she had had lessons in the past while working she would not ask herself whether she was happy or unhappy i would gladly have taken her also to dine now and again with the verdurins and the cambremers who certainly would have been delighted to see any friend introduced by myself but i must first make certain that mme putbus was not yet at la raspelière it was only by going there in person that i could make sure of this and as i knew beforehand that on the next day but one albertine would be going on a visit with her aunt i had seized this opportunity to send mme verdurin a telegram asking her whether she would be at home upon wednesday if mme putbus was there i would manage to see her maid ascertain whether there was any danger of her coming to balbec and if so find out when so as to take albertine out of reach on the day the little local railway making a loop which did not exist at the time when i had taken it with my grandmother now extended to doncièreslagoupil a big station at which important trains stopped among them the express by which i had come down to visit saintloup from paris and the corresponding express by which i had returned and because of the bad weather the omnibus from the grand hotel took albertine and myself to the station of the little tram balbecplage

   the little train had not yet arrived but one could see lazy and slow the plume of smoke that it had left in its wake which confined now to its own power of locomotion as an almost stationary cloud was slowly mounting the green slope of the cliff of criquetot finally the little tram which it had preceded by taking a vertical course arrived in its turn at a leisurely crawl the passengers who were waiting to board it stepped back to make way for it but without hurrying knowing that they were dealing with a goodnatured almost human traveller who guided like the bicycle of a beginner by the obliging signals of the stationmaster in the strong hands of the enginedriver was in no danger of running over anybody and would come to a halt at the proper place

   my telegram explained the verdurins’ telephone message and had been all the more opportune since wednesday the day i had fixed happened to be a wednesday was the day set apart for dinnerparties by mme verdurin at la raspelière as in paris a fact of which i was unaware mme verdurin did not give ‘dinners’ but she had ‘wednesdays’ these wednesdays were works of art while fully conscious that they had not their match anywhere mme verdurin introduced shades of distinction between them “last wednesday was not as good as the one before” she would say “but i believe the next will be one of the best i have ever given” sometimes she went so far as to admit “this wednesday was not worthy of the others but i have a big surprise for you next week” in the closing weeks of the paris season before leaving for the country the mistress would announce the end of the wednesdays it gave her an opportunity to stimulate the faithful “there are only three more wednesdays left there are only two more” she would say in the same tone as though the world were coming to an end “you aren’t going to miss next wednesday for the finale” but this finale was a sham for she would announce “officially there will be no more wednesdays today was the last for this year but i shall be at home all the same on wednesday we shall have a little wednesday to ourselves i dare say these little private wednesdays will be the nicest of all” at la raspelière the wednesdays were of necessity restricted and since if they had discovered a friend who was passing that way they would invite him for one or another evening almost every day of the week became a wednesday “i don’t remember all the guests but i know there’s madame la marquise de camembert” the liftboy had told me his memory of our discussion of the name cambremer had not succeeded in definitely supplanting that of the old world whose syllables familiar and full of meaning came to the young employee’s rescue when he was embarrassed by this difficult name and were immediately preferred and readopted by him not by any means from laziness or as an old and ineradicable usage but because of the need for logic and clarity which they satisfied

   we hastened in search of an empty carriage in which i could hold albertine in my arms throughout the journey having failed to find one we got into a compartment in which there was already installed a lady with a massive face old and ugly with a masculine expression very much in her sunday best who was reading the revue des deux mondes notwithstanding her commonness she was eclectic in her tastes and i found amusement in asking myself to what social category she could belong i at once concluded that she must be the manager of some large brothel a procuress on holiday her face her manner proclaimed the fact aloud only i had never yet supposed that such ladies read the revue des deux mondes albertine drew my attention to her with a wink and a smile the lady wore an air of extreme dignity and as i for my part bore within me the consciousness that i was invited two days later to the terminal point of the little railway by the famous mme verdurin that at an intermediate station i was awaited by robert de saintloup and that a little farther on i had it in my power to give great pleasure to mme de cambremer by going to stay at féterne my eyes sparkled with irony as i studied this selfimportant lady who seemed to think that because of her elaborate attire the feathers in her hat her revue des deux mondes she was a more considerable personage than myself i hoped that the lady would not remain in the train much longer than m nissim bernard and that she would alight at least at toutainville but no the train stopped at evreville she remained seated similarly at montmartinsurmer at parvillelabingard at incarville so that in despair when the train had left saintfrichoux which was the last station before doncières i began to embrace albertine without bothering about the lady at doncières saintloup had come to meet me at the station with the greatest difficulty he told me for as he was staying with his aunt my telegram had only just reached him and he could not having been unable to make any arrangements beforehand spare me more than an hour of his time this hour seemed to me alas far too long for as soon as we had left the train albertine devoted her whole attention to saintloup she never talked to me barely answered me if i addressed her repulsed me when i approached her with robert on the other hand she laughed her provoking laugh talked to him volubly played with the dog he had brought with him and as she excited the animal deliberately rubbed against its master i remembered that on the day when albertine had allowed me to kiss her for the first time i had had a smile of gratitude for the unknown seducer who had wrought so profound a change in her and had so far simplified my task i thought of him now with horror robert must have noticed that i was not unconcerned about albertine for he offered no response to her provocations which made her extremely annoyed with myself then he spoke to me as though i had been alone which when she realised it raised me again in her esteem robert asked me if i would not like to meet those of his friends with whom he used to make me dine every evening at doncières when i was staying there who were still in the garrison and as he himself adopted that irritating manner which he rebuked in others “what is the good of your having worked so hard to charm them if you don’t want to see them again” i declined his offer for i did not wish to run any risk of being parted from albertine but also because now i was detached from them from them which is to say from myself we passionately long that there may be another life in which we shall be similar to what we are here below but we do not pause to reflect that even without waiting for that other life in this life after a few years we are unfaithful to what we have been to what we wished to remain immortally even without supposing that death is to alter us more completely than the changes that occur in the course of a lifetime if in that other life we were to encounter the self that we have been we should turn away from ourselves as from those people with whom we were once on friendly terms but whom we have not seen for years — such as saintloup’s friends whom i used so much to enjoy meeting again every evening at the faisan doré and whose conversation would now have seemed to me merely a boring importunity in this respect and because i preferred not to go there in search of what had pleased me there in the past a stroll through doncières might have seemed to me a préfiguration of an arrival in paradise we dream much of paradise or rather of a number of successive paradises but each of them is long before we die a paradise lost in which we should feel ourselves lost also

   he left us at the station “but you may have about an hour to wait” he told me “if you spend it here you will probably see my uncle charlus who is going by the train to paris ten minutes before yours i have said goodbye to him already because i have to go back before his train starts i didn’t tell him about you because i hadn’t got your telegram” to the reproaches which i heaped upon albertine when saintloup had left us she replied that she had intended by her coldness towards me to destroy any idea that he might have formed if at the moment when the train stopped he had seen me leaning against her with my arm round her waist he had indeed noticed this attitude i had not caught sight of him otherwise i should have adopted one that was more correct and had had time to murmur in my ear “so that’s how it is one of those priggish little girls you told me about who wouldn’t go near mlle de stermaria because they thought her fast” i had indeed mentioned to robert and in all sincerity when i went down from paris to visit him at doncières and when we were talking about our time at balbec that there was nothing to be had from albertine that she was the embodiment of virtue and now that i had long since discovered for myself that this was false i was even more anxious that robert should believe it to be true it would have been sufficient for me to tell robert that i was in love with albertine he was one of those people who are capable of denying themselves a pleasure to spare their friend sufferings which they would feel even more keenly if they themselves were the victims “yes she is still rather childish but you don’t know anything against her” i added anxiously “nothing except that i saw you clinging together like a pair of lovers”

    “your attitude destroyed absolutely nothing” i told albertine when saintloup had left us “quite true” she said to me “it was stupid of me i hurt your feelings i’m far more unhappy about it than you are you’ll see i shall never be like that again forgive me” she pleaded holding out her hand with a sorrowful air at that moment from the entrance to the waitingroom in which we were sitting i saw advance slowly followed at a respectful distance by a porter loaded with his baggage m de charlus

   in paris where i encountered him only in evening dress immobile straitlaced in a black coat maintained in a vertical posture by his proud aloofness his thirst for admiration the soar of his conversation i had never realised how far he had aged now in a light travelling suit which made him appear stouter as he swaggered through the room balancing a pursy stomach and an almost symbolical behind the cruel light of day broke up into paint upon his lips ricepowder fixed by cold cream on the tip of his nose black upon his dyed moustaches whose ebon tint formed a contrast to his grizzled hair all that by artificial light had seemed the animated colouring of a man who was still young

   while i stood talking to him though briefly because of his train i kept my eye on albertine’s carriage to shew her that i was coming when i turned my head towards m de charlus he asked nie to be so kind as to summon a soldier a relative of his who was standing on the other side of the platform as though he were waiting to take our train but in the opposite direction away from balbec “he is in his regimental band” said m de charlus “as you are so fortunate as to be still young enough and i unfortunately am old enough for you to save me the trouble of going across to him” i took it upon myself to go across to the soldier he pointed out to me and saw from the lyres embroidered on his collar that he was a bandsman but just as i was preparing to execute my commission what was my surprise and i may say my pleasure on recognising morel the son of my uncle’s valet who recalled to me so many memories they made me forget to convey m de charlus’s message “what you are at doncières” “yes and they’ve put me in the band attached to the batteries” but he made this answer in a dry and haughty tone he had become an intense ‘poseur’ and evidently the sight of myself reminding him of his father’s profession was not pleasing to him suddenly i saw m de charlus descending upon us my delay had evidently taxed his patience “i should like to listen to a little music this evening” he said to morel without any preliminaries “i pay five hundred francs for the evening which may perhaps be of interest to one of your friends if you have any in the band” knowing as i did the insolence of m de charlus i was astonished at his not even saying how d’ye do to his young friend the baron did not however give me time to think holding out his hand in the friendliest manner “goodbye my dear fellow” he said as a hint that i might now leave them i had as it happened left my dear albertine too long alone “d’you know” i said to her as i climbed into the carriage “life by the seaside and travelling make me realise that the theatre of the world is stocked with fewer settings than actors and with fewer actors than situations” “what makes you say that” “because m de charlus asked me just now to fetch one of his friends whom this instant on the platform of this station i have just discovered to be one of my own” but as i uttered these words i began to wonder how the baron could have bridged the social gulf to which i had not given a thought it occurred to me first of all that it might be through jupien whose niece as the reader may remember had seemed to shew a preference for the violinist what did baffle me completely was that when due to leave for paris in five minutes the baron should have asked for a musical evening but visualising jupien’s niece again in my memory i was beginning to find that ‘recognitions’ did indeed play an important part in life when all of a sudden the truth flashed across my mind and i realised that i had been absurdly innocent m de charlus had never in his life set eyes upon morel nor morel upon m de charlus who dazzled but also terrified by a warrior albeit he bore no weapon but a lyre had called upon me in his emotion to bring him the person whom he never suspected that i already knew in any case the offer of five hundred francs must have made up to morel for the absence of any previous relations for i saw that they continued to talk without reflecting that they were standing close beside our tram as i recalled the manner in which m de charlus had come up to morel and myself i saw at once the resemblance to certain of his relatives when they picked up a woman in the street only the desired object had changed its sex after a certain age and even if different evolutions are occurring in us the more we become ourselves the more our characteristic features are accentuated for nature while harmoniously contributing the design of her tapestry breaks the monotony of the composition thanks to the variety of the intercepted forms besides the arrogance with which m de charlus had accosted the violinist is relative and depends upon the point of view one adopts it would have been recognised by three out of four of the men in society who nodded their heads to him not by the prefect of police who a few years later was to keep him under observation

    “the paris train is signalled sir” said the porter who was carrying his luggage “but i am not going by the train put it in the cloakroom damn you” said m de charlus as he gave twenty francs to the porter astonished by the change of plan and charmed by the tip this generosity at once attracted a flowerseller “buy these carnations look this lovely rose kind gentlemen it will bring you luck” m de charlus out of patience handed her a couple of francs in exchange for which the woman gave him her blessing and her flowers as well “good god why can’t she leave us alone” said m de charlus addressing himself in an ironical and complaining tone as of a man distraught to morel to whom he found a certain comfort in appealing “we’ve quite enough to talk about as it is” perhaps the porter was not yet out of earshot perhaps m de charlus did not care to have too numerous an audience perhaps these incidental remarks enabled his lofty timidity not to approach too directly the request for an assignation the musician turning with a frank imperative and decided air to the flowerseller raised a hand which repulsed her and indicated to her that they did not want her flowers and that she was to get out of their way as quickly as possible m de charlus observed with ecstasy this authoritative virile gesture made by the graceful hand for which it ought still to have been too weighty too massively brutal with a precocious firmness and suppleness which gave to this still beardless adolescent the air of a young david capable of waging war against goliath the baron’s admiration was unconsciously blended with the smile with which we observe in a child an expression of gravity beyond his years “this is a person whom i should like to accompany me on my travels and help me in my business how he would simplify my life” m de charlus said to himself

   the train for paris which m de charlus did not take started then we took our seats in our own train albertine and i without my knowing what had become of m de charlus and morel “we must never quarrel any more i beg your pardon again” albertine repeated alluding to the saintloup incident “we must always be nice to each other” she said tenderly “as for your friend saintloup if you think that i am the least bit interested in him you are quite mistaken all that i like about him is that he seems so very fond of you” “he’s a very good fellow” i said taking care not to supply robert with those imaginary excellences which i should not have failed to invent out of friendship for himself had i been with anybody but albertine “he’s an excellent creature frank devoted loyal a person you can rely on to do anything” in saying this i confined myself held in check by my jealousy to telling the truth about saintloup but what i said was literally true it found expression in precisely the same terms that mme de villeparisis had employed in speaking to me of him when i did not yet know him imagined him to be so different so proud and said to myself “people think him good because he is a great gentleman” just as when she had said to me “he would be so pleased” i imagined after seeing him outside the hotel preparing to drive away that his aunt’s speech had been a mere social banality intended to natter me and i had realised afterwards that she had said what she did sincerely thinking of the things that interested me of my reading and because she knew that that was what saintloup liked as it was to be my turn to say sincerely to somebody who was writing a history of his ancestor la rochefoucauld the author of the maximes who wished to consult robert about him “he will be so pleased” it was simply that i had learned to know him but when i set eyes on him for the first time i had not supposed that an intelligence akin to my own could be enveloped in so much outward elegance of dress and attitude by his feathers i had judged him to be a bird of another species it was albertine now who perhaps a little because saintloup in his kindness to myself had been so cold to her said to me what i had already thought “ah he is as devoted as all that i notice that people always find all the virtues in other people when they belong to the faubourg saintgermain” now that saintloup belonged to the faubourg saintgermain was a thing of which i had never once thought in the course of all these years in which stripping himself of his prestige he had displayed to me his virtues a change in our perspective in looking at other people more striking already in friendship than in merely social relations but how much more striking still in love where desire on so vast a scale increases to such proportions the slightest signs of coolness that far less than the coolness saintloup had shewn me in the beginning had been enough to make me suppose at first that albertine scorned me imagine her friends to be creatures marvellously inhuman and ascribe merely to the indulgence that people feel for beauty and for a certain elegance elstir’s judgment when he said to me of the little band with just the same sentiment as mme de villeparisis speaking of saintloup “they are good girls” but this was not the opinion that i would instinctively have formed when i heard albertine say “in any case whether he’s devoted or not i sincerely hope i shall never see him again since he’s made us quarrel we must never quarrel again it isn’t nice” i felt since she had seemed to desire saintloup almost cured for the time being of the idea that she cared for women which i had supposed to be incurable and faced by albertine’s mackintosh in which she seemed to have become another person the tireless vagrant of rainy days and which closefitting malleable and grey seemed at that moment not so much intended to protect her garments from the rain as to have been soaked by her and to be clinging to my mistress’s body as though to take the imprint of her form for a sculptor i tore apart that tunic which jealously espoused a longedfor bosom and drawing albertine towards me “but won’t you indolent traveller dream upon my shoulder resting your brow upon it” i said taking her head in my hands and shewing her the wide meadows flooded and silent which extended in the gathering dusk to the horizon closed by the parallel openings of valleys far and blue

   two days later on the famous wednesday in that same little train which i had again taken at balbec to go and dine at la raspelière i was taking care not to miss cottard at graincourtsaintvast where a second telephone message from mme verdurin had told me that i should find him he was to join my train and would tell me where we had to get out to pick up the carriages that would be sent from la raspelière to the station and so as the little train barely stopped for a moment at graincourt the first station after doncières i was standing in readiness at the open window so afraid was i of not seeing cottard or of his not seeing me vain fears i had not realised to what an extent the little clan had moulded all its regular members after the same type so that they being moreover in full evening dress as they stood waiting upon the platform let themselves be recognised immediately by a certain air of assurance fashion and familiarity by a look in their eyes which seemed to sweep like an empty space in which there was nothing to arrest their attention the serried ranks of the common herd watched for the arrival of some fellowmember who had taken the train at an earlier station and sparkled in anticipation of the talk that was to come this sign of election with which the habit of dining together had marked the members of the little group was not all that distinguished them when numerous in full strength they were massed together forming a more brilliant patch in the midst of the troop of passengers — what brichot called the pecus — upon whose dull countenances could be read no conception of what was meant by the name verdurin no hope of ever dining at la raspelière to be sure these common travellers would have been less interested than myself had anyone quoted in their hearing — notwithstanding the notoriety that several of them had achieved — the names of those of the faithful whom i was astonished to see continuing to dine out when many of them had already been doing so according to the stories that i had heard before my birth at a period at once so distant and so vague that i was inclined to exaggerate its remoteness the contrast between the continuance not only of their existence but of the fulness of their powers and the annihilation of so many friends whom i had already seen in one place or another pass away gave me the same sentiment that we feel when in the stoppress column of the newspapers we read the very announcement that we least expected for instance that of an untimely death which seems to us fortuitous because the causes that have led up to it have remained outside our knowledge this is the feeling that death does not descend upon all men alike but that a more oncoming wave of its tragic tide carries off a life placed at the same level as others which the waves that follow will long continue to spare we shall see later on that the diversity of the forms of death that circulate invisibly is the cause of the peculiar unexpectedness presented in the newspapers by their obituary notices then i saw that with the passage of time not only do the real talents that may coexist with the most commonplace conversation reveal and impose themselves but furthermore that mediocre persons arrive at those exalted positions attached in the imagination of our childhood to certain famous elders when it never occurred to us that after a certain number of years their disciples become masters would be famous also and would inspire the respect and awe that once they felt but if the names of the faithful were unknown to the pecus their aspect still singled them out in its eyes indeed in the train when the coincidence of what one or another of them might have been doing during the day assembled them all together having to collect at a subsequent station only an isolated member the carriage in which they were gathered ticketed with the elbow of the sculptor ski flagged with cottard’s temps stood out in the distance like a special saloon and rallied at the appointed station the tardy comrade the only one who might because of his semiblindness have missed these welcoming signals was brichot but one of the party would always volunteer to keep a lookout for the blind man and as soon as his straw hat his green umbrella and blue spectacles caught the eye he would be gently but hastily guided towards the chosen compartment so that it was inconceivable that one of the faithful without exciting the gravest suspicions of his being ‘on the loose’ or even of his not having come ‘by the train’ should not pick up the others in the course of the journey sometimes the opposite process occurred one of the faithful had been obliged to go some distance down the line during the afternoon and was obliged in consequence to make part of the journey alone before being joined by the group but even when thus isolated alone of his kind he did not fail as a rule to produce a certain effect the future towards which he was travelling marked him out to the person on the seat opposite who would say to himself “that must be somebody” would discern round the soft hat of cottard or of the sculptor ski a vague aureole and would be only halfastonished when at the next station an elegant crowd if it were their terminal point greeted the faithful one at the carriage door and escorted him to one of the waiting carriages all of them reverently saluted by the factotum of douville station or if it were an intermediate station invaded the compartment this was what was done and with precipitation for some of them had arrived late just as the train which was already in the station was about to start by the troop which cottard led at a run towards the carriage in the window of which he had seen me signalling brichot who was among these faithful had become more faithful than ever in the course of these years which had diminished the assiduity of others as his sight became steadily weaker he had been obliged even in paris to reduce more and more his working hours after dark besides he was out of sympathy with the modern sorbonne where ideas of scientific exactitude after the german model were beginning to prevail over humanism he now confined himself exclusively to his lectures and to his duties as an examiner and so had a great deal more time to devote to social pursuits that is to say to evenings at the verdurins’ or to those parties that now and again were offered to the verdurins by one of the faithful tremulous with emotion it is true that on two occasions love had almost succeeded in achieving what his work could no longer do in detaching brichot from the little clan but mme verdurin who kept her eyes open and moreover having acquired the habit in the interests of her salon had come to take a disinterested pleasure in this sort of drama and execution had immediately brought about a coolness between him and the dangerous person being skilled in as she expressed it ‘putting things in order’ and ‘applying the red hot iron to the wound’ this she had found all the more easy in the case of one of the dangerous persons who was simply brichot’s laundress and mme verdurin having the right of entry into the professor’s fifth floor rooms crimson with rage when she deigned to climb his stairs had only had to shut the door in the wretched woman’s face “what” the mistress had said to brichot “a woman like myself does you the honour of calling upon you and you receive a creature like that” brichot had never forgotten the service that mme verdurin had rendered him by preventing his old age from foundering in the mire and became more and more strongly attached to her whereas in contrast to this revival of affection and possibly because of it the mistress was beginning to be tired of a too docile follower and of an obedience of which she could be certain beforehand but brichot derived from his intimacy with the verdurins a distinction which set him apart from all his colleagues at the sorbonne they were dazzled by the accounts that he gave them of dinnerparties to which they would never be invited by the mention made of him in the reviews the exhibition of his portrait in the salon by some writer or painter of repute whose talent the occupants of the other chairs in the faculty of arts esteemed but without any prospect of attracting his attention not to mention the elegance of the mundane philosopher’s attire an elegance which they had mistaken at first for slackness until their colleague kindly explained to them that a tall hat is naturally laid on the floor when one is paying a call and is not the right thing for dinners in the country however smart where it should be replaced by a soft hat which goes quite well with a dinnerjacket for the first few moments after the little group had plunged into the carriage i could not even speak to cottard for he was suffocated not so much by having run in order not to miss the train as by his astonishment at having caught it so exactly he felt more than the joy inherent in success almost the hilarity of an excellent joke “ah that was a good one” he said when he had recovered himself “a minute later ‘pon my soul that’s what they call arriving in the nick of time” he added with a wink intended not so much to inquire whether the expression were apt for he was now overflowing with assurance but to express his satisfaction at length he was able to introduce me to the other members of the little clan i was annoyed to see that they were almost all in the dress which in paris is called smoking i had forgotten that the verdurins were beginning a timid evolution towards fashionable ways retarded by the dreyfus case accelerated by the ‘new’ music an evolution which for that matter they denied and continued to deny until it was complete like those military objectives which a general does not announce until he has reached them so as not to appear defeated if he fails in addition to which society was quite prepared to go half way to meet them it went so far as to regard them as people to whose house nobody in society went but who were not in the least perturbed by the fact the verdurin salon was understood to be a temple of music it was there people assured you that vinteuil had found inspiration encouragement now even if vinteuil’s sonata remained wholly unappreciated and almost unknown his name quoted as that of the greatest of modern composers had an extraordinary effect moreover certain young men of the faubourg having decided that they ought to be more intellectual than the middle classes there were three of them who had studied music and among these vinteuil’s sonata enjoyed an enormous vogue they would speak of it on returning to their homes to the intelligent mothers who had incited them to acquire culture and taking an interest in what interested their sons at a concert these mothers would gaze with a certain respect at mme verdurin in her front box following the music in the printed score so far this social success latent in the verdurins was revealed by two facts only in the first place mme verdurin would say of the principessa di caprarola “ah she is intelligent she is a charming woman what i cannot endure are the imbeciles the people who bore me they drive me mad” which would have made anybody at all perspicacious realise that the principessa di caprarola a woman who moved in the highest society had called upon mme verdurin she had even mentioned her name in the course of a visit of condolence which she had paid to mme swann after the death of her husband and had asked whether she knew them “what name did you say” odette had asked with a sudden wistfulness “verdurin oh yes of course” she had continued in a plaintive tone “i don’t know them or rather i know them without really knowing them they are people i used to meet at people’s houses years ago they are quite nice” when the principessa di caprarola had gone odette would fain have spoken the bare truth but the immediate falsehood was not the fruit of her calculations but the revelation of her fears of her desires she denied not what it would have been adroit to deny but what she would have liked not to have happened even if the other person was bound to hear an hour later that it was a fact a little later she had recovered her assurance and would indeed anticipate questions by saying so as not to appear to be afraid of them “mme verdurin why i used to know her terribly well” with an affectation of humility like a great lady who tells you that she has taken the tram “there has been a great deal of talk about the verdurins lately” said mme de souvré odette with the smiling disdain of a duchess replied “yes i do seem to have heard a lot about them lately every now and then there are new people who arrive like that in society” without reflecting that she herself was among the newest “the principessa di caprarola has dined there” mme de souvré went on “ah” replied odette accentuating her smile “that does not surprise me that sort of thing always begins with the principessa di caprarola and then some one else follows suit like comtesse mole” odette in saying this appeared to be filled with a profound contempt for the two great ladies who made a habit of ‘housewarming’ in recently established drawingrooms one felt from her tone that the implication was that she odette was like mme de souvré not the sort of person to let herself in for that sort of thing

   after the admission that mme verdurin had made of the principessa di caprarola’s intelligence the second indication that the verdurins were conscious of their future destiny was that without of course their having formally requested it they became most anxious that people should now come to dine with them in evening dress m verdurin could now have been greeted without shame by his nephew the one who was ‘in the cart’ among those who entered my carriage at graincourt was saniette who long ago had been expelled from the verdurins’ by his cousin forcheville but had since returned his faults from the social point of view had originally been — notwithstanding his superior qualities — something like cottard’s shyness anxiety to please fruitless attempts to succeed in doing so but if the course of life by making cottard assume if not at the verdurins’ where he had because of the influence that past associations exert over us when we find ourselves in familiar surroundings remained more or less the same at least in his practice in his hospital ward at the academy of medicine a shell of coldness disdain gravity that became more accentuated while he rewarded his appreciative students with puns had made a clean cut between the old cottard and the new the same defects had on the contrary become exaggerated in saniette the more he sought to correct them conscious that he was frequently boring that people did not listen to him instead of then slackening his pace as cottard would have done of forcing their attention by an air of authority not only did he try by adopting a humorous tone to make them forgive the unduly serious turn of his conversation he increased his pace cleared the ground used abbreviations in order to appear less longwinded more familiar with the matters of which he spoke and succeeded only by making them unintelligible in seeming interminable his selfassurance was not like that of cottard freezing his patients who when other people praised his social graces would reply “he is a different man when he receives you in his consulting room you with your face to the light and he with his back to it and those piercing eyes” it failed to create an effect one felt that it was cloaking an excessive shyness that the merest trifle would be enough to dispel it saniette whose friends had always told him that he was wanting in selfconfidence and who had indeed seen men whom he rightly considered greatly inferior to himself attain with ease to the success that was denied to him never began telling a story without smiling at its drollery fearing lest a serious air might make his hearers underestimate the value of his wares sometimes giving him credit for the comic element which he himself appeared to find in what he was about to say people would do him the honour of a general silence but the story would fall flat a fellowguest who was endowed with a kind heart would sometimes convey to saniette the private almost secret encouragement of a smile of approbation making it reach him furtively without attracting attention as one passes a note from hand to hand but nobody went so far as to assume the responsibility to risk the glaring publicity of an honest laugh long after the story was ended and had fallen flat saniette crestfallen would remain smiling to himself as though relishing in it and for himself the delectation which he pretended to find adequate and which the others had not felt as for the sculptor ski so styled on account of the difficulty they found in pronouncing his polish surname and because he himself made an affectation since he had begun to move in a certain social sphere of not wishing to be confused with certain relatives perfectly respectable but slightly boring and very numerous he had at fortyfour and with no pretension to good looks a sort of boyishness a dreamy wistfulness which was the result of his having been until the age of ten the most charming prodigal imaginable the darling of all the ladies mme verdurin maintained that he was more of an artist than elstir any resemblance that there may have been between them was however purely external it was enough to make elstir who had met ski once feel for him the profound repulsion that is inspired in us less by the people who are our exact opposite than by those who résemble us in what is least good in whom are displayed our worst qualities the faults of which we have cured ourselves who irritate by reminding us of how we may have appeared to certain other people before we became what we now are but mme verdurin thought that ski had more temperament than elstir because there was no art in which he had not a facility of expression and she was convinced that he would have developed that facility into talent if he had not been so lazy this seemed to the mistress to be actually an additional gift being the opposite of hard work which she regarded as the lot of people devoid of genius ski would paint anything you asked on cufflinks or on the panels over doors he sang with the voice of a composer played from memory giving the piano the effect of an orchestra less by his virtuosity than by his vamped basses which suggested the inability of the fingers to indicate that at a certain point the cornet entered which for that matter he would imitate with his lips choosing his words when he spoke so as to convey an odd impression just as he would pause before banging out a chord to say ‘ping’ so as to let the brasses be heard he was regarded as marvellously intelligent but as a matter of fact his ideas could be boiled down to two or three extremely limited bored with his reputation for whimsicality he had set himself to shew that he was a practical matteroffact person whence a triumphant affectation of false precision of false common sense aggravated by his having no memory and a fund of information that was always inaccurate the movements of his head neck limbs would have been graceful if he had been still nine years old with golden curls a wide lace collar and little boots of red leather having reached graincourt station with cottard and brichot with time to spare he and cottard had left brichot in the waitingroom and had gone for a stroll when cottard proposed to turn back ski had replied “but there is no hurry it isn’t the local train today it’s the departmental train” delighted by the effect that this refinement of accuracy produced upon cottard he added with reference to himself “yes because ski loves the arts because he models in clay people think he’s not practical nobody knows this line better than i do” nevertheless they had turned back towards the station when all of a sudden catching sight of the smoke of the approaching train cottard with a wild shout had exclaimed “we shall have to put our best foot foremost” they did as a matter of fact arrive with not a moment to spare the distinction between local and departmental trains having never existed save in the mind of ski “but isn’t the princess on the train” came in ringing tones from brichot whose huge spectacles resplendent as the reflectors that laryngologists attach to their foreheads to throw a light into the throats of their patients seemed to have taken their life from the professor’s eyes and possibly because of the effort that he was making to adjust his sight to them seemed themselves even at the most trivial moments to be gazing at themselves with a sustained attention and an extraordinary fixity brichot’s malady as it gradually deprived him of his sight had revealed to him the beauties of that sense just as frequently we have to have made up our minds to part with some object to make a present of it for instance before we can study it regret it admire it “no no the princess went over to maineville with some of mme verdurin’s guests who were taking the paris train it is within the bounds of possibility that mme verdurin who had some business at saintmars may be with her in that case she will be coming with us and we shall all travel together which will be delightful we shall have to keep our eyes skinned at maineville and see what we shall see oh but that’s nothing you may say that we came very near to missing the bus when i saw the train i was dumbfoundered that’s what is called arriving at the psychological moment can’t you picture us missing the train mme verdurin seeing the carriages come back without us tableau” added the doctor who had not yet recovered from his emotion “that would be a pretty good joke wouldn’t it now then brichot what have you to say about our little escapade” inquired the doctor with a note of pride “upon my soul” replied brichot “why yes if you had found the train gone that would have been what the late villemain used to call a wipe in the eye” but i distracted at first by these people who were strangers to me was suddenly reminded of what cottard had said to me in the ballroom of the little casino and just as though there were an invisible link uniting an organ to our visual memory the vision of albertine leaning her breasts against andrée’s caused my heart a terrible pain this pain did not last the idea of albertine’s having relations with women seemed no longer possible since the occasion fortyeight hours earlier when the advances that my mistress had made to saintloup had excited in me a fresh jealousy which had made me forget the old i was simple enough to suppose that one taste of necessity excludes another at harambouville as the tram was full a farmer in a blue blouse who had only a third class ticket got into our compartment the doctor feeling that the princess must not be allowed to travel with such a person called a porter shewed his card describing him as medical officer to one of the big railway companies and obliged the stationmaster to make the farmer get out this incident so pained and alarmed saniette’s timid spirit that as soon as he saw it beginning fearing already lest in view of the crowd of peasants on the platform it should assume the proportions of a rising he pretended to be suffering from a stomachache and so that he might not be accused of any share in the responsibility for the doctor’s violence wandered down the corridor pretending to be looking for what cottard called the ‘water’ failing to find one he stood and gazed at the scenery from the other end of the ‘twister’ “if this is your first appearance at mme verdurin’s sir” i was addressed by brichot anxious to shew off his talents before a newcomer “you will find that there is no place where one feels more the ‘amenities of life’ to quote one of the inventors of dilettantism of pococurantism of all sorts of words in — ism that are in fashion among our little snobbesses i refer to m le prince de talleyrand” for when he spoke of these great noblemen of the past he thought it clever and ‘in the period’ to prefix a ‘m’ to their titles and said ‘m le duc de la rochefoucauld’ ‘m le cardinal de retz’ referring to these also as ‘that struggleforlifer de gondi’ ‘that boulangist de marcillac’ and he never failed to call montesquieu with a smile when he referred to him “monsieur le président secondât de montesquieu” an intelligent man of the world would have been irritated by a pedantry which reeked so of the lectureroom but in the perfect manners of the man of the world when speaking of a prince there is a pedantry also which betrays a different caste that in which one prefixes ‘the emperor’ to the name ‘william’ and addresses a royal highness in the third person “ah now that is a man” brichot continued still referring to ‘monsieur le prince de talleyrand’—“to whom we take off our hats he is an ancestor” “it is a charming house” cottard told me “you will find a little of everything for mme verdurin is not exclusive great scholars like brichot the high nobility such as the princess sherbatoff a great russian lady a friend of the grand duchess eudoxie who even sees her alone at hours when no one else is admitted” as a matter of fact the grand duchess eudoxie not wishing princess sherbatoff who for years past had been cut by everyone to come to her house when there might be other people allowed her to come only in the early morning when her imperial highness was not at home to any of those friends to whom it would have been as unpleasant to meet the princess as it would have been awkward for the princess to meet them as for the last three years as soon as she came away like a manicurist from the grand duchess mme sherbatoff would go on to mme verdurin who had just awoken and stuck to her for the rest of the day one might say that the princess’s loyalty surpassed even that of brichot constant as he was at those wednesdays both in paris where he had the pleasure of fancying himself a sort of chateaubriand at l’abbayeauxbois and in the country where he saw himself becoming the equivalent of what might have been in the salon of mme de châtelet the man whom he always named with an erudite sarcasm and satisfaction “m de voltaire”

   her want of friends had enabled princess sherbatoff to shew for some years past to the verdurins a fidelity which made her more than an ordinary member of the ‘faithful’ the type of faithfulness the ideal which mme verdurin had long thought unattainable and which now in her later years she at length found incarnate in this new feminine recruit however keenly the mistress might feel the pangs of jealousy it was without precedent that the most assiduous of her faithful should not have ‘failed’ her at least once the most stayathome yielded to the temptation to travel the most continent fell from virtue the most robust might catch influenza the idlest be caught for his month’s soldiering the most indifferent go to close the eyes of a dying mother and it was in vain that mme verdurin told them then like the roman empress that she was the sole general whom her legion must obey like the christ or the kaiser that he who loved his father or mother more than her and was not prepared to leave them and follow her was not worthy of her that instead of slacking in bed or letting themselves be made fools of by bad women they would do better to remain in her company by her their sole remedy and sole delight but destiny which is sometimes pleased to brighten the closing years of a life that has passed the mortal span had made mme verdurin meet the princess sherbatoff out of touch with her family an exile from her native land knowing nobody but the baroness putbus and the grand duchess eudoxie to whose houses because she herself had no desire to meet the friends of the former and the latter no desire that her friends should meet the princess she went only in the early morning hours when mme verdurin was still asleep never once so far as she could remember having been confined to her room since she was twelve years old when she had had the measles having on the 3lst of december replied to mme verdurin who afraid of being left alone had asked her whether she would not ‘shake down’ there for the night in spite of its being new year’s eve “why what is there to prevent me any day of the year besides tomorrow is a day when one stays at home and this is my home” living in a boardinghouse and moving from it whenever the verdurins moved accompanying them upon their holidays the princess had so completely exemplified to mme verdurin the line of vigny

   thou only didst appear that which one seeks always

   that the lady president of the little circle anxious to make sure of one of her ‘faithful’ even after death had made her promise that whichever of them survived the other should be buried by her side before strangers — among whom we must always reckon him to whom we lie most barefacedly because he is the person whose scorn we should most dread ourself — princess sherbatoff took care to represent her only three friendships — with the grand duchess the verdurins and the baroness putbus — as the only ones not which cataclysms beyond her control had allowed to emerge from the destruction of all the rest but which a free choice had made her elect in preference to any other and to which a certain love of solitude and simplicity had made her confine herself “i see nobody else” she would say insisting upon the inflexible character of what appeared to be rather a rule that one imposes upon oneself than a necessity to which one submits she would add “i visit only three houses” as a dramatist who fears that it may not run to a fourth announces that there will be only three performances of his play whether or not m and mme verdurin believed in the truth of this fiction they had helped the princess to instil it into the minds of the faithful and they in turn were persuaded both that the princess among the thousands of invitations that were offered her had chosen the verdurins alone and that the verdurins courted in vain by all the higher aristocracy had consented to make but a single exception in favour of the princess

   in their eyes the princess too far superior to her native element not to find it boring among all the people whose society she might have enjoyed found the verdurins alone entertaining while they in return deaf to the overtures with which they were bombarded by the entire aristocracy had consented to make but a single exception in favour of a great lady of more intelligence than the rest of her kind the princess sherbatoff

   the princess was very rich she engaged for every first night a large box to which with the assent of mme verdurin she invited the faithful and nobody else people would point to this pale and enigmatic person who had grown old without turning white turning red rather like certain sere and shrivelled hedgerow fruits they admired both her influence and her humility for having always with her an academician brichot a famous scientist cottard the leading pianist of the day at a later date m de charlus she nevertheless made a point of securing the least prominent box in the theatre remained in the background paid no attention to the rest of the house lived exclusively for the little group who shortly before the end of the performance would withdraw in the wake of this strange sovereign who was not without a certain timid fascinating faded beauty but if mme sherbatoff did not look at the audience remained in shadow it was to try to forget that there existed a living world which she passionately desired and was unable to know the coterie in a box was to her what is to certain animals their almost corpselike immobility in the presence of danger nevertheless the thirst for novelty and for the curious which possesses people in society made them pay even more attention perhaps to this mysterious stranger than to the celebrities in the front boxes to whom everybody paid a visit they imagined that she must be different from the people whom they knew that a marvellous intellect combined with a discerning bounty retained round about her that little circle of eminent men the princess was compelled if you spoke to her about anyone or introduced anyone to her to feign an intense coldness in order to keep up the fiction of her horror of society nevertheless with the support of cottard or mme verdurin several newcomers succeeded in making her acquaintance and such was her excitement at making a fresh acquaintance that she forgot the fable of her deliberate isolation and went to the wildest extremes to please the newcomer if he was entirely unimportant the rest would be astonished “how strange that the princess who refuses to know anyone should make an exception of such an uninteresting person” but these fertilising acquaintances were rare and the princess lived narrowly confined in the midst of the faithful

   cottard said far more often “i shall see him on wednesday at the verdurins’” than “i shall see him on tuesday at the academy” he spoke too of the wednesdays as of an engagement equally important and inevitable but cottard was one of those people little sought after who make it as imperious a duty to respond to an invitation as if such invitations were orders like a military or judicial summons it required a call from a very important patient to make him “fail” the verdurins on a wednesday the importance depending moreover rather upon the rank of the patient than upon the gravity of his complaint for cottard excellent fellow as he was would forego the delights of a wednesday not for a workman who had had a stroke but for a minister’s cold even then he would say to his wife “make my apologies to mme verdurin tell her that i shall be coming later on his excellency might really have chosen some other day to catch cold” one wednesday their old cook having opened a vein in her arm cottard already in his dinnerjacket to go to the verdurins’ had shrugged his shoulders when his wife had timidly inquired whether he could not bandage the cut “of course i can’t léontine” he had groaned “can’t you see i’ve got my white waistcoat on” so as not to annoy her husband mme cottard had sent post haste for his chief dresser he to save time had taken a cab with the result that his carriage entering the courtyard just as cottard’s was emerging to take him to the verdurins’ five minutes had been wasted in backing to let one another pass mme cottard was worried that the dresser should see his master in evening dress cottard sat cursing the delay from remorse perhaps and started off in a villainous temper which it took all the wednesday’s pleasures to dispel

   if one of cottard’s patients were to ask him “do you ever see the guermantes” it was with the utmost sincerity that the professor would reply “perhaps not actually the guermantes i can’t be certain but i meet all those people at the house of some friends of mine you must of course have heard of the verdurins they know everybody besides they certainly are not people who’ve come down in the world they’ve got the goods all right it is generally estimated that mme verdurin is worth thirtyfive million gad thirtyfive million that’s a pretty figure and so she doesn’t make two bites at a cherry you mentioned the duchesse de guermantes let me explain the difference mme verdurin is a great lady the duchesse de guermantes is probably a nobody you see the distinction of course in any case whether the guermantes go to mme verdurin’s or not she entertains all the very best people the d’sherbatôffs the d’forchevilles e tutti quanti people of the highest flight all the nobility of france and navarre with whom you would see me conversing as man to man of course those sort of people are only too glad to meet the princes of science” he added with a smile of fatuous conceit brought to his lips by his proud satisfaction not so much that the expression formerly reserved for men like potain and charcot should now be applicable to himself as that he knew at last how to employ all these expressions that were authorised by custom and after a long course of study had learned them by heart and so after mentioning to me princess sherbatoff as one of the people who went to mme verdurin’s cottard added with a wink “that gives you an idea of the style of the house if you see what i mean” he meant that it was the very height of fashion now to entertain a russian lady who knew nobody but the grand duchess eudoxie was not fashionable at all but princess sherbatoff might not have known even her it would in no way have diminished cottard’s estimate of the supreme elegance of the verdurin salon or his joy at being invited there the splendour that seems to us to invest the people whose houses we visit is no more intrinsic than that of kings and queens on the stage in dressing whom it is useless for a producer to spend hundreds and thousands of francs in purchasing authentic costumes and real jewels when a great designer will procure a far more sumptuous impression by focussing a ray of light on a doublet of coarse cloth studded with lumps of glass and on a cloak of paper a man may have spent his life among the great ones of the earth who to him have been merely boring relatives or tiresome acquaintances because a familiarity engendered in the cradle had stripped them of all distinction in his eyes the same man on the other hand need only have been led by some chance to mix with the most obscure people for innumerable cottards to be permanently dazzled by the ladies of title whose drawingrooms they imagined as the centres of aristocratic elegance ladies who were not even what mme de villeparisis and her friends were great ladies fallen from their greatness whom the aristocracy that had been brought up with them no longer visited no those whose friendship has been the pride of so many men if these men were to publish their memoirs and to give the names of those women and of the other women who came to their parties mme de cambremer would be no more able than mme de guermantes to identify them but what of that a cottard has thus his marquise who is to him “the baronne” as in marivaux the baronne whose name is never mentioned so much so that nobody supposes that she ever had a name cottard is all the more convinced that she embodies the aristocracy — which has never heard of the lady — in that the more dubious titles are the more prominently coronets are displayed upon wineglasses silver notepaper luggage many cottards who have supposed that they were living in the heart of the faubourg saintgermain have had their imagination perhaps more enchanted by feudal dreams than the men who did really live among princes just as with the small shopkeeper who on sundays goes sometimes to look at “old time” buildings it is sometimes from those buildings every stone of which is of our own time the vaults of which have been by the pupils of violletleduc painted blue and sprinkled with golden stars that they derive the strongest sensation of the middle ages “the princess will be at maineville she will be coming with us but i shall not introduce you to her at once it will be better to leave that to mme verdurin unless i find a loophole then you can rely on me to take the bull by the horns” “what were you saying” asked saniette as he rejoined us pretending to have gone out to take the air “i was quoting to this gentleman” said brichot “a saying which you will remember of the man who to my mind is the first of the finsdesiècle of the eighteenth century that is by name charles maurice abbé de perigord he began by promising to be an excellent journalist but he made a bad end by which i mean that he became a minister life has these tragedies a far from serapulous politician to boot who with the lofty contempt of a thoroughbred nobleman did not hesitate to work in his time for the king of prussia there are no two ways about it and died in the skin of a ‘left centre’”

   at saintpierredesifs we were joined by a glorious girl who unfortunately was not one of the little group i could not tear my eyes from her magnolia skin her dark eyes her bold and admirable outlines a moment later she wanted to open a window for it was hot in the compartment and not wishing to ask leave of everybody as i alone was without a greatcoat she said to me in a quick cool jocular voice “do you mind a little fresh air sir” i would have liked to say to her “come with us to the verdurins’” or “give me your name and address” i answered “no fresh air doesn’t bother me mademoiselle” whereupon without stirring from her seat “do your friends object to smoke” and she lit a cigarette at the third station she sprang from the carriage next day i inquired of albertine who could she be for stupidly thinking that people could have but one sort of love in my jealousy of albertine’s attitude towards robert i was reassured so far as other women were concerned albertine told me i believe quite sincerely that she did not know “i should so much like to see her again” i exclaimed “don’t worry one always sees people again” replied albertine in this particular instance she was wrong i never saw again nor did i ever identify the pretty girl with the cigarette we shall see moreover why for a long time i ceased to look for her but i have not forgotten her i find myself at times when i think of her seized by a wild longing but these recurrences of desire oblige us to reflect that if we wish to rediscover these girls with the same pleasure we must also return to the year which has since been followed by ten others in the course of which her bloom has faded we can sometimes find a person again but we cannot abolish time and so on until the unforeseen day gloomy as a winter night when we no longer seek for that girl or for any other when to find her would actually frighten us for we no longer feel that we have sufficient attraction to appeal to her or strength to love her not of course that we are in the strict sense of the word impotent and as for loving we should love her more than ever but we feel that it is too big an undertaking for the little strength that we have left eternal rest has already fixed intervals which we can neither cross nor make our voice be heard across them to set our foot on the right step is an achievement like not missing the perilous leap to be seen in such a state by a girl we love even if we have kept the features and all the golden locks of our youth we can no longer undertake the strain of keeping pace with youth all the worse if our carnal desire increases instead of failing we procure for it a woman whom we need make no effort to attract who will share our couch for one night only and whom we shall never see again

    “still no news i suppose of the violinist” said cottard the event of the day in the little clan was in fact the failure of mme verdurin’s favourite violinist employed on military service near doncières he came three times a week to dine at la raspelière having a midnight pass but two days ago for the first time the faithful had been unable to discover him on the tram it was supposed that he had missed it but albeit mme verdurin had sent to meet the next tram and so on until the last had arrived the carriage had returned empty “he’s certain to have been shoved into the guardroom there’s no other explanation of his desertion gad in soldiering you know with those fellows it only needs a badtempered serjeant” “it will be all the more mortifying for mme verdurin” said brichot “if he fails again this evening because our kind hostess has invited to dinner for the first time the neighbours from whom she has taken la raspelière the marquis and marquise de cambremer” “this evening the marquis and marquise de cambremer” exclaimed cottard “but i knew absolutely nothing about it naturally i knew like everybody else that they would be coming one day but i had no idea that it was to be so soon sapristi” he went on turning to myself “what did i tell you the princess sherbatoff the marquis and marquise de cambremer” and after repeating these names lulling himself with their melody “you see that we move in good company” he said to me “however as it’s your first appearance you’ll be one of the crowd it is going to be an exceptionally brilliant gathering” and turning to brichot he went on “the mistress will be furious it is time we appeared to lend her a hand” ever since mme verdurin had been at la raspelière she had pretended for the benefit of the faithful to be at once feeling and regretting the necessity of inviting her landlords for one evening by so doing she would obtain better terms next year she explained and was inviting them for business reasons only but she pretended to regard with such terror to make such a bugbear of the idea of dining with people who did not belong to the little group that she kept putting off the evil day the prospect did for that matter alarm her slightly for the reasons which she professed albeit exaggerating them if at the same time it enchanted her for reasons of snobbishness which she preferred to keep to herself she was therefore partly sincere she believed the little clan to be something so matchless throughout the world one of those perfect wholes which it takes centuries of time to produce that she trembled at the thought of seeing introduced into its midst these provincials people ignorant of the ring and the meistersinger who would be unable to play their part in the concert of conversation and were capable by coming to mme verdurin’s of ruining one of those famous wednesdays masterpieces of art incomparable and frail like those venetian glasses which one false note is enough to shatter “besides they are bound to be absolutely anti and militarists” m verdurin had said “oh as for that i don’t mind we’ve heard quite enough about all that business” had replied mme verdurin who a sincere dreyfusard would nevertheless have been glad to discover a social counterpoise to the preponderant dreyfusism of her salon for dreyfusism was triumphant politically but not socially labori reinach picquart zola were still to people in society more or less traitors who could only keep them aloof from the little nucleus and so after this incursion into politics mme verdurin was determined to return to the world of art besides were not indy debussy on the ‘wrong’ side in the case “so far as the case goes we need only remember brichot” she said the don being the only one of the faithful who had sided with the general staff which had greatly lowered him in the esteem of madame verdurin “there is no need to be eternally discussing the dreyfus case no the fact of the matter is that the cambremers bore me” as for the faithful no less excited by their unconfessed desire to make the cambremers’ acquaintance than dupes of the affected reluctance which mme verdurin said she felt to invite them they returned day after day in conversation with her to the base arguments with which she herself supported the invitation tried to make them irresistible “make up your mind to it once and for all” cottard repeated “and you will have better terms for next year they will pay the gardener you will have the use of the meadow that will be well worth a boring evening i am thinking only of yourselves” he added albeit his heart had leaped on one occasion when in mme verdurin’s carriage he had met the carriage of the old mme de cambremer and what was more he had been abased in the sight of the railwaymen when at the station he had found himself standing beside the marquis for their part the cambremers living far too remote from the social movement ever to suspect that certain ladies of fashion were speaking with a certain consideration of mme verdurin imagined that she was a person who could know none but bohemians was perhaps not even legally married and so far as people of birth were concerned would never meet any but themselves they had resigned themselves to the thought of dining with her only to be on good terms with a tenant who they hoped would return again for many seasons especially after they had in the previous month learned that she had recently inherited all those millions it was in silence and without any vulgar pleasantries that they prepared themselves for the fatal day the faithful had given up hope of its ever coming so often had mme verdurin already fixed in their hearing a date that was invariably postponed these false decisions were intended not merely to make a display of the boredom that she felt at the thought of this dinnerparty but to keep in suspense those members of the little group who were staying in the neighbourhood and were sometimes inclined to fail not that the mistress guessed that the “great day” was as delightful a prospect to them as to herself but in order that having persuaded them that this dinnerparty was to her the most terrible of social duties she might make an appeal to their devotion “you are not going to leave me all alone with those chinese mandarins we must assemble in full force to support the boredom naturally we shan’t be able to talk about any of the things in which we are interested it will be a wednesday spoiled but what is one to do”

    “indeed” brichot explained to me “i fancy that mme verdurin who is highly intelligent and takes infinite pains in the elaboration of her wednesdays was by no means anxious to see these bumpkins of ancient lineage but scanty brains she could not bring herself to invite the dowager marquise but has resigned herself to having the son and daughterinlaw” “ah we are to see the marquise de cambremer” said cottard with a smile into which he saw fit to introduce a leer of sentimentality albeit he had no idea whether mme de cambremer were goodlooking or not but the title marquise suggested to him fantastic thoughts of gallantry “ah i know her” said ski who had met her once when he was out with mme verdurin “not in the biblical sense of the word i trust” said the doctor darting a sly glance through his eyeglass this was one of his favourite pleasantries “she is intelligent” ski informed me “naturally” he went on seeing that i said nothing and dwelling with a smile upon each word “she is intelligent and at the same time she is not she lacks education she is frivolous but she has an instinct for beautiful things she may say nothing but she will never say anything silly and besides her colouring is charming she would be an amusing person to paint” he added half shutting his eyes as though he saw her posing in front of him as my opinion of her was quite the opposite of what ski was expressing with so many fine shades i observed merely that she was the sister of an extremely distinguished engineer m legrandin “there you see you are going to be introduced to a pretty woman” brichot said to me “and one never knows what may come of that cleopatra was not even a great lady she was a little woman the unconscious terrible little woman of our meilhac and just think of the consequences not only to that idiot antony but to the whole of the ancient world” “i have already been introduced to mme de cambremer” i replied “ah in that case you will find yourself on familiar ground” “i shall be all the more delighted to meet her” i answered him “because she has promised me a book by the former curé of combray about the placenames of this district and i shall be able to remind her of her promise i am interested in that priest and also in etymologies” “don’t put any faith in the ones he gives” replied brichot “there is a copy of the book at la raspelière which i have glanced through but without finding anything of any value it is a mass of error let me give you an example the word bricq is found in a number of placenames in this neighbourhood the worthy cleric had the distinctly odd idea that it comes from briga a height a fortified place he finds it already in the celtic tribes latobriges nemetobriges and so forth and traces it down to such names as briand brion and so forth to confine ourselves to the region in which we have the pleasure of your company at this moment bricquebose means the wood on the height bricqueville the habitation on the height bricquebec where we shall be stopping presently before coming to maineville the height by the stream now there is not a word of truth in all this for the simple reason that bricq is the old norse word which means simply a bridge just as fleur which mme de cambremer’s protégé takes infinite pains to connect in one place with the scandinavian words floi flo in another with the irish word ae or aer is beyond any doubt the fjord of the danes and means harbour so too the excellent priest thinks that the station of saintmarslevetu which adjoins la raspelière means saintmartinlevieux vetus it is unquestionable that the word vieux has played a great part in the toponymy of this region vieux comes as a rule from vadum and means a passage as at the place called les vieux it is what the english call ford oxford hereford but in this particular instance vêtu is derived not from vetus but from vastatus a place that is devastated and bare you have round about here sottevast the vast of setold brillevast the vast of berold i am all the more certain of the cure’s mistake in that saintmarslevetu was formerly called saintmars du cast and even saintmarsdeterregate now the v and the g in these words are the same letter we say dévaster but also gâcher jâchères andgatines from the high german wastinna have the same meaning terregate is therefore terra vasta as for saintmars formerly save the mark saintmerd it is saintmedardus which appears variously as saintmédard saintmard saintmarc cinqmars and even dammas nor must we forget that quite close to here places bearing the name of mars are proof simply of a pagan origin the god mars which has remained alive in this country but which the holy man refuses to see the high places dedicated to the gods are especially frequent such as the mount of jupiter jeumont your curé declines to admit this but on the other hand wherever christianity has left traces they escape his notice he has gone so far afield as to loctudy a barbarian name according to him whereas it is simply locus sancti tudeni nor has he in sammarcoles divined sanctus martialis your curé” brichot continued seeing that i was interested “derives the terminations hon home holm from the word holl hullus a hill whereas it cornes from the norse holm an island with which you are familiar in stockholm and which is so widespread throughout this district la houlme engohomme tahoume robehomme néhomme quettehon and so forth” these names made me think of the day when albertine had wished to go to amfrevillelabigot from the name of two successive lords of the manor brichot told me and had then suggested that we should dine together at robehomme as for maineville we were just coming to it “isn’t néhomme” i asked “somewhere near carquethuit and clitourps” “precisely néhomme is the holm the island or peninsula of the famous viscount nigel whose name has survived also in neville the carquethuit and clitourps that you mention furnish mme de cambremer’s protégé with an occasion for further blunders no doubt he has seen that carque is a church the kirche of the germans you will remember querqueville not to mention dunkerque for there we should do better to stop and consider the famous word dun which to the celts meant high ground and that you will find over the whole of france your abbé was hypnotised by duneville which recurs in the eureetloir he would have found châteaudun dunleroi in the cher duneau in the sarthe dun in the ariège dunelesplaces in the nièvre and many others this word dun leads him into a curious error with regard to douville where we shall be alighting and shall find mme verdurin’s comfortable carriages awaiting us douville in latin donvilla says he as a matter of fact douville does lie at the foot of high hills your curé who knows everything feels all the same that he has made a blunder he has indeed found in an old cartulary the name domvilla whereupon he retracts douville according to him is a fief belonging to the abbot domino abbati of mont saintmichel he is delighted with the discovery which is distinctly odd when one thinks of the scandalous life that according to the capitulary of sainteclaire sur epte was led at mont saintmichel though no more extraordinary than to picture the king of denmark as suzerain of all this coast where he encouraged the worship of odin far more than that of christ on the other hand the supposition that the n has been changed to m does not shock me and requires less alteration than the perfectly correct lyon which also is derived from dun lugdunum but the fact is the abbé is mistaken douville was never donville but doville eudonis villa the village of eudes douville was formerly called escalecliff the steps up the cliff about the year 1233 eudes le bouteiller lord of escalecliff set out for the holy land on the eve of his departure he made over the church to the abbey of blanchelande by an exchange of courtesies the village took his name whence we have douville today but i must add that toponymy of which moreover i know little or nothing is not an exact science had we not this historical evidence douville might quite well come from ouville that is to say the waters the forms in ai aiguësmortes from aqua are constantly changed to eu or ou now there were quite close to douville certain famous springs carquethuit you might suppose that the curé was only too ready to detect there a christian origin especially as this district seems to have been pretty hard to convert since successive attempts were made by saint ursal saint gofroi saint barsanore saint laurent of brèvedent who finally handed over the task to the monks of beaubec but as regards thuit the writer is mistaken he sees in it a form of toft a building as in cricquetot ectot yvetot whereas it is the thveit the clearing the reclaimed land as in braquetuit le thuit regnetuit and so forth similarly if he recognises in clitourps the norman thorp which means village he insists that the first syllable of the word must come fromclivus a slope whereas it comes from cliff a precipice but his biggest blunders are due not so much to his ignorance as to his prejudices however loyal a frenchman one is there is no need to fly in the face of the evidence and take saintlaurent en bray to be the roman priest so famous at one time when he is actually saint lawrence ‘toot archbishop of dublin but even more than his patriotic sentiments your friend’s religious bigotry leads him into strange errors thus you have not far from our hosts at la raspelière two places called montmartin montmartinsurmer and montmartinengraignes in the case of craignes the good curé has been quite right he has seen that craignes in latin crania in greekkrene means ponds marshes how many instances of cresmays croen gremeville lengronne might we not adduce but when he comes to montmartin your selfstyled linguist positively insists that these must be parishes dedicated to saint martin he bases his opinion upon the fact that the saint is their patron but does not realise that he was only adopted subsequently or rather he is blinded by his hatred of paganism he refuses to see that we should say montsaintmartin as we say montsaintmichel if it were a question of saint martin whereas the name montmartin refers in a far more pagan fashion to temples consecrated to the god mars temples of which it is true no other vestige remains but which the undisputed existence in the neighbourhood of vast roman camps would render highly probable even without the name montmartin which removes all doubt you see that the little pamphlet which you will find at la raspelière is far from perfect” i protested that at combray the curé had often told us interesting etymologies “he was probably better on his own ground the move to normandy must have made him lose his bearings” “nor did it do him any good” i added “for he came here with neurasthenia and went away again with rheumatism” “ah his neurasthenia is to blame he has lapsed from neurasthenia to philology as my worthy master pocquelin would have said tell us cottard do you suppose that neurasthenia can have a disturbing effect on philology philology a soothing effect on neurasthenia and the relief from neurasthenia lead to rheumatism” “undoubtedly rheumatism and neurasthenia are subordinate forms of neuroarthritism you may pass from one to the other by metastasis” “the eminent professor” said brichot “expresses himself in a french as highly infused with latin and greek as m purgon himself of molièresque memory my uncle i refer to our national sarcey    ” but he was prevented from finishing his sentence the professor had leaped from his seat with a wild shout “the devil” he exclaimed on regaining his power of articulate speech “we have passed maineville d’you hear and renneville too” he had just noticed that the train was stopping at saintmarslevetu where most of the passengers alighted “they can’t have run through without stopping we must have failed to notice it while we were talking about the cambremers listen to me ski pay attention i am going to tell you ‘a good one’” said cottard who had taken a fancy to this expression in common use in certain medical circles “the princess must be on the train she can’t have seen us and will have got into another compartment come along and find her let’s hope this won’t land us in trouble” and he led us all off in search of princess sherbatoff he found her in the corner of an empty compartment reading the revue des deux mondes she had long ago from fear of rebuffs acquired the habit of keeping in her place or remaining in her corner in life as on the train and of not offering her hand until the other person had greeted her she went on reading as the faithful trooped into her carriage i recognised her immediately this woman who might have forfeited her position but was nevertheless of exalted birth who in any event was the pearl of a salon such as the verdurins’ was the lady whom on the same train i had put down two days earlier as possibly the keeper of a brothel her social personality which had been so vague became clear to me as soon as i learned her name just as when after racking our brains over a puzzle we at length hit upon the word which clears up all the obscurity and which in the case of a person is his name to discover two days later who the person is with whom one has travelled in the train is a far more amusing surprise than to read in the next number of a magazine the clue to the problem set in the previous number big restaurants casinos local trains are the family portrait galleries of these social enigmas “princess we must have missed you at maineville may we come and sit in your compartment” “why of course” said the princess who upon hearing cottard address her but only then raised from her magazine a pair of eyes which like the eyes of m de charlus although gentler saw perfectly well the people of whose presence she pretended to be unaware cottard coming to the conclusion that the fact of my having been invited to meet the cambremers was a sufficient recommendation decided after a momentary hesitation to introduce me to the princess who bowed with great courtesy but appeared to be hearing my name for the first time “cré nom” cried the doctor “my wife has forgotten to make them change the buttons on my white waistcoat ah those women they never remember anything don’t you ever marry my boy” he said to me and as this was one of the pleasantries which he considered appropriate when he had nothing else to say he peeped out of the corner of his eye at the princess and the rest of the faithful who because he was a professor and an academician smiled back admiring his good temper and freedom from pride the princess informed us that the young violinist had been found he had been confined to bed the evening before by a sick headache but was coming that evening and bringing with him a friend of his father whom he had met at doncières she had learned this from mme verdurin with whom she had taken luncheon that morning she told us in a rapid voice rolling her rs with her russian accent softly at the back of her throat as though they were not rs but ls “ah you had luncheon with her this morning” cottard said to the princess but turned his eyes to myself the purport of this remark being to shew me on what intimate terms the princess was with the mistress “you are indeed a faithful adherent” “yes i love the little cirlcle so intelligent so agleeable neverl spiteful quite simple not at all snobbish and clevel to theirl fingletips” “nom d’une pipe i must have lost my ticket i can’t find it anywhere” cried cottard with an agitation that was in the circumstances quite unjustified he knew that at douville where a couple of landaus would be awaiting us the collector would let him pass without a ticket and would only bare his head all the more humbly so that the salute might furnish an explanation of his indulgence to wit that he had of course recognised cottard as one of the verdurins’ regular guests “they won’t shove me in the lockup for that” the doctor concluded “you were saying sir” i inquired of brichot “that there used to be some famous waters near here how do we know that” “the name of the next station is one of a multitude of proofs it is called fervaches” “i don’t undlestand what he’s talking about” mumbled the princess as though she were saying to me out of politeness “he’s rather a bore ain’t he” “why princess fervaches means hot springs fervidae aquae but to return to the young violinist” brichot went on “i was quite forgetting cottard to tell you the great news had you heard that our poor friend dechambre who used to be mme verdurin’s favourite pianist has just died it is terribly sad” “he was quite young” replied cottard “but he must have had some trouble with his liver there must have been something sadly wrong in that quarter he had been looking very queer indeed for a long time past” “but he was not so young as all that” said brichot “in the days when elstir and swann used to come to mme verdurin’s dechambre had already made himself a reputation in paris and what is remarkable without having first received the baptism of success abroad ah he was no follower of the gospel according to saint barnum that fellow” “you are mistaken he could not have been going to mme verdurin’s at that time he was still in the nursery” “but unless my old memory plays me false i was under the impression that dechambre used to play vinteuil’s sonata for swann when that clubman who had broken with the aristocracy had still no idea that he was one day to become the embourgeoised prince consort of our national odette” “it is impossible vinteuil’s sonata was played at mme verdurin’s long after swann ceased to come there” said the doctor who like all people who work hard and think that they remember many things which they imagine to be of use to them forget many others a condition which enables them to go into ecstasies over the memories of people who have nothing else to do “you are hopelessly muddled though your brain is as sound as ever” said the doctor with a smile brichot admitted that he was mistaken the train stopped we were at la sogne the name stirred my curiosity “how i should like to know what all these names mean” i said to cottard “you must ask m brichot he may know perhaps” “why la sogne is la cicogne siconia” replied brichot whom i was burning to interrogate about many other names

   forgetting her attachment to her ‘corner’ mme sherbatoff kindly offered to change places with me so that i might talk more easily with brichot whom i wanted to ask about other etymologies that interested me and assured me that she did not mind in the least whether she travelled with her face or her back to the engine standing or seated or anyhow she remained on the defensive until she had discovered a newcomer’s intentions but as soon as she had realised that these were friendly she would do everything in her power to oblige at length the train stopped at the station of douvilleféterne which being more or less equidistant from the villages of féterne and douville bore for this reason their hyphenated name “saperlipopette” exclaimed doctor cottard when we came to the barrier where the tickets were collected and pretending to have only just discovered his loss “i can’t find my ticket i must have lost it” but the collector taking off his cap assured him that it did not matter and smiled respectfully the princess giving instructions to the coachman as though she were a sort of lady in waiting to mme verdurin who because of the cambremers had not been able to come to the station as for that matter she rarely did took me and also brichot with herself in one of the carriages the doctor saniette and ski got into the other

   the driver although quite young was the verdurins’ first coachman the only one who had any right to the title he took them in the daytime on all their excursions for he knew all the roads and in the evening went down to meet the faithful and took them back to the station later on he was accompanied by extra helpers whom he selected if necessary he was an excellent fellow sober and capable but with one of those melancholy faces on which a fixed stare indicates that the merest trifle will make the person fly into a passion not to say nourish dark thoughts but at the moment he was quite happy for he had managed to secure a place for his brother another excellent type of fellow with the verdurins we began by driving through douville grassy knolls ran down from the village to the sea in wide slopes to which their saturation in moisture and salt gave a richness a softness a vivacity of extreme tones the islands and indentations of rivebelle far nearer now than at balbec gave this part of the coast the appearance novel to me of a relief map we passed by some little bungalows almost all of which were let to painters turned into a track upon which some loose cattle as frightened as were our horses barred our way for ten minutes and emerged upon the cliff road “but by the immortal gods” brichot suddenly asked “let us return to that poor dechambre do you suppose mme verdurin knows has anyone toldher” mme verdurin like most people who move in society simply because she needed the society of other people never thought of them again for a single day as soon as being dead they could no longer come to the wednesdays nor to the saturdays nor dine without dressing and one could not say of the little clan a type in this respect of all salons that it was composed of more dead than living members seeing that as soon as one was dead it was as though one had never existed but to escape the nuisance of having to speak of the deceased in other words to postpone one of the dinners — a thing impossible to the mistress — as a token of mourning m verdurin used to pretend that the death of the faithful had such an effect on his wife that in the interest of her health it must never be mentioned to her moreover and perhaps just because the death of other people seemed to him so conclusive so vulgar an accident the thought of his own death filled him with horror and he shunned any consideration that might lead to it as for brichot since he was the soul of honesty and completely taken in by what m verdurin said about his wife he dreaded for his friend’s sake the emotions that such a bereavement must cause her “yes she knew the worst this morning” said the princess “it was impossible to keep it from her” “ah thousand thunders of zeus” cried brichot “ah it must have been a terrible blow a friend of twentyfive years’ standing there was a man who was one of us” “of course of course what can you expect such incidents are bound to be painful but madame verdurin is a brave woman she is even more cerebral than emotive” “i don’t altogether agree with the doctor” said the princess whose rapid speech her murmured accents certainly made her appear both sullen and rebellious “mme verdurin beneath a cold exterior conceals treasures of sensibility m verdurin told me that he had had great difficulty in preventing her from going to paris for the funeral he was obliged to let her think that it was all to be held in the country” “the devil she wanted to go to paris did she of course i know that she has a heart too much heart perhaps poor dechambre as madame verdurin remarked not two months ago ‘compared with him planté paderewski risler himself are nowhere’ ah he could say with better reason than that limelighter nero who has managed to take in even german scholarshipqualis artifex pereo but he at least dechambre must have died in the fulfilment of his priesthood in the odour of beethovenian devotion and gallantly i have no doubt he had every right that interpreter of german music to pass away while celebrating the mass in d but he was when all is said the man to greet the unseen with a cheer for that inspired performer would produce at times from the parisianised champagne stock of which he came the swagger and smartness of a guardsman”

   from the height we had now reached the sea suggested no longer as at balbec the undulations of swelling mountains but on the contrary the view beheld from a mountaintop or from a road winding round its flank of a bluegreen glacier or a glittering plain situated at a lower level the lines of the currents seemed to be fixed upon its surface and to have traced there for ever their concentric circles the enamelled face of the sea which changed imperceptibly in colour assumed towards the head of the bay where an estuary opened the blue whiteness of milk in which little black boats that did not move seemed entangled like flies i felt that from nowhere could one discover a vaster prospect but at each turn in the road a fresh expanse was added to it and when we arrived at the douville tollhouse the spur of the cliff which until then had concealed from us half the bay withdrew and all of a sudden i descried upon my left a gulf as profound as that which i had already had before me but one that changed the proportions of the other and doubled its beauty the air at this lofty point acquired a keenness and purity that intoxicated me i adored the verdurins that they should have sent a carriage for us seemed to me a touching act of kindness i should have liked to kiss the princess i told her that i had never seen anything so beautiful she professed that she too loved this spot more than any other but i could see that to her as to the verdurins the thing that really mattered was not to gaze at the view like tourists but to partake of good meals there to entertain people whom they liked to write letters to read books in short to live in these surroundings passively allowing the beauty of the scene to soak into them rather than making it the object of their attention

   after the tollhouse where the carriage had stopped for a moment at such a height above the sea that as from a mountaintop the sight of the blue gulf beneath almost made one dizzy i opened the window the sound distinctly caught of each wave that broke in turn had something sublime in its softness and precision was it not like an index of measurement which upsetting all our ordinary impressions shews us that vertical distances may be coordinated with horizontal in contradiction of the idea that our mind generally forms of them and that though they bring the sky nearer to us in this way they are not great that they are indeed less great for a sound which traverses them as did the sound of those little waves the medium through which it has to pass being purer and in fact if one went back but a couple of yards below the tollhouse one could no longer distinguish that sound of waves which six hundred feet of cliff had not robbed of its delicate minute and soft precision i said to myself that my grandmother would have listened to it with the delight that she felt in all manifestations of nature or art in the simplicity of which one discerns grandeur i was now at the highest pitch of exaltation which raised everything round about me accordingly it melted my heart that the verdurins should have sent to meet us at the station i said as much to the princess who seemed to think that i was greatly exaggerating so simple an act of courtesy i know that she admitted subsequently to cottard that she found me very enthusiastic he replied that i was too emotional required sedatives and ought to take to knitting i pointed out to the princess every tree every little house smothered in its mantle of roses i made her admire everything i would have liked to take her in my arms and press her to my heart she told me that she could see that i had a gift for painting that of course i must sketch that she was surprised that nobody had told her about it and she confessed that the country was indeed pici turesque we drove through where it perched upon its height the little i village of englesqueville engleberti villa brichot informed us “but are you quite sure that there will be a party this evening in spite of dechambre’s death princess” he went on without stopping to think that the presence at the station of the carriage in which we were sitting was in itself an answer to his question “yes” said the princess “m verldulin insisted that it should not be put off simply to keep his wife from thinking and besides after never failing for all these years to entertain on wednesdays such a change in her habits would have been bound to upset her her nerves are velly bad just now m verdurin was particularly pleased that you were coming to dine this evening because he knew that it would be a great distraction for mme verdurin” said the princess forgetting her pretence of having never heard my name before “i think that it will be as well not to sayanything in front of mme verdurin” the princess added “ah i am glad you warned me” brichot artlessly replied “i shall pass on your suggestion to cottard” the carriage stopped for a moment it moved on again but the sound that the wheels had been making in the village street had ceased we had turned into the main avenue of la raspelière where m verdurin stood waiting for us upon the steps “i did well to put on a dinnerjacket” he said observing with pleasure that the faithful had put on theirs “since i have such smart gentlemen in my party” and as i apologised for not having changed “why that’s quite all right we’re all friends here i should be delighted to offer you one of my own dinnerjackets but it wouldn’t fit you” the handclasp throbbing with emotion which as he entered the hall of la raspelière and by way of condolence at the death of the pianist brichot gave our host elicited no response from the latter i told him how greatly i admired the scenery “ah all the better and you’ve seen nothing we must take you round why not come and spend a week or two here the air is excellent” brichot was afraid that his handclasp had not been understood “ah poor dechambre” he said but in an undertone in case mme verdurin was within earshot “it is terrible” replied m verdurin lightly “so young” brichot pursued the point annoyed at being detained over these futilities m verdurin replied in a hasty tone and with an embittered groan not of grief but of irritated impatience “why yes of course but what’s to be done about it it’s no use crying over spilt milk talking about him won’t bring him back to life will it” and his civility returning with his joviality “come along my good brichot get your things off quickly we have a bouillabaisse which mustn’t be kept waiting but in heaven’s name don’t start talking about dechambre to madame verdurin you know that she always hides her feelings but she is quite morbidly sensitive i give you my word when she heard that dechambre was dead she almost cried” said m verdurin in a tone of profound irony one might have concluded from hearing him speak that it implied a form of insanity to regret the death of a friend of thirty years’ standing and on the other hand one gathered that the perpetual union of m verdurin and his wife did not preclude his constantly criticising her and her frequently irritating him “if you mention it to her she will go and make herself ill again it is deplorable three weeks after her bronchitis when that happens it is i who have to be sicknurse you can understand that i have had more than enough of it grieve for dechambre’s fate in your heart as much as you like think of him but do not speak about him i was very fond of dechambre but you cannot blame me for being fonder still of my wife here’s cottard now you can ask him” and indeed he knew that a family doctor can do many little services such as prescribing that one must not give way to grief

   the docile cottard had said to the mistress “upset yourself like that and tomorrow you will give me a temperature of 102” as he might have said to the cook “tomorrow you will give me a riz de veau” medicine when it fails to cure the sick busies itself with changing the sense of verbs and pronouns

   m verdurin was glad to find that saniette notwithstanding the snubs that he had had to endure two days earlier had not deserted the little nucleus and indeed mme verdurin and her husband had acquired in their idleness cruel instincts for which the great occasions occurring too rarely no longer sufficed they had succeeded in effecting a breach between odette and swann between brichot and his mistress they would try it again with some one else that was understood but the opportunity did not present itself every day whereas thanks to his shuddering sensibility his timorous and quickly aroused shyness saniette provided them with a whippingblock for every day in the year and so for fear of his failing them they took care always to invite him with friendly and persuasive words such as the bigger boys at school the old soldiers in a regiment address to a recruit whom they are anxious to beguile so that they may get him into their clutches with the sole object of flattering him for the moment and bullying him when he can no longer escape “whatever you do” brichot reminded cottard who had not heard what m verdurin was saying “mum’s the word before mme verdurin have no fear o cottard you are dealing with a sage as theocritus says besides m verdurin is right what is the use of lamentations” he went on for being capable of assimilating forms of speech and the ideas which they suggested to him but having no finer perception he had admired in m verdurin’s remarks the most courageous stoicism “all the same it is a great talent that has gone from the world” “what are you still talking about dechambre” said m verdurin who had gone on ahead of us and seeing that we were not following him had turned back “listen” he said to brichot “nothing is gained by exaggeration the fact of his being dead is no excuse for making him out a genius which he was not he played well i admit and what is more he was in his proper element here transplanted he ceased to exist my wife was infatuated with him and made his reputation you know what she is i will go farther in the interest of his own reputation he has died at the right moment he is done to a turn as the demoiselles de caen grilled according to the incomparable recipe of pampilles are going to be i hope unless you keep us standing here all night with your jeremiads in this kasbah exposed to all the winds of heaven you don’t seriously expect us all to die of hunger because dechambre is dead when for the last year he was obliged to practise scales before giving a concert to recover for the moment and for the moment only the suppleness of his wrists besides you are going to hear this evening or at any rate to meet for the rascal is too fond of deserting his art after dinner for the cardtable somebody who is a far greater artist than dechambre a youngster whom my wife has discovered” as she had discovered dechambre and paderewski and everybody else “morel he has not arrived yet the devil he is coming with an old friend of his family whom he has picked up and who bores him to tears but otherwise not to get into trouble with his father he would have been obliged to stay down at doncières and keep him company the baron de charlus” the faithful entered the drawingroom m verdurin who had remained behind with me while i took off my things took my arm by way of a joke as one’s host does at a dinnerparty when there is no lady for one to take in “did you have a pleasant journey” “yes m brichot told me things which interested me greatly” said i thinking of the etymologies and because i had heard that the verdurins greatly admired brichot “i am surprised to hear that he told you anything” said m verdurin “he is such a retiring man and talks so little about the things he knows” this compliment did not strike me as being very apt “he seems charming” i remarked “exquisite delicious not the sort of man you meet every day such a light fantastic touch my wife adores him and so do i” replied m verdurin in an exaggerated tone as though repeating a lesson only then did i grasp that what he had said to me about brichot was ironical and i asked myself whether m verdurin since those faroff days of which i had heard reports had not shaken off the yoke of his wife’s tutelage

   the sculptor was greatly astonished to learn that the verdurins were willing to have m de charlus in their house whereas in the faubourg saintgermain where m de charlus was so well known nobody ever referred to his morals of which most people had no suspicion others remained doubtful crediting him rather with intense but platonic friendships with behaving imprudently while the enlightened few strenuously denied shrugging their shoulders any insinuation upon which some malicious gallardon might venture those morals the nature of which was known perhaps to a few intimate friends were on the other hand being denounced daily far from the circle in which he moved just as at times the sound of artillery fire is audible only beyond a zone of silence moreover in those professional and artistic circles where he was regarded as the typical instance of inversion his great position in society his noble origin were completely unknown by a process analogous to that which among the people of rumania has brought it about that the name of ronsard is known as that of a great nobleman while his poetical work is unknown there not only that the rumanian estimate of ronsard’s nobility is founded upon an error similarly if in the world of painters and actors m de charlus had such an evil reputation that was due to their confusing him with a certain comte leblois de charlus who was not even related to him or if so the connexion was extremely remote and who had been arrested possibly by mistake in the course of a police raid which had become historic in short all the stories related of our m de charlus referred to the other many professionals swore that they had had relations with m de charlus and did so in good faith believing that the false m de charlus was the true one the false one possibly encouraging partly from an affectation of nobility partly to conceal his vice a confusion which to the true one the baron whom we already know was for a long time damaging and afterwards when he had begun to go down the hill became a convenience for it enabled him likewise to say “that is not myself” and in the present instance it was not he to whom the rumours referred finally what enhanced the falsehood of the reports of an actual fact the baron’s tendencies he had had an intimate and perfectly pure friendship with an author who in the theatrical world had for some reason acquired a similar reputation which he in no way deserved when they were seen together at a first night people would say “you see” just as it was supposed that the duchesse de guermantes had immoral relations with the princesse de parme an indestructible legend for it would be disproved only in the presence of those two great ladies themselves to which the people who repeated it would presumably never come any nearer than by staring at them through their glasses in the theatre and slandering them to the occupant of the next stall given m de charlus’s morals the sculptor concluded all the more readily that the baron’s social position must be equally low since he had no sort of information whatever as to the family to which m de charlus belonged his title or his name just as cottard imagined that everybody knew that the degree of doctor of medicine implied nothing the title of consultant to a hospital meant something so people in society are mistaken when they suppose that everybody has the same idea of the social importance of their name as they themselves and the other people of their set

   the prince d’agrigente was regarded as a swindler by a club servant to whom he owed twentyfive louis and regained his importance only in the faubourg saintgermain where he had three sisters who were duchesses for it is not among the humble people in whose eyes he is of small account but among the smart people who know what is what that the great nobleman creates an effect m de charlus for that matter was to learn in the course of the evening that his host had the vaguest ideas about the most illustrious ducal families

   certain that the verdurins were making a grave mistake in allowing an individual of tarnished reputation to be admitted to so ‘select’ a household as theirs the sculptor felt it his duty to take the mistress aside “you are entirely mistaken besides i never pay any attention to those tales and even if it were true i may be allowed to point out that it could hardly compromise me” replied mme verdurin furious for morel being the principal feature of the wednesdays the chief thing for her was not to give any offence to him as for cottard he could not express an opinion for he had asked leave to go upstairs for a moment to ‘do a little job’ in thebuen retiro and after that in m verdurin’s bedroom to write an extremely urgent letter for a patient

   a great publisher from paris who had come to call expecting to be invited to stay to dinner withdrew abruptly quickly realising that he was not smart enough for the little clan he was a tall stout man very dark with a studious and somewhat cutting air he reminded one of an ebony paperknife

   mme verdurin who to welcome us in her immense drawingroom in which displays of grasses poppies fieldflowers plucked only that morning alternated with a similar theme painted on the walls two centuries earlier by an artist of exquisite taste had risen for a moment from a game of cards which she was playing with an old friend begged us to excuse her for just one minute while she finished her game talking to us the while what i told her about my impressions did not however seem altogether to please her for one thing i was shocked to observe that she and her husband came indoors every day long before the hour of those sunsets which were considered so fine when seen from that cliff and finer still from the terrace of la raspelière and which i would have travelled miles to see “yes it’s incomparable” said mme verdurin carelessly with a glance at the huge windows which gave the room a wall of glass “even though we have it always in front of us we never grow tired of it” and she turned her attention back to her cards now my very enthusiasm made me exacting i expressed my regret that i could not see from the drawingroom the rocks of darnetal which elstir had told me were quite lovely at that hour when they reflected so many colours “ah you can’t see them from here you would have to go to the end of the park to the ‘view of the bay’ from the seat there you can take in the whole panorama but you can’t go there by yourself you will lose your way i can take you there if you like” she added kindly “no no you are not satisfied with the illness you had the other day you want to make yourself ill again he will come back he can see the view of the bay another time” i did not insist and understood that it was enough for the verdurins to know that this sunset made its way into their drawingroom or diningroom like a magnificent painting like a priceless japanese enamel justifying the high rent that they were paying for la raspelière with plate and linen but a thing to which they rarely raised their eyes the important thing here for them was to live comfortably to take drives to feed well to talk to entertain agreeable friends whom they provided with amusing games of billiards good meals merry teaparties i noticed however later on how intelligently they had learned to know the district taking their guests for excursions as ‘novel’ as the music to which they made them listen the part which the flowers of la raspelière the roads by the sea’s edge the old houses the undiscovered churches played in the life of m verdurin was so great that those people who saw him only in paris and who themselves substituted for the life by the seaside and in the country the refinements of life in town could barely understand the idea that he himself formed of his own life or the importance that his pleasures gave him in his own eyes this importance was further enhanced by the fact that the verdurins were convinced that la raspelière which they hoped to purchase was a property without its match in the world this superiority which their selfesteem made them attribute to la raspelière justified in their eyes my enthusiasm which but for that would have annoyed them slightly because of the disappointments which it involved like my disappointment when long ago i had first listened to berma and which i frankly admitted to them

    “i hear the carriage coming back” the mistress suddenly murmured let us state briefly that mme verdurin quite apart from the inevitable changes due to increasing years no longer resembled what she had been at the time when swann and odette used to listen to the little phrase in her house even when she heard it played she was no longer obliged to assume the air of attenuated admiration which she used to assume then for that had become her normal expression under the influence of the countless neuralgias which the music of bach wagner vinteuil debussy had given her mme verdurin’s brow had assumed enormous proportions like limbs that are finally crippled by rheumatism her temples suggestive of a pair of beautiful painstricken milkwhite spheres in which harmony rolled endlessly flung back upon either side her silvered tresses and proclaimed on the mistress’s behalf without any need for her to say a word “i know what is in store for me tonight” her features no longer took the trouble to formulate successively aesthetic impressions of undue violence for they had themselves become their permanent expression on a countenance ravaged and superb this attitude of resignation to the ever impending sufferings inflicted by beauty and of the courage that was required to make her dress for dinner when she had barely recovered from the effects of the last sonata had the result that mme verdurin even when listening to the most heartrending music preserved a disdainfully impassive countenance and actually withdrew into retirement to swallow her two spoonfuls of aspirin

    “why yes here they are” m verdurin cried with relief when he saw the door open to admit morel followed by m de charlus the latter to whom dining with the verdurins meant not so much going into society as going into questionable surroundings was as frightened as a schoolboy making his way for the first time into a brothel with the utmost deference towards its mistress moreover the persistent desire that m de charlus felt to appear virile and frigid was overcome when he appeared in the open doorway by those traditional ideas of politeness which are awakened as soon as shyness destroys an artificial attitude and makes an appeal to the resources of the subconscious when it is a charlus whether he be noble or plebeian that is stirred by such a sentiment of instinctive and atavistic politeness to strangers it is always the spirit of a relative of the female sex attendant like a goddess or incarnate as a double that undertakes to introduce him into a strange drawingroom and to mould his attitude until he comes face to face with his hostess thus a young painter brought up by a godly protestant female cousin will enter a room his head aslant and quivering his eyes raised to the ceiling his hands gripping an invisible muff the remembered shape of which and its real and tutelary presence will help the frightened artist to cross without agoraphobia the yawning abyss between the hall and the inner drawingroom thus it was that the pious relative whose memory is helping him today used to enter a room years ago and with so plaintive an air that one was asking oneself what calamity she had come to announce when from her first words one realised as now in the case of the painter that she had come to pay an afterdinner call by virtue of the same law which requires that life in the interests of the still unfulfilled act shall bring into play utilise adulterate in a perpetual prostitution the most respectable it may be the most sacred sometimes only the most innocent legacies from the past and albeit in this instance it engendered a different aspect the one of mme cottard’s nephews who distressed his family by his effeminate ways and the company he kept would always make a joyous entry as though he had a surprise in store for you or were going to inform you that he had been left a fortune radiant with a happiness which it would have been futile to ask him to explain it being due to his unconscious heredity and his misplaced sex he walked upon tiptoe was no doubt himself astonished that he was not holding a cardcase offered you his hand parting his lips as he had seen his aunt part hers and his uneasy glance was directed at the mirror in which he seemed to wish to make certain albeit he was bareheaded whether his hat as mme cottard had once inquired of swann was not askew as for m de charlus whom the society in which he had lived furnished at this critical moment with different examples with other patterns of affability and above all with the maxim that one must in certain cases when dealing with people of humble rank bring into play and make use of one’s rarest graces which one normally holds in reserve it was with a flutter archly and with the same sweep with which a skirt would have enlarged and impeded his waddling motion that he advanced upon mme verdurin with so flattered and honoured an air that one would have said that to be taken to her house was for him a supreme favour one would have thought that it was mme de marsantes who was entering the room so prominent at that moment was the woman whom a mistake on the part of nature had enshrined in the body of m de charlus it was true that the baron had made every effort to obliterate this mistake and to assume a masculine appearance but no sooner had he succeeded than he having in the meantime kept the same tastes this habit of looking at things through a woman’s eyes gave him a fresh feminine appearance due this time not to heredity but to his own way of living and as he had gradually come to regard even social questions from the feminine point of view and without noticing it for it is not only by dint of lying to other people but also by lying to oneself that one ceases to be aware that one is lying albeit he had called upon his body to manifest at the moment of his entering the verdurins’ drawingroom all the courtesy of a great nobleman that body which had fully understood what m de charlus had ceased to apprehend displayed to such an extent that the baron would have deserved the epithet ‘ladylike’ all the attractions of a great lady not that there need be any connexion between the appearance of m de charlus and the fact that sons who do not always take after their fathers even without being inverts and though they go after women may consummate upon their faces the profanation of their mothers but we need not consider here a subject that deserves a chapter to itself the profanation of the mother

   albeit other reasons dictated this transformation of m de charlus and purely physical ferments set his material substance ‘working’ and made his body pass gradually into the category of women’s bodies nevertheless the change that we record here was of spiritual origin by dint of supposing yourself to be ill you become ill grow thin are too weak to rise from your bed suffer from nervous enteritis by dint of thinking tenderly of men you become a woman and an imaginary spirit hampers your movements the obsession just as in the other instance it affects your health may in this instance alter your sex morel who accompanied him came to shake hands with me from that first moment owing to a twofold change that occurred in him i formed alas i was not warned in time to act upon it a bad impression of him i have said that morel having risen above his father’s menial status was generally pleased to indulge in a contemptuous familiarity he had talked to me on the day when he brought me the photographs without once addressing me as monsieur treating me as an inferior what was my surprise at mme verdurin’s to see him bow very low before me and before me alone and to hear before he had even uttered a syllable to anyone else words of respect most respectful — such words as i thought could not possibly flow from his pen or fall from his lips — addressed to myself i at once suspected that he had some favour to ask of me taking me aside a minute later “monsieur would be doing me a very great service” he said to me going so far this time as to address me in the third person “by keeping from mme verdurin and her guests the nature of the profession that my father practised with his uncle it would be best to say that he was in your family the agent for estates so considerable as to put him almost on a level with your parents” morel’s request annoyed me intensely because it obliged me to magnify not his father’s position in which i took not the slightest interest but the wealth — the apparent wealth of my own which i felt to be absurd but he appeared so unhappy so pressing that i could not refuse him “no before dinner” he said in an imploring tone “monsieur can easily find some excuse for taking mme verdurin aside” this was what in the end i did trying to enhance to the best of my ability the distinction of morel’s father without unduly exaggerating the ‘style’ the ‘worldly goods’ of my own family it went like a letter through the post notwithstanding the astonishment of mme verdurin who had had a nodding acquaintance with my grandfather and as she had no tact hated family life that dissolvent of the little nucleus after telling me that she remembered long ago seeing my greatgrandfather and after speaking of him as of somebody who was almost an idiot who would have been incapable of understanding the little group and who to use her expression “was not one of us” she said to me “families are such a bore the only thing is to get right away from them” and at once proceeded to tell me of a trait in my greatgrandfather’s character of which i was unaware although i might have suspected it at home i had never seen him but they frequently spoke of him his remarkable stinginess in contrast to the somewhat excessive generosity of my greatuncle the friend of the lady in pink and morel’s father’s employer “why of course if your grandparents had such a grand agent that only shews that there are all sorts of people in a family your grandfather’s father was so stingy that at the end of his life when he was almost halfwitted — between you and me he was never anything very special you are worth the whole lot of them — he could not bring himself to pay a penny for his ride on the omnibus so that they were obliged to have him followed by somebody who paid his fare for him and to let the old miser think that his friend m de persigny the cabinet minister had given him a permit to travel free on the omnibuses but i am delighted to hear that our morel’s father held such a good position i was under the impression that he had been a schoolmaster but that’s nothing i must have misunderstood in any case it makes not the slightest difference for i must tell you that here we appreciate only true worth the personal contribution what i call the participation provided that a person is artistic provided in a word that he is one of the brotherhood nothing else matters” the way in which morel was one of the brotherhood was — so far as i have been able to discover — that he was sufficiently fond of both women and men to satisfy either sex with the fruits of his experience of the other but what it is essential to note here is that as soon as i had given him my word that i would speak on his behalf to mme verdurin as soon moreover as i had actually done so and without any possibility of subsequent retractation morel’s ‘respect’ for myself vanished as though by magic the formal language of respect melted away and indeed for some time he avoided me contriving to appear contemptuous of me so that if mme verdurin wanted me to give him a message to ask him to play something he would continue to talk to one of the faithful then move on to another changing his seat if i approached him the others were obliged to tell him three or four times that i had spoken to him after which he would reply with an air of constraint briefly that is to say unless we were by ourselves when that happened he was expansive friendly for there was a charming side to him i concluded all the same from this first evening that his must be a vile nature that he would not at a pinch shrink from any act of meanness was incapable of gratitude in which he resembled the majority of mankind but inasmuch as i had inherited a strain of my grandmother’s nature and enjoyed the diversity of other people without expecting anything of them or resenting anything that they did i overlooked his baseness rejoiced in his gaiety when it was in evidence and indeed in what i believe to have been a genuine affection on his part when having gone the whole circuit of his false ideas of human nature he realised with a jerk for he shewed strange reversions to a blind and primitive savagery that my kindness to him was disinterested that my indulgence arose not from a want of perception but from what he called goodness and more important still i was enraptured by his art which indeed was little more than an admirable virtuosity but which made me without his being in the intellectual sense of the word a real musician hear again or for the first time so much good music moreover a manager — m de charlus whom i had not suspected of such talents albeit mme de guermantes who had known him a very different person in their younger days asserted that he had composed a sonata for her painted a fan and so forth modest in regard to his true merits but possessing talents of the first order contrived to place this virtuosity at the service of a versatile artistic sense which increased it tenfold imagine a merely skilful performer in the russian ballet formed educated developed in all directions by m diaghileff

   i had just given mme verdurin the message with which morel had charged me and was talking to m de charlus about saintloup when cottard burst into the room announcing as though the house were on fire that the cambremers had arrived mme verdurin not wishing to appear before strangers such as m de charlus whom cottard had not seen and myself to attach any great importance to the arrival of the cambremers did not move made no response to the announcement of these tidings and merely said to the doctor fanning herself gracefully and adopting the tone of a marquise in the théâtre français “the baron has just been telling us    ” this was too much for cottard less abruptly than he would have done in the old days for learning and high positions had added weight to his utterance but with the emotion nevertheless which he recaptured at the verdurins’ he exclaimed “a baron what baron where’s the baron” staring around the room with an astonishment that bordered on incredulity mme verdurin with the affected indifference of a hostess when a servant has in front of her guests broken a valuable glass and with the artificial highfalutin tone of a conservatoire prizewinner acting in a play by the younger dumas replied pointing with her fan to morel’s patron “why the baron de charlus to whom let me introduce you m le professeur cottard” mme verdurin was for that matter by no means sorry to have an opportunity of playing the leading lady m de charlus proffered two fingers which the professor clasped with the kindly smile of a ‘prince of science’ but he stopped short upon seeing the cambremers enter the room while m de charlus led me into a corner to tell me something not without feeling my muscles which is a german habit m de cambremer bore no resemblance to the old marquise to anyone who had only heard of him or of letters written by him well and forcibly expressed his personal appearance was startling no doubt one would grow accustomed to it but his nose had chosen to place itself aslant above his mouth perhaps the only crooked line among so many which one would never have thought of tracing upon his face and one that indicated a vulgar stupidity aggravated still further by the proximity of a norman complexion on cheeks that were like two ripe apples it is possible that the eyes of m de cambremer retained behind their eyelids a trace of the sky of the cotentin so soft upon sunny days when the wayfarer amuses himself in watching drawn up by the roadside and counting in their hundreds the shadows of the poplars but those eyelids heavy bleared and drooping would have prevented the least flash of intelligence from escaping and so discouraged by the meagreness of that azure glance one returned to the big crooked nose by a transposition of the senses m de cambremer looked at you with his nose this nose of his was not ugly it was if anything too handsome too bold too proud of its own importance arched polished gleaming brand new it was amply prepared to atone for the inadequacy of his eyes unfortunately if the eyes are sometimes the organ through which our intelligence is revealed the nose to leave out of account the intimate solidarity and the unsuspected repercussion of one feature upon the rest the nose is generally the organ in which stupidity is most readily displayed

   the propriety of the dark clothes which m de cambremer invariably wore even in the morning might well reassure those who were dazzled and exasperated by the insolent brightness of the seaside attire of people whom they did not know still it was impossible to understand why the chief magistrate’s wife should have declared with an air of discernment and authority as a person who knows far more than you about the high society of alençon that on seeing m de cambremer one immediately felt oneself even before one knew who he was in the presence of a man of supreme distinction of a man of perfect breeding a change from the sort of person one saw at balbec a man in short in whose company one could breathe freely he was to her stifled by all those balbec tourists who did not know her world like a bottle of smelling salts it seemed to me on the contrary that he was one of the people whom my grandmother would at once have set down as ‘all wrong’ and that as she had no conception of snobbishness she would no doubt have been stupefied that he could have succeeded in winning the hand of mlle legrandin who must surely be difficult to please having a brother who was ‘so refined’ at best one might have said of m de cambremer’s plebeian ugliness that it was redolent of the soil and preserved a very ancient local tradition one was reminded on examining his faulty features which one would have liked to correct of those names of little norman towns as to the etymology of which my friend the curé was mistaken because the peasants mispronouncing the names or having misunderstood the latin or norman words that underlay them have finally fixed in a barbarism to be found already in the cartularies as brichot would have said a wrong meaning and a fault of pronunciation life in these old towns may for all that be pleasant enough and m de cambremer must have had his good points for if it was in a mother’s nature that the old marquise should prefer her son to her daughterinlaw on the other hand she who had other children of whom two at least were not devoid of merit was often heard to declare that the marquis was in her opinion the best of the family during the short time he had spent in the army his messmates finding cambremer too long a name to pronounce had given him the nickname cancan implying a flow of chatter which he in no way merited he knew how to brighten a dinnerparty to which he was invited by saying when the fish even if it were stale or the entrée came in “i say that looks a fine animal” and his wife who had adopted upon entering the family everything that she supposed to form part of their customs put herself on the level of her husband’s friends and perhaps sought to please him like a mistress and as though she had been involved in his bachelor existence by saying in a careless tone when she was speaking of him to officers “you shall see cancan presently cancan has gone to balbec but he will be back this evening” she was furious at having compromised herself by coming to the verdurins’ and had done so only upon the entreaties of her motherinlaw and husband in the hope of renewing the lease but being less wellbred than they she made no secret of the ulterior motive and for the last fortnight had been making fun of this dinnerparty to her women friends “you know we are going to dine with our tenants that will be well worth an increased rent as a matter of fact i am rather curious to see what they have done to our poor old la raspelière” as though she had been born in the house and would find there all her old family associations “our old keeper told me only yesterday that you wouldn’t know the place i can’t bear to think of all that must be going on there i am sure we shall have to have the whole place disinfected before we move in again” she arrived haughty and morose with the air of a great lady whose castle owing to a state of war is occupied by the enemy but who nevertheless feels herself at home and makes a point of shewing the conquerors that they are intruding mme de cambremer could not see me at first for i was in a bay at the side of the room with m de charlus who was telling me that he had heard from morel that morel’s father had been an ‘agent’ in my family and that he charlus credited me with sufficient intelligence and magnanimity a term common to himself and swann to forego the mean and ignoble pleasure which vulgar little idiots i was warned would not have failed in my place to give themselves by revealing to our hosts details which they might regard as derogatory “the mere fact that i take an interest in him and extend my protection over him gives him a preeminence and wipes out the past” the baron concluded as i listened to him and promised the silence which i would have kept even without any hope of being considered in return intelligent and magnanimous i was looking at mme de cambremer and i had difficulty in recognising the melting savoury morsel which i had had beside me the other afternoon at teatime on the terrace at balbec in the norman rockcake that i now saw hard as a rock in which the faithful would in vain have tried to set their teeth irritated in anticipation by the knowledge that her husband inherited his mother’s simple kindliness which would make him assume a flattered expression whenever one of the faithful was presented to him anxious however to perform her duty as a leader of society when brichot had been named to her she decided to make him and her husband acquainted as she had seen her more fashionable friends do but anger or pride prevailing over the desire to shew her knowledge of the world she said not as she ought to have said “allow me to introduce my husband” but “i introduce you to my husband” holding aloft thus the banner of the cambremers without avail for her husband bowed as low before brichot as she had expected but all mme de cambremer’s ill humour vanished in an instant when her eye fell on m de charlus whom she knew by sight never had she succeeded in obtaining an introduction even at the time of her intimacy with swann for as m de charlus always sided with the woman with his sisterinlaw against m de guermantes’s mistresses with odette at that time still unmarried but an old flame of swann’s against the new he had as a stern defender of morals and faithful protector of homes given odette — and kept — the promise that he would never allow himself to be presented to mme de cambremer she had certainly never guessed that it was at the verdurins’ that she was at length to meet this unapproachable person m de cambremer knew that this was a great joy to her so great that he himself was moved by it and looked at his wife with an air that implied “you are glad now you decided to come aren’t you” he spoke very little knowing that he had married a superior woman “i all unworthy” he would say at every moment and spontaneously quoted a fable of la fontaine and one of florian which seemed to him to apply to his ignorance and at the same time enable him beneath the outward form of a contemptuous flattery to shew the men of science who were not members of the jockey that one might be a sportsman and yet have read fables the unfortunate thing was that he knew only two of them and so they kept cropping up mme de cambremer was no fool but she had a number of extremely irritating habits with her the corruption of names bore absolutely no trace of aristocratic disdain she was not the person to say like the duchesse de guermantes whom the mere fact of her birth ought to have preserved even more than mme de cambremer from such an absurdity with a pretence of not remembering the unfashionable name albeit it is now that of one of the women whom it is most difficult to approach of julien de monchâteau “a little madame    pica della mirandola” no when mme de cambremer said a name wrong it was out of kindness of heart so as not to appear to know some damaging fact and when in her sincerity she admitted it she tried to conceal it by altering it if for instance she was defending a woman she would try to conceal the fact while determined not to lie to the person who had asked her to tell the truth that madame soandso was at the moment the mistress of m sylvain levy and would say “no    i know absolutely nothing about her i fancy that people used to charge her with having inspired a passion in a gentleman whose name i don’t know something like cahn kohn kuhn anyhow i believe the gentleman has been dead for years and that there was never anything between them” this is an analogous but contrary process to that adopted by liars who think that if they alter their statement of what they have been doing when they make it to a mistress or merely to another man their listener will not immediately see that the expression like her cahn kohn kuhn is interpolated is of a different texture from the rest of the conversation has a double meaning

   mme verdurin whispered in her husband’s ear “shall i offer my arm to the baron de charlus as you will have mme de cambremer on your right we might divide the honours” “no” said m verdurin “since the other is higher in rank” meaning that m de cambremer was a marquis “m de charlus is strictly speaking his inferior” “very well i shall put him beside the princess” and mme verdurin introduced mme sherbatoff to m de charlus each of them bowed in silence with an air of knowing all about the other and of promising a mutual secrecy m verdurin introduced me to m de cambremer before he had even begun to speak in his loud and slightly stammering voice his tall figure and high complexion displayed in their oscillation the martial hesitation of a commanding officer who tries to put you at your ease and says “i have heard about you i shall see what can be done your punishment shall be remitted we don’t thirst for blood here it will be all right” then as he shook my hand “i think you know my mother” he said to me the word ‘think’ seemed to him appropriate to the discretion of a first meeting but not to imply any uncertainty for he went on “i have a note for you from her” m de cambremer took a childish pleasure in revisiting a place where he had lived for so long “i am at home again” he said to mme verdurin while his eyes marvelled at recognising the flowers painted on panels over the doors and the marble busts on their high pedestals he might all the same have felt himself at sea for mme verdurin had brought with her a quantity of fine old things of her own in this respect mme verdurin while regarded by the cambremers as having turned everything upside down was not revolutionary but intelligently conservative in a sense which they did not understand they were thus wrong in accusing her of hating the old house and of degrading it by hanging plain cloth curtains instead of their rich plush like an ignorant parish priest reproaching a diocesan architect with putting back in its place the old carved wood which the cleric had thrown on the rubbish heap and had seen fit to replace with ornaments purchased in the place saintsulpice furthermore a herb garden was beginning to take the place in front of the mansion of the borders that were the pride not merely of the cambremers but of their gardener the latter who regarded the cambremers as his sole masters and groaned beneath the yoke of the verdurins as though the place were under occupation for the moment by an invading army went in secret to unburden his griefs to its dispossessed mistress grew irate at the scorn that was heaped upon his araucarias begonias houseleeks double dahlias and at anyone’s daring in so grand a place to grow such common plants as camomile and maidenhair mme verdurin felt this silent opposition and had made up her mind if she took a long lease of la raspelière or even bought the place to make one of her conditions the dismissal of the gardener by whom his old mistress on the contrary set great store he had worked for her without payment when times were bad he adored her but by that odd multiformity of opinion which we find in the lower orders among whom the most profound moral scorn is embedded in the most passionate admiration which in turn overlaps old and undying grudges he used often to say of mme de cambremer who in ‘70 in a house that she owned in the east of france surprised by the invasion had been obliged to endure for a month the contact of the germans “what many people can’t forgive mme la marquise is that during the war she took the side of the prussians and even had them to stay in her house at any other time i could understand it but in war time she ought not to have done it it is not right” so that he was faithful to her unto death venerated her for her goodness and firmly believed that she had been guilty of treason mme verdurin was annoyed that m de cambremer should pretend to feel so much at home at la raspelière “you must notice a good many changes all the same” she replied “for one thing there were those big bronze barbedienne devils and some horrid little plush chairs which i packed off at once to the attic though even that is too good a place for them” after this bitter retort to m de cambremer she offered him her arm to go in to dinner he hesitated for a moment saying to himself “i can’t really go in before m de charlus” but supposing the other to be an old friend of the house seeing that he was not set in the post of honour he decided to take the arm that was offered him and told mme verdurin how proud he felt to be admitted into the symposium so it was that he styled the little nucleus not without a smile of satisfaction at his knowledge of the term cottard who was seated next to m de charlus beamed at him through his glass to make his acquaintance and to break the ice with a series of winks far more insistent than they would have been in the old days and not interrupted by fits of shyness and these engaging glances enhanced by the smile that accompanied them were no longer dammed by the glass but overflowed on all sides the baron who readily imagined people of his own kind everywhere had no doubt that cottard was one and was making eyes at him at once he turned on the professor the cold shoulder of the invert as contemptuous of those whom he attracts as he is ardent in pursuit of such as attract him no doubt albeit each one of us speaks mendaciously of the pleasure always refused him by destiny of being loved it is a general law the application of which is by no means confined to the charlus type that the person whom we do not love and who does love us seems to us quite intolerable to such a person to a woman of whom we say not that she loves us but that she bores us we prefer the society of any other who has neither her charm nor her looks nor her brains she will recover these in our estimation only when she has ceased to love us in this light we might see only the transposition into odd terms of this universal rule in the irritation aroused in an invert by a man who displeases him and runs after him and so whereas the ordinary man seeks to conceal what he feels the invert is implacable in making it felt by the man who provokes it as he would certainly not make it felt by a woman m de charlus for instance by the princesse de guermantes whose passion for him bored him but flattered him but when they see another man shew a peculiar liking for them then whether because they fail to realise that this liking is the same as their own or because it annoys them to be reminded that this liking which they glorify so long as it is they themselves that feel it is regarded as a vice or from a desire to rehabilitate themselves by a sensational display in circumstances in which it costs them nothing or from a fear of being unmasked which they at once recover as soon as desire no longer leads them blindfold from one imprudence to another or from rage at being subjected by the equivocal attitude of another person to the injury which by their own attitude if that other person attracted them they would not be afraid to inflict on him the men who do not in the least mind following a young man for miles never taking their eyes off him in the theatre even if he is with friends and there is therefore a danger of their compromising him with them may be heard if a man who does not attract them merely looks at them to say “sir for what do you take me” simply because he takes them for what they are “i don’t understand no don’t attempt to explain you are quite mistaken” pass if need be from words to blows and to a person who knows the imprudent stranger wax indignant “what you know that loathsome creature he stares at one so    a fine way to behave” m de charlus did not go quite as far as this but assumed the offended glacial air adopted when one appears to be suspecting them by women who are not of easy virtue even more by women who are furthermore the invert brought face to face with an invert sees not merely an unpleasing image of himself which being purely inanimate could at the worst only injure his selfesteem but a second self living acting in the same sphere capable therefore of injuring him in his loves and so it is from an instinct of selfpreservation that he will speak evil of the possible rival whether to people who are able to do him some injury nor does invert the first mind being thought a liar when he thus denounces invert the second before people who may know all about his own case or to the young man whom he has ‘picked up’ who is perhaps going to be snatched away from him and whom it is important to persuade that the very things which it is to his advantage to do with the speaker would be the bane of his life if he allowed himself to do them with the other person to m de charlus who was thinking perhaps of the — wholly imaginary — dangers in which the presence of this cottard whose smile he misinterpreted might involve morel an invert who did not attract him was not merely a caricature of himself but was a deliberate rival a tradesman practising an uncommon trade who on his arrival in the provincial town where he intends to settle for life discovers that in the same square directly opposite the same trade is being carried on by a competitor is no more discomfited than a charlus who goes down to a quiet spot to make love unobserved and on the day of his arrival catches sight of the local squire or the barber whose aspect and manner leave no room for doubt the tradesman often comes to regard his competitor with hatred this hatred degenerates at times into melancholy and if there be but a sufficient strain of heredity one has seen in small towns the tradesman begin to shew signs of insanity which is cured only by his deciding to sell his stock and goodwill and remove to another place the invert’s rage is even more agonising he has realised that from the first moment the squire and the barber have desired his young companion even though he repeat to him a hundred times daily that the barber and the squire are scoundrels whose contact would dishonour him he is obliged like harpagon to watch over his treasure and rises in the night to make sure that it is not being stolen and it is this no doubt that even more than desire or the convenience of habits shared in common and almost as much as that experience of oneself which is the only true experience makes one invert detect another with a rapidity and certainty that are almost infallible he may be mistaken for a moment but a rapid divination brings him back to the truth and so m de charlus’s error was brief his divine discernment shewed him after the first minute that cottard was not of his kind and that he need not fear his advances either for himself which would merely have annoyed him or for morel which would have seemed to him a more serious matter he recovered his calm and as he was still beneath the influence of the transit of venus androgyne now and again he smiled a faint smile at the verdurins without taking the trouble to open his mouth merely curving his lips at one corner and for an instant kindled a coquettish light in his eyes he so obsessed with virility exactly as his sisterinlaw the duchesse de guermantes might have done “do you shoot much sir” said m verdurin with a note of contempt to m de cambremer “has ski told you of the near shave we had today” cottard inquired of the mistress “i shoot mostly in the forest of chantepie” replied m de cambremer “no i have told her nothing” said ski “does it deserve its name” brichot asked m de cambremer after a glance at me from the corner of his eye for he had promised me that he would introduce the topic of derivations begging me at the same time not to let the cambremers know the scorn that he felt for those furnished by the combray curé “i am afraid i must be very stupid but i don’t grasp your question” said m de cambremer “i mean to say do many pies sing in it” replied brichot cottard meanwhile could not bear mme verdurin’s not knowing that they had nearly missed the train “out with it” mme cottard said to her husband encouragingly “tell us your odyssey” “well really it is quite out of the ordinary” said the doctor and repeated his narrative from the beginning “when i saw that the train was in the station i stood thunderstruck it was all ski’s fault you are somewhat wide of the mark in your information my dear fellow and there was brichot waiting for us at the station” “i assumed” said the scholar casting around him what he could still muster of a glance and smiling with his thin lips “that if you had been detained at graincourt it would mean that you had encountered some peripatetic siren” “will you hold your tongue if my wife were to hear you” said the professor “this wife of mine it is jealous” “ah that brichot” cried ski moved to traditional merriment by brichot’s spicy witticism “he is always the same” albeit he had no reason to suppose that the university don had ever indulged in obscenity and to embellish this consecrated utterance with the ritual gesture he made as though he could not resist the desire to pinch brichot’s leg “he never changes the rascal” ski went on and without stopping to think of the effect at once tragic and comic that the don’s semiblindness gave to his words “always a sharp lookout for the ladies” “you see” said m de cambremer “what it is to meet with a scholar here have i been shooting for fifteen years in the forest of chantepie and i’ve never even thought of what the name meant” mme de cambremer cast a stern glance at her husband she did not like him to humble himself thus before brichot she was even more annoyed when at every ‘readymade’ expression that cancan employed cottard who knew the ins and outs of them all having himself laboriously acquired them pointed out to the marquis who admitted his stupidity that they meant nothing “why ‘stupid as a cabbage’ do you suppose cabbages are stupider than anything else you say‘repeat the same thing thirtysix times’ why thirtysix why do you say‘sleep like a top’ why ‘thunder of brest’ why ‘play four hundred tricks’” but at this the defence of m de cambremer was taken up by brichot who explained the origin of each of these expressions but mme de cambremer was occupied principally in examining the changes that the verdurins had introduced at la raspelière in order that she might be able to criticise some and import others or possibly the same ones to féterne “i keep wondering what that lustre is that’s hanging all crooked i can hardly recognise my old raspelière” she went on with a familiarly aristocratic air as she might have spoken of an old servant meaning not so much to indicate his age as to say that she had seen him in his cradle and as she was a trifle bookish in her speech “all the same” she added in an undertone “i can’t help feeling that if i were inhabiting another person’s house i should feel some compunction about altering everything like this” “it is a pity you didn’t come with them” said mme verdurin to m de charlus and morel hoping that m de charlus was now ‘enrolled’ and would submit to the rule that they must all arrive by the same train “you are sure that chantepie means the singing magpie chochotte” she went on to shew that like the great hostess that she was she could join in every conversation at the same time “tell me something about this violinist” mme de cambremer said to me “he interests me i adore music and it seems to me that i have heard of him before complete my education” she had heard that morel had come with m de charlus and hoped by getting the former to come to her house to make friends with the latter she added however so that i might not guess her reason for asking “m brichot too interests me” for even if she was highly cultivated just as certain persons inclined to obesity eat hardly anything and take exercise all day long without ceasing to grow visibly fatter so mme de cambremer might in vain master and especially at féterne a philosophy that became ever more esoteric music that became ever more subtle she emerged from these studies only to weave plots that would enable her to cut the middleclass friends of her girlhood and to form the connexions which she had originally supposed to be part of the social life of her ‘in laws’ and had then discovered to be far more exalted and remote a philosopher who was not modern enough for her leibnitz has said that the way is long from the intellect to the heart this way mme de cambremer had been no more capable than her brother of traversing abandoning the study of john stuart mill only for that of lachelier the less she believed in the reality of the external world the more desperately she sought to establish herself before she died in a good position in it in her passion for realism in art no object seemed to her humble enough to serve as a model to painter or writer a fashionable picture or novel would have made her feel sick tolstoi’s mujiks or millet’s peasants were the extreme social boundary beyond which she did not allow the artist to pass but to cross the boundary that limited her own social relations to raise herself to an intimate acquaintance with duchesses this was the goal of all her efforts so ineffective had the spiritual treatment to which she subjected herself by the study of great masterpieces proved in overcoming the congenital and morbid snobbishness that had developed in her this snobbishness had even succeeded in curing certain tendencies to avarice and adultery to which in her younger days she had been inclined just as certain peculiar and permanent pathological conditions seem to render those who are subject to them immune to other maladies i could not all the same refrain as i listened to her from giving her credit without deriving any pleasure from them for the refinement of her expressions they were those that are used at a given date by all the people of the same intellectual breadth so that the refined expression provides us at once like the arc of a circle with the means to describe and limit the entire circumference and so the effect of these expressions is that the people who employ them bore me immediately because i feel that i already know them but are generally regarded as superior persons and have often been offered me as delightful and unappreciated companions “you cannot fail to be aware madame that many forest regions take their name from the animals that inhabit them next to the forest of chantepie you have the wood chantereine” “i don’t know who the queen may be but you are not very polite to her” said m de cambremer “one for you chochotte” said mme de verdurin “and apart from that did you have a pleasant journey” “we encountered only vague human beings who thronged the train but i must answer m de cambremer’s question reine in this instance is not the wife of a king but a frog it is the name that the frog has long retained in this district as is shewn by the station renneville which ought to be spelt reineville” “i say that seems a fine animal” said m de cambremer to mme verdurin pointing to a fish it was one of the compliments by means of which he considered that he paid his scot at a dinnerparty and gave an immediate return of hospitality “there is no need to invite them” he would often say in speaking of one or other couple of their friends to his wife “they were delighted to have us it was they that thanked me for coming” “i must tell you all the same that i have been going every day for years to renneville and i have never seen any more frogs there than anywhere else madame de cambremer brought the curé here from a parish where she owns a considerable property who has very much the same turn of mind as yourself it seems to me he has written a book” “i know i have read it with immense interest” brichot replied hypocritically the satisfaction that his pride received indirectly from this answer made m de cambremer laugh long and loud “ah well the author of what shall i say this geography this glossary dwells at great length upon the name of a little place of which we were formerly if i may say so the lords and which is called pontacouleuvre of course i am only an ignorant rustic compared with such a fountain of learning but i have been to pontàcouleuvre a thousand times if he’s been there once and devil take me if i ever saw one of his beastly serpents there i say beastly in spite of the tribute the worthy la fontaine pays them” the man and the serpent was one of his two fables “you have not seen any and you have been quite right” replied brichot “undoubtedly the writer you mention knows his subject through and through he has written a remarkable book” “there” exclaimed mme de cambremer “that book there’s no other word for it is a regular benedictine opus” “no doubt he has consulted various polyptychs by which we mean the lists of benefices and cures of each diocese which may have furnished him with the names of lay patrons and ecclesiastical collators but there are other sources one of the most learned of my friends has delved into them he found that the place in question was named pontaquileuvre this odd name encouraged him to carry his researches farther to a latin text in which the bridge that your friend supposes to be infested with serpents is styled pons cui aperit a closed bridge that was opened only upon due payment” “you were speaking of frogs i when i find myself among such learned folk feel like the frog before the areopagus” this being his other fable said cancan who often indulged with a hearty laugh in this pleasantry thanks to which he imagined himself to be making at one and the same time out of humility and with aptness a profession of ignorance and a display of learning as for cottard blocked upon one side by m de charlus’s silence and driven to seek an outlet elsewhere he turned to me with one of those questions which so impressed his patients when it hit the mark and shewed them that he could put himself so to speak inside their bodies if on the other hand it missed the mark it enabled him to check certain theories to widen his previous point of view “when you come to a relatively high altitude such as this where we now are do you find that the change increases your tendency to choking fits” he asked me with the certainty of either arousing admiration or enlarging his own knowledge m de cambremer heard the question and smiled “i can’t tell you how amused i am to hear that you have choking fits” he flung at me across the table he did not mean that it made him happy though as a matter of fact it did for this worthy man could not hear any reference to another person’s sufferings without a feeling of satisfaction and a spasm of hilarity which speedily gave place to the instinctive pity of a kind heart but his words had another meaning which was indicated more precisely by the clause that followed “it amuses me” he explained “because my sister has them too” and indeed it did amuse him as it would have amused him to hear me mention as one of my friends a person who was constantly coming to their house “how small the world is” was the reflexion which he formed mentally and which i saw written upon his smiling face when cottard spoke to me of my choking fits and these began to establish themselves from the evening of this dinnerparty as a sort of interest in common after which m de cambremer never failed to inquire if only to hand on a report to his sister as i answered the questions with which his wife kept plying me about morel my thoughts returned to a conversation i had had with my mother that afternoon having without any attempt to dissuade me from going to the verdurins’ if there was a chance of my being amused there suggested that it was a house of which my grandfather would not have approved which would have made him exclaim “on guard” my mother had gone on to say “listen judge toureuil and his wife told me they had been to luncheon with mme bontemps they asked me no questions but i seemed to gather from what was said that your marriage to albertine would be the joy of her aunt’s life i think the real reason is that they are all extremely fond of you at the same time the style in which they suppose that you would be able to keep her the sort of friends they more or less know that we have all that is not i fancy left out of account although it may be a minor consideration i should not have mentioned it to you myself because i attach no importance to it but as i imagine that people will mention it to you i prefer to get a word in first” “but you yourself what do you think of her” i asked my mother “well it’s not i that am going to marry her you might certainly do a thousand times better but i feel that your grandmother would not have liked me to influence you as a matter of fact i cannot tell you what i think of albertine i don’t think of her i shall say to you like madame de sévigné ‘she has good qualities at least i suppose so but at this first stage i can praise her only by negatives one thing she is not she has not the rennes accent in time i shall perhaps say she is something else and i shall always think well of her if she can make you happy’” but by these very words which left it to myself to decide my own happiness my mother had plunged me in that state of doubt in which i had been plunged long ago when my father having allowed me to go to phèdre and what was more to take to writing i had suddenly felt myself burdened with too great a responsibility the fear of distressing him and that melancholy which we feel when we cease to obey orders which from one day to another keep the future hidden and realise that we have at last begun to live in real earnest as a grownup person the life the only life that any of us has at his disposal

   perhaps the best thing would be to wait a little longer to begin by regarding albertine as in the past so as to find out whether i really loved her i might take her as a distraction to see the verdurins and this thought reminded me that i had come there myself that evening only to learn whether mme putbus was staying there or was expected in any case she was not dining with them “speaking of your friend saintloup” said mme de cambremer using an expression which shewed a closer sequence in her ideas than her remarks might have led one to suppose for if she spoke to me about music she was thinking about the guermantes “you know that everybody is talking about his marriage to the niece of the princesse de guermantes i may tell you that so far as i am concerned all that society gossip leaves me cold” i was seized by a fear that i might have spoken unfeelingly to robert about the girl in question a girl full of sham originality whose mind was as mediocre as her actions were violent hardly ever do we hear anything that does ‘not make us regret something that we have said i replied to mme de cambremer truthfully as it happened that i knew nothing about it and that anyhow i thought that the girl was still too young to be engaged “that is perhaps why it is not yet official anyhow there is a lot of talk about it” “i ought to warn you” mme verdurin observed dryly to mme de cambremer having heard her talking to me about morel and supposing when mme de cambremer lowered her voice to speak of saintloup’s engagement that morel was still under discussion “you needn’t expect any light music here in matters of art you know the faithful who come to my wednesdays my children as i call them are all fearfully advanced” she added with an air of proud terror “i say to them sometimes my dear people you move too fast for your mistress not that she has ever been said to be afraid of anything daring every year it goes a little farther i can see the day coming when they will have no more use for wagner or indy” “but it is splendid to be advanced one can never be advanced enough” said mme de cambremer scrutinising as she spoke every corner of the diningroom trying to identify the things that her motherinlaw had left there those that mme verdurin had brought with her and to convict the latter redhanded of want of taste at the same time she tried to get me to talk of the subject that interested her most m de charlus she thought it touching that he should be looking after a violinist “he seems intelligent” “why his mind is extremely active for a man of his age” said i “age but he doesn’t seem at all old look the hair is still young” for during the last three or four years the word hair had been used with the article by one of those unknown persons who launch the literary fashions and everybody at the same radius from the centre as mme de cambremer would say ‘the hair’ not without an affected smile at the present day people still say ‘the hair’ but from an excessive use of the article the pronoun will be born again “what interests me most about m de charlus” she went on “is that one can feel that he has the gift i may tell you that i attach little importance to knowledge things that can be learned do not interest me” this speech was not incompatible with mme de cambremer’s own distinction which was in the fullest sense imitated and acquired but it so happened that one of the things which one had to know at that moment was that knowledge is nothing and is not worth a straw when compared with originality mme de cambremer had learned with everything else that one ought not to learn anything “that is why” she explained to me “brichot who has an interesting side to him for i am not one to despise a certain spicy erudition interests me far less” but brichot at that moment was occupied with one thing only hearing people talk about music he trembled lest the subject should remind mme verdurin of the death of dechambre he decided to say something that would avert that harrowing memory m de cambremer provided him with an opportunity with the question “you mean to say that wooded places always take their names from animals” “not at all” replied brichot proud to display his learning before so many strangers among whom i had told him he would be certain to interest one at least “we have only to consider how often even in the names of people a tree is preserved like a fern in a piece of coal one of our conscript fathers is called m de saulces de freycinet which means if i be not mistaken a spot planted with willows and ashes salix et fraxinetum his nephew m de selves combines more trees still since he is named de selves de sylvis” saniette was delighted to see the conversation take so animated a turn he could since brichot was talking all the time preserve a silence which would save him from being the butt of m and mme verdurin’s wit and growing even more sensitive in his joy at being set free he had been touched when he heard m verdurin notwithstanding the formality of so grand a dinnerparty tell the butler to put a decanter of water in front of m saniette who never drank anything else the generals responsible for the death of most soldiers insist upon their being well fed moreover mme verdurin had actually smiled once at saniette decidedly they were kind people he was not going to be tortured any more at this moment the meal was interrupted by one of the party whom i have forgotten to mention an eminent norwegian philosopher who spoke french very well but very slowly for the twofold reason that in the first place having learned the language only recently and not wishing to make mistakes he did nevertheless make some he referred each word to a sort of mental dictionary and secondly being a metaphysician he always thought of what he intended to say while he was saying it which even in a frenchman causes slowness of utterance he was otherwise a charming person although similar in appearance to many other people save in one respect this man so slow in his diction there was an interval of silence after every word acquired a startling rapidity in escaping from the room as soon as he had said goodbye his haste made one suppose the first time one saw him that he was suffering from colic or some even more urgent need

    “my dear — colleague” he said to brichot after deliberating in his mind whether colleague was the correct term “i have a sort of — desire to know whether there are other trees in the — nomenclature of your beautiful french — latin — norman tongue madame” lie meant madame verdurin although he dared not look at her “has told me that you know everything is not this precisely the moment” “no it is the moment for eating” interrupted mme verdurin who saw the dinner becoming interminable “very well” the scandinavian replied bowing his head over his plate with a resigned and sorrowful smile “but i must point out to madame that if i have permitted myself this questionnaire — pardon me this questation — it is because i have to return tomorrow to paris to dine at the tour d’argent or at the hôtel meurice my french — brother — m boutroux is to address us there about certain seances of spiritualism — pardon me certain spirituous evocations which he has controlled” “the tour d’argent is not nearly as good as they make out” said mme verdurin sourly “in fact i have had some disgusting dinners there” “but am i mistaken is not the food that one consumes at madame’s table an example of the finest french cookery” “well it is not positively bad” replied mme verdurin sweetening “and if you come next wednesday it will be better” “but i am leaving on monday for algiers and from there i am going to the cape and when i am at the cape of good hope i shall no longer be able to meet my illustrious colleague — pardon me i shall no longer be able to meet my brother” and he set to work obediently after offering these retrospective apologies to devour his food at a headlong pace but brichot was only too delighted to be able to furnish other vegetable etymologies and replied so greatly interesting the norwegian that he again stopped eating but with a sign to the servants that they might remove his plate and help him to the next course “one of the forty” said brichot “is named houssaye or a place planted with hollies in the name of a brilliant diplomat d’ormesson you will find the elm theulmus beloved of virgil which has given its name to the town of ulm in the names of his colleagues m de la boulaye the birch bouleau m d’aunay the alder aune m de buissière the box buis m albaret the sapwood aubier” i made a mental note that i must tell this to céleste “m de cholet the cabbage chou and the appletree pommier in the name of m de la pommeraye whose lectures we used to attend do you remember saniette in the days when the worthy porel had been sent to the farthest ends of the earth as proconsul in odeonia” “you said that cholet was derived from chou” i remarked to brichot “am i to suppose that the name of a station i passed before reaching doncières saintfrichoux comes from chou also” “no saintfrichoux is sanctus fructuosus assanctus ferreolus gave rise to saintfargeau but that is not norman in the least” “he knows too much he’s boring us” the princess muttered softly “there are so many other names that interest me but i can’t ask you everything at once” and turning to cottard “is madame putbus here” i asked him on hearing brichot utter the name of saniette m verdurin cast at his wife and at cottard an ironical glance which confounded their timid guest “no thank heaven” replied mme verdurin who had overheard my question “i have managed to turn her thoughts in the direction of venice we are rid of her for this year” “i shall myself be entitled presently to two trees” said m de charlus “for i have more or less taken a little house between saintmartinduchene and saintpierredesifs” “but that is quite close to here i hope that you will come over often with charlie morel you have only to come to an arrangement with our little group about the trains you are only a step from doncières” said mme verdurin who hated people’s not coming by the same train and not arriving at the hours when she sent carriages to meet them she knew how stiff the climb was to la raspelière even if you took the zigzag path behind féterne which was halfanhour longer she was afraid that those of her guests who kept to themselves might not find carriages to take them or even having in reality stayed away might plead the excuse that they had not found a carriage at douvilleféterne and had not felt strong enough to make so stiff a climb on foot to this invitation m de charlus responded with a silent bow “he’s not the sort of person you can talk to any day of the week he seems a tough customer” the doctor whispered to ski for having remained quite simple notwithstanding a surfacedressing of pride he made no attempt to conceal the fact that charlus had snubbed him “he is doubtless unaware that at all the wateringplaces and even in paris in the wards the physicians who naturally regard me as their ‘chief’ make it a point of honour to introduce me to all the noblemen present not that they need to be asked twice it makes my stay at the spas quite enjoyable” he added carelessly “indeed at doncières the medical officer of the regiment who is the doctor who attends the colonel invited me to luncheon to meet him saying that i was fully entitled to dine with the general and that general is a monsieur de something i don’t know whether his titledeeds are more or less ancient than those of this baron” “don’t you worry about him his is a very humble coronet” replied ski in an undertone and added some vague statement including a word of which i caught only the last syllable ast being engaged in listening to what brichot was saying to m de charlus “no as for that i am sorry to say you have probably one tree only for if saintmartinduchêne is obviouslysanctus martinus juxta quercum on the other hand the word if may be simply the root ave eve which means moist as in aveyron lodève yvette and which you see survive in our kitchensinks éviers it is the word eau which in breton is represented by ster stermaria sterlaer sterbouest sterendreuchen” i heard no more for whatever the pleasure i might feel on hearing again the name stermaria i could not help listening to cottard next to whom i was seated as he murmured to ski “indeed i was not aware of it so he is a gentleman who has learned to look behind he is one of the happy band is he he hasn’t got rings of fat round his eyes all the same i shall have to keep my feet well under me or he may start squeezing them but i’m not at all surprised i am used to seeing noblemen in the bath in their birthday suits they are all more or less degenerates i don’t talk to them because after all i am in an official position and it might do me harm but they know quite well who i am” saniette whom brichot’s appeal had frightened was beginning to breathe again like a man who is afraid of the storm when he finds that the lightning has not been followed by any sound of thunder when he heard m verdurin interrogate him fastening upon him a stare which did not spare the wretch until he had finished speaking so as to put him at once out of countenance and prevent him from recovering his composure “but you never told us that you went to those matinées at the odéon saniette” trembling like a recruit before a bullying serjeant saniette replied making his speech as diminutive as possible so that it might have a better chance of escaping the blow “only once to the chercheuse” “what’s that he says” shouted m verdurin with an air of disgust and fury combined knitting his brows as though it was all he could do to grasp something unintelligible “it is impossible to understand what you say what have you got in your mouth” inquired m verdurin growing more and more furious and alluding to saniette’s defective speech “poor saniette i won’t have him made unhappy” said mme verdurin in a tone of false pity so as to leave no one in doubt as to her husband’s insolent intention “i was at the ch    che” “che che try to speak distinctly” said m verdurin “i can’t understand a word you say” almost without exception the faithful burst out laughing and they suggested a band of cannibals in whom the sight of a wound on a white man’s skin has aroused the thirst for blood for the instinct of imitation and absence of courage govern society and the mob alike and we all of us laugh at a person whom we see being made fun of which does not prevent us from venerating him ten years later in a circle where he is admired it is in like manner that the populace banishes or acclaims its kings “come now it is not his fault” said mme verdurin “it is not mine either people ought not to dine out if they can’t speak properly” “i was at the chercheuse d’esprit by favart” “what it’s thechercheuse d’esprit that you call the chercheuse why that’s marvellous i might have tried for a hundred years without guessing it” cried m verdurin who all the same would have decided immediately that you were not literary were not artistic were not ‘one of us’ if he had heard you quote the full title of certain works for instance one was expected to say the malade the bourgeois and whoso would have added imaginaire orgentilhomme would have shewn that he did not understand ‘shop’ just as in a drawingroom a person proves that he is not in society by saying ‘m de montesquioufézensac’ instead of ‘m de montesquieu’ “but it is not so extraordinary” said saniette breathless with emotion but smiling albeit he was in no smiling mood mme verdurin could not contain herself “yes indeed” she cried with a titter “you may be quite sure that nobody would ever have guessed that you meant the chercheuse d’esprit” m verdurin went on in a gentler tone addressing both saniette and brichot “it is quite a pretty piece all the same the chercheuse d’esprit” uttered in a serious tone this simple phrase in which one could detect no trace of malice did saniette as much good and aroused in him as much gratitude as a deliberate compliment he was unable to utter a single word and preserved a happy silence brichot was more loquacious “it is true” he replied to m verdurin “and if it could be passed off as the work of some sarmatian or scandinavian author we might put forward the chercheuse d’esprit as a candidate for the vacant post of masterpiece but be it said without any disrespect to the shade of the gentle favart he had not the ibsenian temperament” immediately he blushed to the roots of his hair remembering the norwegian philosopher who appeared troubled because he was seeking in vain to discover what vegetable the buis might be that brichot had cited a little earlier in connexion with the name bussière “however now that porel’s satrapy is filled by a functionary who is a tolstoist of rigorous observance it may come to pass that we shall witnessanna karenina or resurrection beneath the odéonian architrave” “i know the portrait of favart to which you allude” said m de charlus “i have seen a very fine print of it at comtesse molé‘s” the name of comtesse molé made a great impression upon mme verdurin “oh so you go to mme de molé‘s” she exclaimed she supposed that people said comtesse molé madame molé simply as an abbreviation as she heard people say ‘the rohans’ or in contempt as she herself said ‘madame la trémoïlle’ she had no doubt that comtesse molé who knew the queen of greece and the principessa di caprarola had as much right as anybody to the particle and for once in a way had decided to bestow it upon so brilliant a personage and one who had been extremely civil to herself and so to make it clear that she had spoken thus on purpose and did not grudge the comtesse her ‘de’ she went on “but i had no idea that you knew madame de molé” as though it had been doubly extraordinary both that m de charlus should know the lady and that mme verdurin should not know that he knew her now society or at least the people to whom m de charlus gave that name forms a relatively homogeneous and compact whole and so it is comprehensible that in the incongruous vastness of the middle classes a barrister may say to somebody who knows one of his school friends “but how in the world do you come to know him” whereas to be surprised at a frenchman’s knowing the meaning of the word templeor forest would be hardly more extraordinary than to wonder at the hazards that might have brought together m de charlus and the comtesse molé what is more even if such an acquaintance had not been derived quite naturally from the laws that govern society how could there be anything strange in the fact of mme verdurin’s not knowing of it since she was meeting m de charlus for the first time and his relations with mme molé were far from being the only thing that she did not know with regard to him about whom to tell the truth she knew nothing “who was it that played this chercheuse d’esprit my good saniette” asked m verdurin albeit he felt that the storm had passed the old antiquarian hesitated before answering “there you go” said mme verdurin “you frighten him you make fun of everything that he says and then you expect him to answer come along tell us who played the part and you shall have some galantine to take home” said mme verdurin making a cruel allusion to the penury into which saniette had plunged himself by trying to rescue the family of a friend “i can remember only that it was mme samary who played the zerbine” said saniette “the zerbine what in the world is that” m verdurin shouted as though the house were on fire “it is one of the parts in the old repertory like captain fracasse as who should say the fireeater the pedant” “ah the pedant that’s yourself the zerbine no really the man’s mad” exclaimed m verdurin mme verdurin looked at her guests and laughed as though to apologise for saniette “the zerbine he imagines that everybody will know at once what it means you are like m de longepierre the stupidest man i know who said to us quite calmly the other day ‘the banat’ nobody had any idea what he meant finally we were informed that it was a province in serbia” to put an end to saniette’s torture which hurt me ‘more than it hurt him i asked brichot if he knew what the word balbec meant “balbec is probably a corruption of dalbec” he told me “one would have to consult the charters of the kings of england overlords of normandy for balbec was held of the barony of dover for which reason it was often styled balbec d’outremer balbecenterre but the barony of dover was itself held of the bishopric of bayeux and notwithstanding the rights that were temporarily enjoyed in the abbey by the templars from the time of louis d’harcourt patriarch of jerusalem and bishop of bayeux it was the bishops of that diocese who collated to the benefice of balbec so it was explained to me by the incumbent of douville a bald person eloquent fantastic and a devotee of the table who lives by the rule of brillatsavarin and who expounded to me in slightly sibylline language a loose pedagogy while he fed me upon some admirable fried potatoes” while brichot smiled to shew how witty it was to combine matters so dissimilar and to employ an ironically lofty diction in treating of commonplace things saniette was trying to find a loophole for some clever remark which would raise him from the abyss into which he had fallen the witty remark was what was known as a ‘comparison’ but had changed its form for there is an evolution in wit as in literary styles an epidemic that disappears has its place taken by another and so forth    at one time the typical ‘comparison’ was the ‘height of    ’ but this was out of date no one used it any more there was only cottard left to say still on occasion in the middle of a game of piquet “do you know what is the height of absentmindedness it is to think that the edict l’edit of nantes was an englishwoman” these ‘heights’ had been replaced by nicknames in reality it was still the old ‘comparison’ but as the nickname was in fashion people did not observe the survival unfortunately for saniette when these ‘comparisons’ were not his own and as a rule were unknown to the little nucleus he produced them so timidly that notwithstanding the laugh with which he followed them up to indicate their humorous nature nobody saw the point and if on the other hand the joke was his own as he had generally hit upon it in conversation with one of the faithful and the latter had repeated it appropriating the authorship the joke was in that case known but not as being saniette’s and so when he slipped in one of these it was recognised but because he was its author he was accused of plagiarism “very well then” brichot continued “bee in norman is a stream there is the abbey of bee mobec the stream from the marsh mor or mer meant a marsh as in morville or in bricquemar alvimare cambremer bricquebac the stream from the high ground coming from briga a fortified place as in bricqueville bricquebose le bric briand or indeed brice bridge which is the same asbruck in german innsbruck and as the english  which ends so many placenames cambridge for instance you have moreover in normandy many other instances of bec caudebec bolbec le robec le bechellouin becquerel it is the norman form of the german bach offenbach anspach varaguebec from the old word varaigne equivalent to warren preserved woods or ponds as for dal” brichot went on “it is a form of thal a valley darnetal rosendal and indeed close to louviers becdal the river that has given its name to balbec is by the way charming seen from a falaise fels in german you have indeed not far from here standing on a height the picturesque town of falaise it runs close under the spires of the church which is actually a long way from it and seems to be reflecting them” “i should think” said i “that is an effect that elstir admires greatly i have seen several sketches of it in his studio” “elstir you know tiche” cried mme verdurin “but do you know that we used to be the dearest friends thank heaven i never see him now no but ask cottard brichot he used to have his place laid at my table he came every day now there’s a man of whom you can say that it has done him no good to leave our little nucleus i shall shew you presently some flowers he painted for me you shall see the difference from the things he is doing now which i don’t care for at all not at all why i made him do me a portrait of cottard not to mention all the sketches he has made of me” “and he gave the professor purple hair” said mme cottard forgetting that at the time her husband had not been even a fellow of the college “i don’t know sir whether you find that my husband has purple hair” “that doesn’t matter” said mme verdurin raising her chin with an air of contempt for mme cottard and of admiration for the man of whom she was speaking “he was a brave colourist a fine painter whereas” she added turning again to myself “i don’t know whether you call it painting all those huge shedevils of composition those vast structures he exhibits now that he has given up coming to me for my part i call it daubing it’s all so hackneyed and besides it lacks relief personality it’s anybody’s work” “he revives the grace of the eighteenth century but in a modern form” saniette broke out fortified and reassured by my affability “but i prefer helleu” “he’s not in the least like helleu” said mme verdurin “yes he has the fever of the eighteenth century he’s a steam watteau” and he began to laugh “old old as the hills i’ve had that served up to me for years” said m verdurin to whom indeed ski had once repeated the remark but as his own invention “it’s unfortunate that when once in a way you say something quite amusing and make it intelligible it is not your own” “i’m sorry about it” mme verdurin went on “because he was really gifted he has wasted a charming temperament for painting ah if he had stayed with us why he would have become the greatest landscape painter of our day and it is a woman that has dragged him down so low not that that surprises me for he was a pleasant enough man but common at bottom he was a mediocrity i may tell you that i felt it at once really he never interested me i was very fond of him that was all for one thing he was so dirty tell me do you now really like people who never wash” “what is this charmingly coloured thing that we are eating” asked ski “it is called strawberry mousse” said mme verdurin “but it is exquisite you ought to open bottles of châteaumargaux châteaulafite port wine” “i can’t tell you how he amuses me he never drinks anything but water” said mme verdurin seeking to cloak with her delight at such a flight of fancy her alarm at the thought of so prodigal an outlay “but not to drink” ski went on “you shall fill all our glasses they will bring in marvelous peaches huge nectarines there against the sunset it will be as gorgeous as a fine veronese” “it would cost almost as much” m verdurin murmured “but take away those cheeses with their hideous colour” said ski trying to snatch the plate from before his host who defended his gruyère with his might and main “you can realise that i don’t regret elstir” mme verdurin said to me “that one is far more gifted elstir is simply hard work the man who can’t make himself give up painting when he would like to he is the good student the slavish competitor ski now only follows his own fancy you will see him light a cigarette in the middle of dinner” “after all i can’t see why you wouldn’t invite his wife” said cottard “he would be with us still” “will you mind what you’re saying please i don’t open my doors to streetwalkers monsieur le professeur” said mme verdurin who had on the contrary done everything in her power to make elstir return even with his wife but before they were married she had tried to make them quarrel had told elstir that the woman he loved was stupid dirty immoral a thief for once in a way she had failed to effect a breach it was with the verdurin salon that elstir had broken and he was glad of it as converts bless the illness or misfortune that has withdrawn them from the world and has made them learn the way of salvation “he really is magnificent the professor” she said “why not declare outright that i keep a disorderly house anyone would think you didn’t know what madame elstir was like i would sooner have the lowest streetwalker at my table oh no i don’t stand for that sort of thing besides i may tell you that it would have been stupid of me to overlook the wife when the husband no longer interests me he is out of date he can’t even draw” “that is extraordinary in a man of his intelligence” said cottard “oh no” replied mme verdurin “even at the time when he had talent for he had it the wretch and to spare what was tiresome about him was that he had not a spark of intelligence” mme verdurin in passing this judgment upon elstir had not waited for their quarrel or until she had ceased to care for his painting the fact was that even at the time when he formed part of the little group it would happen that elstir spent the whole day in the company of some woman whom rightly or wrongly mme verdurin considered a goose which in her opinion was not the conduct of an intelligent man “no” she observed with an air of finality “i consider that his wife and he are made for one another heaven knows there isn’t a more boring creature on the face of the earth and i should go mad if i had to spend a couple of hours with her but people say that he finds her very intelligent there’s no use denying it our tiche was extremely stupid i have seen him bowled over by people you can’t conceive worthy idiots we should never have allowed into our little clan well he wrote to them he argued with them he elstir that doesn’t prevent his having charming qualities oh charming and deliciously absurd naturally” for mme verdurin was convinced that men who are truly remarkable are capable of all sorts of follies a false idea in which there is nevertheless a grain of truth certainly people’s follies are insupportable but a want of balance which we discover only in course of time is the consequence of the entering into a human brain of delicacies for which it is not regularly adapted so that the oddities of charming people exasperate us but there are few if any charming people who are not at the same time odd “look i shall be able to shew you his flowers now” she said to me seeing that her husband was making signals to her to rise and she took m de cambremer’s arm again m verdurin tried to apologise for this to m de charlus as soon as he had got rid of mme de cambremer and to give him his reasons chiefly for the pleasure of discussing these social refinements with a gentleman of title momentarily the inferior of those who assigned to him the place to which they considered him entitled but first of all he was anxious to make it clear to m de charlus that intellectually he esteemed him too highly to suppose that he could pay any attention to these trivialities “excuse my mentioning so small a point” he began “for i can understand how little such things mean to you middleclass minds pay attention to them but the others the artists the people who are really of our sort don’t give a rap for them now from the first words we exchanged i realised that you were one of us” m de charlus who gave a widely different meaning to this expression drew himself erect after the doctor’s oglings he found his host’s insulting frankness suffocating “don’t protest my dear sir you are one of us it is plain as daylight” replied m verdurin “observe that i have no idea whether you practise any of the arts but that is not necessary it is not always sufficient dechambre who has just died played exquisitely with the most vigorous execution but he was not one of us you felt at once that he was not one of us brichot is not one of us morel is my wife is i can feel that you are    ” “what were you going to tell me” interrupted m de charlus who was beginning to feel reassured as to m verdurin’s meaning but preferred that he should not utter these misleading remarks quite so loud “only that we put you on the left” replied m verdurin m de charlus with a comprehending genial insolent smile replied “why that is not of the slightest importancehere” and he gave a little laugh that was all his own — a laugh that came to him probably from some bavarian or lorraine grandmother who herself had inherited it in identical form from an ancestress so that it had been sounding now without change for not a few centuries in little oldfashioned european courts and one could relish its precious quality like that of certain old musical instruments that have now grown rare there are times when to paint a complete portrait of some one we should have to add a phonetic imitation to our verbal description and our portrait of the figure that m de charlus presented is liable to remain incomplete in the absence of that little laugh so delicate so light just as certain compositions are never accurately rendered because our orchestras lack those ‘small trumpets’ with a sound so entirely their own for which the composer wrote this or that part “but” m verdurin explained stung by his laugh “we did it on purpose i attach no importance whatever to title of nobility” he went on with that contemptuous smile which i have seen so many people whom i have known unlike my grandmother and my mother assume when they spoke of anything that they did not possess before others who thus they supposed would be prevented from using that particular advantage to crow over them “but don’t you see since we happened to have m de cambremer here and he is a marquis while you are only a baron    ” “pardon me” m de charlus replied with an arrogant air to the astonished verdurin “i am also duc de brabant damoiseau de montargis prince d’oloron de carency de viareggio and des dunes however it is not of the slightest importance please do not distress yourself” he concluded resuming his subtle smile which spread itself over these final words “i could see at a glance that you were not accustomed to society”

   mme verdurin came across to me to shew me elstir’s flowers if this action to which i had grown so indifferent of going out to dinner had on the contrary taking the form that made it entirely novel of a journey along the coast followed by an ascent in a carriage to a point six hundred feet above the sea produced in me a sort of intoxication this feeling had not been dispelled at la raspelière “just look at this now” said the mistress shewing me some huge and splendid roses by elstir whose unctuous scarlet and rich white stood out however with almost too creamy a relief from the flowerstand upon which they were arranged “do you suppose he would still have to touch to get that don’t you call that striking and besides it’s fine as matter it would be amusing to handle i can’t tell you how amusing it was to watch him painting them one could feel that he was interested in trying to get just that effect” and the mistress’s gaze rested musingly on this present from the artist in which were combined not merely his great talent but their long friendship which survived only in these mementoes of it which he had bequeathed to her behind the flowers which long agcr he had picked for her she seemed to see the shapely hand that had painted them in the course of a morning in their freshness so that they on the table it leaning against the back of a chair had been able to meet face to face at the mistress’s luncheon party the roses still alive and their almost lifelike portrait almost only for elstir was unable to look at a flower without first transplanting it to that inner garden in which we are obliged always to remain he had shewn in this watercolour the appearance of the roses which he had seen and which but for him no one would ever have known so that one might say that they were a new variety with which this painter like a skilful gardener had enriched the family of the roses “from the day he left the little nucleus he was finished it seems my dinners made him waste his time that i hindered the development of his genius” she said in a tone of irony “as if the society of a woman like myself could fail to be beneficial to an artist” she exclaimed with a burst of pride close beside us m de cambremer who was already seated seeing that m de charlus was standing made as though to rise and offer him his chair this offer may have arisen in the marquis’s mind from nothing more than a vague wish to be polite m de charlus preferred to attach to it the sense of a duty which the plain gentleman knew that he owed to a prince and felt that he could not establish his right to this precedence better than by declining it and so he exclaimed “what are you doing i beg of you the idea” the astutely vehement tone of this protest had in itself something typically ‘guermantes’ which became even more evident in the imperative superfluous and familiar gesture with which he brought both his hands down as though to force him to remain seated upon the shoulders of m de cambremer who had not risen “come come my dear fellow” the baron insisted “this is too much there is no reason for it in these days we keep that for princes of the blood” i made no more effect on the cambremers than on mme verdurin by my enthusiasm for their house for i remained cold to the beauties which they pointed out to me and grew excited over confused reminiscences at times i even confessed my disappointment at not finding something correspond to what its name had made me imagine i enraged mme de cambremer by telling her that i had supposed the place to be more in the country on the other hand i broke off in an ecstasy to sniff the fragrance of a breeze that crept in through the chink of the door “i see you like draughts” they said to me my praise of the patch of green liningcloth that had been pasted over a broken pane met with no greater success “how frightful” cried the marquise the climax came when i said “my greatest joy was when i arrived when i heard my step echoing along the gallery i felt that i had come into some village counciloffice with a map of the district on the wall” this time mme de cambremer resolutely turned her back on me “you don’t think the arrangement too bad” her husband asked her with the same compassionate anxiety with which he would have inquired how his wife had stood some painful ceremony “they have some fine things” but inasmuch as malice when the hard and fast rules of sure taste do not confine it within fixed limits finds fault with everything in the persons or in the houses of the people who have supplanted the critic “yes but they are not in the right places besides are they really as fine as all that” “you noticed” said m de cambremer with a melancholy that was controlled by a note of firmness “there are some jouy hangings that are worn away some quite threadbare things in this drawingroom” “and that piece of stuff with its huge roses like a peasant woman’s quilt” said mme de cambremer whose purely artificial culture was confined exclusively to idealist philosophy impressionist painting and debussy’s music and so as not to criticise merely in the name of smartness but in that of good taste “and they have put up windscreens such bad style what can you expect of such people they don’t know where could they have learned they must be retired tradespeople it’s really not bad for them” “i thought the chandeliers good” said the marquis though it was not evident why he should make an exception of the chandeliers just as inevitably whenever anyone spoke of a church whether it was the cathedral of chartres or of rheims or of amiens or the church at balbec what he would always make a point of mentioning as admirable would be “the organloft the pulpit and the misericords” “as for the garden don’t speak about it” said mme de cambremer “it’s a massacre those paths running all crooked” i seized the opportunity while mme verdurin was pouring out coffee to go and glance over the letter which m de cambremer had brought me and in which his mother invited me to dinner with that faint trace of ink the handwriting revealed an individuality which in the future i should be able to recognise among a thousand without any more need to have recourse to the hypothesis of special pens than to suppose that rare and mysteriously blended colours are necessary to enable a painter to express his original vision indeed a paralytic stricken with agraphia after a seizure and compelled to look at the script as at a drawing without being able to read it would have gathered that mme de cambremer belonged to an old family in which the zealous cultivation of literature and the arts had supplied a margin to its artistocratic traditions he would have guessed also the period in which the marquise had learned simultaneously to write and to play chopin’s music it was the time when wellbred people observed the rule of affability and what was called the rule of the three adjectives mme de cambremer combined the two rules in one a laudatory adjective was not enough for her she followed it after a little stroke of the pen with a second then after another stroke with a third but what was peculiar to herself was that in defiance of the literary and social object at which she aimed the sequence of the three epithets assumed in mme de cambremer’s notes the aspect not of a progression but of a diminuendo mme de cambremer told me in this first letter that she had seen saintloup and had appreciated more than ever his ‘unique — rare — real’ qualities that he was coming to them again with one of his friends the one who was in love with her daughterinlaw and that if i cared to come with or without them to dine at féterne she would be ‘delighted — happy — pleased’ perhaps it was because her desire to be friendly outran the fertility of her imagination and the riches of her vocabulary that the lady while determined to utter three exclamations was incapable of making the second and third anything more than feeble echoes of the first add but a fourth adjective and of her initial friendliness there would be nothing left moreover with a certain refined simplicity which cannot have failed to produce a considerable impression upon her family and indeed in her circle of acquaintance mme de cambremer had acquired the habit of substituting for the word which might in time begin to ring false ‘sincere’ the word ‘true’ and to shew that it was indeed by sincerity that she was impelled she broke the conventional rule that would have placed the adjective ‘true’ before its noun and planted it boldly after her letters ended with “croyez à mon amitié vraie” “croyez à ma sympathie vraie” unfortunately this had become so stereotyped a formula that the affectation of frankness was more suggestive of a polite fiction than the timehonoured formulas of the meaning of which people have ceased to think i was however hindered from reading her letter by the confused sound of conversation over which rang out the louder accents of m de charlus who still on the same topic was saying to m de cambremer “you reminded me when you offered me your chair of a gentleman from whom i received a letter this morning addressed ‘to his highness the baron de charlus’ and beginning ‘monseigneur’” “to be sure your correspondent was slightly exaggerating” replied m de cambremer giving way to a discreet show of mirth m de charlus had provoked this he did not partake in it “well if it comes to that my dear fellow” he said “i may observe that heraldically speaking he was entirely in the right i am not regarding it as a personal matter you understand i should say the same of anyone else but one has to face the facts history is history we can’t alter it and it is not in our power to rewrite it i need not cite the case of the emperor william who at kiel never ceased to address me as ‘monseigneur’ i have heard it said that he gave the same title to all the dukes of france which was an abuse of the privilege but was perhaps simply a delicate attention aimed over our heads at france herself” “more delicate perhaps than sincere” said m de cambremer “ah there i must differ from you observe that personally a gentleman of the lowest rank such as that hohenzollern a protestant to boot and one who has usurped the throne of my cousin the king of hanover can be no favourite of mine” added m de charlus with whom the annexation of hanover seemed to rankle more than that of alsacelorraine “but i believe the feeling that turns the emperor in our direction to be profoundly sincere fools will tell you that he is a stage emperor he is on the contrary marvellously intelligent it is true that he knows nothing about painting and has forced herr tschudi to withdraw the elstirs from the public galleries but louis xiv did not appreciate the dutch masters he had the same fondness for display and yet he was when all is said a great monarch besides william ii has armed his country from the military and naval point of view in a way that louis xiv failed to do and i hope that his reign will never know the reverses that darkened the closing days of him who is fatuously styled the roi soleil the republic made a great mistake to my mind in rejecting the overtures of the hohenzollern or responding to them only in driblets he is very well aware of it himself and says with that gift that he has for the right expression ‘what i want is a clasped hand not a raised hat’ as a man he is vile he has abandoned surrendered denied his best friends in circumstances in which his silence was as deplorable as theirs was grand” continued m de charlus who was irresistibly drawn by his own tendencies to the eulenburg affair and remembered what one of the most highly placed of the culprits had said to him “the emperor must have relied upon our delicacy to have dared to allow such a trial but he was not mistaken in trusting to our discretion we would have gone to the scaffold with our lips sealed” “all that however has nothing to do with what i was trying to explain which is that in germany mediatised princes like ourselves are durchlaucht and in france our rank of highness was publicly recognised saintsimon tries to make out that this was an abuse on our part in which he is entirely mistaken the reason that he gives namely that louis xiv forbade us to style him the most christian king and ordered us to call him simply the king proves merely that we held our title from him and not that we had not the rank of prince otherwise it would have to be withheld from the duc de lorraine and ever so many others besides several of our titles come from the house of lorraine through thérèse d’espinay my greatgrandmother who was the daughter of the damoiseau de commercy” observing that morel was listening m de charlus proceeded to develop the reasons for his claim “i have pointed out to my brother that it is not in the third part of gotha but in the second not to say the first that the account of our family ought to be included” he said without stopping to think that morel did not know what ‘gotha’ was “but that is his affair he is the head of my house and so long as he raises no objection and allows the matter to pass i have only to shut my eyes” “m brichot interests me greatly” i said to mme verdurin as she joined me and i slipped mme de cambremer’s letter into my pocket “he has a cultured mind and is an excellent man” she replied coldly “of course what he lacks is originality and taste he has a terrible memory they used to say of the ‘forebears’ of the people we have here this evening the émigrés that they had forgotten nothing but they had at least the excuse” she said borrowing one of swann’s epigrams “that they had learned nothing whereas brichot knows everything and hurls chunks of dictionary at our heads during dinner i’m sure you know everything now about the names of all the towns and villages” while mme verdurin was speaking it occurred to me that i had determined to ask her something but i could not remember what it was i could not at this moment say what mme verdurin was wearing that evening perhaps even then i was no more able to say for i have not an observant mind but feeling that her dress was not unambitious i said to her something polite and even admiring she was like almost all women who imagine that a compliment that is paid to them is a literal statement of the truth and is a judgment impartially irresistibly pronounced as though it referred to a work of art that has no connexion with a person and so it was with an earnestness which made me blush for my own hypocrisy that she replied with the proud and artless question habitual in the circumstances “you like it” “i know you’re talking about brichot eh chantepie freycinet he spared you nothing i had my eye on you my little mistress” “i saw you it was all i could do not to laugh” “you are talking about chantepie i am certain” said m verdurin as he came towards us i had been alone as i thought of my strip of green cloth and of a scent of wood in failing to notice that while he discussed etymologies brichot had been provoking derision and inasmuch as the expressions which for me gave their value to things were of the sort which other people either do not feel or reject without thinking of them as unimportant they were entirely useless to me and had the additional drawback of making me appear stupid in the eyes of mme verdurin who saw that i had ‘swallowed’ brichot as before i had appeared stupid to mme de guermantes because i enjoyed going to see mme d’arpajon with brichot however there was another reason i was not one of the little clan and in every clan whether it be social political literary one contracts a perverse facility in discovering in a conversation in an official speech in a story in a sonnet everything that the honest reader would never have dreamed of finding there how many times have i found myself after reading with a certain emotion a tale skilfully told by a learned and slightly oldfashioned academician on the point of saying to bloch or to mme de guermantes “how charming this is” when before i had opened my mouth they exclaimed each in a different language “if you want to be really amused read a tale by soandso human stupidity has never sunk to greater depths” bloch’s scorn was aroused principally by the discovery that certain effects of style pleasant enough in themselves were slightly faded that of mme de guermantes because the tale seemed to prove the direct opposite of what the author meant for reasons of fact which she had the ingenuity to deduce but which would never have occurred to me i was no less surprised to discover the irony that underlay the verdurins’ apparent friendliness for brichot than to hear some days later at féterne the cambremers say to me on hearing my enthusiastic praise of la raspelière “it’s impossible that you can be sincere after all they’ve done to it” it is true that they admitted that the china was good like the shocking windscreens it had escaped my notice “anyhow when you go back to balbec you will know what balbec means” said m verdurin ironically it was precisely the things brichot had told me that interested me as for what they called his mind it was exactly the same mind that had at one time been so highly appreciated by the little clan he talked with the same irritating fluency but his words no longer carried having to overcome a hostile silence or disagreeable echoes what had altered was not the things that he said but the acoustics of the room and the attitude of his audience “take care” mme verdurin murmured pointing to brichot the latter whose hearing remained keener than his vision darted at the mistress the hastily withdrawn gaze of a shortsighted philosopher if his bodily eyes were less good his mind’s eye on the contrary had begun to take a larger view of things he saw how little was to be expected of human affection and resigned himself to it undoubtedly the discovery pained him it may happen that even the man who on one evening only in a circle where he is usually greeted with joy realises that the others have found him too frivolous or too pedantic or too loud or too forward or whatever it may be returns home miserable often it is a difference of opinion or of system that has made him appear to other people absurd or oldfashioned often he is perfectly well aware that those others are inferior to himself he could easily dissect the sophistries with which he has been tacitly condemned he is tempted to pay a call to write a letter on second thoughts he does nothing awaits the invitation for the following week sometimes too these discomfitures instead of ending with the evening last for months arising from the instability of social judgments they increase that instability further for the man who knows that mme x despises him feeling that he is respected at mme y’s pronounces her far superior to the other and emigrates to her house this however is not the proper place to describe those men superior to the life of society but lacking the capacity to realise their own worth outside it glad to be invited embittered by being disparaged discovering annually the faults of the hostess to whom they have been offering incense and the genius of her whom they have never properly appreciated ready to return to the old love when they shall have felt the drawbacks to be found equally in the new and when they have begun to forget those of the old we may judge by these temporary discomfitures the grief that brichot felt at one which he knew to be final he was not unaware that mme verdurin sometimes laughed at him publicly even at his infirmities and knowing how little was to be expected of human affection submitting himself to the facts he continued nevertheless to regard the mistress as his best friend but from the blush that swept over the scholar’s face mme verdurin saw that he had heard her and made up her mind to be kind to him for the rest of the evening i could not help remarking to her that she had not been very kind to saniette “what not kind to him why he adores us you can’t imagine what we are to him my husband is sometimes a little irritated by his stupidity and you must admit that he has every reason but when that happens why doesn’t he rise in revolt instead of cringing like a whipped dog it is not honest i don’t like it that doesn’t mean that i don’t always try to calm my husband because if he went too far all that would happen would be that saniette would stay away and i don’t want that because i may tell you that he hasn’t a penny in the world he needs his dinners but after all if he does mind he can stay away it has nothing to do with me when a person depends on other people he should try not to be such an idiot” “the duchy of aumale was in our family for years before passing to the house of france” m de charlus was explaining to m de cambremer before a speechless morel for whom as a matter of fact the whole of this dissertation was if not actually addressed to him intended “we took precedence over all foreign princes i could give you a hundred examples the princesse de croy having attempted at the burial of monsieur to fall on her knees after my greatgreatgrandmother that lady reminded her sharply that she had not the privilege of the hassock made the officer on duty remove it and reported the matter to the king who ordered mme de croy to call upon mme de guermantes and offer her apologies the duc de bourgogne having come to us with ushers with raised wands we obtained the king’s authority to have them lowered i know it is not good form to speak of the merits of one’s own family but it is well known that our people were always to the fore in the hour of danger our battlecry after we abandoned that of the dukes of brabant was passavant so that it is fair enough after all that this right to be everywhere the first which we had established for so many centuries in war should afterwards have been confirmed to us at court and egad it has always been admitted there i may give you a further instance that of the princess of baden as she had so far forgotten herself as to attempt to challenge the precedence of that same duchesse de guermantes of whom i was speaking just now and had attempted to go in first to the king’s presence taking advantage of a momentary hesitation which my relative may perhaps have shewn although there could be no reason for it the king called out ‘come in cousin come in mme de baden knows very well what her duty is to you’ and it was as duchesse de guermantes that she held this rank albeit she was of no mean family herself since she was through her mother niece to the queen of poland the queen of hungary the elector palatine the prince of savoycarignano and the elector of hanover afterwards king of england” “maecenas atavis édite regibus” said brichot addressing m de charlus who acknowledged the compliment with a slight inclination of his head “what did you say” mme verdurin asked brichot anxious to make amends to him for her previous speech “i was referring heaven forgive me to a dandy who was the pick of the basket” mme verdurin winced “about the time of augustus” mme verdurin reassured by the remoteness in time of this basket assumed a more serene expression “of a friend of virgil and horace who carried their sycophancy to the extent of proclaiming to his face his more than aristocratic his royal descent in a word i was referring to maecenas a bookworm who was the friend of horace virgil augustus i am sure that m de charlus knows all about maecenas” with a gracious sidelong glance at mme verdurin because he had heard her make an appointment with morel for the day after next and was afraid that she might not invite him also “i should say” said m de charlus “that maecenas was more or less the verdurin of antiquity” mme verdurin could not altogether suppress a smile of satisfaction she went over to morel “he’s nice your father’s friend” she said to him “one can see that he’s an educated man and well bred he will get on well in our little nucleus what is his address in paris” morel preserved a haughty silence and merely proposed a game of cards mme verdurin insisted upon a little violin music first to the general astonishment m de charlus who never referred to his own considerable gifts accompanied in the purest style the closing passage uneasy tormented schumannesque but for all that earlier than franck’s sonata of the sonata for piano and violin by fauré i felt that he would furnish morel marvellously endowed as to tone and virtuosity with just those qualities that he lacked culture and style but i thought with curiosity of this combination in a single person of a physical blemish and a spiritual gift m de charlus was not very different from his brother the duc de guermantes indeed a moment ago though this was rare he had spoken as bad french as his brother he having reproached me doubtless in order that i might speak in glowing terms of morel to mme verdurin with never coming to see him and i having pleaded discretion he had replied “but since it is i that asks you there is no one but i who am in a position to take offence” this might have been said by the duc de guermantes m de charlus was only a guermantes when all was said but it had been enough that nature should upset the balance of his nervous system sufficiently to make him prefer to the woman that his brother the duke would have chosen one of virgil’s shepherds or plato’s disciples and at once qualities unknown to the duc de guermantes and often combined with this want of balance had made m de charlus an exquisite pianist an amateur painter who was not devoid of taste an eloquent talker who would ever have detected that the rapid eager charming style with which m de charlus played the schumannesque passage of fauré‘s sonata had its equivalent — one dares not say its cause — in elements entirely physical in the nervous defects of m de charlus we shall explain later on what we mean by nervous defects and why it is that a greek of the time of socrates a roman of the time of augustus might be what we know them to have been and yet remain absolutely normal men and not menwomen such as we see around us today just as he had genuine artistic tendencies which had never come to fruition so m de charlus had far more than the duke loved their mother loved his own wife and indeed years after her death if anyone spoke of her to him would shed tears but superficial tears like the perspiration of an overstout man whose brow will glisten with sweat at the slightest exertion with this difference that to the latter we say “how hot you are” whereas we pretend not to notice other people’s tears we that is to say people in society for the humbler sort are as distressed by the sight of tears as if a sob were more serious than a hemorrhage his sorrow after the death of his wife thanks to the habit of falsehood did not debar m de charlus from a life which was not in harmony •with it indeed later on he sank so low as to let it be known that during the funeral rites he had found an opportunity of asking the acolyte for his name and address and it may have been true

   when the piece eame to an end i ventured to ask for some franck which appeared to cause mme de cambremer such acute pain that i did not insist “you can’t admire that sort of thing” she said to me instead she asked for debussy’s fêtes which made her exclaim “ah how sublime” from the first note but morel discovered that he remembered the opening bars only and in a spirit of mischief without any intention to deceive began a march by meyerbeer unfortunately as he left little interval and made no announcement everybody supposed that he was still playing debussy and continued to exclaim ‘sublime’ morel by revealing that the composer was that not of pelléas but of robert le diable created a certain chill mme de cambremer had scarcely time to feel it for she had just discovered a volume of scarlatti and had flung herself upon it with an hysterical impulse “oh play this look this piece it’s divine” she cried and yet of this composer long despised recently promoted to the highest honours what she had selected in her feverish impatience was one of those infernal pieces which have so often kept us from sleeping while a merciless pupil repeats them indefinitely on the next floor but morel had had enough music and as he insisted upon cards m de charlus to be able to join in proposed a game of whist “he was telling the master just now that he is a prince” said ski to mme verdurin “but it’s not true they’re quite a humble family of architects” “i want to know what it was you were saying about maecenas it interests me don’t you know” mme verdurin repeated to brichot with an affability that carried him off his feet and so in order to shine in the mistress’s eyes and possibly in mine “why to tell you the truth madame maecenas interests me chiefly because he is the earliest apostle of note of that chinese god who numbers more followers in france today than brahma than christ himself the allpowerful god ubedamd” mme verdurin was no longer content upon these occasions with burying her head in her hands she would descend with the suddenness of the insects called ephemeral upon princess sherbatoff were the latter within reach the mistress would cling to her shoulder dig her nails into it and hide her face against it for a few moments like a child playing at hide and seek concealed by this protecting screen she was understood to be laughing until she cried and was as well able to think of nothing at all as people are who while saying a prayer that is rather long take the wise precaution of burying their faces in their hands mme verdurin used to imitate them when she listened to beethoven quartets so as at the same time to let it be seen that she regarded them as a prayer and not to let it be seen that she was asleep “i am quite serious madame” said brichot “too numerous i consider today is become the person who spends his time gazing at his navel as though it were the hub of the universe as a matter of doctrine i have no objection to offer to some nirvana which will dissolve us in the great whole which like munich and oxford is considerably nearer to paris than asnières or boiscolombes but it is unworthy either of a true frenchman or of a true european even when the japanese are possibly at the gates of our byzantium that socialised antimilitarists should be gravely discussing the cardinal virtues of free verse” mme verdurin felt that she might dispense with the princess’s mangled shoulder and allowed her face to become once more visible not without pretending to wipe her eyes and gasping two or three times for breath but brichot was determined that i should have my share in the entertainment and having learned from those oral examinations which he conducted so admirably that the best way to flatter the young is to lecture them to make them feel themselves important to make them regard you as a reactionary “i have no wish to blaspheme against the gods of youth” he said with that furtive glance at myself which a speaker turns upon a member of his audience whom he has mentioned by name “i have no wish to be damned as a heretic and renegade in the mallarméan chapel in which our new friend like all the young men of his age must have served the esoteric mass at least as an acolyte and have shewn himself deliquescent or rosicrucian but really we have seen more than enough of these intellectuals worshipping art with a big a who when they can no longer intoxicate themselves upon zola inject themselves with verlaine become etheromaniacs out of baudelairean devotion they would no longer be capable of the virile effort which the country may one day or another demand of them anaesthetised as they are by the great literary neurosis in the heated enervating atmosphere heavy with unwholesome vapours of a symbolism of the opiumpipe” feeling incapable of feigning any trace of admiration for brichot’s inept and motley tirade i turned to ski and assured him that he was entirely mistaken as to the family to which m de charlus belonged he replied that he was certain of his facts and added that i myself had said that his real name was gandin le gandin “i told you” was my answer “that mme de cambremer was the sister of an engineer m legrandin i never said a word to you about m de charlus there is about as much connexion between him and mme de cambremer as between the great condé and racine” “indeed i thought there was” said ski lightly with no more apology for his mistake than he had made a few hours earlier for the mistake that had nearly made his party miss the train “do you intend to remain long on this coast” mme verdurin asked m de charlus in whom she foresaw an addition to the faithful and trembled lest he should be returning too soon to paris “good lord one never knows” replied m de charlus in a nasal drawl “i should like to stay here until the end of september” “you are quite right” said mme verdurin “that is the time for fine storms at sea” “to tell you the truth that is not what would influence me i have for some time past unduly neglected the archangel saint michael my patron and i should like to make amends to him by staying for his feast on the 29th of september at the abbey on the mount” “you take an interest in all that sort of thing” asked mme verdurin who might perhaps have succeeded in hushing the voice of her outraged anticlericalism had she not been afraid that so long an expedition might make the violinist and the baron ‘fail’ her for fortyeight hours “you are perhaps afflicted with intermittent deafness” m de charlus replied insolently “i have told you that saint michael is one of my glorious patrons” then smiling with a benevolent ecstasy his eyes gazing into the distance his voice strengthened by an excitement which seemed now to be not merely aesthetic but religious “it is so beautiful at the offertory when michael stands erect by the altar in a white robe swinging a golden censer heaped so high with perfumes that the fragrance of them mounts up to god” “we might go there in a party” suggested mme verdurin notwithstanding her horror of the clergy “at that moment when the offertory begins” went on m de charlus who for other reasons but in the same manner as good speakers in parliament never replied to an interruption and would pretend not to have heard it “it would be wonderful to see our young friend palestrinising indeed performing an aria by bach the worthy abbot too would be wild with joy and that is the greatest homage at least the greatest public homage that i can pay to my holy patron what an edification for the faithful we must mention it presently to the young angelico of music a warrior like saint michael”

   saniette summoned to make a fourth declared that he did not know how to play whist and cottard seeing that there was not much time left before our train embarked at once on a game of écarté with morel m verdurin was furious and bore down with a terrible expression upon saniette “is there anything in the world that you can play” he cried furious at being deprived of the opportunity for a game of whist and delighted to have found one to insult the old registrar he in his terror did his best to look clever “yes i can play the piano” he said cottard and morel were seated face to face “your deal” said cottard “suppose we go nearer to the cardtable” m de charlus worried by the sight of morel in cottard’s company suggested to m de cambremer “it is quite as interesting as those questions of etiquette which in these days have ceased to count for very much the only kings that we have left in france at least are the kings in the pack of cards who seem to me to be positively swarming in the hand of our young virtuoso” he added a moment later from an admiration for morel which extended to his way of playing cards to flatter him also and finally to account for his suddenly turning to lean over the young violinist’s shoulder “iee cut” said imitating the accent of a cardsharper cottard whose children burst out laughing like his students and the chief dresser whenever the master even by the bedside of a serious case uttered with the emotionless face of an epileptic one of his hackneyed witticisms “i don’t know what to play” said morel seeking advice from m de charlus “just as you please you’re bound to lose whatever you play it’s all the same c’est égal” “egal    ingalli” said the doctor with an insinuating kindly glance at m de cambremer “she was what we call a true diva she was a dream a carmen such as we shall never see again she was wedded to the part i used to enjoy too listening to ingalli — married” the marquis drew himself up with that contemptuous vulgarity of wellbred people who do not realise that they are insulting their host by appearing uncertain whether they ought to associate with his guests and adopt english manners by way of apology for a scornful expression “who is that gentleman playing cards what does he do for a living what does he sell i rather like to know whom i am meeting so as not to make friends with any tom dick or harry but i didn’t catch his name when you did me the honour of introducing me to him” if m verdurin availing himself of this phrase had indeed introduced m de cambremer to his fellowguests the other would have been greatly annoyed but knowing that it was the opposite procedure that was observed he thought it gracious to assume a genial and modest air without risk to himself the pride that m verdurin took in his intimacy with cottard had increased if anything now that the doctor had become an eminent professor but it no longer found expression in the artless language of earlier days then when cottard was scarcely known to the public if you spoke to m verdurin of his wife’s facial neuralgia “there is nothing to be done” he would say with the artless selfsatisfaction of people who assume that anyone whom they know must be famous and that everybody knows the name of their family singingmaster “if she had an ordinary doctor one might look for a second opinion but when that doctor is called cottard” a name which he pronounced as though it were bouchard or charcot “one has simply to bow to the inevitable” adopting a reverse procedure knowing that m de cambremer must certainly have heard of the famous professor cottard m verdurin adopted a tone of simplicity “he’s our family doctor a worthy soul whom we adore and who would let himself be torn in pieces for our sakes he is not a doctor he is a friend i don’t suppose you have ever heard of him or that his name would convey anything to you in any case to us it is the name of a very good man of a very dear friend cottard” this name murmured in a modest tone took in m de cambremer who supposed that his host was referring to some one else “cottard you don’t mean professor cottard” at that moment one heard the voice of the said professor who at an awkward point in the game was saying as he looked at his cards “this is where greek meets greek” “why yes to be sure he is a professor” said m verdurin “what professor cottard you are not making a mistakeyou are quite sure it’s the same man the one who lives in the rue du bac” “yes his address is 43 rue du bac you know him” “but everybody knows professor cottard he’s at the top of the tree you might as well ask me if i knew bouffe de saintbiaise or courtoissuffit i could see when i heard him speak that he was not an ordinary person that is why i took the liberty of asking you” “come now what shall i play trumps” asked cottard then abruptly with a vulgarity which would have been offensive even in heroic circumstances as when a soldier uses a coarse expression to convey his contempt for death but became doubly stupid in the safe pastime of a game of cards cottard deciding to play a trump assumed a sombre suicidal air and borrowing the language of people who are risking their skins played his card as though it were his life with the exclamation “there it is and be damned to it” it was not the right card to play but he had a consolation in the middle of the room in a deep armchair mme cottard yielding to the effect which she always found irresistible of a good dinner had succumbed after vain efforts to the vast and gentle slumbers that were overpowering her in vain might she sit up now and again and smile whether at her own absurdity or from fear of leaving unanswered some polite speech that might have been addressed to her she sank back in spite of herself into the clutches of the implacable and delicious malady more than the noise what awakened her thus for an instant only was the giance which in her wifely affection she could see even when her eyes were shut and foresaw for the same scene occurred every evening and haunted her dreams like the thought of the hour at which one will have to rise the glance with which the professor drew the attention of those present to his wife’s slumbers to begin with he merely looked at her and smiled for if as a doctor he disapproved of this habit of falling asleep after dinner or at least gave this scientific reason for growing annoyed later on but it is not certain whether it was a determining reason so many and diverse were the views that he held about it as an allpowerful and teasing husband he was delighted to be able to make a fool of his wife to rouse her only partly at first so that she might fall asleep again and he have the pleasure of waking her afresh

   by this time mme cottard was sound asleep “now then léontine you’re snoring” the professor called to her “i am listening to mme swann my dear” mme cottard replied faintly and dropped back into her lethargy “it’s perfect nonsense” exclaimed cottard “she’ll be telling us presently that she wasn’t asleep she’s like the patients who come to consult us and insist that they never sleep at all” “they imagine it perhaps” said m de cambremer with a laugh but the doctor enjoyed contradicting no less than teasing and would on no account allow a layman to talk medicine to him “people do not imagine that they never sleep” he promulgated in a dogmatic tone “ah” replied the marquis with a respectful bow such as cottard at one time would have made “it is easy to see” cottard went on “that you have never administered as i have as much as two grains of trional without succeeding in provoking somnolescence” “quite so quite so” replied the marquis laughing with a superior air “i have never taken trional or any of those drugs which soon cease to have any effect but ruin your stomach when a man has been out shooting all night like me in the forest of chantepie i can assure you he doesn’t need any trional to make him sleep” “it is only fools who say that” replied the professor “trional frequently has a remarkable effect on the nervous tone you mention trional have you any idea what it is” “well    i’ve heard people say that it is a drug to make one sleep” “you are not answering my question” replied the professor who thrice weekly at the faculty sat on the board of examiners “i don’t ask you whether it makes you sleep or not but what it is can you tell me what percentage it contains of amyl and ethyl” “no” replied m de cambremer with embarrassment “i prefer a good glass of old brandy or even 345 port” “which are ten times as toxic” the professor interrupted “as for trional” m de cambremer ventured “my wife goes in for all that sort of thing you’d better talk to her about it” “she probably knows just as much about it as yourself in any case if your wife takes trional to make her sleep you can see that mine has no need of it come along léontine wake up you’re getting ankylosed did you ever see me fall asleep after dinner what will you be like when you’re sixty if you fall asleep now like an old woman you’ll go and get fat you’re arresting the circulation she doesn’t even hear what i’m saying” “they’re bad for one’s health these little naps after dinner ain’t they doctor” said m de cambremer seeking to rehabilitate himself with cottard “after a heavy meal one ought to take exercise” “stuff and nonsense” replied the doctor “we have taken identical quantities of food from the stomach of a dog that has lain quiet and from the stomach of a dog that has been running about and it is in the former that digestion is more advanced” “then it is sleep that stops digestion” “that depends upon whether you mean oesophagic digestion stomachic digestion intestinal digestion it is useless to give you explanations which you would not understand since you have never studied medicine now then léontine quick march it is time we were going” this was not true for the doctor was going merely to continue his game but he hoped thus to cut short in a more drastic fashion the slumbers of the deaf mute to whom he had been addressing without a word of response the most learned exhortations whether a determination to remain awake survived in mme cottard even in the state of sleep or because the armchair offered no support to her head it was jerked mechanically from left to right and up and down in the empty air like a lifeless object and mme cottard with her nodding poll appeared now to be listening to music now to be in the last throes of death where her husband’s increasingly vehement admonitions failed of their effect her sense of her own stupidity proved successful “my bath is nice and hot” she murmured “but the feathers in the dictionary    ” she exclaimed as she sat bolt upright “oh good lord what a fool i am whatever have i been saying i was thinking about my hat i’m sure i said something silly in another minute i should have been asleep it’s that wretched fire” everybody began to laugh for there was no fire in the room

    “you are making fun of me” said mme cottard herself laughing and raising her hand to her brow to wipe away with the light touch of a hypnotist and the sureness of a woman putting her hair straight the last traces of sleep “i must offer my humble apologies to dear mme verdurin and ask her to tell me the truth” but her smile at once grew sorrowful for the professor who knew that his wife sought to please him and trembled lest she should fail had shouted at her “look at yourself in the glass you are as red as if you had an eruption of acne you look just like an old peasant” “you know he is charming” said mme verdurin “he has such a delightfully sarcastic side to his character and then he snatched my husband from the jaws of death when the whole faculty had given him up he spent three nights by his bedside without ever lying down and so cottard to me you know” she went on in a grave and almost menacing tone raising her hand to the twin spheres shrouded in white tresses of her musical temples and as though we had wished to assault the doctor “is sacred he could ask me for anything in the world as it is i don’t call him doctor cottard i call him doctor god and even in saying that i am slandering him for this god does everything in his power to remedy some of the disasters for which the other is responsible” “play a trump” m de charlus said to morel with a delighted air “a trump here goes” said the violinist “you ought to have declared your king first” said m de charlus “you’re not paying attention to the game but how well you play” “i have the king” said morel “he’s a fine man” replied the professor “what’s all that business up there with the sticks” asked mme verdurin drawing m de cambremer’s attention to a superb escutcheon carved over the mantelpiece “are they your arms” she added with an ironical disdain “no they are not ours” replied m de cambremer “we bear barry of five embattled counterembattled or and gules as many trefoils countercharged no those are the arms of the arrachepels who were not of our stock but from whom we inherited the house and nobody of our line has ever made any changes here the arrachepels formerly pelvilains we are told bore or five piles couped in base gules when they allied themselves with the féterne family their blazon changed but remainedcantoned within twenty cross crosslets fitchee in base or a dexter canton ermine” “that’s one for her” muttered mme de cambremer “my greatgrandmother was a d’arrachepel or de rachepel as you please for both forms are found in the old charters” continued m de cambremer blushing vividly for only then did the idea for which his wife had given him credit occur to him and he was afraid that mme verdurin might have applied to herself a speech which had been made without any reference to her “the history books say that in the eleventh century the first arrachepel mace named pelvilain shewed a special aptitude in siege warfare in tearing up piles whence the name arrachepel by which he was ennobled and the piles which you see persisting through the centuries in their arms these are the piles which to render fortifications more impregnable used to be driven plugged if you will pardon the expression into the ground in front of them and fastened together laterally they are what you quite rightly called sticks though they had nothing to do with the floating sticks of our good lafontaine for they were supposed to render a stronghold unassailable of course with our modern artillery they make one smile but you must bear in mind that i am speaking of the eleventh century” “it is all rather out of date” said mme verdurin “but the little campanile has a character” “you have” said cottard “the luck of    turlututu” a word which he gladly repeated to avoid using molière’s “do you know why the king of diamonds was turned out of the army” “i shouldn’t mind being in his shoes” said morel who was tired of military service “oh what a bad patriot” exclaimed m de charlus who could not refrain from pinching the violinist’s ear “no you don’t know why the king of diamonds was turned out of the army” cottard pursued determined to make his joke “it’s because he has only one eye” “you are up against it doctor” said m de cambremer to shew cottard that he knew who he was “this young man is astonishing” m de charlus interrupted innocently “he plays like a god” this observation did not find favour with the doctor who replied “never too late to mend who laughs last laughs longest” “queen ace” morel whom fortune was favouring announced triumphantly the doctor bowed his head as though powerless to deny this good fortune and admitted spellbound “that’s fine” “we are so pleased to have met m de charlus” said mme de cambremer to mme verdurin “had you never met him before he is quite nice he is unusual he is of a period“ she would have found it difficult to say which replied mme verdurin with the satisfied smile of a connoisseur a judge and a hostess mme de cambremer asked me if i was coming to féterne with saintloup i could not suppress a cry of admiration when i saw the moon hanging like an orange lantern beneath the vault of oaks that led away from the house “that’s nothing presently when the moon has risen higher and the valley is lighted up it will be a thousand times better” “are you staying any time in this neighbourhood madame” m de cambremer asked mme cottard a speech that might be interpreted as a vague intention to invite and dispensed him for the moment from making any more precise engagement “oh certainly sir i regard this annual exodus as most important for the children whatever you may say they must have fresh air the faculty wanted to send me to vichy but it is too stuffy there and i can look after my stomach when those big boys of mine have grown a little bigger besides the professor with all the examinations he has to hold has always got his shoulder to the wheel and the hot weather tires him dreadfully i feel that a man needs a thorough rest after he has been on the go all the year like that whatever happens we shall stay another month at least” “ah in that case we shall meet again” “besides i shall be all the more obliged to stay here as my husband has to go on a visit to savoy and won’t be finally settled here for another fortnight” “i like the view of the valley even more than the sea view” mme verdurin went on “you are going to have a splendid night for your journey” “we ought really to find out whether the carriages are ready if you are absolutely determined to go back to balbec tonight” m verdurin said to me “for i see no necessity for it myself we could drive you over tomorrow morning it is certain to be fine the roads are excellent” i said that it was impossible “but in any case it is not time yet” the mistress protested “leave them alone they have heaps of time a lot of good it will do them to arrive at the station with an hour to wait they are far happier here and you my young mozart” she said to morel not venturing to address m de charlus directly “won’t you stay the night we have some nice rooms facing the sea” “no he can’t” m de gharlus replied on behalf of the absorbed cardplayer who had not heard “he has a pass until midnight only he must go back to bed like a good little boy obedient and wellbehaved” he added in a complaisant mannered insistent voice as though he derived some sadic pleasure from the use of this chaste comparison and also from letting his voice dwell in passing upon any reference to morel from touching him with failing his fingers words that seemed to explore his person

   from the sermon that brichot had addressed to me m de cambremer had concluded that i was a dreyfusard as he himself was as antidreyfusard as possible out of courtesy to a foe he began to sing me the praises of a jewish colonel who had always been very decent to a cousin of the chevregny and had secured for him the promotion he deserved “and my cousin’s opinions were the exact opposite” said m de cambremer he omitted to mention what those opinions were but i felt that they were as antiquated and misshapen as his own face opinions which a few families in certain small towns must long have entertained “well you know i call that really fine” was m de cambremer’s conclusion it is true that he was hardly employing the word ‘fine’ in the aesthetic sense in which it would have suggested to his wife and mother different works but works anyhow of art m de cambremer often made use of this term when for instance he was congratulating a delicate person who had put on a little flesh “what you have gained halfastone in two months i say that’s fine” refreshments were set out on a table mme verdurin invited the gentlemen to go and choose whatever drinks they preferred m de charlus went and drank his glass and at once returned to a seat by the cardtable from which he did not stir mme verdurin asked him “have you tasted my orangeade” upon which m de charlus with a gracious smile in a crystalline tone which he rarely sounded and with endless motions of his lips and body replied “no i preferred its neighbour it was strawberryjuice i think it was delicious” it is curious that a certain order of secret actions has the external effect of a manner of speaking or gesticulating which reveals them if a gentleman believes or disbelieves in the immaculate conception or in the innocence of dreyfus or in a plurality of worlds and wishes to keep his opinion to himself you will find nothing in his voice or in his movements that will let you read his thoughts but on hearing m de charlus say in that shrill voice and with that smile and waving his arms “no i preferred its neighbour the strawberryjuice” one could say “there he likes the stronger sex” with the same certainty as enables a judge to sentence a criminal who has not confessed a doctor a patient suffering from general paralysis who himself is perhaps unaware of his malady but has made some mistake in pronunciation from which one can deduce that he will be dead in three years perhaps the people who conclude from a man’s way of saying “no i preferred its neighbour the strawberryjuice” a love of the kind called unnatural have no need of any such scientific knowledge but that is because there is a more direct relation between the revealing sign and the secret without saying it in so many words to oneself one feels that it is a gentle smiling lady who is answering and who appears mannered because she is pretending to be a man and one is not accustomed to seeing men adopt such mannerisms and it is perhaps more pleasant to think that for long years a certain number of angelic women have been included by mistake in the masculine sex where in exile ineffectually beating their wings towards men in whom they inspire a physical repulsion they know how to arrange a drawingroom compose ‘interiors’ m de charlus was not in the least perturbed that mme verdurin should be standing and remained installed in his armchair so as to be nearer to morel “don’t you think it criminal” said mme verdurin to the baron “that that creature who might be enchanting us with his violin should be sitting there at a cardtable when anyone can play the violin like that” “he plays cards well he does everything well he is so intelligent” said m de charlus keeping his eye on the game so as to be able to advise morel this was not his only reason however for not rising from his chair for mme verdurin with the singular amalgam that he had made of the social conceptions at once of a great nobleman and an amateur of art instead of being polite in the same way that a man of his world would be he would create a sort of tableauvivant for himself after saintsimon and at that moment was amusing himself by impersonating the maréchal d’uxelles who interested him from other aspects also and of whom it is said that he was so proud as to remain seated with a pretence of laziness before all the most distinguished persons at court “by the way charlus” said mme verdurip who was beginning to grow familiar “you don’t know of any ruined old nobleman in your faubourg who would come to me as porter” “why yes    why yes” replied m de charlus with a genial smile “but i don’t advise it” “why not” “i should be afraid for your sake that your smart visitors would call at the lodge and go no farther” this was the first skirmish between them mme verdurin barely noticed it there were to be others alas in paris m de charlus remained glued to his chair he could not moreover restrain a faint smile seeing how his favourite maxims as to aristocratic prestige and middleclass cowardice were confirmed by the so easily won submission of mme verdurin the mistress appeared not at all surprised by the baron’s posture and if she left him it was only because she had been perturbed by seeing me taken up by m de cambremer but first of all she wished to clear up the mystery of m de charlus’s relations with comtesse mole “you told me that you knew mme de molê does that mean you go there” she asked giving to the words ‘go there’ the sense of being received there of having received authority from the lady to go and call upon her m de charlus replied with an inflexion of disdain an affectation of precision and in a singsong tone “yes sometimes” this ‘sometimes’ inspired doubts in mme verdurin who asked “have you ever met the duc de guermantes there” “ah that i don’t remember” “oh” said mme verdurin “you don’t know the duc de guermantes” “and how should i not know him” replied m de charlus his lips curving in a smile this smile was ironical but as the baron was afraid of letting a gold tooth be seen he stopped it with a reverse movement of his lips so that the resulting sinuosity was that of a goodnatured smile “why do you say ‘how should i not know him’ “ “because he is my brother” said m de charlus carelessly leaving mme verdurin plunged in stupefaction and in the uncertainty whether her guest was making fun of her was a natural son or a son by another marriage the idea that the brother of the duc de guermantes might be called baron de charlus never entered her head she bore down upon me “i heard m de cambremer invite you to dinner just now it has nothing to do with me you understand but for your own sake i do hope you won’t go for one thing the place is infested with bores oh if you like dining with provincial counts and marquises whom nobody knows you will be supplied to your heart’s content” “i think i shall be obliged to go there once or twice i am not altogether free however for i have a young cousin whom i cannot leave by herself” i felt that this fictitious kinship made it easier for me to take albertine about “but as for the cambremers as i have been introduced to them    ” “you shall do just as you please one thing i can tell you it’s extremely unhealthy when you have caught pneumonia or a nice little chronic rheumatism you’ll be a lot better off” “but isn’t the place itself very pretty” “mmmmyess    if you like for my part i confess frankly that i would a hundred times rather have the view from here over this valley to begin with if they’d paid us i wouldn’t have taken the other house because the sea air is fatal to m verdurin if your cousin suffers at all from nerves    but you yourself have bad nerves i think you have choking fits very well you shall see go there once you won’t sleep for a week after it but it’s not my business” and without thinking of the inconsistency with what she had just been saying “if it would amuse you to see the house which is not bad pretty is too strong a word still it is amusing with its old moat and the old drawbridge as i shall have to sacrifice myself and dine there once very well come that day i shall try to bring all my little circle then it will be quite nice the day after tomorrow we are going to harambouville in the carriage it’s a magnificent drive the cider is delicious come with us you brichot you shall come too and you too ski that will make a party which as a matter of fact my husband must have arranged already i don’t know whom all he has invited monsieur de charlus are you one of them” the baron who had not heard the whole speech and did not know that she was talking of an excursion to harambouville gave a start “a strange question” he murmured in a mocking tone by which mme verdurin felt hurt “anyhow” she said to me “before you dine with the cambremers why not bring her here your cousin does she like conversation and clever people is she pleasant yes very well then bring her with you the cambremers aren’t the only people in the world i can understand their being glad to invite her they must find it difficult to get anyone here she will have plenty of fresh air and lots of clever men in any case i am counting on you not to fail me next wednesday i heard you were having a teaparty at rivebelle with your cousin and m de charlus and i forget who’ else you must arrange to bring the whole lot on here it would be nice if you all came in a body it’s the easiest thing in the world to get here the roads are charming if you like i can send down for you i can’t imagine what you find attractive in rivebelle it’s infested with mosquitoes you are thinking perhaps of the reputation of the rockcakes my cook makes them far better i can let you have them here norman rockcakes the real article and shortbread i need say no more ah if you like the filth they give you at rivebelle that i won’t give you i don’t poison my guests sir and even if i wished to my cook would refuse to make such abominations and would leave my service those rockcakes you get down there you can’t tell what they are made of i knew a poor girl who got peritonitis from them which carried her off in three days she was only seventeen it was sad for her poor mother” added mme verdurin with a melancholy air beneath the spheres of her temples charged with experience and suffering “however go and have tea at rivebelle if you enjoy being fleeced and flinging money out of the window but one thing i beg of you it is a confidential mission i am charging you with on the stroke of six bring all your party here don’t allow them to go straggling away by themselves you can bring whom you please i wouldn’t say that to everybody but i am sure that your friends are nice i can see at once that we understand one another apart from the little nucleus there are some very pleasant people coming on wednesday you don’t know little madame de longpont she is charming and so witty not in the least a snob you will find you’ll like her immensely and she’s going to bring a whole troop of friends too” mme verdurin added to shew me that this was the right thing to do and encourage me by the other’s example “we shall see which has most influence and brings most people barbe de longpont or you and then i believe somebody’s going to bring bergotte” she added with a vague air this meeting with a celebrity being rendered far from likely by a paragraph which had appeared in the papers that morning to the effect that the great writer’s health was causing grave anxiety “anyhow you will see that it will be one of my most successful wednesdays i don’t want to have any boring women you mustn’t judge by this evening it has been a complete failure don’t try to be polite you can’t have been more bored than i was i thought myself it was deadly it won’t always be like tonight you know i’m not thinking of the cambremers who are impossible but i have known society people who were supposed to be pleasant well compared with my little nucleus they didn’t exist i heard you say that you thought swann clever i must say to my mind his cleverness was greatly exaggerated but without speaking of the character of the man which i have always found fundamentally antipathetic sly underhand i have often had him to dinner on wednesdays well you can ask the others even compared with brichot who is far from being anything wonderful a good assistant master whom i got into the institute swann was simply nowhere he was so dull” and as i expressed a contrary opinion “it’s the truth i don’t want to say a word against him to you since he was your friend indeed he was very fond of you he has spoken to me about you in the most charming way but ask the others here if he ever said anything interesting at our dinners that after all is the supreme test well i don’t know why it was but swann in my house never seemed to come off one got nothing out of him and yet anything there ever was in him he picked up here” i assured her that he was highly intelligent “no you only think that because you haven’t known him as long as i have one got to the end of him very soon i was always bored to death by him” which may be interpreted “he went to the la trémoïlles and the guermantes and knew that i didn’t” “and i can put up with anything except being bored that i cannot and will not stand” her horror of boredom was now the reason upon which mme verdurin relied to explain the composition of the little group she did not yet entertain duchesses because she was incapable of enduring boredom just as she was unable to go for a cruise because of seasickness i thought to myself that what mme verdurin said was not entirely false and whereas the guermantes would have declared brichot to be the stupidest man they had ever met i remained uncertain whether he were not in reality superior if not to swann himself at least to the other people endowed with the wit of the guermantes who would have had the good taste to avoid and the modesty to blush at his pedantic pleasantries i asked myself the question as though a fresh light might be thrown on the nature of the intellect by the answer that i should make and with the earnestness of a christian influenced by portroyal when he considers the problem of grace “you will see” mme verdurin continued “when one has society people together with people of real intelligence people of our set that’s where one has to see them the society man who is brilliant in the kingdom of the blind is only oneeyed here besides the others don’t feel at home any longer so much so that i’m inclined to ask myself whether instead of attempting mixtures that spoil everything i shan’t start special evenings confined to the bores so as to have the full benefit of my little nucleus however you are coming again with your cousin that’s settled good at any rate you will both find something to eat here féterne is starvation corner oh by the way if you like rats go there at once you will get as many as you want and they will keep you there as long as you are prepared to stay why you’ll die of hunger i’m sure when i go there i shall have my dinner before i start the more the merrier you must come here first and escort me we shall have high tea and supper when we get back do you like appletarts yes very well then our chef makes the best in the world you see i was quite right when i told you that you were meant to live here so come and stay you know there is far more room in the house than people think i don’t speak of it so as not to let myself in for bores you might bring your cousin to stay she would get a change of air from balbec with this air here i maintain i can cure incurables i have cured them i may tell you and not only this time for i have stayed quite close to here before a place i discovered and got for a mere song a very different style of house from their raspelicre i can shew you it if we go for a drive together but i admit that even here the air is invigorating still i don’t want to say too much about it the whole of paris would begin to take a fancy to my little corner that has always been my luck anyhow give your cousin my message we shall put you in two nice rooms looking over the valley you ought to see it in the morning with the sun shining on the mist by the way who is this robert de saintloup of whom you were speaking” she said with a troubled air for she had heard that i was to pay him a visit at doncières and was afraid that he might make me fail her “why not bring him here instead if he’s not a bore i have heard of him from morel i fancy he’s one of his greatest friends” said mme verdurin with entire want of truth for saintloup and morel were not even aware of one another’s existence but having heard that saintloup knew m de charlus she supposed that it was through the violinist and wished to appear to know all about them “he’s not taking up medicine by any chance or literature you know if you want any help about examinations cottard can do anything and i make what use of him i please as for the academy later on for i suppose he’s not old enough yet i have several notes in my pocket your friend would find himself on friendly soil here and it might amuse him perhaps to see over the house life’s not very exciting at doncières but you shall do just what you please then you can arrange what you think best” she concluded without insisting so as not to appear to be trying to know people of noble birth and because she always maintained that the system by which she governed the faithful to wit despotism was named liberty “why what’s the matter with you” she said at the sight of m verdurin who with gestures of impatience was making for the wooden terrace that ran along the side of the drawingroom above the valley like a man who is bursting with rage and must have fresh air “has saniette been annoying you again but you know what an idiot he is you have to resign yourself to him don’t work yourself up into such a state i dislike this sort of thing” she said to me “because it is bad for him it sends the blood to his head but i must say that one would need the patience of an angel at times to put up with saniette and one must always remember that it is a charity to have him in the house for my part i must admit that he’s so gloriously silly i can’t help enjoying him i dare say you heard what he said after dinner ‘i can’t play whist but i can the piano’ isn’t it superb it is positively colossal and incidentally quite untrue for he knows nothing at all about either but my husband beneath his rough exterior is very sensitive very kindhearted and saniette’s selfcentred way of always thinking about the effect he is going to make drives himcrazy come dear calm yourself you know cottard told you that it was bad for your liver and it is i that will have to bear the brunt of it all” said mme verdurin “tomorrow saniette will come back all nerves and tears poor man he is very ill indeed still that is no reason why he should kill other people besides even at times when he is in pain when one would like to be sorry for him his silliness hardens one’s heart he is really too stupid you have only to tell him quite politely that these scenes make you both ill and he is not to come again since that’s what he’s most afraid of it will have a soothing effect on his nerves” mme verdurin whispered to her husband

   one could barely make out the sea from the windows on the right but those on the other side shewed the valley now shrouded in a snowy cloak of moonlight now and again one heard the voices of morel and cottard “you have a trump” “yes” “ah you’re in luck you are” said m de cambremer to morel in answer to his question for he had seen that the doctor’s hand was full of trumps “here comes the lady of diamonds” said the doctor “that’s a trump you know my trick but there isn’t a sorbonne any longer” said the doctor to m de cambremer “there’s only the university of paris” m de cambremer confessed his inability to understand why the doctor made this remark to him “i thought you were talking about the sorbonne” replied the doctor “i heard you say tu nous la sors bonne” he added with a wink to shew that this was meant for a pun “just wait a moment” he said pointing to his adversary “i have a trafalgar in store for him” and the prospect must have been excellent for the doctor for in his joy his shoulders began to shake rapturously with laughter which in his family in the ‘breed’ of the cottards was an almost zoological sign of satisfaction in the previous generation the gesture of rubbing the hands together as though one were soaping them used to accompany this movement cottard himself had originally employed both forms simultaneously but one fine day nobody ever knew by whose intervention wifely professorial perhaps the rubbing of the hands had disappeared the doctor even at dominoes when he got his adversary on the run and made him take the double six which was to him the keenest of pleasures contented himself with shaking his shoulders and when — which was as seldom as possible — he went down to his native village for a few days and met his first cousin who was still at the handrubbing stage he would say to mme cottard on his return “i thought poor rené very common” “have you the little deear” he said turning to morel “no then i play this old david” “then you have five you have won” “that’s a great victory doctor” said the marquis “a pyrrhic victory” said cottard turning to face the marquis and looking at him over his glasses to judge the effect of his remark “if there is still time” he said to morel “i give you your revenge it is my deal ah no here come the carriages it will have to be friday and i shall shew you a trick you don’t see every day” m and mme verdurin accompanied us to the door the mistress was especially coaxing with saniette so as to make certain of his returning next time “but you don’t look to me as if you were properly wrapped up my boy” said m verdurin whose age allowed him to address me in this paternal tone “one would say the weather had changed” these words filled me with joy as though the profoundly hidden life the uprising of different combinations which they implied in nature hinted at other changes these occurring in my own life and created fresh possibilities in it merely by opening the door upon the park before leaving one felt that a different ‘weather’ had at that momerit taken possession of the scene cooling breezes one of the joys of summer were rising in the fir plantation where long ago mme de cambremer had dreamed of chopin and almost imperceptibly in caressing coils capricious eddies were beginning their gentle nocturnes i declined the rug which on subsequent evenings i was to accept when albertine was with me more to preserve the secrecy of my pleasure than to avoid the risk of cold a vain search was made for the norwegian philosopher had he been seized by a colic had he been afraid of missing the train had an aeroplane come to fetch him had he been carried aloft in an assumption in any case he had vanished without anyone’s noticing his departure like a god “you are unwise” m de cambremer said to me “it’s as cold as charity” “why charity” the doctor inquired “beware of choking” the marquis went on “my sister never goes out at night however she is in a pretty bad state at present in any case you oughtn’t to stand about bareheaded put your tile on at once” “they are not frigorifie chokings” said cottard sententiously “oh indeed” m de cambremer bowed “of course if that’s your opinion    ” “opinions of the press” said the doctor smiling round his glasses m de cambremer laughed but feeling certain that he was in the right insisted “all the same” he said “whenever my sister goes out after dark she has an attack” “it’s no use quibbling” replied the doctor regardless of his want of manners “however i don’t practise medicine by the seaside unless i am called in for a consultation i am here on holiday” he was perhaps even more on holiday than he would have liked m de cambremer having said to him as they got into the carriage together “we are fortunate in having quite close to us not on your side of the day on the opposite side but it is quite narrow at that point another medical celebrity doctor du boulbon” cottard who as a rule from ‘deontology’ abstained from criticising his colleagues could not help exclaiming as he had exclaimed to me on the fatal day when we had visited the little casino “but he is not a doctor he practises ‘a literary medicine it is all fantastic therapeutics charlatanism all the same we are on quite good terms i should take the boat and go over and pay him a visit if i weren’t leaving” but from the air which cottard assumed in speaking of du boulbon to m de cambremer i felt that the boat which he would gladly have taken to call upon him would have greatly resembled that vessel which in order to go and ruin the waters discovered by another literary doctor virgil who took all their patients from them as well the doctors of salerno had chartered but which sank with them on the voyage “goodbye my dear saniette don’t forget to come tomorrow you know how my husband enjoys seeing you he enjoys your wit your intellect yes indeed you know quite well he takes sudden moods but he can’t live without seeing you it’s always the first thing he asks me ‘is saniette coming i do so enjoy seeing him’” “i never said anything of the sort” said m verdurin to saniette with a feigned frankness which seemed perfectly to reconcile what the mistress had just said with the manner in which he treated saniette then looking at his watch doubtless so as not to prolong the leavetaking in the damp night air he warned the coachmen not to lose any time but to be careful when going down the hill and assured us that we should be in plenty of time for our train this was to set down the faithful one at one station another at another ending with myself for no one else was going as far as balbec and beginning with the cambremers they so as not to bring their horses all the way up to la raspelière at night took the train with us at douvilleféterne the station nearest to them was indeed not this which being already at some distance from the village was farther still from the mansion but la sogne on arriving at the station of douvilleféterne m de cambremer made a point of giving a ‘piece’ as françoise used to say to the verdurins’ coachman the nice sensitive coachman with melancholy thoughts for m de cambremer was generous and in that respect took rather ‘after his mamma’ but possibly because his ‘papa’s’ strain intervened at this point he felt a scruple or else that there might be a mistake — either on his part if for instance in the dark he were to give a you instead of a franc or on the recipient’s who might not perceive the importance of the present that was being given him and so he drew attention to it “it is a franc i’m giving you isn’t it” he said to the coachman turning the coin until it gleamed in the lamplight and so that the faithful might report his action to mme verdurin “isn’t it twenty sous is right as it’s only a short drive” he and mme de cambremer left us at la sogne “i shall tell my sister” he repeated to me “that you have choking fits i am sure she will be interested” i understood that he meant ‘will be pleased’ as for his wife she employed in saying goodbye to me two abbreviations which even in writing used to shock me at that time in a letter although one has grown accustomed to them since but which when spoken seem to me today even to contain in their deliberate carelessness in their acquired familiarity something insufferably pedantic “pleased to have met you” she said to me “greetings to saintloup if you see him” in making this speech mme de cambremer pronounced the name ‘saintloupe’ i have never discovered who had pronounced it thus in her hearing or what had led her to suppose that it ought to be so pronounced however it may be for some weeks afterwards she continued to say ‘saintloupe’ and a man who had a great admiration for her and echoed her in every way did the same if other people said ‘saintlou’ they would insist would say emphatically ‘saintloupe’ whether to teach the others an indirect lesson or to be different from them but no doubt women of greater brilliance than mme de cambremer told her or gave her indirectly to understand that this was not the correct pronunciation and that what she regarded as a sign of originality was a mistake which would make people think her little conversant with the usages of society for shortly afterwards mme de cambremer was again saying ‘saintlou’ and her admirer similarly ceased to hold out whether because she had lectured him or because he had noticed that she no longer sounded the final consonant and had said to himself that if a woman of such distinction energy and ambition had yielded it must have been on good grounds the worst of her admirers was her husband mme de cambremer loved to tease other people in a way that was often highly impertinent as soon as she began to attack me or anyone else in this fashion m de cambremer would start watching her victim laughing the while as the marquis had a squint — a blemish which gives an effect of wit to the mirth even of imbeciles — the effect of this laughter was to bring a segment of pupil into the otherwise complete whiteness of his eye so a sudden rift brings a patch of blue into an otherwise clouded sky his monocle moreover protected like the glass over a valuable picture this delicate operation as for the actual intention of his laughter it was hard to say whether it was friendly “ah you rascal you’re in an enviable position aren’t you you have won the favour of a lady who has a pretty wit” or coarse “well sir i hope you’ll learn your lesson you’ve got to eat a slice of humble pie” or obliging “i’m here you know i take it with a laugh because it’s all pure fun but i shan’t let you be illtreated” or cruelly accessory “i don’t need to add my little pinch of salt but you can see i’m revelling in all the insults she is showering on you i’m wriggling like a hunchback therefore i approve i the husband and so if you should take it into your head to answer back you would have me to deal with my young sir i should first of all give you a pair of resounding smacks well aimed then we should go and cross swords in the forest of chantepie”

   whatever the correct interpretation of the husband’s merriment the wife’s whimsies soon came to an end whereupon m de cambremer ceased to laugh the temporary pupil vanished and as one had forgotten for a minute or two to expect an entirely white eyeball it gave this ruddy norman an air at once anaemic and ecstatic as though the marquis had just undergone an operation or were imploring heaven through his monocle for the palms of martyrdomembed"
