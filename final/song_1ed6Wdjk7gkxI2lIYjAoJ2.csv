i really was born at 929 am on 929
you think im lying but im im being dead serious i gotta see this birth certificate
okay ill prove it

verse
well who am i im almost twentyfive
cant remember half the time that ive been alive
cause half was in a cheap apartment
and half was on the eastside eastside
they said dont meet your heroes theyre all fuckin weirdos
and god knows that they were right
because nobody loves you they just try to fuck you
then put you on a feature on the bside
and who do you call when its late at night
when the headlines just dont paint the picture right
when you look at yourself on a screen and say
oh my god theres no way thats me
and i i quit smoking well recently ive tried
and i bought another house and i never go outside
and i remember this girl with pink hair in detroit
well she told me
she said ashley you gotta promise us that you wont die
cause we need you and honestly i think that she lied
and i remember the names of every single kid ive met
but i forget half the people who ive gotten in bed
and ive stared at the sky in milwaukee
and hoped that my father would finally call me
and its just these things that im thinkin for hours
and im pickin my hair out in clumps in the shower
lost the love of my life to an ivory powder
but then i realize that im no higher power
that i wasnt in love then and im still not now
and im so happy i figured that out
ive got a long way to go until selfpreservation
think my moral compass is on a vacation
and i cant believe i still feed my fucking temptation
im still looking for my salvation

soft and slow watch the minutes go
count out loud so we know you dont keep em for yourself
watch the minutes go
count out loud so we know you dont keep em for yourself

interlude
i think i have a confession to make so we know you dont
i need to say that i was really born at 926
i saw my birth certificate and im a liar
and im a fucking liar

outro
soft and slow watch the minutes go
count out loud so we know you dont keep em for yourself24embed"
