verse 1
i must have been a fool
to love you so hard for so long
so much stronger than before
but so much harder to move on
and now the bitter chill of the winter
still blows through me like a plague
only to wake up with an empty bed
on a perfect summer day ooh

prechorus
my world just feels so cold
and you find yourself
walking down the wrong side of the road ooh

chorus
i cant lie youre on my mind
stuck inside my head
i wanna feel your heart beat for me instead yeah
i just die so much inside
now that youre not there
i wanna feel your heartbeat like yesterday
