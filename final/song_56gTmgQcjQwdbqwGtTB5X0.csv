im thinking bout you loving me kissing me touching me

verse 1
i promised you id take you out
enjoy your night out on the town
light dinner and some champagne
you deserve the best of the finer thangs
girl tonight you couldnt look any better
amazingly irresistable
i can see it in my mind baby you and i

weve been dancing all night long
wanna hold you in my arms
girl its time that we get gone

way that we be doing our thang
when we be doing it
we should be making love

most gorgeous lady in the room
i know you can feel all eyes are on you
i think they all are a little envious
of this chemistry that we share between us
so i dont wanna come off disrespectful
but i cant keep my hands off of you
girl im all over your love and if i can lay it down
then right here on the ground id start making love to you
