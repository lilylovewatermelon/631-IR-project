verse 1
we are awakened with the axe
night of the living dead at last
they have begun to shake the dirt
wiping their shoulders from the earth
i know i know the nations past
i know i know they rust at last
they tremble with the nervous thought
of having been at last forgot

speaking their names they shake the flag
waking the earth it lifts and lags
we see a thousand rooms to rest
helping us taste the bite of death
i know i know my time is passed
i’m not so young i’m not so fast
i tremble with the nervous thought
of having been at last forgot
