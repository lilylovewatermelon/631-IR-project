who wouldve thought that you could hurt me
the way youve done it
so deliberate so determined
and since you have been gone
i bite my nails for days and hours
and question my own questions on and on

prechorus shakira
so tell me now tell me now
why youre so far away
when im still so close

chorus shakira
you dont even know the meaning of the words im sorry
you said you would love me until you die
and as far as i know youre still alive baby
you dont even know the meaning of the words im sorry
im starting to believe it should be illegal
to deceive a womans heart

verse 2 shakira
i tried so hard to be attentive
to all you wanted
always supportive always patient
what did i do wrong
been wondering for days and hours
its clear it isnt here where you belong
you might also likeprechorus shakira
anyhow anyhow
i wish you both all the best
i hope you get along

chorus shakira
you dont even know the meaning of the words im sorry
you said you would love me until you die
and as far as i know youre still alive baby
you dont even know the meaning of the words im sorry
im starting to believe it should be illegal
to deceive a womans heart
