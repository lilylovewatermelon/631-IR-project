do you feel the same when im away from you ooooh ooooh
do you know the line that id walk for you ooooh ooooh
we could turn around or we could give it up
but well take what comes take what comes

verse 2
oh the storm is ragin against us now ooooh ooooh
if youre afraid of falling then dont look down ooooh ooooh
but we took the step oh we took the leap
and well take what comes take what comes

prechorus
feel the wind in your hair
feel the rush way up here

we couldnt be higher up

verse 3
theres nights we had to just walk away ooooh ooooh
and theres tears well cry but those tears will fade ooooh ooooh
