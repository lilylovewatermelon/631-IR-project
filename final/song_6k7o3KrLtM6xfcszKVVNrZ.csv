starin at her number i wont call
yeah and even though its all your fault

im thinking all about the things you said
that shit is on repeat inside my head
makin me feel like a fool
every sacrifice i made for you
for you yeah

starting over is hard to do
cause starting over is without you
alright i cant keep pretending im fine

can you live without me
baby when they doubt me
tell me do you doubt me
yeah and even though this shit is all your fault
baby when they call
silence to em all

cause all these women wanna see me fall yeah
they dont know me like you do
