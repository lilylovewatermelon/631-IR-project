i wake up every evenin
with a big smile on my face
and it never feels outta place
and youre still probably workin
at a 9 to 5 pace
i wonder how bad that tastes

when you see my face hope it gives you hell hope it gives you hell
when you walk my way hope it gives you hell hope it gives you hell

and wheres that shiny car
and did it ever get you far
you never seemed so tense love
ive never seen you fall so hard
yeah do you know where you are

and truth be told i miss you
and truth be told im lyin

when you see my face hope it gives you hell hope it gives you hell
