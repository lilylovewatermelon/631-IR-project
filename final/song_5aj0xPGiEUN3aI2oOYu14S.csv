i’ll never settle down
that’s what i always thought
yeah i was that kind of man
just ask anyone

chorus
i don’t dance but here i am
spinning you round and round in circles
it ain’t my style but i don’t care
i’d do anything with you anywhere
yes you got me in the palm of your hand
cause i don’t dance

verse 2
love’s never come my way
i’ve never been this far
cause you took these two left feet
and waltzed away with my heart

chorus
no i don’t dance but here i am
spinning you round and round in circles
it ain’t my style but i don’t care
i’d do anything with you anywhere
yes you got me in the palm of your hand girl
cause i don’t dance
