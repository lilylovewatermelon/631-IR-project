let me let me let me let me let me let me love you tonight
cause im a real speed racer so i gotta get to know you alright
gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme lovin tonight
well shes a real cool sister but im thinking shes a little uptight

chorus
shes aware that i gave her the look
im surprised at the time that it took
but its fine that im just comin off
after all
she knows

verse 2
baby let me tell you what i think is gonna happen tonight
im gonna be a keen chaser never letting you get out of my sight
name another reason why i shouldnt be your lover tonight
well you can tell the speed racer but hes putting up a hell of a fight

chorus
shes aware that i may take the move
i feel bad for the guys in the room
they think i get my hopes up too soon
but i dont
shes not
