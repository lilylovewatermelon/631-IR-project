verse 1
gotta get it through my thick head
i was so close to being dead yeah
life live it with nobodys help tips
man im just walking without being led
see the world is so crazy and filled with such risk and man
i just know i gotta dodge them yeah
the beginning is always followed by an end
in the inbetween time im not runnin or hidin

prechorus
see things do come around
and make sense eventually
things do come around
but some things trouble me

chorus
the people ive met and the places ive been
are all what make me the man i so proudly am
but i wanna know one thing
when did i become a ghost
im most confused about the world i live in
you think that im lonely well i probably am
one thing that still gets me
when did i become a ghost

verse 2
tried to fight it but soon that gave in
went down a road with no lights on
cant describe it and you dont move like them
you become their worst nightmare
you remember the things that your parents had said and well
rather find out the hard way
you should tell a friend to tell a friend to tell a friend
i keep with my stroll im not runnin or hidin

prechorus
see things do come around
and make sense eventually
things do come around
but some things still trouble me

chorus
the people ive met and the places ive been
are all what make me the man i so proudly am
but i wanna know one thing
when did i become a ghost
im most confused about the world i live in
you think that im lonely well i probably am
one thing that still gets me
when did i become a ghost
yeah
