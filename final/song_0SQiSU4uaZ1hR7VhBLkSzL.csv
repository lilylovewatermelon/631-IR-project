i can hear that rooster crowing down the road
i felt my eyes open up real slow and i looked around making sure i hadnt checked out
because there was an angel lying next to me
and i figured heavens where i must be oh but it was you and baby what else could i do
in that bed i said a little prayer for one more day im still here

chorus
its your world and im just in it aint no other way to spin it
lucky me just being there when i get to hold you
im just here to love you girl its your world and im just passing through

verse 2
i dig in my heels and try to slow this down
i want my life to revolve around everything you do aw but thats all up to you
everything good seems to go so fast its kinda like one big party crash
you werent counting on one day youre here and gone
baby all i wanna do is lay right here and hope it all dont disappear

chorus
its your world and im just in it aint no other way to spin it
lucky me just being there when i get to hold you
im just here to love you girl its your world and im just passing through
its your world and im just in it aint no other way to spin it
lucky me just being there when i get to hold you
im just here to love you girl its your world and im just passing through
im just here to love you girl its your world and im just passing throughsee jason aldean liveget tickets as low as 41you might also like1embed"
