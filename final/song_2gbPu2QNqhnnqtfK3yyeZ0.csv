here from the kings mountain view
here from the wild dream come true
feast like a sultan i do
on treasures and flesh never few

chorus
but i i would wish it all away
if i thought id lose you just one day

verse 2
the devil and his had me down
in love with the dark side id found
dabblin all the way down
up to my neck soon to drown
but you changed that all for me
lifted me up turned me round

chorus
so i i i i
i would i would i would wish this all away

verse 3
prayed like a martyr dusk to dawn
begged like a hooker all night long
tempted the devil with my song
and got what i wanted all along
see tool liveget tickets as low as 64you might also likechorus
but i i would
if i could then i would
wish it away wish it away
wish it all away
wanna wish it all away
no prize that could hold sway
or justify my giving away my center

verse 4
so if i could id wish it all away
if i thought tomorrow would take you away
you my peace of mind my all my center
just tryin to hold on one more day
damn my eyes damn my eyes
damn my eyes if they should compromise the fulcrum
if wants and needs divide me then i might as well be gone

shine on forever
shine on benevolent sun
shine down upon the broken
shine until the two become one
shine on forever
shine on benevolent sun
shine down upon the severed
shine until the two become one
divided withering away
divided withering away
shine down upon the many
light our way benevolent sun
outro
breathe in union breathe in union
breathe in union breathe in union
breathe in union so as one survive
another day and season
silence legion save your poison
silence legion stay out of my way26embed"
