you always watch me leave
you swore youd stick around and have a dance with me
you never dance with me
wont you please be my little honey slider
ill leave you out to dry ill leave you out on the wire
why would you get up and walk out on me
you always walk on me
you swore youd stick around and have a drink with me
you never drink on me
wont you please be my little honey slider
ill leave you out to dry ill leave you out on the wire
at the very least
im gonna find you
