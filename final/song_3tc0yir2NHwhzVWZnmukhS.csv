jacqueline was seventeen working on a desk
when ivor peered above a spectacle forgot that he had wrecked a girl
sometimes these eyes forget the face theyre peering from
when the face they peer upon
well you know that face as i do and how in the return of the gaze
she can return you the face that you are staring from
