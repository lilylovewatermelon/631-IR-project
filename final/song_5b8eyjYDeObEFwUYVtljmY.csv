chuva chuvinha vem vem vem ca rapaz
chuva chuvinha vem vem ca rapaz

verse 1
this is not political its just that i i
demand attention when i walk into a room
and its not that i cant play ball hard its just that i dont want to
and the more i think about this pressure love i dont want you
and i cant have you and thats what hurts the most
i cannot show you these things i boast
ill throw my heart out keep my head up i cannot fuck up cause

chorus
i i got what you need boy baby i do
but i will only cause you pain yeah i promise that
i i got what you need boy baby i do
but i will only bring on the rain

verse 2
so ill prefer to run this road rough around the edges
good for something but too good to give it to you
you run your own course at your own pace but i just got impatient
see i wanted to explore
forsake you forsook you abate you dissipate you
so turn fate around i believed that i was free of you not
i still believe in those days on benches at sunset or the waves in july  or was it march
we weathered weathers and storms real and imagined such fragile tenderness
you are truly blessed
i stress this as i blow you this kiss as i blow it in the wind mwah
see nelly furtado liveget tickets as low as 1538you might also likechorus
i i got what you need boy baby i do
but i will only cause you pain yeah i promise that
i i got what you need boy baby i do
but i will only bring on the rain

verse 3
they say time is made of memories
well i remembered and im tired
this is not political
its just that i remember the fire
babe you left me with my head held high and
i feigned to be more than i was didnt i
i thought i could do without sugar love
but this chocolate has turned into sweet bubble gum
candy is sweet but honey is sweeter
it tastes like the real thing but candy is much much cheaper cheaper
chorus
i i got what you need boy baby i do
but i will only cause you pain yeah i promise that
i i got what you need boy baby i do
but i will only bring on the rain
rain afallin down rain afallin down hahaha
rain afallin down rain afallin down hahaha
rain afallin down rain afallin down hahaha
time crying youll be crying im sorry i made you cry
