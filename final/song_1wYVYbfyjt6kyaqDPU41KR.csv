i can remember the good old days where you and me we used to hide away
where the stars were shining or the sun was blinding our eyes
yeah you filled up my glass with promises that could never last
but i still find pieces of you in the back of my mind

prechorus
and all of the things that we once said
theyre not in my heart theyre in my head
that was the time to say goodbye
lets put it to rest yeah let it die

chorus
cause we dont we dont need to talk about this now
yeah weve been down that road before
that was then and this is now
the crowds in my heart theyve been calling out your name
now it just dont feel the same
guess its over yeah were done

verse 2
i heard you made your way downtown to the place id been hanging around
i was looking for your face in the crowd but trying to keep my head down
over time our wires crossed when you changed and the truth got lost
all the things i would change if we could only rewind
you might also likeprechorus
you were a moment in life that comes and goes
a riddle a rhyme that no one knows
a change of the heart a twist of fate
couldnt fix it its too late

chorus
cause we dont we dont need to talk about this now
yeah weve been down that road before
that was then and this is now
the crowds in my heart theyve been calling out your name
now it just dont feel the same
guess its over yeah were done
