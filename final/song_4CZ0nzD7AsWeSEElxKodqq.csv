i miss the quarter
the magnolias and the pontchartrain
french market on a saturday
ill miss the feel of this place
i miss the bayou sunrise
the mardi gras and the second lines
bourbon jazz sidewalk kids
with bottle cap taps dancing for tips

chorus
but im leaving new orleans
theres too much of you in this town
your memory is like moss in the trees
every corner its just hanging around
well the big easy aint so easy
hard to say it but baby come morning
ill be rolling like the mississippi leaving new orleans

verse 2
well i like highways
so maybe la is the place for me
if i point these wheels toward the hollywood sign
all those miles to clear my mind
or i could watch a horse race on some bluegrass
where bourbons made
catch some rays in the sunshine state
hit seattle if i need a little rain

but im leaving new orleans
theres too much of you in this town
your memorys like moss in the trees
every corner its just hanging around
well the big easy aint so easy
hard to say it but baby come morning
ill be rolling like the mississippi leaving new orleans

bridge
i guess our good times have rolled away
well laissez les bons temps rouler

chorus
im leaving new orleans
theres too much of you in this town
your memory is like moss in the trees
every corner its just hanging around
well the big easy aint so easy
hard to say it but baby come morning

chorus
yeah im leaving new orleans
theres too much of you in this town
your memory is like moss in the trees
every quarter is just hanging around
well the big easy aint so easy
hard to say it but baby come morning
ill be rolling like the mississippi leaving new orleans
outro
yeah im leaving new orleans
goodbye new orleans
