mom im tired
can i sleep in your house tonight
mom is it alright
if i stay for a year or two

verse 2
mom ill be quiet
it would be just to sleep at night
and ill leave once i figure out
how to pay for my own life too

verse 3
mom would you wash my back
this once and then we can forget
and ill leave what im chasing
for the other girls to pursue

outro
