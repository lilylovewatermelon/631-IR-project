who gives a fuck about an oxford comma
ive seen those english dramas too theyre cruel
so if theres any other way to spell the word
its fine with me with me

chorus 1
why would you speak to me that way
especially when i always said that i
havent got the words for you
all your diction dripping with disdain
through the pain i always tell the truth

verse 2
who gives a fuck about an oxford comma
i climbed to dharamsala too i did
i met the highest lama
his accent sounded fine to me to me

prechorus 1
take your handbook its no trick
take the chapstick put it on your lips
crack a smile adjust my tie
know your boyfriend unlike other guys

chorus 2
why would you lie bout how much coal you have
why would you lie about something dumb like that
why would you lie bout anything at all
first the window then its to the wall
lil jon he always tells the truth
see vampire weekend liveget tickets as low as 73you might also likeinstrumental bridge

prechorus 2
check your passport its no trick
take the chapstick put it on your lips
crack a smile adjust my tie
know your butler unlike other guys

chorus 3
why would you lie bout how much coal you have
why would you lie about something dumb like that
why would you lie bout anything at all
first the window then its to the wall
why would you tape my conversations
show your paintings at the united nations
lil jon he always tells the truth30embed"
