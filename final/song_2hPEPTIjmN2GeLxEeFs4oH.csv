feel me come on

next time yall try to compare
remember i just turned 18
that means i got 7 years to catch up
so whats up
next time yall underestimate me dont do that
recognize i just turned 18
that means i got 7 years to catch up

i brush the dirt off my shoulder
push through the city in an all pearl rover
one day i wanna be just like my nigga hova
but they dont wanna let me
haters they been hatin
sayin what i cant be
but imma stay up on they bumper
keeping the radios jumpin all summer
havin your girl screamin just to take a picture
im settin up my features
my bank accounts reachin
and everybodys peeking

this is a funny situation
these guys i grew up havin crazy admiration for
got the feelin that im tryna replace them
that aint the case
im in a whole nother place
tryna build my estate
i gotta keep my meggies nice and clean
keep the women up to 25 chasin me
got mr davis pushin buttons in the captains seat
that means more dough before im too old
and basically before

they been tryna critcize
but you cant live your life through another niggas eyes

imma fall back and let my young boy blow

next time yall try to compare me
