heres that part again where everythings more than it should be
and greener seems to fall beneath your feet
seconds tick like boulders whenever you dont call
does it seem like that where you are
wherever it is you are does it seem like that where you ahare
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

verse 2 rob cantor
time for time together and depending on the weather
well either argue in your house or outside
how different i felt before i got this notch on my belt
cause in my plans you were all for me
yeah but now it seems that youd just rather leave

chorus rob cantor zubin sedghi
wherever you go is breaking me slowly
dont leave it alone dont leave it alone
you sound so much further on the phone
you fit just right right next to me
but theres always a reason why it cant be

verse 3 rob cantor
telephones make you seem miles away from home
all alone i get a little meaner
i leave a message at your tone and miles away from home
you get a little cleaner of me
and i find a little greener shade of envy

wherever you go is breaking me slowly
dont leave it alone dont leave it alone
you sound so much further on the phone
you fit just right right next to me
but theres always a reason why it cant be
