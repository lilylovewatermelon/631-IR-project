just for now
just for now

chorus
its that time of year
leave all our hopelessnesses aside
if just for a little while
tears stop right here
i know weve all had a bumpy ride
im secretly on your side

verse 1
how did you know
its what ive always wanted
could never have had too many of these
will you quit kicking me under the table
im trying will somebody make her shut up about it
can we settle down please

chorus
its that time of year
leave all our hopelessnesses aside
if just for a little while
tears stop right here
i know weve all had a bumpy ride
im secretly on your side
see kelly clarkson liveget tickets as low as 275you might also likebridge
bite tongue
deep breaths
count to ten
nod your head

verse 2
i think something is burning
now youve ruined the whole thing
muffle the smoke alarm
whoever put on this music
better quick sharp remove it
pour me another
dont wag your finger at me

chorus
its that time of year
leave all our hopelessnesses aside
if just for a little while
tears stop right here
i know weve all had a bumpy ride
im secretly on your side

bridge
get me get me outta here
get me get me outta here
get me outta here
