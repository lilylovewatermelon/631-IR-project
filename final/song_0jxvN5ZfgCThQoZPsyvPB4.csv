warned the people about the ways of sin
he said go out yonder to the water and travel
cause disciples they were fishers of men
yeah disciples they were fishers of men

so i got me a job on the first boat rowin
and its been a mighty long time
since i sat in the house of my father and my mother
or i seen that woman of mine
yeah that good lovin gal of mine

i said babe im agoin on a little bitty journey
ill be back when the fishin is through
while im waitin in case get ready
for when jesus comes for you
when the good lord comes for you
when jesus comes for you
here it comes

sayin shall we gather by the water
the beautiful water
shall we gather by the water
that flows from the throne of god

truth it lies in the love of a woman
lord dont sink this boat
i got a pretty little thing waitin in new orleans
with a dagger by her throat
she dont wanna do it but shes that crazy
and if i dont make it back
shell probably die alone and cold
as the creole night turns black
see tyler childers liveget tickets as low as 39you might also likesayin shall we gather by the water
the beautiful water
shall we gather by the water
that flows from the throne of god

shall we gather by the water
the beautiful water
shall we gather by the water
that flows from the throne of godembed"
