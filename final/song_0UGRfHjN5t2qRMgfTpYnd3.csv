saw you today after so much time
felt just like it used to be
talking for hours bout a different life
surrounded us in memories
we were close never close enough
where are we now
cause if its torn we can stitch it up
dont rule it out
oh no no

chorus
ill come around
if you ever want to be in love
im not waiting but im willing if you call me up
if you ever want to be in love
ill come around

verse 2
wanted to ask if we could have been
but my tongue wouldnt break the seal
you always had something effortless
at school you were the biggest deal
little quirks close and open up
time is slipping by
im always thinking bout the two of us
replay on my mind
always playing on my mind

ill come around
if you ever want to be in love
im not waiting but im willing if you call me up
if you ever want to be in love
ill come around

bridge
we were young we were side by side
dont know when we started losing touch
if you want we could walk around
maybe that would be enough
used to talk drinking to the night
i would wake up on the front room floor
all alone youd be in my bed
make me crazy make me want you more

chorus
ill come around
if you ever want to be in love
im not waiting but im willing if you call me up
ill come around
if you ever want to be in love
im not waiting but im willing if you call me up
if you ever want to be in love
ill come around17embed"
