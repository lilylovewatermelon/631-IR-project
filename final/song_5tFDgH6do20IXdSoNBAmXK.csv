verse 1
first of all let me say
you cant accuse me of all the things
you know that you are guilty of
and i see
that it is easy for you to blame everything on me
if thats the case i should go have my fun
and do all the things you say i do
boy i cant continue to take this from you

chorus
i might as well have cheated on you you
as much as you accused me of cheatin
i might as well have lied to you
as much as you accused me of lyin
