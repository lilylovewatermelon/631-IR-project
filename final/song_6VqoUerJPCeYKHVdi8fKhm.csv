got it all figured out inside of my head
theres a bag packed up at the foot of my bed
you say the word baby im all set
well cover our tracks tell a couple white lies
make sure we got a good alibi
and by the time they catch on well be outta their sight
long gone baby

chorus
lets get out of this town tonight
nothing but dust in the shadows
gone by morning light
somewhere we wont ever get caught ever be found
baby lets just get out of this town

verse 2
dont need directions dont need a map
if we get lost ill be good with that
yeah well find a way to make the time pass
windows rolled down with the heat on high
stars all aligned in a runaway sky
holding my hand as the miles roll by
long gone baby

chorus
lets get out of this town tonight
nothing but dust in the shadows
gone by morning light
somewhere we wont ever get caught ever be found
baby lets just get out of this town
see carrie underwood liveget tickets as low as 94you might also likebridge
if we leave tonight and drive fast enough
all of our troubles will be just like us
long gone baby

chorus
lets get out of this town tonight
nothing but dust in the shadows
gone by morning light
somewhere we wont ever get caught ever be found yeah
lets get out of this town tonight
lets get out of this town tonight
yeah we wont ever get caught ever be found
baby lets just get out of this townembed"
