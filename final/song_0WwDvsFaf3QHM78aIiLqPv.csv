i dont mind it i dont mind at all
its like youre the swing set and im the kid that falls
its like the way we fight the times i cry
we come to blows and every night
the passions there so its gotta be right right

chorus
no i dont believe you
when you say dont come around here no more
i wont remind you
you said we wouldnt be apart
no i dont believe you
when you say you dont need me anymore
so dont pretend to
not love me at all

verse 2
i dont mind it i still dont mind at all
its like one of those bad dreams when you cant wake up
it looks like youve given up youve had enough
but i want more no i wont stop
cause i just know youll come around right

chorus
no i dont believe you
when you say dont come around here no more
i wont remind you
you said we wouldnt be apart
no i dont believe you
when you say you dont need me anymore
so dont pretend to
not love me at all

just dont stand there and watch me fall
cause i cause i still dont mind at all
its like the way we fight the times i cry
we come to blows and every night
the passions there so its gotta be right right

chorus
no i dont believe you
when you say dont come around here no more
