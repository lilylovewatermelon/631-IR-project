have you ever seen crocodile seats in the truck
turn around and sit it down and let em bite your butt
see the steerin wheel is fendi dashboard armani
with your baby momma players where you can find me
cruisin through the parkin lot on twentyfours
cadillac escalade with the chromedout nose
with an navigation arrow headed straight to your spot turn left
where your wife really love me cause the sex is so hot
put the caddy up start the 3wheel benz skrtt
hyper white lights ultraviolet lens
sumitomo tires and they gotta be run flat
tv where the horn go uh uh boy can you top that
ima show you some shit rookie press that button
the trunk went uhuh and all of a sudden
four 15s didnt see no wires
and then i heard boom from the amplifiers

in a cadillac truck twentyfours with tens

six bad broads flyin in at nine
new suburban truck with the porno showin
up and down and up they goin
bodies on the roadster lexus you know what
that hardtop bimmer yo ma thats your truck
im comin up the hood been lovely
new shoes on the whip and i wake up to bubbly
430 lex with the convertible top
and the rims keeps spinning every time i stop
got a superman benz that i scored from shaq
with a old school caddy with a diamond in the back
chorus mannie fresh

aint got no job but i stay shive i stay shive
cant pay my rent cause all my moneys spent
but thats okay cause im still fly
got a quarter tank of gas in my new e class
but thats alright cause im gon ride
