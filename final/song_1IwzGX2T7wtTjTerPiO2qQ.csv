here we are

verse 1
can you tell that story its my favorite one
you fucking disappointment i cant entertain you anymore
these stupid states of mind
everyone punishing me all the time why
but dont cross your boundaries and think that its cool
misguided by darkness and lost on the road

prechorus
but im such a sucker for the rain
chorus
here we are
crashing once again into the center of your moonlit face
our caved in ribs
your tears they fall on my tongue
and our lips are letting go
as we laid on the side of the road go

verse 2
pull the trigger tight and watch our distances explode explode
if texas is forever wheres your home sweet home
if anything should happen to me i want you to know
ive loved you since ever since then
dont dance around me i know what it means
no communication cannot be received
see pierce the veil liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likeprechorus
but im such a sucker for the rain yeah
oh

chorus
here we are
crashing once again into the center of your moonlit face
our caved in ribs
your tears they fall on my tongue
and our lips are letting go
as we laid on the side of the road

breakdown
dont chase your nightmares
yeah

chorus
here we are
crashing once again into the center of your moonlit face
our caved in ribs
your tears they fall our lips are locked in lemon groves
and i can never let them never let them grow
on the side of the road

outro
so take a deep breath and chase it with mine
your southern hospitality wont mind8embed"
