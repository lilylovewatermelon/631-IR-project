i was just a lonely girl
looking for a little fun
though without a friend in the world
i was forced to find a new one

chorus
now im the queen of mars
i was invisible on earth
it only took a magic portal to mars
to give me some self worth

verse 2
you put a crown on my head
and you all seem to worship me
but you dont understand a word i said
still you treat me like royalty

chorus
cause im the queen of mars
i was invisible on earth
it only took a magic portal to mars
to give me some self worth
cause im the queen of mars
i was invisible on earth
it only took a magic portal to mars
to give me some self worth ohhyou might also likeembed"
