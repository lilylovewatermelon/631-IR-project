what have i missed living like this
whod think id get this far
fancy house and my fancy car

why you living like this
together as kids
you were my best of friend
all the trouble you got up in

hook
see i been there
and i been scared
i been discriminated against and compared
to you whose my brother
thanks to you i discovered
theres only one way to go in life
and thats be right

chorus
theres only one way to do right right right right
theres only one way to do right right right right

see me i aint always done right right right right
thats why im here to help you fight fight
to do right

you were the queen in my future
i was the one you was used to
it was like we were one
up under the sun

and narcotics in your system
the love i should have i missed it
now look what weve become
but i shouldnt judge

repeat hook

repeat chorus

bridge
cause in life
there are decisions to make
but its your choice
but i chose to walk away rather than wilding out
and get locked away

see my friends all chose the fast money
but i chose my father
cause i knew hed come for me
and recover me already dead
see what im trying to say is
im trying to be the best man i can be
and when i see you too
struggling to do the best you can do

you may run into a rock
but you cant let it stop whats planned for you
so make the right choice

repeat chorus 2xembed"
