verse 1 jayz
heres a couple of suggestions of how you could finesse it
you find a dude in town you send him a short message
say hey im new in town i dont know my way around
but i got some soft white thats sure to come back brown
i get that butter all night
cause most niggas dont know a brick from a bite
they keep buying hard white
and if you free tomorrow night we can meet and discuss price
fyi i never been robbed in my life
or  you find a chick shit you hole up in her crib and
let her introduce you round town like her man
shake hands make friends like its all innocent
then  before they look up you sellin the town cookup
or  gorilla pimp come up on that killer shit
take a nigga brick smack him then you sell it back to them
still there brooklyn

stash dough whip yay with right amount of bake ho
