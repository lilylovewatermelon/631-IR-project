gotta keep it on the down low
ill never let my mama know
only call him on my cell phone
only see him after dark
i met him on the six train
just the way he said my name
the brother had a lotta game
had me open from the start
he scoops me up in his ride
friday about a quarter to nine
so fly and so fine and im so glad that hes all mine
chorus rihanna
theres a thug in my life
how am i gonna tell my mama
shes gonna say it aint right but hes so good to me
theres a thug in my life
and its gonna cause crazy drama
im gonna see him tonight
im gonna give him everything
verse 2 rihanna
i know his crews kinda shady
sometimes it gets kinda crazy
but he treats me like a lady
gives me everything i need
i dont care whos hating on me
cause every night hes waiting on me
hes got mad personality a side they never see
my friends tell me to slow down
but every time that hes around
my hearts on lock down
i feel love and im so proud
