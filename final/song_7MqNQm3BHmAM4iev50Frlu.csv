you left me drowning in the tears of memory
and ever since youve gone ive found it hard to breathe
cause there was so much that your heart just couldnt see
a thousand wasted dreams are rolling off my eyes
but times been healing me and i say goodbye

cause i can breathe again dream again
ill be on the road again
like it used to be the other day
now i feel free again so innocent
cause someone makes me whole again for sure
ill find another you

could you imagine someone else is by my side
ive been afraid he couldnt keep myself from falling
my heart was always searching for a place to hide
could not await the dawn to bring another day
youre not the only one so hear me when i say
the thoughts of you they just fade away

cause i can breathe again dream again
ill be on the road again
like it used to be the other day
now i feel free again so innocent
cause someone makes me whole again for sure
ill find another you
see cascada liveget tickets as low as 83you might also likesometimes i see you when i close my eyes
youre still a part of my life

but i can breathe again dream again
ill be on the road again
like it used to be the other day
now i feel free again so innocent
cause someone makes me whole again for sure
ill find another you

oh ill find another youembed"
