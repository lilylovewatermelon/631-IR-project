but im wishing id stayed
in the back room something i heard you say
we didnt want to call it too early
now it seems a world away
but i miss the thing are we ever gonna feel the same
standing in the light till its over
out of our minds
someone had to draw a line
well be coming back for you one day
well be coming back for you one day
i dont even care if i know you
out of our minds
got to leave it all behind
well be coming back
well be coming back for you one day
you can see it from afar
we were riding that wave
blinded by the lights and its something not great
we didnt want to call it too early
now it seems a world away
but i miss the thing are we ever gonna feel the same
standing in the light till its over
out of our minds
someone had to draw a line
well be coming back for you one day
well be coming back for you one day
i dont even care if i know you
out of our minds
got to leave it all behind
well be coming back for you one day
well be coming back for you one day
gonna rise gonna fall getting pulled apart
and we all do it all cause it stole our hearts
gonna light up the skies or ignore the stars
and we all do it all cause it stole our hearts
standing in the light till its over
out of our minds
someone had to draw a line
well be coming back for you one day
well be coming back for you one day
i dont even care if i know you
out of our minds
got to leave it all behind
well be coming back for you one day
well be coming back for you one daysee example liveget tickets as low as 44you might also likeembed"
