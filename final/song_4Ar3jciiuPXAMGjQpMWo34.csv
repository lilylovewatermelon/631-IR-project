i bet this time of night you’re still up
i bet you’re tired from a long hard week
i bet you’re sittin in your chair by the window
looking out at the city and i bet
sometimes you wonder bout me

chorus
and i just wanna tell you
it takes everything in me not to call you
and i wish i could run to you
and i hope you know that
every time i don’t i almost do i almost do

verse 2
i bet you think i either moved on or hate you
‘cause each time you reach out there’s no reply
i bet it never ever occurred to you
that i can’t say hello to you and risk another goodbye

chorus
and i just wanna tell you
it takes everything in me not to call you
and i wish i could run to you
and i hope you know that
every time i don’t i almost do i almost do

oh we made quite a mess babe
it’s probably better off this way
and i confess babe
in my dreams you’re touching my face
and asking me if i want to try again with you
and i almost do

chorus
and i just wanna tell you
it takes everything in me not to call you
and i wish i could run to you
and i hope you know that
every time i don’t i almost do i almost do

outro
i bet this time of night you’re still up
i bet you’re tired from a long hard week
i bet you’re sittin in your chair by the window
looking out at the city and i hope
sometimes you wonder bout me19embed"
