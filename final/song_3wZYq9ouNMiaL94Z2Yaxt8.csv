i must be on my way
before i pass this way again
be many a dark dark day

the sheriff does not know my face
he does not know my name
but before the sun goes down again
hell know them just the same

one kiss before i leave you
and one more for the wind
everyday i hope and pray
to be with you again

between a poor mans word and a rich mans gold
whos chances would you choose
the judge and jury close their eyes
and justice dont come true

ill run from what i havent done
cause the long arm of the law
has got a silver spade thatll dig my grave
in fort smith arkansas

one kiss before i leave you
and one more for the wind
everyday i hope and pray
to be with you again
see the steeldrivers liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likedown along the railroad tracks
waitin in the weeds
the first freight train to the leave the yard
will be the one for me

ill find a place on the box car roof
where the wind cuts cold and deep
i dont know need no rail road man
to catch me in my sleep

one kiss before i leave you
and one more for the wind
everyday i hope and pray
to be with you againembed"
