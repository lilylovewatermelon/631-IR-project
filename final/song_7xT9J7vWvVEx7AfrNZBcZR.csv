this state im in
a place ive never been
im dyin to meet you here
come break this skin
ill let you sink right in
and show you everything
see you in hell

chorus
well gather round the fire
and i will lead the choir
sing farewell
see you in hell

verse 2
come break my spell
well drown the wishin well
well find some time to kill
ill be right there
the buzz inside your head
the whole electric chair
see you in hell

well gather round the fire
and i will lead the choir
sing farewell
