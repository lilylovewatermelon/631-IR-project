i was so high i did not recognize
the fire burning in her eyes
the chaos that controlled my mind
whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
never to return again
but always in my heart

chorus
this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
and her heart is breaking in front of me
i have no choice cause i wont say goodbye anymore
whoa whoa whoa

verse 2
i tried my best to feed her appetite
keep her coming every night
so hard to keep her satisfied
keep playing love like it was just a game
pretending to feel the same
then turn around and leave again

chorus
this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
and my heart is breaking in front of me
i have no choice
i wont say goodbye anymore

this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
and my heart is breaking in front of me
i have no choice
cause i wont say goodbye anymore
this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
and my heart is breakin in front of me
she said goodbye too many times before

outro until fade
oh yeah yeah yeah
oh oh oh hey yeah
oh oh ohembed"
