when you change your point of view to underfoot
very good
you may be flat but youre breathing

and theres no doubt hes at home in his room
probably watching porn of you from the fall
its last call

and youre the last one leaving
and you thought you could change the world
by opening your legs
well it isnt very hard
try kicking them instead
and you thought you could change his mind
by changing your perfume to the kind his mother wore
o god delilah why
i never met a more impossible girl

in this same bar where you slammed down your hand
and said “amanda im in love”
no youre not
youre just a sucker for the ones who use you
and it doesnt matter what i say or do
the stupid bastards gonna have his way with you
you might also likeyoure an unrescuable schizo
or else youre on the rag
if you take him back
im gonna lose my nerve
i never met a more impossible girl
i never met a more impossible girl

at four oclock he got off
and you called up
“im down at dennys on route 1
and you wont guess what hes done”
is that a fact delilah
larry tap let you in through the back
and use his calling card again
for a quick hand of gin

you are impossible delilah the princess of denial
and after 7 years in advertising you are none the wiser

youre an unrescuable schizo
or else youre on the rag
cause if you take him back
im gonna lose my nerve
hes gonna beat you like a pillow
you schizos never learn
and if you take him home
youll get what you deserve
so dont cry delilah
youre still alive delilah
you need a ride delilah
lets see how fast this thing can goembed"
