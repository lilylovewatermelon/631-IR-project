memories consume like opening the wound
im picking me apart again
you all assume im safe here in my room
unless i try to start again

prechorus
i dont want to be the one the battles always choose
cause inside i realize that im the one confused

chorus
i dont know whats worth fighting for or why i have to scream
i dont know why i instigate and say what i dont mean
i dont know how i got this way i know its not alright
so im breaking the habit
im breaking the habit tonight

verse 2
clutching my cure i tightly lock the door
i try to catch my breath again
i hurt much more than anytime before
i had no options left again

prechorus
i dont want to be the one the battles always choose
cause inside i realize that im the one confused

i dont know whats worth fighting for or why i have to scream

so im breaking the habit
im breaking the habit tonight

bridge
ill paint it on the walls
cause im the one at fault
ill never fight again
and this is how it ends

chorus
i dont know whats worth fighting for or why i have to scream
but now i have some clarity to show you what i mean
i dont know how i got this way ill never be alright
