said the plain clothes cop to the beauty queen
ive seen nothing but a spoke in a wheel
so she gave up her crown to a kid with a crutch
and they both felt cheated after closing the deal

and the white tooth man i ran with him
got all cut up from pissing out in the weeds
and a fight upstate with a broken blade
and a wife whose finger never wanted a ring

verse 2
said the plain clothes cop to the indian chief
ive made nothing but an honest mistake
the postman cried while reading the mail
and we all got trampled in the christmas parade

and the white tooth man who sold me a gun
a map of canaan and a government bond
said i love this town but it aint the same
the ski mask ripped as he was puttin it on

verse 3
said the plain clothes cop to the holy ghost
ive heard nothing if it wasnt the wind
and we all got sick on a strip club meal
while the statehouse was frying all the witches again
see iron  wine liveget tickets as low as 60you might also likeso the white tooth man with his kids in the car
and a wad of money that was already spent
said i love my dog but she just ran away
shell keep running like the world never endsembed"
