i dont wanna talk
about things weve gone through
though its hurting me now its history
ive played all my cards
and thats what youve done too
nothing more to say no more ace to play

chorus 1
the winner takes it all
the losers standing small
beside the victory
thats her destiny

verse 2
i was in your arms
thinking i belonged there
i figured it made sense building me a fence
building me a home
thinking id be strong there
but i was a fool playing by the rules

chorus 2
the gods may throw the dice
their minds as cold as ice
and someone way down here
loses someone dear
the winner takes it all takes it all
the loser has to fall has to fall
its simple and its plain it seems plain
why should i complain why complain
you might also likeverse 3
but tell me does she kiss
like i used to kiss you
does it feel the same when she calls your name
somewhere deep inside
you must know i miss you
but what can i say rules must be obeyed

chorus 3
the judges will decide they decide
the likes of me abide we abide
spectators of the show of the show
always staying low staying low
the game is on again on again
a lover or a friend or a friend
a big thing or a small big or small
the winner takes it all takes it all

verse 4
i dont wanna talk
if it makes you feel sad
and i understand youve come to shake my hand
i apologise
if it makes you feel bad
seeing me so tense no selfconfidence
bridge
but you see the winner takes it all
the winner takes it all

outro
so the winner
takes it all
and the loser
has to fall
throw a dice
cold as ice
way down here
someone dear
takes it all
has to fall
it seems plain
why complain18embed"
