oh its music to my ears oh man
how can i describe the way i feel
fucking great man
okay let me see
how could i begin

verse 1
locked in mariahs wine cellar all i had for lunch
was bread wine more bread wine and captain crunch
red wine for breakfast and for brunch
and to soak it up an inbetween snack crackers to munch
mariah whats ever happened to us
why did we have to break up
all i asked for was a glass of punch
you see i never really asked for much
i cant imagine whats going through your mind after such
a nasty breakup with that latin hunk
luis miguel nick cannon better back the fuck up
im not playin i want her back you punk
this is hello kitty bedspread satin funk
mixed with egyptian with a little rap and punk
zapp and eric clapton shaft frank zappa crunk
and yeah baby i want another crack at ya
you can beat me with any spatula that you want
i mean i really want you bad you cunt
nick you had your fun ive come to kick you in your sack of junk
man i could use a fresh batch of blood
so prepare your vernacular for dracula acupuncture

bagpipes from baghdad
when will it ever cease
for petes sakes hes crazy to say the least
bagpipes from baghdad
whats going through my mind
half the time when i rhyme or blowing up like
bagpipes from baghdad
somebody turn the vacancy sign on
cause im gone blowing on my
bagpipes from baghdad
i run the streets and act like a madman holding a glad—

verse 2
you can be a permanent fixture in my lyrical mixture
im the miracle whip trickster
my signature sound when a tube of lipsticks around
im bound to put it on in an instant wow
man what an ensemble
what an assortment of pharma–ceuticals
this beautiful pill dust in my palm my
cuticles get residue just from touchin the bottle
never knew i could remind me so much of my momma
ill cut ya like dahmer pull a butcher knife on ya
the size of a sword boy im like the fuckin red sonja
get it stuck in your cornea nice knowing ya norman
youre so fuckin annoyin drop the shovel boy
you dont know what the fuck youre doin
i aint playin no fuckin more
nick cannon you prick i wish you luck with the fuckin whore
every minute theres a sucker born snuck up on malachai
made the motherfucker suck on a shuck of corn
shuck o shuck o corn chaka khan
hit jason in the face with a hockey puck and
told him its fuckin on man what the fuck are ya doin
youre runnin over the snowblower with the lawnmower
blowin your bagpipes from baghdad
chorus
bagpipes from baghdad
when will it ever cease
for petes sakes hes crazy to say the least
bagpipes from baghdad
whats going through my mind
half the time when i rhyme or blowing up like
bagpipes from baghdad
somebody turn the vacancy sign on
cause im gone blowing on my
bagpipes from baghdad
i run the streets and act like a madman holding a glad bag

verse 3
in the bed with two braindead lesbian vegetables
i bet you they become heterosexual
nothing will stop me from molestin you
tittyfuckin you til your breast nipple flesh tickles my testicles
is what i said to the two conjoined twins
hows it going girlfriends you needs a boyfriend
you need some ointment just set up an appointment
whos gonna see the doctor first well do a coin flip
i just got my oneyear sobriety coin chip
when the bad get going how bad does the going get
baby you shouldnt have any trouble rubbing groins with
each other especially when youre joined at the hip
im going to get the needle and thread from the sewing kit
and attempt to separate em and stitch em back at the loin shit
lure the little boy with the chocolate chips ahoy chip
cookie lookie even took me a polaroid pic
chorus
bagpipes from baghdad
when will it ever cease
for petes sakes hes crazy to say the least
bagpipes from baghdad
whats going through my mind
half the time when i rhyme or blowing up like
bagpipes from baghdad
somebody turn the vacancy sign on
cause im gone blowing on my
bagpipes from baghdad
i run the streets and act like a madman holding a glad bag
oh bagpipes from baghdad
