i brush my teeth and look in the mirror
and laugh out loud as im beaming from ear to ear
id rather pick flowers instead of fights
and rather than flaunt my style
id flash you a smile of clean pearly whites

chorus
ive been to the dentist a thousand times so i know the drill
i smooth my hair sit back in the chair
but somehow i still get the chills

verse 2
have a seat he says pleasantly
as he shakes my hand and practically laughs at me
open up nice and wide he says peering in
and with a smirk he says dont have a fit thisll just pinch a bit
as he tries not to grin
when hygienists leave on long vacations
thats when dentists scream and lose their patience
talking only brings the toothaches on
because i say the stupidest things
so if my resolve goes south
ill swallow my pride with an aspirin and shut my mouth
golf and alcohol dont mix
and thats why i dont drink and drive
because good grief id knock out my teeth
and have to kiss my smile goodbye

but somehow i still get the chills2embed"
