ya never know
some folks think the world just moves too slow
but was it you
who told me im your everything

chorus
you hit me like i never felt before
hit me like i never felt before
hit me like a sucker punch youre rotten to the core
you know you hit me like i never felt before
silly for the last time

verse 2
you never take
a promise from a man who sheds his skin
you had to wait
for my achin heart to break

chorus
you hit me like i never felt before
hit me like i never felt before
hit me like a sucker punch youre rotten to the core
you know you hit me like i never felt before
silly for the last time
see the goo goo dolls liveget tickets as low as 59you might also likebridge
now everyone gets angry
and i feel it when youre holdin me
in the right place at the right time to the right degree
its a breeding ground
for the pain ive found
from dealin with your scene
and you know that it aint easy
that aint easy
that aint easy
that aint easy

outro
hit me like i never felt before
hit me like i never felt before
hit me like i never felt before
hit me like i never felt before
im silly for the last timeembed"
