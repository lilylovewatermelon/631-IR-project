broken windows and empty hallways
a pale dead moon in the sky streaked with gray
human kindness is overflowing
and i think its going to rain today

verse 2
scarecrows dressed in the latest styles
with frozen smiles to chase love away
human kindness is overflowing
and i think its going to rain today

verse 3
bright before me the signs implore me
to help the needy and show them the way
human kindness is overflowing
and i think its going to rain today
