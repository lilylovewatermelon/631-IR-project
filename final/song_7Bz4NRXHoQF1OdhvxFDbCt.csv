i got to breathe
you cant take that from me
cause its all that you left thats mine
and you had to leave
and thats all i can see
but you told me your love was blind

prechorus
i know there are times
youre so impossible that i should sign a waiver
and you will find
someone worth walkin on when you ask me to go

chorus
ill leave when the wind blows
take a breath there your heart goes
ill be outside of your window
ill pass by but ill go slow
ill leave when the wind blows

verse 2
there was a day
you threw our love away
then you passed it to someone new
you wanna stay
but since you wanna play
we can finally say were through

and i know there are times
youre so impossible and you ask me to go

chorus
ill leave when the wind blows
take a breath there your heart goes
ill be outside of your window
ill pass by but ill go slow
ill leave when the wind blows
you can scream theres just echoes
ill pass outside of your window
youll be sad that you let me go
ill leave but just know

bridge
as i lay in solitude
oh whats a boy supposed to do
i shake the very thought of you
and me together i remember
late nights when i stayed up late
all id do is wait and wait
youre never comin home to me
thats the hardest thing to see
thats the hardest thing to see
interlude
i got to breathe
you cant take that from me
but i can finally say were through

chorus
ill leave when the wind blows
take a breath there your heart goes
ill be outside of your window
ill pass by but ill go slow
ill leave when the wind blows
you can scream theres just echoes
ill pass outside of your window
youll be sad that you let me go
on every face youll ever know
and everywhere youll ever go
youll feel when the wind blows2embed"
