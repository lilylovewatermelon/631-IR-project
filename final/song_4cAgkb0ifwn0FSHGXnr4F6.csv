verse 1 kanye west
my mama was raised in the era when
clean water was only served to the fairer skin
doin clothes you wouldve thought i had help
but they wasnt satisfied unless i picked the cotton myself
you see its broke nigga racism
thats that dont touch anything in the store
and its rich nigga racism
thats that come in please buy more
what you want a bentley fur coat a diamond chain
all you blacks want all the same things
used to only be niggas now everybody playin
spendin everything on alexander wang
new slaves

refrain kanye west
you see its leaders and its followers
but id rather be a dick than a swallower
you see its leaders and its followers
but id rather be a dick than a swallower
see kanye west liveget tickets as low as 122you might also likeverse 2 kanye west
i throw these maybach keys
i wear my heart on the sleeve
i know that we the new slaves
i see the blood on the leaves
i see the blood on the leaves
i see the blood on the leaves
i know that we the new slaves
i see the blood on the leaves
they throwin hate at me
want me to stay at ease
fuck you and your corporation
yall niggas cant control me
i know that we the new slaves
i know that we the new slaves
im bout to wild the fuck out
im goin bobby boucher
i know that pussy aint free
you niggas pussy aint me
yall throwin contracts at me
you know that niggas cant read
throw on some maybach keys
fuck it cest la vie
i know that we the new slaves
yall niggas cant fuck with me
yall niggas cant fuck with ye
yall niggas cant fuck with ye
ill move my family out the country
so you cant see where i stay
so go and grab the reporters
so i can smash their recorders
see theyll confuse us with some bullshit
like the new world order
meanwhile the dea
teamed up with the cca
they tryna lock niggas up
they tryna make new slaves
see thats that privately owned prison
get your peace today
they prolly all in the hamptons
braggin bout what they made
fuck you and your hampton house
ill fuck your hampton spouse
came on her hampton blouse
and in her hampton mouth
yall bout to turn shit up
im bout to tear shit down
im bout to air shit out
now what the fuck they gon say now

az embereknek fájt a sötét
ő megsajnált eljött közénk
