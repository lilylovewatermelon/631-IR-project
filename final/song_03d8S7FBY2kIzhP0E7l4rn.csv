you say you need a couple credits fore theyll let you out of college
i bet you bought that beer with your daddys card
youre looking like you probably get a little tired of all this
attention that youre getting when you go to the bar

prechorus
we can take a different route
i know youre from a different town
but youre here for now
so whatcha say we get on out and see where this night leads

chorus
if i know me ill have you hopping up in my passenger seat
bet i take you home and you aint gonna wanna leave
make a little love at a quarter past three
gotta keep it down cause your roommates home
honey when the sun come peeking through the trees
you aint gotta worry bout what it might be
cause i bet it wont be the last time youre waking up next to me
if i know me if i know me woah woah

verse 2
this aint some routine that i use every friday
this aint a one line one night kiss and tell
but ever since i caught you looking over my way
all that i could do was tell myself
see morgan wallen liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likechorus
if i know me ill have you hopping up in my passenger seat
bet i take you home and you aint gonna wanna leave
make a little love at a quarter past three
gotta keep it down cause your roommates home
honey when the sun come peeking through the trees
you aint gotta worry bout what it might be
cause i bet it wont be the last time youre waking up next to me
if i know me woah woah

bridge
ooh ooh
and i could just change my mind
and leave my number in your phone ooh ooh
and give you a kiss goodnight
and go home alone

chorus
but if i know me ill have you hopping up in my passenger seat
bet i take you home and you aint gonna wanna leave
make a little love at a quarter past three
gotta keep it down cause your roommates home
honey when the sun come peeking through the trees
you aint gotta worry bout what it might be
cause i bet it wont be the last time youre waking up next to me
