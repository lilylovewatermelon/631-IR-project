repeats 1 time

the circle of life ground forms in the bss and holds its pattern for eight bars it is a nonchordal bs part the progressions are in the medium ranges of the strings  various pans and camera views of african animals all moving coinciding with the fs pickup in the eighth bar
we first view the giraffes panning to a long shot of all the animals in their procession


fs from the day we arrive on the planet
and blinking step into the sun
theres more to see than can ever be seen
more to do than can ever be done

camera is panning and jumping to elephants zebras ants birds storks etc 

theres far too much to take in here
more to find than can ever be found
but the sun rolling high
through the sapphire sky
keeps great and small on the endless round

when the the circle of life is mentioned the long distance pan centers on pride rock where all the animals are gathering mufasa is on pride rock long camera arc to mufasa and zazu
its the circle of life
and it moves us all

zazu bows to mufasa who smiles and nods at him

through despair and hope
through faith and love

appearance of rafiki the mandrill he passes between ranks of animals who bow to him he then climbs pride rock to where mufasa is standing

till we find our place
on the path unwinding

rafiki and mufasa embrace

in the circle
the circle of life

decrescendo in bs fs drops out pan flute takes simple lead

mufasa leads rafiki over to sarabi who is holding simba

rafiki puts the juice and sand he collects on simbas brow a ceremonial crown he then picks simba up and ascends to the point of pride rock mufasa and sarabi follow with a crescendo in the music and a restatement of the refrain rafiki holds simba up for the crowd to view

fs its the circle of life
the crowd starts howling stamping etc 

and it moves us all
through despair and hope
through faith and love

the clouds part and a sunbeam highlights rafiki and simba on pride rock

till we find our place

the crowd bows down one by one

on the path unwinding

camera slowly zooms out to a striking panoramic view of the presentation

in the circle
the circle of life

bass drum hit fff and immediate switch to black
screen with title the lion king in bloodred caps

visual fade into mouse in cave  mouse comes out and starts preening in the light begins sniffing becomes frightened suddenly a large lion paw swoops down and catches him

cue the scar theme dissonant slow reed theme fade in slowly and up full during speech

camera switch to scar holding the squeaking and struggling
mouse in his paw he talks to it while playing with it

scar lifes not fair is it you see i  well i shall never be
king exhale lightly and you shall never see the light of another day
closedmouth laughter starts to place the mouse on his extended tongue 
adieu quiet laugh

zazu  interrupting
didnt your mother ever tell you not to play with your food

scar light sigh the mouse is under his paw
what do you want

zazu im here to announce that king mufasa is on his way bows
so youd better have a good excuse for missing the ceremony this morning

the mouse runs away from scar

scar oh now look zazu youve made me lose my lunch

zazu hah youll lose more than that when the king gets
through with you hes as mad as a hippo with a hernia

scar oooh i quiver with fear

on fear scar crouches down and is baring his teeth at zazu

zazu very concerned
now scar dont look at me that way help

scar quickly pounces on the bird catching him in his mouth

mufasa almost immediately and offcamera
scar 

scar mouth full
mmhmm

mufasa drop him

zazu speaking from scars mouth through his emerged beak
impeccable timing your majesty

scar spits the bird out covered with saliva

zazu slimed eyyccch

scar sarcastically overjoyed
why if it isnt my big brother descending from on high to mingle with the commoners

mufasa sarabi and i didnt see you at the presentation of simba

scar faking astonishment
that was today oh i feel simply awful

he turns and start scraping his claws on the rock wall zazu cringes at the sound

scar admiring his claws
must have slipped my mind

zazu yes well as slippery as your mind is as the
kings brother you should have been first in line

scar clicks his teeth at zazu who has flown near his face zazu takes cover behind mufasas foreleg scar bends down to speak to him

scar well i was first in line until the little hairball was born

mufasa lowering his head and meeting scar eye to eye
that hairball is my son and your future king

scar ohh i shall practice my curtsy
scar turns away and starts to exit

mufasa warning dont turn your back on me scar

scar looking back oh no mufasa perhaps you shouldnt turn your back on me

mufasa roars and literally jumps in front of scar baring his teeth for the first time
is that a challenge

scar temper temper i wouldnt dream of challenging you

zazu pity why not

scar looking at zazu
well as far as brains go i got the lions share but when it comes to brute strength
looking at mufasa im afraid im at the shallow end of the gene pool

exit scar

zazu deep sigh
theres one in every family sire two in mine actually
perches on mufasas shoulder
and they always manage to ruin special occasions

mufasa what am i going to do with him

zazu hed make a very handsome throw rug

mufasa chiding zazu

zazu and just think whenever he gets dirty you could take him out and beat him

they exit chuckling pan out into open savannah

rise in music this land track with theme stated in african flute it broadens eventually with chorus and full orchestra we see a rainstorm gently crossing the savannah  multiplane camera approach to rafikis baobab tree camera switch to inside the tree rafiki is doing hand paintings on the wall we see he is completing a lion cub

rafiki mutters to himself in which the word simba can be heard
hmmm ah heh heh heh heh heh
completing the ceremonial crown in the painting
simba

horns and brass close theme in a stately manner with a decrescendo fade to black keeping the painting of the cub as a crossover to the fade in of pride rock in early morning

simba is seen coming out on the rock he runs back into the cave and leaps over several of the lionesses accidentally jumping on a few

simba dad daad come on dad we gotta go wake up

random lioness oomph

simba sorry oop
simba starts to wake mufasa

simba dad daad dad dad dad dad dad dad dad dad

sarabi over simbas endless noise of dads sleepily
your son is awake

mufasa also sleepily before sunrise hes your son

simba dad daad come on dad
tugs at mufasas ear daa whoa

he loses his grip on mufasas ear and slips and crashes into something off camera he then comes running back on screen and butts mufasa mufasa sleepily eyes his son

simba you promised

mufasa seeing his sons impatience
okay okay im up im up

simba yeah

mufasa yawns a wellrecorded lion yawn mufasa and sarabi follow simba up to the top of pride rock simba rubs up against sarabi she nudges him ahead and stays behind departing
shot of her with a loving expression the sunrise illuminates the top of pride rock impressively both simba and mufasa are on the point cue music

mufasa look simba everything the light touches is our kingdom

simba wow

the camera revolves around them during mufasas
speech from a reverse view to a frontal shot

mufasa a kings time as ruler rises and falls like the sun one day simba the sun will set on my time here and will rise with you as the new king

simba and this will all be mine

mufasa everything

simba everything the light touches
simba looks all around he views the riprap canyon to the north
what about that shadowy place

mufasa thats beyond our borders you must never go there simba

simba but i thought a king can do whatever he wants

mufasa oh theres more to being king than getting your way all the time
mufasa starts back down the rock

simba awed theres more

mufasa chuckles simba

camera switch mufasa and simba are out walking on the savannah

mufasa everything you see exists together in a delicate balance as king you need to understand that balance and respect all the creatures from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope

simba but dad dont we eat the antelope

mufasa yes simba but let me explain when we die our bodies become the grass and the antelope eat the grass and so we are all connected in the great circle of life

zazu lights on a nearby rock
good morning sire

mufasa good morning zazu

zazu checking in with the morning report

mufasa fire away

zazu well the buzz from the bees is that the leopards are in a bit of a spot

zazus speech will continue through without stop
simbas and mufasas conversation is the focus

mufasa distracted oh really

simba uninterested in zazu pounces at a grasshopper and misses

zazu continuing not noticing mufasas lack of enthusiasm
 and the baboons are going ape over this of
course the giraffes are acting like theyre above it all

mufasa to simba what are you doing son

simba disappointedly looking in his empty paws
pouncing

mufasa let an old pro show you how its done

zazu the tick birds are pecking on the elephants
i told the elephants to forget it but they cant

mufasa zazu would you turn around

zazu yes sire
continuing immediately
the cheetahs are hard up but i always say 

mufasa whispering stay low to the ground

zazu cheetahs never prosper

simba whispering okay stay low to the ground right yeah

zazu realizing something is amiss what going on

mufasa a pouncing lesson

zazu oh very good pouncing
realizing pouncing  oh no sire you cant be serious
mufasa motions for zazu to turn back around

zazu oh this is so humiliating

mufasa still whispering try not to make a sound

zazu what are you telling him mufasa
looking around uneasily simba and mufasa seem to have disappeared
mufasa simba
simba does a full pounce leaving zazu stunned on the ground

mufasa ha ha ha ha ha thats very good ha ha ha
a gopher emerges under zazu

gopher zazu

zazu exasperated yes

gopher saluting

mufasa to simba now this time

zazu interrupting and with urgency

simba oh dad cant i come

mufasa curtly no son
mufasa heads off at a full gallop

simba i never get to go anywhere

zazu oh young master one day you will be king then you can chase those slobbering mangy stupid poachers from dawn until dusk

they head off camera pulls back to wide view of savannah

camera change to scar on his overhanging rock ledge
we see scar pace once and kick an old bone off the edge  enter simba

simba hey uncle scar guess what

scar i despise guessing games

simba im going to be king of pride rock

scar sarcastically oh goody

simba looking out over the edge of the rock

scar interrupting

simba why not

scar simba simba im only looking out for the wellbeing of my favorite nephew
scar rubs and pats simbas head

simba snorts sarcastically
yeah right im your only nephew

scar all the more reason for me to be protective
an elephant graveyard is no place for a young prince
faking surprise oops

simba enthusiastic
an elephant what whoa

scar faking dismay
oh dear ive said too much well i suppose youd have
found sooner or later you being so clever and all
pulling simba near
oh just do me one favor promise me youll never visit that dreadful place

simba thinks no problem

scar theres a good lad you run along now and have fun and remember its our little secret

simba leaves the rock scar walks away with an evil smile  menacing music

simba is running down the slope of the bottom part of pride rock he runs down towards two lionesses sarabi and sarafina sarafina is giving nala a bath music is light almost jazzy pan flute lead

simba hey nala

nala hi simba

simba come on i just heard about this great place

nala through clenched teeth
simba im kind of in the middle of a bath

sarabi and its time for yours

simba tries too late to escape sarabi bends down and
grabs him she proceeds to give the struggling cub a bath

simba mom mom youre messing up my mane
sarabi smiles

simba okay okay im clean can we go now

nala so where are we going it better not be anyplace dumb

sarabi its all right with me
nala and simba are overjoyed

nala all right

simba yeah

sarabi as long as zazu goes with you
simba and nala stop dead in their celebration

simba no not zazu

camera is at a ground angle slightly behind the cubs walking towards the water hole zazu is visible in the sky overhead

zazu step lively the sooner we get to the water hole the sooner we can leave
camera angle changes to the cubs from an immediate real view

nala whisper so where we really going

simba whisper an elephant graveyard

nala wow

simba whisper shhh zazu

nala whisper right so how are we gonna ditch the dodo
camera switch to just above zazu we hear the cubs whispering back and forth below

simba whispering oh i know how we can

zazu flying down
oh just look at you two little seeds of romance
blossoming in the savannah your parents will be thrilled
he lands in front of them
what with your being betrothed and all

simba bewhat

zazu betrothed intended affianced

nala meaning

zazu as though holding on to his coat lapels
one day you two are going to be married

simba yuck

nala ewww

simba i cant marry her shes my friend

nala yeah itd be too weird

zazu well sorry to burst your bubble but you two turtle doves have no choice its a tradition
simba mimics zazu during these last words

zazu going back generations

simba well when im king thatll be the first thing to go

zazu not so long as im around

start fading in intro to i just cant wait to be king

simba well in that case youre fired

zazu hmmm nice try but only the king can do that
pokes simbas nose

nala well hes the future king

simba yeah thumping zazus chest
so you have to do what i tell you

zazu not yet i dont and with an attitude like that im
afraid youre shaping up to be a pretty pathetic king indeed

simba hmph not the way i see it

full song colors change to wild popafrican background
abruptly becomes surreal brightlycolored cartoon style

simba im gonna be a mighty king
so enemies beware

zazu well ive never seen a king of beasts
plucks simbas hair where mane would be
with quite so little hair

simba gets a mane of leaves
simba im gonna be the mane event
like no king was before
climbs a log
im brushing up on looking down
im working on my roar
on roar he shouts at zazu startling him backwards into a puddle

zazu drying on what appears to be a hanging towel
thus far a rather uninspiring thing

camera pulls back reveals the towel as the ear of a red elephant which hits zazu with its trunk as with a golf club sending him skipping like a stone across a shallow pool of water the cubs follow immediately

simba oh i just cant wait to be king

zazu speaking
youve rather a long way to go young master if you think

for this verse zazu is making quick spokenpart replies to each line simba and nala are on each side of zazu as he turns to talk to one the other makes faces at him

simba no one saying do this
zazu now when i said that i

nala no one saying be there
zazu what i meant was

simba no one saying stop that
zazu look what you dont realize

simba and nala no one saying see here
zazu now see here

simba free to run around all day
simba and nala are now riding ostriches
zazu well thats definitely out

simba free to do it all my way

zazu flying ahead of the cubs looking back to
speak to them and so not paying attention ahead
i think its time that you and i
arranged a heart to heart
flies into a rhino

simba kings dont need advice
from little hornbills for a start
lights on a branch

zazu if this is where the monarchy is headed
count me out
out of service out of africa
i wouldnt hang about aagh

the camera pulls back to reveal zazu has lighted on a log being washed towards a waterfall it disappears over the edge zazu yells in surprise but quickly reappears flying towards and through the camera

this child is getting wildly out of wing

simba oh i just cant wait to be king

the cubs trot up a corridor of zebras standing at attention  when zazu follows they all turn and raise their tails zazu covers himself with a wing

nala and simba dance about under a moving herd of elephants while the african flute leads a short instrumental sequence  zazu flies overhead looking for them simba ends up standing
on a giraffes head

everybody look left
zazu squawks as the herd tramples him
everybody look right
simba hops up a ladder of giraffe heads
everywhere you look im
sliding down a giraffes neck into theatrical pose
standing in the spotlight

zazu speaking but strict this time
not yet

chorus let every creature go for broke and sing
lets hear it in the herd and on the wing
its gonna be king simbas finest fling

the chorus of hippos anteaters antelopes giraffes etc forms a pyramid with the cubs on top

simba  chorus oh i just cant wait to be king
oh i just cant wait to be king
oh i just cant waaaaaait  to be king

end song

the pyramid topples leaving the rhino sitting on zazu

zazu muffled
i beg your pardon madam but get off   simba nala

camera change to simba and nala making their way away from zazu they are laughing

simba all right it worked

nala we lost im

simba arrogantly i am a genius

nala hey genius it was my idea

simba yeah but i pulled it off

nala with me

simba oh yeah rrarr

simba jumps at nala they tussle quickly nala ends on top and
pins simba with her forepaws producing a resounding thump

nala ha pinned ya

simba annoyed hey lemme up

nala turns away smiling simba looks at her and jumps at her again they tussle rolling down a short hill she pins him again in the same position with another thump

nala pinned ya again

a geyser makes a loud noise nearby ejecting steam  the camera pulls back to a view of the surroundings that the cubs have just noticed mostly in grays we see a dark craggy vale filled with skeletons of elephants eerie music

simba this is it we made it

they look over the edge of the ledge they are on a large bull elephant skull is nearby the camera follows to survey the entire bleak view

simba and nala whoa

nala its really creepy

simba yeah isnt it great

nala relishing her naughtiness
we could get in big trouble

simba enjoying it also i know huh

nala looking at the skull
i wonder if its brains are still in there

simba walking towards the skull
theres only one way to know come on lets go check it out

simba walks towards the mouth of the skull zazu flaps suddenly up in front of them emitting a sharp squawk of wrong and giving the audience a start

zazu the only checking out you will do will be to check out of here

simba aw man

zazu were way beyond the boundary of the pride lands

simba huh look banana beak is scared heh

zazu poking simba in the nose
thats mr banana beak to you fuzzy and right now we are all in very real danger

simba has moved nearer to the entrance of the skull
simba danger hah i walk on the wild side i laugh in the face of danger ha ha ha ha

following simbas confident laughter we hear more laughing from inside the skull simba runs back and hides behind nala and zazu three hyenas emerge from the skulls eyes and mouth

shenzi well well well banzai what have we got here

banzai hmm i dont know shenzi uh what do you think ed

ed crazy laughter
they circle around the cubs and zazu

banzai yeah just what i was thinking a trio of trespassers

zazu and quite by accident let me assure you a simple navigational error eh heh heh

shenzi whoa whoa wait wait wait i know you
peering close into the camera
youre mufasas little stooge

zazu i madam am the kings majordomo

banzai looking at simba
and that would make you

simba the future king

shenzi do you know what we do to kings who step out of their kingdom

simba puh you cant do anything to me

simba but zazu you told me theyre nothing but slobbering mangy stupid poachers

zazu aside surreptitiously to simba

shenzi what ed what is it

banzai looking where ed is pointing

banzai cause there it goes

camera view to the cubs running off they stop after a bit
quick camera jump showing zazu being caught in midflight

nala did we lose em

simba i think so wheres zazu
camera switch the hyenas have zazu near a steam vent banzai is holding the bird

banzai the little majordomo bird hippityhopped all the way to the birdieboiler
he walks zazu to the vent and stuffs him into it plugging it up

zazu oh no not the birdieboiler
it shoots him off in a puff of steam and the hyenas start laughing hysterically

simba now near the hyenas
hey why dont you pick on somebody your own size

shenzi like you

simba oops

the hyenas start chasing the cubs they dart around behind
them and poke their heads through an active methane vent

shenzi banzai ed boo laughter

the hyenas chase the cubs up and over the skull and the cubs slip away by sliding down the spine they shoot off the end of the spine and land on a hillside of bones

nala simba

simba turns around and is horrified to see nala slipping back down the pile

nala aaaaiee

simba runs bravely back and claws shenzi across the cheek drawing blood and distracting her while nala escapes shenzi becomes enraged the hyenas pursue the cubs quickly and corner them in a cave

 cut lines 

for a reason unknown to me the following line was cut  it appeared on story boards and even in the promotional pamphlet for the movie as well as on the first series of collectors cards bt it must have been cut fairly late in production

shenzi look boys a king fit for a meal



banzai entering the cave taunting here kitty kitty kitty
simba tries to roar he produces a nice medium yowl

shenzi oohoo that was it hah do it again come on

simba opens his mouth to roar again but we hear a full grown lion roar

shenzi banzai ed huh

mufasa charges the hyenas from camera left and
knocks them about until they are cringing under him

shenzi oh please please uncle uncle

banzai ow ow ow

mufasa half roar silence

banzai oh were gonna shut up right now

shenzi calm down were really sorry

mufasa if you ever come near my son again

shenzi oh this is this is your son

banzai no me iii didnt know it no did you

shenzi no of course not

banzai no

shenzi and banzai ed

ed stupidly nods yes
mufasa roars

banzai toodles

with a gunshot sound they disappear zazu lights in front of mufasa giving him a thatll show em nod but then withers under mufasas angry glare

simba approaching his father dad i

mufasa you deliberately disobeyed me

simba dad im im sorry

mufasa stern lets go home
they all start walking out of the burial grounds the cubs bent down in shame

nala whispering i thought you were very brave

the camera steadily pans up one of the walls of the cave it stops on a horrifying image of scar standing on a ledge where he had been watching the cubs neardemise

camera switch to out on the savannah the cubs are still walking in a shamed manner behind mufasa zazu is flying between

mufasa still stern zazu

zazu flying forward and lighting in front of mufasa his trepidation showing
yes sire

mufasa stern
take nala home ive got to teach my son a lesson

the camera views the cubs simba crouches lower in
the grass as if to hide zazu flies back to the cubs

zazu come nala simba
puts his wings on simbas shoulders gives a heavy sigh and then a reassuring pat
good luck

zazu and nala leave the camera view is of simba in the foreground with mufasa facing away from the camera in the background

mufasa calling still very stern not looking at simba
simba
the word reverberates in the night air

simba slowly turns and walks towards his father the camera follows him forward ominous yet sad music simba steps into a depression looking down he sees that his forepaw fits inside just the palmprint of his fathers paw a very tense moment for simba it comes across to the audience that his father could easily do much much more than discipline simba it also comes across that simba has some rather big shoes to fill so to speak and is only now realizing his true position bt simba is harshly reminded of how small and young he is compared to his father he looks up and quite courageously continues to come forward mufasa thinks silently for a few moments not looking at his son then finally he turns to him

mufasa simba im very disappointed in you

simba very quietly and sadly i know

mufasa continuing
you could have been killed you deliberately disobeyed
me and whats worse you put nala in danger

simba bordering on crying voice cracks
i was just trying to be brave like you

mufasa im only brave when i have to be simba
being brave doesnt mean you go looking for trouble

simba but youre not scared of anything

mufasa i was today

simba disbelieving you were

mufasa yes
bends down close to simba
i thought i might lose you

simba oh
lightening slightly
i guess even kings get scared huh

mufasa mmhmm

simba whispering conspiratorially
but you know what

mufasa whispering back what

simba i think those hyenas were even scareder

mufasa gentle laugh
cause nobody messes with your dad  come here you
mufasa has bent down he picks simba up and starts giving him a noogie

simba oh no no aaagh errrggh
music rises as simba and mufasa tussle playfully for a brief while

simba oh come here
as mufasa runs away
hah gotcha

they end up with mufasa laid down and simba on his head

simba dad

mufasa hmm

simba were pals right

mufasa gentle laugh right

simba and well always be together right

mufasa sitting up simba now on his shoulder
simba let me tell you something that my father told me look at the stars the great kings of the past look down on us from those stars

simba awed really

mufasa yes so whenever you feel alone just remember that those kings will always be there to guide you  and so will i

camera switch from stars to hyena cave as we move into the cave we first hear banzais voice and eventually see banzai and ed together with shenzi to the side

banzai man that lousy mufasa i wont be able to sit for a week
we notice numerous scratches on banzais rear

ed laughs

banzai its not funny ed

ed tries to stop laughing but bursts out worse

banzai hey shut up

ed cannot stop laughing  banzai tackles ed they start fighting

shenzi will you knock it off
banzai stops ed continues biting himself in the leg

banzai well he started it

shenzi look at you guys no wonder were dangling at the bottom of the food chain

banzai with drool dangling from his mouth

shenzi builds up hysterical laughter

scar sarcastic charmed

shenzi ohh i like that hes not king but hes still so proper

banzai yeah hey hey did ya bring us anything to eat
scar old buddy old pal huh didyadidyadidya

scar i dont think you really deserve this
holds out a zebra haunch
i practically giftwrapped those cubs for you
drops leg to hyenas
and you couldnt even dispose of them

start intro fadein on be prepared 

shenzi chewing with full mouth
well ya know it wasnt exactly like they was alone scar

banzai yeah what are we supposed to do
swallow kill mufasa

scar precisely

the three hyenas pause from eating and look up at scar questioningly

threetop flutter to coincide with scars leaps down to the hyenas

 cut lines 

due to plot adjustment the intro lines to the music track be prepared were cut they were originally a monologue of scar trying to decide on using the hyenas or not these were cut presumably to allow for the earlier entrapment of the cubs being credited to scar the monologue
does however appear on the soundtrack

scar spoken over what is now faded intro
i never thought hyenas essential
theyre crude and unspeakably plain
but maybe theyve a glimmer of potential
if allied to my vision and brain



scar walks calmly through sheets of flame and gas
into the camera over the opening bit of the song

scar
scar paces slowly around ed who is chewing on the remnants of the zebra leg

i know that your powers of retention
are as wet as a warthogs backside
but thick as you are pay attention

he angrily swats the bone away ed comes to abrupt attention

my words are a matter of pride
its clear from your vacant expressions
the lights are not all on upstairs
waving his paw in front of eds blank eyes to make his point eds tongue lolls out
but were talking kings and successions
even you cant be caught unawares

shenzi and banzai are laughing on a ledge behind him on you scar turns and leaps at them throwing them backward onto a pair of geysers which then erupt throwing the two hyenas into the air

in the next verse scar is strutting theatrically along a ledge which runs around back to the floor

so prepare for a chance of a lifetime
be prepared for sensational news
a shining new era
is tiptoeing nearer

shenzi
and where do we feature

scar grabbing shenzis cheek
just listen to teacher

shenzi rubs her cheek which is now bruised red

i know it sounds sordid
but youll be rewarded
when at last i am given my dues
and injustice deliciously squared

scar leaps up beside ed who is again chewing on the bone and here kicks him off the ledge

be prepared

the three hyenas land in a pile of bones and are submerged they reappear each with a different horned skull on his head

spoken
banzai yeah be prepared yeahheh well be prepared heh for what

scar for the death of the king

banzai why is he sick

scar grabs banzai by the throat
scar no fool were going to kill him and simba too
dropping banzai back onto the floor

shenzi great idea who needs a king

shenzi and then banzai singsong voices dancing around banzai
no king no king lalalalalaalaa

scar idiots there will be a king

banzai hey but you said uh

scar i will be king stick with me
triumphant toothy grin
and youll never go hungry again

shenzi and banzai yaay all right long live the king

camera reveals hundreds of more hyenas in the shadows
all hyenas long live the king long live the king

full song again

scars army of hyenas is goosestepping across the floor
of the cave now stylized into a naziesque quadrangle

hyenas in tight crisp phrasing and diction
its great that well soon be connected
with a king wholl be alltime adored

scar
of course quid pro quo youre expected
to take certain duties on board
motions a slice across the neck
the future is littered with prizes
and though im the main addressee
the point that i must emphasize is
leaps off his rock throne to single out one hapless hyena
you wont get a sniff without me

that hyena slips and falls into a fiery crevice  throughout the next verse the entire horde of hyenas joins in dancing boisterously leaping along the tops of rock pillars shaking animal skeletons in the light one playing a rib cagexylophone  the paranthetical parts are the hyenas counterpoint singing

so prepare for the coup of the century
oooh
be prepared for the murkiest scam
oooh la la la rear ends punctuating
meticulous planning
well have food
tenacity spanning
lots of food
decades of denial
we repeat
is simply why ill
endless meat
be king undisputed
aaaaaaah
respected saluted
aaaaaaah
and seen for the wonder i am
aaaaaaah

yes my teeth and ambitions are bared
oooooooooooooo
be prepared

all even ed who can be heard growling and snarling an approximation of the lines
yes our teeth and ambitions are bared
be prepared

close with a fillin and a fadeout scar and the hyenas are laughing evilly drum roll rises to a crash coinciding with the panoramic opening of the next scene  camera switch to a view of a large canyon cloud shadows scroll slowly over the landscape

scar now you wait here your father has a marvelous surprise for you
camera switch to bottom of the gully scar and simba are near a rock underneath a small tree

simba oooh what is it

scar if i told you it wouldnt be a surprise now would it

simba if you tell me ill still act surprised

scar ho ho ho you are such a naughty boy

simba come on uncle scar

scar nonononononono this is just for you and
your daddy you know a sort of fatherson thing

through simbas expression we see that he resents
scars dismissive attitude but soon shrugs it off

scar well id better go get him

simba ill go with you

scar loud snapping tone
no
regaining composure
heh heh heh  no just stay on this rock you wouldnt want to end up in another mess like you did with the hyenas

simba shocked
you know about that

scar simba everybody knows about that

simba meek and embarrassed really

scar oh yes lucky daddy was there to save you eh
clearly enjoying himself he puts a paw on simbas shoulder
oh and just between us you might want to work on that little roar of yours hmm

scar starts to pull away

simba oh okay

scar pats simba roughly on the head then moves off

simba hey uncle scar will i like the surprise

scar turning back over his shoulder
simba its to die for

the camera slowly pans up the side of the gorge away from scar and simba after a distance of rock we reach the edge and view on the plain a very large herd of wildebeest the size of the herd comes across with a striking computergenerated parallax pan the camera then focuses in on the hyenas shenzi banzai and ed who are waiting off of the edge of the herd hidden under a rock arch

banzai stomach growls

shenzi shut up

banzai i cant help it im so hungry
jumping up
i gotta have a wildebeest

shenzi stay put

banzai well cant i just pick off one of the little sick ones

shenzi no we wait for the signal from scar

camera switch to scar mounting a rock in view of the hyenas

shenzi there he is
making an evil almost humorous face
lets go

camera switch back to simba

simba little roar puh

a lizard walks past simba he growls at it

simba rarrr

the lizard has no reaction to this first attempt simba then jumps down and tries again

simba rrrraowrnh

for the third attempt simba moves closer again and inhales deeply

simba raowr

the lizard skitters off screen simbas roar echoes around the canyon shot of simba lifting his ears to relish the echo the echo is soon eclipsed however by a low rumble simba looks down and sees pebbles jumping cue the very sinister to die for music we see the herd coming over the lip of the gorge dramatic multilayer camera pull up to simbas terrified face simba takes off in front of the herd

cut to the rim of the gorge where the hyenas are seen chasing the wildebeest herd nipping at their heels to drive them over the edge camera switch to mufasa and zazu a short distance from the canyon

zazu oh look sire the herd is on the move

mufasa odd

scar runs up out of breath

scar mufasa quick stampede in the gorge simbas down there

mufasa simba

camera switch to simba he is running and climbs up a dead tree zazu flies ahead of mufasa and scar down into the canyon he spots simba

simba clinging precariously to a tree
zazu help me

zazu your father is on the way hold on

simba losing grip hurry

mufasa and scar are on the lower ledges of the gorge
zazu flies back to mufasa and points out where simba is

zazu there there on that tree

mufasa hold on simba

in the gully a wildebeest rams the tree simbas on nearly breaking it

simba ahhhh

mufasa runs out into the herd joining the stampede

zazu oh scar this is awful what will we do what will we do hah  ill go back for help thats what ill do ill go back for heoomph

scar backhands zazu into a rock wall knocking him out scar then follows mufasas progress from the lip of the gorge his shadow cast mysteriously from the bottom of the gully  mufasa runs with the herd till slightly past the tree he whips around the front of some wildebeest and runs into the herd towards simbas tree he gets rammed headfirst once throwing him to the ground a wildebeest hits simbas tree throwing simba into the air mufasa gets up in time to catch simba in the air with his mouth he gets hit again and accidentally throws simba simba dodges a few oncoming wildebeest mufasa runs by with the herd and grabs simba he jumps up to a near rock ledge and sets simba down but is immediately struck by a wildebeest and carried off into the stampede

simba dad

simba watches in horror as he cannot find his father in the swirling mass of wildebeest below him at the last second mufasa leaps out of the herd and starts to climb with great difficulty up the sheer rock slope simba turns and starts to climb up to the top of the gorge out of simbas sight mufasa reaches a point right below a ledge where he cant climb due to the steepness his claws are scraping and his back paws have no traction above him on the ledge is scar

mufasa scar broth
slips barely hangs on
brother help me

scar looks disdainfully down and then suddenly latches onto mufasas forepaws with claws extended mufasa roars primarily from the sudden pain of scars claws but no doubt also due to the sudden flash of realization his expression slowly changes to one of horror as he recognizes scars intent

scar slowly and evilly
long live the king

scar throws his brother backwards mufasa freefalls back first the camera follows mufasa down from under him then from above him showing the stampede raging below

mufasa aaaaaaahh

camera suddenly focuses in on simba who is watching his father hit the ground no sound effects of the hit no view of it either mufasa and simbas screams mingle

simba nooooooo

the herd passes everything is clouded by dust simba
bounds to the canyon floor mufasa is nowhere to be seen

simba cough dad

we hear a sound

simba quietly dad

we see a stray wildebeest run past the source of the sound the wildebeest curves around a log further down the gully under the log is mufasa laying on his side he is not moving or breathing simba approaches the body sad musical theme again we notice how small simba really is

simba hopefully
dad dad come on
he rubs up against mufasas cheek the head merely rolls back in place after the rub
you gotta get up
he places both forepaws on his fathers cheek and pushes
dad we gotta go home
he tugs at mufasas ear again the head limply moves
back in place simba runs off a bit obviously very scared
heeeeelp somebody
his voice reverberates hollowly off the sides of the gorge
anybody help

he cries simba turns back to the body he nuzzles up under
the limp paw so that his father is embracing him pause for effect

where the music would resolve we hit a minor chord as
the image of scar advancing appears through the dust

scar  simba what have you done

simba jumps back crying
there were wildebeests and he tried to save me
it was an accident i i didnt mean for it to happen

scar embracing simba yet still distant
of course of course you didnt no one ever means
pulls simba closer simba hides his face on scars foreleg
for these things to happen but the king is dead
looking with mock regret at simba
and if it werent for you hed still be alive
simba is crushed believing his guilt another thought occurs to scar
oh what will your mother think

simba sniffing what am i gonna do

scar run away simba run run away and never return

simba runs off blindly obviously broken slight pause for the audience to catch its emotional breath music ends the three hyenas appear behind scar

scar kill him

the hyenas take off after him scar stands motionless simba is chased up the entire length of the gully he reaches the lip only to see a sheer drop on the other side having no choice he jumps and tumbles down into a patch of briars below the hyenas pursue the entire way when the are running down towards the briars banzai sees them and recoils

banzai whoa

after skidding extensively banzai manages to stop just above the brambles he heaves a sigh of relief then shenzi and ed run into him propelling him into the bushes

banzai yeow jumping back out of the bushes
shenzi and ed are laughing

shenzi seeing simba emerge from the far side of the briars into the desert
hey there he goes there he goes

banzai removing thorns so go get im

shenzi there aint no way im going in there what you
want me to come out there looking like you cactus butt

banzai spitting out thorns into eds laughing face ed lets out a small yelp of pain
we gotta finish the job

shenzi well hes as good as dead out there anyway and if he comes back well kill him

banzai shouting
yeah you hear that if you ever come back well kill ya

kill ya echoes off as we see simba still running into the desert the hyenas make their way off the cliffs back to the pride lands  camera change to scar addressing the lionesses by the moon on pride rock

scar mufasas death was a terrible tragedy but to lose simba who had barely begun to live

camera pans around the lionesses some of them with zazu are comforting sarabi who bends her head in extreme pain nala is rubbing against her mothers paw crying

scar for me it is a deep personal loss so it is with a heavy heart that i assume the throne yet out of the ashes of this tragedy we shall rise to greet the dawning of a new era the hyenas start emerging casting eerie green shadows and laughing hollowly in which lion and hyena come together in a great and glorious future scar ascends pride rock as the hyenas appear in full force  the camera pans to rafiki who is shaking his head in the distance the scene changes with rafiki in the same position  he is in his tree house after wiping away a tear he reaches up and rubs his hand across the cub painting smearing it the camera changes the painting smeared is overlaid on simba laying out in the hot desert sun  buzzards are circling the cubs body one descends then all they circle around it with a blast of music timon riding pumbaa appears and dives into the midst of the buzzards they slap and kick the buzzards all away

timon yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaahh get out get out get outta here whoo

timon laughing dusting himself off

timon all righty what have we got here

timon jeez its a lion

timon yelling into pumbaas ear which creates a reverberating effect
pumbaa are you nuts were talking about a lion lions eat guys like us

he leans over to regard simba and accidentally dumps timon from his head

timon hes gonna get bigger

pumbaa seen from timons point of view on the ground with a huge nose

timon eating mouth full

slimy yet satisfying

timon grabbing a bug
these are rare delicacies mmmm

piquant with a very pleasant crunch

pumbaa youll learn to love em

timon has been collecting bugs on a leaf he offers it to simba simba picks out a grub

timon well kid

simba oh well hakuna matata
he eats  sick music

simba looking more cheerful
slimy yet satisfying

timon thats it

the bugs fly off the leaf in a colorful flutter  the scene switches to all three crossing a log walking and tossing their heads to the music with a steady build in the music a change occurs we see the image of young simba become an adolescent simba with a partial mane and then again simba becomes a full grown adult while the chanting of the title is happening the camera is panning at the low level 6 off ground where all the interaction between pumbaa timon and simba as a cub had been occurring first we see timon and then pumbaa the camera continues panning at a low angle to where the cub simba would fit instead we see the adult simbas paw come down an immediate back up for a full view of a big simba

pumbaa and timon chanting to music
hakuna matata hakuna matata hakuna matata

simba adult voice now
it means no worries
for the rest of your days

all three
its our problemfree
philosophy

simba
hakuna matata

all three dive off of the log into a pond first timon jumps in doing a cannonball and makes a small splash  then pumbaa doing a swan dive makes a small splash too finally simba swings out on a vine gripped in his teeth  before he can dive the vine breaks under his weight the
resulting splash is big enough to wash pumbaa and timon ashore

hakuna matata

simba joins timon and pumbaa on shore the song breaks into gentle jazz voice improvisations on the words hakuna matata we see a rear view of timon pumbaa and simba boogeying off into the forest to the beat of hakuna matata

the camera switches to a far view of pride rock almost all of the coloring is in gray most of the plants and trees appear to be dead we can hear zazus first line and then the scene switches to a view of zazu and scar zazu is in a cage made of some animals ribcage singing scar is laying out on a rock picking his teeth with a bone

zazu
nobody knows
the trouble ive seen
nobody knows
my sorrow

scar oh zazu do lighten up
he tosses the bone at zazu and it clatters against the cage
sing something with a little bounce in it

zazu thinks a moment

scar interrupting almost shouting
no no anything but that

zazu thinks then holds up a feather as a tune comes to him
ive got a lovely bunch of coconuts

timon breaks out laughing pumbaa joins in simba does halfheartedly

timon aw youre killing me simba

the music rises again simba looks back up at the stars  he quietly gets up and leaves

timon was it something i said

the music continues simba walks out on a ledge and looks up at the stars he then collapses to lay on the edge of the ledge milkweed floss is stirred into the air by his flop the camera follows its path it crosses the desert next we see rafikis hand snatch some it out of the air he sniffs it grunts and bounds down into his tree he pours the milkweed into a turtle shell sifts it around and then eats from the same kind of fruit he anointed simba with examining the milkweed floss again realization dawns on his face

rafiki simba hes hes alive he he hes alive he laughs

rafiki grabs his staff laughing in delight he picks up some
paint and puts a mane on the smeared lion image on the wall

rafiki it is time

the camera switches to a jungle scene we hear pumbaa singing the familiar bass to the lion sleeps tonight timon joins in as they walk towards the camera a capella

pumbaa singing
ohimbube
ohimbube

timon singing
in the jungle

pumbaa turns to follow a bug he fades out
the lion sleeps

left the following line is in full and good falsetto

aweeeeeeeeee bapumbabumbaway

realizing pumbaa is not there

apumbaa
pumbaa

camera switch to pumbaa following the bug he is still humming the bass he stalks the bug up to a log theatrically hiding behind a tree when he tries to jump over the log he gets stuck momentarily and looks back

pumbaa spooked
timon

looks around then shrugs  he jumps over the log as he views the bug at close range the camera at his viewpoint switches focus from it to a pair of green eyes out in the grass the camera closes up on a lioness getting ready to jump

pumbaa yeeeeaaahhh

he runs with the lioness in hot pursuit the lioness with teeth and claws bared chases pumbaa around at high speed camera switch to timon

timon hearing the noise of the chase
pumbaa
pumbaa runs near timon and gets stuck under the root of a tree by trying to squeeze through

timon pumbaa pumbaa hey whats goin on

timon gets up on the branch and sees the lioness charging at full speed towards them he gets down and tries to help push pumbaa out from under the root

timon seeing the lioness
woah  jeez why do i always have to save your aaaaaa

on the aaaaaa timon sees the lioness was about to close on pumbaa and he is in the line of attack at the last minute simba bounds over pumbaa and catches the lioness head on at full force they start fighting savagely

timon to pumbaa

the lions tangle for a bit more the fight becomes a wrestling the lioness flips simba and pins him with a loud thump simba is startled by this the lioness is still baring her teeth simba however is very surprised and no longer threatening

its like youre back from the dead you dont know how much this will mean to everyone pained expression
what it means to me

simba hey its okay

nala rubbing under simbas chin purring
ive really missed you

simba startled by nalas boldness for an instant then reciprocating
ive missed you too

they are rubbing heads we hear timon sigh
camera switch to show them watching from the bushes

timon heavy sigh i tell you pumbaa this stinks

pumbaa oh sorry

timon not you them him her alone

pumbaa whats wrong with that

start song  can you feel the love tonight  

parenthetical part is spoken by pumbaa

timon
i can see whats happening
what
and they dont have a clue
who
theyll fall in love and heres the bottom line
our trios down to two
oh

in a sarcastic mockfrench accent
ze sweet caress of twilight
back to normal but still sarcastic
theres magic everywhere
and with all this romantic atmosphere
disasters in the air

the scene passes from timon and pumbaa to simba and nala in front of a waterfall

fs
can you feel the love tonight
the peace the evening brings
the world for once in perfect harmony
with all its living things

after walking around each other taking in each
others movements they stop to drink at the water

simba
so many things to tell her
but how to make her see
the truth about my past impossible
shed turn away from me

nala
hes holding back hes hiding
but what i cant decide
why wont he be the king i know he is
the king i see inside

during the chorus the following occurs simba looks at nala smiles and runs off stage he runs back on stage grabs a vine in his mouth and splashes into the middle of the pond nala looks out over the still water suddenly simba lunges up under her and pulls her in the pond playfully she immediately comes out dripping and miffed  when simba comes out she pushes him back in the scene switches to them tussling they end up play fighting after tumbling down a hillside simba ends up pinning nala for a first she gives him a tiny lick resembling a kiss simba looks startled and stares at nala closeup of nala as she stares back with a seductive smile closeup of simba whose expression changes from a surprised one to a comprehending one the two rub heads a catstyle kiss as the last lyrics are sung

chorus
can you feel the love tonight
the peace the evening brings
the world for once in perfect harmony
with all its living things

can you feel the love tonight
you neednt look too far
stealing through the nights uncertainties
love is where they are

camera switches back to a tearful timon and pumbaa

timon
and if he falls in love tonight
pumbaa sniffs
it can be assumed
timon hugs pumbaa tearfully

pumbaa
his carefree days with us are history

timon and pumbaa
in short our pal is doomed

they let loose crying full force

simba isnt this a great place

nala it is beautiful but i dont understand something  youve been alive all this time why didnt you come back to pride rock

simba climbing into a hammock of hanging vines
well i just needed to get out on my own live my own life and i did and its great
he sounds almost as if trying to convince himself as well as nala

nala voice catching as though barely under control
weve really needed you at home

simba quieter
no one needs me

nala yes we do youre the king

simba nala weve been through this im not the king  scar is

nala simba he let the hyenas take over the pride lands

simba what

nala everythings destroyed theres no food no water  simba if you dont do something soon everyone will starve

simba hastily
no no no it doesnt matter hakuna matata

nala confused what

simba hakuna matata its something i learned out here  look sometimes bad things happen

nala simba

simba continuing irritated
and theres nothing you can do about it so why worry

simba starts away from nala walking on a fallen tree nala trots back up to him

nala because its your responsibility

simba well what about you you left

nala i left to find help and i found you dont you understand youre our only hope

simba sorry

nala whats happened to you youre not the simba i remember

simba youre right im not now are you satisfied

nala no just disappointed

simba you know youre starting to sound like my father

nala good at least one of us does

simba is obviously cut by the comment about his father he tears into nala with his words

simba angry listen you think you can just show up and tell me how to live my life you dont even know what ive been through

nala i would if you would just tell me

simba forget it

nala fine

simba walks off camera switch to simba pacing in a field

simba shes wrong i cant go back what would it prove anyway it wont change anything you cant change the past

he looks up at the stars

you said youd always be there for me but youre not
and its because of me its my fault its my fault

he bows his head choking back tears the camera backs to a far view and then zooms over to rafiki in a nearby tree we hear his chant just for fun ive included its translation

asante sana thank you very much
squash banana squash banana
we we nugu youre a baboon
mi mi apana and im not

simba seems slightly annoyed by the chant he moves away rafiki elated by the sight of simba follows him simba lies down on a log over a pond a rock disturbs the water rafiki now in a nearby tree starts his chant again

simba come on will you cut it out

rafiki laughing is doing random acrobatics in the trees nearby

rafiki cant cut it out itll grow right back laughs

simba starts walking away rafiki follows

simba creepy little monkey will you stop following me  who are you

rafiki in front of simba then right in his face
the question is whooo are you

simba startled then sighing

he starts his chant into simbas ear and laughs

simba chases after him when we catch up rafiki is in a meditative lotus position on a rock

rafiki monotone

simba i hate to tell you this but he died a long time ago

rafiki leaps off the rock over to a dense junglelike area

rafiki nope wrong again ha ha hah hes alive and ill show him to you you follow old rafiki he knows the way come on

rafiki leads simba through the brush simba has trouble keeping up due to his size the music slips into african chant

rafiki dont dawdle hurry up

simba hey whoa wait wait

rafiki come on come on

simba would you slow down

rafiki is seen flitting through the canopy ahead of simba laughing hollowly and whooping simba struggles to keep up  suddenly rafiki appears with his hand held up right into simbas face

rafiki stop

rafiki motions to simba near some reeds

shhh

he parts the reeds and points past them with his staff

look down there

simba quietly and carefully works his way out he looks over the edge and sees his reflection in a pool of water he first seems a bit startled perhaps at his own mature appearance but then realizes what hes looking at

simba disappointed sigh
thats not my father thats just my reflection

rafiki noo look harder

rafiki motions over the pool ripples form distorting simbas reflection they resolve into mufasas face a deep rumbling noise is heard  you see he lives in you

simba is awestruck the wind picks up in the air the huge image of mufasa is forming from the clouds he appears to be walking from the stars the image is ghostly at first but steadily gains color and coherence

mufasa quietly at first simba   

simba father

mufasa simba you have forgotten me

simba no how could i

mufasa you have forgotten who you are and so have forgotten me look inside yourself simba you are more than what you have become you must take your place in the circle of life

simba how can i go back im not who i used to be

shot of cloudmufasa with glowing yellow eyes
he is framed in swirling clouds radiating golden light

mufasa remember who you are you are my son and the one true king

close up of simbas face bathed in the golden light showing a mixture of awe fear and sadness the image of mufasa starts to fade

remember who you are

mufasa is disappearing rapidly into clouds simba
runs into the fields trying to keep up with the image

simba no please dont leave me

mufasa remember

simba father

mufasa remember

simba dont leave me

mufasa remember   

simba is left out in the fields there is just a cloud left where his fathers image was the wind tosses the grass restlessly rafiki approaches

rafiki what was that
laughs
the weather pbbbah very peculiar dont you think

simba yeah looks like the winds are changing

rafiki ahhh change is good

simba yeah but its not easy i know what i have to do  but going back means ill have to face my past ive been running from it for so long

rafiki whacks simba on the head with his staff

oww jeez what was that for

rafiki it doesnt matter its in the past laughs

simba rubbing head yeah but it still hurts

rafiki oh yes the past can hurt but the way i see it you can either run from it or learn from it

he swings at simba with his staff again this time simba ducks

hah you see so what are you going to do

simba first im gonna take your stick

simba tosses rafikis staff to the side

rafiki no no no no not the stick

as rafiki picks up his staff simba starts running off

hey where are you going

simba shouting back

laughs hoots n hollers as he holds his staff above his head a few shooting stars zing across the sky music rises into celebratory busa theme

timon and pumbaa ohhh

with accompanying music a restatement of the busa theme we see a far shot of simba charging full speed across the desert a layover is faded in of simbas feet pounding the sand

simba slowly crosses the desolated land he reaches the lip of a cliff and looks out over his former home mostly lacking in life it is painted in grays seeing the desolation a look of determination even fury appears on simbas face

nala simba wait up
she trots up next to him on the ledge
its awful isnt it

simba i didnt want to believe you

nala what made you come back

simba i finally got some sense knocked into me and ive got the bump to prove it besides this is my kingdom if i dont fight for it who will

simba smiles appreciatively nice scene with the four
of them on the ledge viewing the work ahead of them

camera switches to simba nala timon and pumbaa sneaking up to the edge of pride rock from behind a log they observe close up the hordes of hyenas

timon hyenas i hate hyenas
to simba whispering so whats your plan for gettin past those guys

simba live bait

timon good idea realizing heeey

simba come on timon you guys have to create a diversion

timon incredulous
what do you want me to do dress in drag and do the hula

camera switch to timon in a hula outfit the music sung is the hawaiian war chant much like the spike jones arrangement pumbaa is set up like a roast pig even with an apple in his mouth jungle drum riff

luau

his mother causes him to pause and watch

sarabi awakens at her sons nudge but mistakes him as mufasa as scar did

sarabi mufasa

scar backing into a wall apologetic
oh simba you must understand the pressures of ruling a kingdom

simba are no longer yours step down scar

scar oh oh ye well i would heh naturally heh

simba regretfully its true

scar you see he admits it murderer

lightning crashes behind scars head to punctuate the line

simba no it was an accident

scar walks around and around simba as he accuses him very nicely done animated rotation

scar if it werent for you mufasa would still be alive its your fault hes dead do you deny it

simba no

scar severely

simba no im not a murderer

scar oh simba youre in trouble again but this time daddy isnt here to save you and now everyone knows why

scar has been backing simba up the length of pride rock after his last sentence simba slips over the edge and is clinging to the ledge by his forepaws lightning strikes below igniting a fire

nala simba

scar sits back and pretends to think

scar now this looks familiar hmm where have i seen this before let me think hmmm hmmm oh yes i remember this is just the way your father looked before he died

scar grabs simba with his claws as he did mufasa he whispers into simbas ear

and heres my little secret i killed mufasa

simba has a quick memory flash back to that fateful instant his voice blends with his younger voice in the scream of when his father died in one giant leap he lunges up and pins scar on his back scar is caught completely by surprise and is understandably very nervous and shaken

simba nooooooooo murderer

scar no simba please

simba tell them the truth

scar truth but truth is in the eye of the beholdllgkkk
simba starts to choke scar
all right all right
quietly venomously i did it

simba quietly severely murderer

scar simba simba please please have mercy i beg you

simba gravely with deep anger
run run away scar and never return

scar yes of course as you wish
looking down and seeing a pile of hot coals
your majesty
scar swipes the coals into simbas face with a cry of surprise and pain simba paws the coals away as scar leaps and attacks  there is a fight in slow motion both scar and simba land heavy blows simba gets knocked on his back scar leaps through the flames at him simba gathers courage and uses scars momentum in a throw similar to nalas fighting tactics to send him flying over the edge scar tumbles to the bottom he weakly gets up he sees banzai shenzi and ed approaching and smiles ed has a very angry look on his face

scar ahh my friends

the camera moves away and we can only see the shadows as the horde of hyenas closes on and devours scar rain opens up and douses the fire simba comes down and greets his mother and nala rafiki motions for simba to ascend pride rock as king simba starts up and pauses to hug rafiki as his father did

rafiki it is time

very majestically he ascends through the rain music is strong through a hole in the clouds we can see a patch of stars one bright star shines out briefly

mufasa remember   

simbas expression gains confidence and strength he roars the lionesses roar in reply time switch to the savannah in full bloom again cue busa theme
