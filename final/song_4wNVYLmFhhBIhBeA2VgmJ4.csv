if hes got a dusty old cowboy hat
if he won a buckle ridin’ on a bulls back
if hes broken bones you didn’t know you had
buy that man a beer

verse 2
if he left home when he turned eighteen
if he earned his stripes when he stormed a beach
if he cant forget about the things hes seen
buy that man a beer

chorus
order up an icecold longneck slide it on down
oughta be a line out the door to buy him a round
pull up a stool and lend him an ear
hear a story thatll bring you to tears
buy that man a beer

verse 3
if he plays guitar every saturday night
if theres a song thats about a goodbye
hes learned every lick and lived every line
buy that man a beer

chorus
order up an icecold longneck slide it on down

chorus
order up an icecold longneck slide it on down
