everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down
i think you only live to see the lights of town
i wasted my time when i would try try try
cause when the lights have lost their glow youll cry cry cry

verse 2
soon your sugar daddies will all be gone
youll wake up some cold day and find youre alone
youll call for me but im gonna tell you bye bye bye
when i turn around and walk away youll cry cry cry

chorus
youre gonna cry cry cry and youll cry alone
when everyones forgotten and youre left on your own
youre gonna cry cry cry

verse 3
i lie awake at night to wait til you come in
you stay a little while and then youre gone again
every question that i ask i get a lie lie lie
for every lie you tell youre gonna cry cry cry

verse 4
when your fickle love gets old no one will care for you
then youll come back to me for a little love thats true
ill tell you no and then youll ask me why why why
when i remind you of all of this youll cry cry cry

itll hurt when you think of the fool youve been
youre gonna cry cry cry2embed"
