verse 1 skepta
you dont know me you better get to know me
stand up tall right next to kobe
a young g i had the weapon on me
slice up work like pepperoni shing
the police still arrest the homies
no statement no testimony
spit in your face with extra bogey
its my time i dont flex a rollie
on cloud nine a mans extra cozy bo greaze
i might switch it up and direct a movie
pussyholes tried to execute me
died and came back as fela kuti
dont phone me send a text to julie
ovo mans so unruly bo
south by ride out no suzuki
got the austin powers a mans extra groovy greaze
front row jacket tailormade
crackhead swag with the razor blade sex
red umbrella when i make it rain sex

verse 2 skepta
yeah theyre nothin like me im a fuckin villain
go against me thats a tough decision mmm
police wish i was stuck in prison
fisheye lens on my tunnel vision straight
real life greaze when i touch the riddim
still the same guy when i touched a million
record labels wanted us to listen
but its greatness only for the love of britain
i say it how it is and no fucks are given
greaze so dont forget to remember me yeah
especially all my enemies
keep your eyes on me with your jealousy
the most solid gang that you will ever see get me
just came back from the embassy
check my crime sheet check my legacy
and now im back on tour so what you tellin me bobo
greaze taliban halloween icy
pull up in the whip with the gasoline greaze bobo
yeah thats that boy from the magazine jeez
bust my dance at the cash machine
make her back it up bounce on my trampoline
like martin luther man i had a dream
now its my world you can have the scene
