i can see the weight there in your eyes
i can feel the thorn in your side
your knuckles are bruised from a losing fight
one way down a deadend street
broken glass underneath your feet
you think the day wont break the sunless night

chorus kelly clarkson  kara dioguardi
the sun will rise
the sun will rise
when youve lost your light
the sun will rise
itll be alright
itll be alright

verse 2 kara dioguardi
ive been in stuck in a storm before
felt the winds raging at my door
couldnt move couldnt breathe
couldnt find a way out
somehow the clouds disappeared
somehow i made it here
maybe just so you could hear me say

chorus kelly clarkson  kara dioguardi
the sun will rise
the sun will rise the sun will rise
when youve lost your light
the sun will rise
itll be alright itll be alright
itll be alright
itll be alright
itll be alright
