2ag2oLCwlFIA88hQrLMHzv,Starlight - Commentary,Taylor Swift,4jTYApZPMapg56gRycOn0D,"11 contributorsfollowing the 2015 vmas liking a justin bieber song and the ensuing fallout lyricsi didn’t watch the 2015 vmas it wasn’t because of indifference nor was it some sort of personal stand against award showswhat they represent there was just something more entertaining on tv for me that night however i did follow the vmas through my twitter feed while the bigger screen in front of me was occupied by notmileycyrus

experiencing an event through only live tweets is interesting because the commentary is inherently biased like a firstperson narrative you need to evaluate the narrator and understand their perspective to come to a valid conclusion about the surroundings but the important distinction to this literary analogy is that the twitter user has chosen their own narrators for the story you willingly followed your friends favorite celebrities humor accounts and journalists in doing so you’ve already become acquainted with the narrators of each 140character story celebrity x has had some of the funniest tweets you’ve ever read soandso is a high school acquaintance that retweets those annoying faux wiz khalifa accounts mr journalist has written some insightful articles you agree with you take that one friend’s words with a grain of salt because they drink kanye west haterade the twitter narrator is seen through a filter that reflects the follower’s preconceived opinions of that narrator and human nature suggests that these people are likely to share similar views to the follower

this results in a personally tailored experience that is easy to forget is a tailored experience for a while during the vma bonanza i forgot that my timeline was biased so everything was fitting into my preconceived notions kanye west is awesome justin bieber does dumb things with his hair cultural appropriation has manifest itself in human form through miley cyrus etc aside from taking the time to watch kanyes beautiful speech i had formed my opinions on the vmas without actually seeing more than six second vines of the show obviously a lot of the experience was lost on me

when i returned to twitter the next day i came across something i missed the night before justin bieber cried as a longstanding nonbelieber this was obviously important to me in some weird petty sort of way expecting to come out of it with more biebz ammunition i ignored my disdain for celebrity gossip headlines and tapped on the crybieber video

after toying with the idea of skipping to the end for the waterworks i decided to watch the full thing because it was only five minutes long and i actually like that jack ü where are ü now song in my head i made fun of his awkward eminem hand gestures during the slow intro and cringed when he tried to whip luckily the camera panned to rebel wilson midwhip so we werent subject to the full thing

but at the same time i also had to appreciate the fact that he clearly wasnt lip syncing most of the song despite the exhaustive choreography of the performance even a light jog forces my attempt at singing to sound more like someone mouthbreathing too loudly over the phone than anything that resembles a melody so i respected the fact that he held his own while flailing his limbs around for consecutive minutes

then something odd happened i realized he had switched to a different song i also realized that i really liked the new song he was playing this immediately launched me into internal crisis code red because i liked a justin bieber song

for starters i tried to rationalize my kneejerk self disgust by recognizing it as elitist bias pop music in general is often looked down on and relegated to a guilty pleasure rather than something truly enjoyed by anyone over the age of 15 while a lot of warranted criticism can and is made of heavily manufactured commercialized sound that panders to the masses for profit rather than arts sake this criticism tends to foment full blown rockism this bias was effectively defined by kelefa sanneh in his 2004 new york times article the rap against rockisma rockist is someone who reduces rock ‘n’ roll to a caricature then uses that caricature as a weapon rockism means idolizing the authentic old legend or underground hero while mocking the latest pop star lionizing punk while barely tolerating disco loving the live show and hating the music video extolling the growling performer while hating the lipsyncherthe argumentativedismissive nature of rockism is what makes it such a controversial and uncompromising bias rockism is part of the reason why family members expressed their concern for my health when i told them i liked a justin bieber song its also part of the reason why my roommate recently refused to acknowledge carly rae jepsons call me maybe as a fantastic song from our formative years

theres a lot to dislike about bubblegum pop and its hooks that often veer quickly from catchy to annoying but its also important to form your own opinion on the quality of the music and not to dismiss something as inferior just because it is pop

quality modern pop music exists whether it is a bit disingenuous at times or not justin timberlake and beyoncé are two of the most talented artists in the world depending on your perspective taylor swift may be a calculating walking pr stunt or an angelic role model but either way 1989 is good carly rae jepsons e•mo•tion is a fun catchy album ryn weavers the fool is an impressive debut from an incredibly talented artist whether or not benny blanco charli xcx michael angelakos and cashmere cat support from the getgo caused some industry plant speculation and labels but at the end of the day this paragraph is essentially my opinion

and at the end of biebers performance my opinion was that what do you mean seemed to be a gulp good song i took to spotify for the cdq version and yep i liked a justin bieber song now i had liked bieber songs before but where are ü now was really skrillex and diplos track right confident was a great song but i mostly listened to it for chance the rappers verse right baby was funny to listen to ironically a couple times but its actually just annoying right

naturally i decided to look around on some music blogs i frequent to see if they had an opinion on biebers recent output pitchfork predictably had next to nothing on biebz aside from when other artists mentionedmocked him and a begrudging review of where are ü now in two paragraphs not that i was expecting them to do as they were depicted in portlandia for jb pigeons  planes last three articles mentioning him were his comedy central roast potentially working with producericon rick rubin and patrick carney of the black keys calling biebz a fucking moron popmatters hasnt written about him since 2013 stereogum though had a post on what do you mean calling it just a straightup great song no qualifiers necessary im not alone

however pitchforks aforementioned review of where are ü now is written in a key perspective one that takes into account the artist as a human being the very first sentence of ryan dombals review is i am not a belieber while the rest of the first paragraph calls bieber a scourge and notes how the author experienced casual schadenfreude every time he was skewered on tmz these qualifications and one hundred other words come up before the song is even mentioned at which point the opinion of the music seems to be positive but never goes further than calling it  unexpected in all the best ways
at its best pitchfork is a knowledgable source for generally good music and reviews that offer a good learning experience at its worst its a hive of selfimportant writers dabbling in elitism and pretension and though public opinion often considers bieber in a similar light as dombal outside of three sentences that address the song the review wasnt much more helpful than someone telling you yeah its actually pretty good after a deep sigh and hand wringing after all even if they did publish meredith graves insightful piece noting the actual emotional abuse in the sun kil moonwar on drugs fiasco they certainly didnt consider kozeleks curmudgeonly temperament when they forwarded benji to best new music
thats not to say artist personality doesnt factor into the enjoyment of an artists work it just calls for the question of whether or not it should take presidenttobe kanye west who is reviled in many circles for his ego and unfiltered outbursts it all came full circle at the 2015 vmas during his heartfelt unscripted video vanguard acceptance monologue on remorse for the infamous tswift mic grab the love he has for his daughter confusion with award shows in general and more yet some still managed to take a moment of honesty and sincerity and spin it out as insane or ridiculous as if any of them would know how to convey such complicated emotions to millions of viewers even through genuinely likable moments his reputation is forever tarnished in the minds of many and that vehement hatred spews over into opinion on his music haters can be found pontificating in comment sections across the internet but none are so brash as those about kanye west a favorite cry of such justice warriors is to denounce the fact that wests creations are even music lol as if its definition could be manipulated meanwhile blatant racism runs rampant disguised by musical opinion as if those speaking on his music had even given it a chance

inevitably assholes pepper the entertainment industry kanye west is not one of them it may be too early to label bieber as one given the extreme pressure of fame at such a young age but his petulant past is far too extensive to worry about reserving judgement as he works toward an image revitalization his art and his character should be treated as two distinct entities

in the modern age social media blogs and pundits tell people what to think of what artists are trying to show at such an alarming rate that its easy to forget to discern opinion from fact and normal to parade recitation of opinionated content as your own mindset if ive learned anything from not watching the vmas its that a collection of other peoples thoughtstweets on a subject does not an experience make be a free thinker and listen for yourself

i dont like justin bieber i like some of his music
