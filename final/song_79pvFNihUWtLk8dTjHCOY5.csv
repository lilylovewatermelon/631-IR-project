all insecure out of my mind
i shouldnt have left that message on your phone

i shouldnt have said the things i said
lookin for love we left for dead
in a grave without a stone

as soon as you hear my voice
dont hesitate
put your finger on the button

erase my love
i bet you cant erase my touch
youre tryin to replace
a feelin without a name
with somebody elses face
in your head

everythings cool
the rent is paid
the house is clean
your bed is made
but its a ghost town in your mind

never had time to go to sleep
wed wake up tangled in the sheets
on a bed that we called home
see mika liveget tickets as low as 37you might also likewhen the pain wont go away
you might as well put your finger on the trigger

erase my love
i bet you cant erase my touch
youre tryin to replace
a feelin without a name
with somebody elses face
in your head

erase

erase my love
i bet you cant erase my touch
cause youre tryin to replace
a feelin without a name
with somebody elses face
in your head

erase

erase

youre tryin to replace
a feelin without a name
with somebody elses face
in your head
