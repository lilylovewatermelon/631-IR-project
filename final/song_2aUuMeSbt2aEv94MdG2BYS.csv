hold on to me love
you know i cant stay long
all i wanted to say was

can you hear me
can you feel me in your arms

holding my last breath
safe inside myself
are all my thoughts of you

ill miss the winter
a world of fragile things
look for me in the white forest
hiding in a hollow tree come find me

i know you hear me
i can taste it in your tears

closing your eyes to disappear
you pray your dreams will leave you here
but still you wake and know the truth
no ones there

say goodnight
dont be afraid
calling me calling me
as you fade to black

holding my last breath

safe inside myself
calling me calling me
are all my thoughts of you
sweet raptured light
it ends here tonight
