shifting under me
the sleeping giants are finally waking
waking finally
my pulse is clear rushing in my ears
i hear something calling me
my pulse is clear rushing in my ears
i hear something calling me

ohh

the moon is humming the moon is humming
lovely melodies
the forest echoes the trees are crowing
hungry hungry harmonies

my pulse is clear rushing in my ears
i hear something calling me
my pulse is clear rushing in my ears
i hear something calling me

ohh

my pulse is clear rushing in my ears
i hear something calling me
my pulse is clear rushing in my ears
i hear something calling me
my pulse is clear rushing in my ears
i hear something calling me
my pulse is clear rushing in my ears
i hear something calling me
