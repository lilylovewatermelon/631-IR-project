this is my life
its not what it was before
all these feelings ive shared
and these are my dreams
that id never lived before
somebody shake me cause i
i must be sleeping

chorus
and now that were here its so far away
all the struggle we thought was in vain
and all the mistakes one life contained
they all finally start to go away
and now that were here its so far away
and i feel like i can face the day
and i can forgive and im not ashamed
to be the person that i am today

verse 2
and these are my words
that ive never said before
i think im doing okay
and this is the smile
that ive never shown before
somebody shake me cause i
i must be sleeping

now that were here its so far away
all the struggle we thought was in vain
and all the mistakes one life contained
they all finally start to go away
and now that were here its so far away
and i feel like i can face the day
and i can forgive and im not ashamed
to be the person that i am today

bridge
im so afraid of waking
please dont shake me
afraid of waking
please dont shake me

chorus
now that were here its so far away
all the struggle we thought was in vain
all the mistakes one life contained
they all finally start to go away
and now that were here its so far away
and i feel like i can face the day
i can forgive and im not ashamed
to be the person that i am today18embed"
