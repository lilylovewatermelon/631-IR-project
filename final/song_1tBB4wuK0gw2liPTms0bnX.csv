hey love can i get a rain check
just 25 and im not ready yet
hey love lets make a deal
give me some time i got a few hearts to steal
hey love got more grounds to gain
cant get stuck with a ball and a chain
hey love i need to be sure
come back and see me in two years or more

verse 1
i remember as a kid i used to dream
i had a big crush on sandras kid sister jean
but she was in love with dwayne
its been so many years but i still feel the pain
what about the girl across the street
took the same bus i used to reserve her seat
but she would just sit with her friends
and the all talk about guys in beemers and benz
seem like my luck took a slide
then shorty came along and stood by my side
i couldnt give her much but she stayed
now im hitting all the charts its so easy getting laid
living in style im getting paid
hooking up my peeps with the millions ive made
now im having girls who i knew in first grade
now im kinda feeling like my shorty getting played
so im begging you

verse 2
i wasnt popular in school i wasnt popular in sports
all the girls i love loved the guys on the court
i feel like i been cheated of my youth
cause back in the days braces werent so cute
girls used to laugh at my suit
now i got models in bed knocking boots so
