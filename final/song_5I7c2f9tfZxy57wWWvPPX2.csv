she says she loves me
but she comes and goes when she pleases
when the door shuts
its like another papercut
and im stuck with a hand full of bandaids
until she comes back around like them ceiling fan blades
claims she loves me
but she cuts me into pieces
when im sewed up
here comes another papercut
now im stuck with a hand full of bandaids
til she comes back around like them ceiling fan blades

we met 22 years back
fresh out the womb
now she consumes me
no room for self these days
and shes so demanding
do this do that
dont forget to take your medicine medicine
i hate it when her face is invading my head again
the welcome mat reads please take off your shoes
but she disregards the statement
ive grown accustomed to bending my beliefs to
satisfy her needs
but im fed up
with plugging cuts everytime they bleed
so i dip my pen in the puddle
what a bloody mess its been
trying to end this struggle
but i love her
shes the reason for the lesions
man i love her
i start bleeding when shes leaving
and every scar on my fingertip is a reminder of
all the lessons learned
on my missions to try to find her but
ill sit alone until she comes back home
and ill be waiting by the phone
see gym class heroes liveget tickets as low as 97you might also likephone rings hello
on phone hello uh ive had my eye for quite a while
who is this
on phone listen

here comes another papercut x2
she says she loves me
but she comes and goes when she pleases
when the door shuts
its like another papercut
and now im stuck with a hand full of bandaids
til she comes back around like them ceiling fan blades
claims she loves me
but she cuts me into pieces
when im sewed up
here comes another papercut
now im stuck with a hand full of bandaids
til she comes back around like them ceiling fan blades

on the phone
she dont live here no more
i heard shes staying down the street with the dead beat
that dont treat her right with two bad ass kids
guilt and regret
and im willing to bet
my last dollar that shes wishing she was kissing me
man the nerve of this bitch
pardon my french
but its been 10 days
and im getting kind of light headed
maybe ill write her a letter in a gentlemans way
and send it with the hopes that she might get it
i cant believe i let her run all over me
but all i think about is
when shes here and holding me
i love her
shes the reason for the lesions
man i love her
i start bleeding when shes leaving
and every scar on my fingertip is a reminder of
all the lessons learned
all my missions trying to find her and
i cant complain
i kind of like the pain
she aint even got a name
she just lives in my brain

she says she loves me
but she comes and goes when she pleases
when the door shuts
its like another papercut
and now im stuck with a hand full of bandaids
til she comes back around like them ceiling fan blades
claims she loves me
but she cuts me into pieces
when im sewed up
here comes another papercut
now im stuck with a hand full of bandaids
until she comes back around like them ceiling fan bladesembed"
