verse 1
maybe im broken maybe im wrong
i couldve spoken sooner than i shouldve
only the good die old
thats what they told me but i dont know

prechorus
maybe im breaking up with myself
maybe im thinking
i should just keep to the things that ive been told
wait for the colors to turn to gold

chorus
do you know do you know
youre all i know youre all i know
when everything comes crashing down
youre all i know youre all i know

postchorus
im ready for the fall
im ready for everything that i believed in to drift away
ready for the leaves
ready for the colors to burn to gold and crumble away
see imagine dragons liveget tickets as low as 120you might also likeverse 2
maybe im destined to be distraught
always a reason breaking me down to my
knees in the dead of night
i keep on praying to see the light ohohoh

prechorus
maybe im breaking up with myself
maybe im thinking
i should just keep to the things that ive been told
wait for the colors to turn to gold

chorus
do you know do you know
youre all i know youre all i know
when everything comes crashing down
youre all i know youre all i know
do you know do you know
youre all i know youre all i know
when everything comes crashing down
youre all i know youre all i know

postchorus
im ready for the fall
im ready for everything that i believed in to drift away
ready for the leaves
ready for the colors to burn to gold and crumble away
