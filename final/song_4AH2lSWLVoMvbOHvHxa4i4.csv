verse
i got the midas touch in my heart this how i put on blue
they left me in the mud i grew just like a flower do
my love for money aint really nothin my family valuable
they say its up so when you get to bussin shit they ride on you
my time precious spend a pretty penny on my left wrist
my dawg reckless its a bag i let em go fetch it go fetch it
this shit get treacherous rock a trench coat in the trenches
i hope my fam dont ever nеver tell or show our messagеs
i need a black to boost my high
i dont wanna rap til i shoot my guy
ima get my mans did you live if i dont see em i settle for his next kin
but ima get him and i never meant to bring no pain again
but i wouldnt wanna be em when niggas pull up in that benz they wont miss him
this for them niggas sittin behind the fence bruh gon stay free
yall speak through me every chance i represent
and it aint yall fault completely its the life we forced to live
my nigga wanna see me dead cause i be shinin more than him
