im timeless like a broken watch
i make money like fred astaire
i see that youve come to resist me
im a pitbull in time
your pretense is not what restricts me
its the circles inside
the anatomy of kisses and a teacher who tries
who knows how well disappear
would you like to be my missus and in future with child
you know we cant get back from here
but we can get away

prechorus 1
baby dont you try to find me
baby dont you try to fight
baby dont you try to find me
baby it will be alright

chorus
along the way tears drown in the wake of delight
theres nothing like this built today
youll never see a finer ship in your life
we sail today tears drown in the wake of delight
theres nothing like this built today
youll never see a finer ship or receive a better tip in your life
see interpol liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likebridge
i am the scavenger between the sheets of union
lately i cant tell for sure whether machines turn anyone
i am the scavenger between the sheets of union
lately i cant tell for sure whether machines turn anyone

prechorus 2
lady dont you try to find me
lady there is no need to fight
lady dont you try to find me
lady it will be alright

chorus
we sail today tears will drown in your wake of delight
theres nothing like this built today
youll never see a finer ship in your life
along the way the sea will crowd us with lovers at night
theres nothing like this built today
youll never see a finer ship or receive a better tip in your life

i see that youve come to resist me
im a pitbull in time

outro
white goddess
red goddess
black temptress of the sea
you treat me right
black goddess
red goddess
white temptress of the sea
you treat me right
oh my love were sailing to norway
oh my love were leaving tonight
oh my love were sailing to norway
oh my love were leaving tonight8embed"
