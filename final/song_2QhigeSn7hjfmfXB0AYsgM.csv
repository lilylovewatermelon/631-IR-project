verse 1 anthony mars
walk in with a dead bitch and a swisher lit
drug kit got a halfhit worth of acid
cant quit im an addict so traumatic and im manic
feelin’ panicked i need a xanax
pass it as i od real slowly lonely looking ghostly
surrounded by smoky mirror images of a fictionist sober me
don’t give a fuck bout harming me i’m druggin til i rip

verse 2 norman atomic
take a hit of acid been a while since i tripped
now im seein all this shit brain glowing
everything is bendin in the same motion roll the blunt ill take a hit
start starin at the smoke as it twists and disappears
peer pressure dont affect me bitch i take drugs on my own
pop a perc and snort some coke it feel like my heart is broke
because i get fucked up when i feel alone
im choking on this 40 of oe im hoping that i dont breathe
bitch im dope act like you know me shoot me up so i can od
