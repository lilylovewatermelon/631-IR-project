remember rio and get down
like some other dj in some other town
shes been tryin to tell me to hold tight
but ive been waitin this whole night

prechorus
but ive been down across a road or two
but now ive found
the velvet sun that shines on me and you

chorus
in the back ahho i cant crack
were on top
its just a shimmy and a shake ahho i cant fake
were on top were on top

verse 2
the day is breakin were still here
your bodys shakin and its clear
you really need it so let go
and let me feed it but you know

prechorus
that ive been down across a road or two
but now ive found
the velvet sun that shines on me and you
see the killers liveget tickets as low as 54you might also likechorus

we bring the bump to the grind ahho i dont mind

and we dont mean to satisfy tonight
so get your eyes off of my pride tonight
cause i dont need to satisfy tonight
its like a cigarette in the mouth
or a handshake in the doorway
i look at you and smile because im fine
