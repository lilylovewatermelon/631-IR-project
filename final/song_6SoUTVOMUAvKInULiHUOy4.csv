when life seems full of clouds and rain
and im full of nothing but pain
who soothes my thumping bumping brain
nobody
when wintertime comes with its snow and sleet
and me with hunger and cold feet
who says heres two bits go and eat
nobody

chorus
well i aint never done nothing to nobody
i aint never got nothing from nobody no time
and until i get something from somebody sometime
i dont intend to do nothing for nobody no time

verse 2
when summertime comes all warm and clear
and my friends see me drawing near
who says come on in and have a beer
nobody
well one time when things was looking bright
i started to whittling on a stick one night
who said hey thats dynamite
nobody

mmm i aint never done nothing to nobody
i aint never got nothing from nobody no time
and until i get something from somebody sometime
i dont intend to do nothing for nobody no time

outro
i aint never done nothing to nobody
i aint never got nothing from nobody no time
and until i get something from somebody sometime
i dont intend to do nothing for nobody no time1embed"
