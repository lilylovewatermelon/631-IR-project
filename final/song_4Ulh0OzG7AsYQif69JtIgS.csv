verse 1 mary j blige
91 i stepped in this game
after whats the 411 things aint been the same
and i cant complain
but with all this fame comes a whole lot of pain but
im so glad to be here and my musics still sincere
lets get back to the story of all this pain and glory
and 94 was my life and my life wasnt right
so i reached out to you and told you what ive been through

verse 2 mary j blige
then i came with share my world
but at that point i was just a foolish girl trying to find my way
then i dropped the mary album
and people were saying that its just not gonna work
and my feelings they did hurt
but my fans showed me so much love
and i owe it all to them
then i came with no more drama i remember that week
yeah it was when aaliyah died i couldnt hardly sleep
thought about it every day and it made me change my way
im a real woman now because of all of these days
