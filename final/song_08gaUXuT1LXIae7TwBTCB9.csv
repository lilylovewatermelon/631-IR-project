verse 1
dont believe what they say
were dead flies in the summertime
they leave us all behind
with duct tape scars on my honey
they dont like who you are
you wont like where well go
brother protect me now
with blood they wash in the money

prechorus
you dont believe in god i dont believe in luck
they dont believe in us but i believe were the enemy
you dont believe in god i dont believe in luck
they dont believe in us but i believe were the enemy

im sick down from the bones to the other side
redmob we insects hide
king rat on the streets in another life
they laugh we dont think its funny
if what you are
is just what you own
what have you become
when they take from you almost everything

prechorus
you dont believe in god i dont believe in luck
they dont believe in us but i believe were the enemy
you dont believe in god i dont believe in luck
they dont believe in us but i believe were the enemy
