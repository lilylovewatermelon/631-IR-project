verse 1 serj tankian with daron malakian
two skies watching it all fading
two skies living it all fading
two skies watching it all fading
two skies fading ones abating
two suns living it all dying
two suns fighting ones abiding
two suns watching them both fighting
two suns seeing them both dying
two suns watching them both fighting
two suns fighting ones abiding
two skies seeing them both dying
two skies fading ones abating
ah ah ah

verse 2 daron malakian  serj tankian
crack pipes needles pcp and fast cars

when i feel like talking i never be wrong
if i feel like walking you best come along
i close my windows crank the heat up high

till my palms are wet and my tongue is dry
