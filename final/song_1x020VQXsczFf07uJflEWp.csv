drowning away all of the pain
til im totally numb
sometimes you want to feel alive
but not on someone elses time

verse
morning heartache
senses your love
i just cant catch a break
squirrels and snakes keep me on my toes
will you go down with me
dont care what you say
so many feels bro
lol im so over it
cause nothing is real
id rather be up my mind
than to be dead alive

chorus
drowning away all of the pain
til im totally numb
sometimes you want to feel alive
but not on someone elses time

outro
