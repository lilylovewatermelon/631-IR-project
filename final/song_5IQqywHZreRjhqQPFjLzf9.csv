verse 1 james pleen
look at me glow like the virgin mary birthin the messiah
frozen in time ho i shine like a lightbulb made out of all diamonds
meme and christ in all black smokin violet
hope im dyin hope im overdosin
i can hear violin strings but inside my casket its silent
bitch im on an island turnin maggots into assets
smiling as im burnin planets into ashes
fucking worth it if you ask me fuck your status ho
bitch im guessin im correcting my depression end up in a hole

verse 2 anthony mars
bitches tryna fuck me like my name was the weeknd
i be that goldtooth motherfucker steady bleedin and leakin
im never sleepin only drinkin some codeine cause im fiendin
i might just go and fuck yo bitch and tell that ho to go tweet it uh
ruthless when im swangin on them twenties like im weezy
aint on no tv but im stuntin like my name was bg
the hot boys resurrected with the triple six
