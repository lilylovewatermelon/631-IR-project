i find the map and draw a straight line
over rivers farms and state lines
the distance from a to where youd be
its only fingerlengths that i see

prechorus 1 gary lightbody  martha wainwright
i touch the place
where id find your face
my fingers in creases
of distant dark places

verse 2 gary lightbody  martha wainwright
i hang my coat up in the first bar
there is no peace that ive found so far
the laughter penetrates my silence
as drunken men find flaws in science

prechorus 2 gary lightbody  martha wainwright
their words mostly noises
ghosts with just voices
your words in my memory
are like music to me

chorus gary lightbody  martha wainwright
and miles from where you are
i lay down on the cold ground i
i pray that somethin picks me up
and sets me down in your warm arms
see snow patrol liveget tickets as low as 81you might also likeverse 3 gary lightbody  martha wainwright
after i have travelled so far
wed set the fire to the third bar
wed share each other like an island
until exhausted close our eyelids

prechorus 3 gary lightbody  martha wainwright
and dreaming pick up from
the last place we left off
your soft skin is weepin
a joy you cant keep in

chorus gary lightbody  martha wainwright
and miles from where you are
i lay down on the cold ground and i
i pray that somethin picks me up
and sets me down in your warm arms
and miles from where you are
i lay down on the cold ground and i
i pray that somethin picks me up
and sets me down in your warm arms15embed"
