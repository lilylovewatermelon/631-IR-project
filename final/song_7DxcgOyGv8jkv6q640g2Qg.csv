you dont even know how much i love you
you dont even know how i adore you
i bet it would astound you
if i told you now to
just let all my love surround you
and everytime you call me i start shaking
and me not telling you bout my heart aching
i bet it would astound you
if i told you now that
i wanna let all my love surround you

verse 1
if you knew what i thought about you
its like the best thing i could find
treat like honeydew when im kissing you
i cant lie
and were suppose to be just friends
benefits with no commitments
but i find myself missing you more than i should be

prechorus
got a picture of you
i keep it with me
you never knew that it was so deep
sick over you
aint that the truth
and it aint hard to tell
see fantasia liveget tickets as low as 57you might also likechorus
you dont even know how much i love you
you dont even know how i adore you
i bet it would astound you
if i told you now to
just let all my love surround you
and everytime you call me i start shaking
and me not telling you bout my heart aching
i bet it would astound you
if i told you now that
i wanna let all my love surround you

verse 2
cant believe you dont know about me
even talk about you in my sleep
all my family knows straight overdose
im you you you
go in my room and i shut the door
so i can think about your smile some more
made you out to be the biggest thing to me
locked up in life

prechorus
got a picture of you
i keep it with me
you never knew that it was so deep
sick over you
aint that the truth
and it aint hard to tell
chorus
you dont even know how much i love you
you dont even know how i adore you
i bet it would astound you
if i told you now to
just let all my love surround you
and everytime you call me i start shaking
and me not telling you bout my heart aching
i bet it would astound you
if i told you now that
i wanna let all my love surround you

bridge
im sitting here in your truck
going crazy over your touch
and it gets to be to much
on the daily if i could keep you with me
just a little bit of your time
wanna give you all of mine
im thinking maybe baby we should just baby we should just try it

chorus until fade
you dont even know how much i love you
you dont even know how i adore you
i bet it would astound you
if i told you now to
just let all my love surround you
and everytime you call me i start shaking
and me not telling you bout my heart aching
i bet it would astound you
if i told you now that
i wanna let all my love surround you
while singing in chorus
you dont even know it
im crazy crazy over you
baby baby yeah
you dont even knowembed"
