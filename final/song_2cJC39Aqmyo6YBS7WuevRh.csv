sunday morning
man she woke up fightin mad
bitchin and moanin on and on
bout the time i had
and by tuesday you could say
that girl was good as gone
then when thursday came around i was all alone
so i went for a drive to clear my mind
ended up at a shell on i65

chorus 1
then i won a hundred bucks on a scratchoff ticket
i bought two 12packs and a tank of gas with it
she swore they were a waste of time
oh but she was wrong
i was caller number five on a radio station
won a four day three night beach vacation
deep sea señorita fishing down in panama
and i aint gotta see my
exfuturemotherinlaw anymore
oh lord when it rains it pours

verse 2
now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
when she heard about my newfound luck
on that fm dial
and its crazy how lately now
it just seems to come in waves
what i thought was gonna be the death of me
was my saving grace
its got me thinking that her leaving
is the only logical reason
see luke combs liveget tickets as low as 33you might also likechorus 2
that i got the last spot in the hooters parking lot
and the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
she picked up on the first ring when i gave her a call
and i only spent five bucks at the moose club raffle
won a used 4wheeler and three free passes
for me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
and i aint gotta see my
exfuturemotherinlaw anymore
oh lord when it rains it pours
when it rains it pours

bridge
well ive been on one hell of a redneck roll
for three weeks now
and it all started on the day that she walked out

chorus 1
then i won a hundred bucks on a scratchoff ticket
bought two 12packs and a tank of gas with it
she swore they were a waste of time
oh but she was wrong
and i was caller number five on a radio station
won a four day three night beach vacation
deep sea señorita fishing down in panama
and i aint gotta see my
exfuturemotherinlaw anymore
oh lord when it rains it pours
