without you
the ground thaws
the rain falls
the grass grows

without you
the seeds root
the flowers bloom
the children play

the stars gleam
the poets dream
the eagles fly
without you

the earth turns
the sun burns
but i die
without you

without you
the breeze warms
the girl smiles
the cloud moves
you might also likewithout you
the tides change
the boys run
the oceans crash

the crowds roar
the days soar
the babies cry
without you

the moon glows
the river flows
but i die
without you

roger  mimi
the world revives—
colors renew
but i know blue only blue lonely blue within me blue

mimi
without you
without you
the hand gropes
the ear hears
the pulse beats
roger
without you
the eyes gaze
the legs walk
the lungs breathe

roger  mimi
the mind churns the mind churns
the heart yearns the heart yearns
the tears dry
without you

mimi  roger
life goes on
but i’m gone
cause i die

roger  mimi
without you
without you
without you
without youembed"
