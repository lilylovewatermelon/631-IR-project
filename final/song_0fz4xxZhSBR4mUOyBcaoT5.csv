weighing me down with its waiting
playing my silly little game
watching the memory i saved

tossing all my coins in wishing wells
searching for the signs in parallel

chasing the person i seem

keeping a tab on my wasting
playing my silly little game
watching the memory i saved

tossing all my coins in wishing wells
searching for the signs in parallel
