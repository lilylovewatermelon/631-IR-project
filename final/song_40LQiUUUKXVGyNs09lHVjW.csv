honey why you callin’ me so late
it’s kinda hard to talk right now
honey why you cryin’ is everything okay
i gotta whisper cause i cant be too loud

prechorus
oh well my girls in the next room
sometimes i wish she was you
i guess we never really moved on

chorus
it’s really good to hear your voice
sayin my name it sounds so sweet
comin from the lips of an angel
hearin those words it makes me weak
and i never wanna say goodbye
but girl you make it hard to be faithful
with the lips of an angel

verse 2
it‘s funny that youre callin me tonight
and yes ive dreamt of you too
does he know youre talkin’ to me
will it start a fight
