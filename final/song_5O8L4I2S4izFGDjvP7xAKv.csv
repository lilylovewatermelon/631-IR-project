i will never bother you
i will never promise to
i will never follow you
i will never bother you
never speak a word again
i will crawl away for good
i will move away from here
you wont be afraid of fear
no thought was put into this
and always knew it would come to this
things have never been so swell
i have never failed to fail

chorus
hey hey hey
you know youre right
you know youre right you know youre right

verse 2
im so warm and calm inside
i no longer have to hide
lets talk about someone else
steaming soup against her mouth
nothing really bothers her
she just wants to love himself
i will move away from here
you wont be afraid of fear
no thought was put into this
always knew itd come to this
things have never been so swell
i have never failed to fail
