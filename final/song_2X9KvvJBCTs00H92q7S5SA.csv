verse
i like pourin up them pints cause it have me chillin
floatin starin at the ceiling a wonderful feeling
if im sober for too long i get in my feelings
startin fights and clutchin poles they swear i be trippin
ran the light and hit a pole a headon collision
went to thinkin bout my lifestyle and lost my vision
had a meeting with my daughters but im gonna miss it
went to bleeding out my head doodie came to get me through the wire
same night they shot the car up nobody killed yeah
sorry nurse im feeling better let me out of here
we went to spin on the house he was hidin in
i cocked my glock and rolled the window down they told me chill
i think its safe to say i lost my damn brain through the wire
but the pressure on my chest made me feel a certain way
like nobody understand me im trapped inside a maze
but if everybody crazy knew that you must be insane

blame the pain built up deep inside
i try to control it
but the anger build up deep inside
leave me to exploding
who got that drank i need it
who got that drank im fiendin

they told me to slow it down you been speedin
they told me to slow it down take it easy

outro
