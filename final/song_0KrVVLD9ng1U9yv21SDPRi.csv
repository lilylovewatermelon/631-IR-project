we made it final today
i gave you all i had you made your getaway
all the love we once made turned to memories today
i left the courtroom and went straight to the church
i hit my knees and told god how much i hurt
nothing left of my heart
its going to be so hard to make a new start

chorus
because today my world slipped away
we buried the plans that we made
and tonight im alone and afraid
because today my world slipped away

verse 2
all my friends say ill make it alright
ill recover and start a new life
but thatll be so hard to do
because living isnt worth living without you
