so we live out in our old van
travel all across this land
me and you
and well end up hand in hand
somewhere down on the sand
just me and you

chorus
just as free
free as well ever be
just as free
free as well ever be

verse 2
we drive until the city lights
dissolve into a country sky
just me and you
lay underneath the harvest moon
do all the things that lovers do
just me and you

chorus
just as free
free as well ever be
just as free
free as well ever be
and ever be
