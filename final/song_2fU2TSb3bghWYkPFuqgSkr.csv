just the other day it was a just dream to make it
just the other day that same dream they tried to take it
just the other day all you wanna do is see em be great
just the other day they look you in your face eyes full of hate
bobby kritical

chorus
just the other day i was goddamn broke
you got a five i got a five lets smoke

verse 1
just other day i was broke as a bitch
walking to work in the hot sun sosoaking it in
i never been a dope man but im the dopest of man
buying some smoke from the dude with the dope

im tryna get my fucking goals not goyard
paying for the lawyers get my bros out the courtyard
cause i got the ear for the flows not mozart but damn a nigga go hard
put me on a postcard or miss me til the show start
my niggas got a benz and he push it like a gocart
tryna get one of them but my aunts like dont start

verse 2
today today i woke up like this
my girl on my left no watch on my wrist
some rings on my fist what we did last night damn
was it a hurricane in here last night
it would appear that something sexual or severe happened
being that i see liquor and beer weed
people still in the living room sleep
come and see huh
she say im dizzy dont wanna move just wanna lay under me
honestly i know that just the other day you was goddamn broke
watch outside that nigga shot them folks
glock in ya ride you gotta watch them folks
and the cops be wilding we aint even provoke em
i remember being broker than i is right now
tryna find a place to live shit im is right now
in doubt of my next move get a pill bite down find focus
i grab pen it was poetry in motion
not the same for many folks different strokes
colloquialism idiot vision yall seen i was doing the most
definite dope its on the scene not in need of a vote
repping the city whats ya team nigga fuck em
east atlanta king and i mean every letter
but when im good im good when im bad im better
the man of the method its a method to the madness
im stepping in my bag with the cannon step back
repping the city showing love that i dont ever get back
but thats the plight of a player plot an attack and rocking and rapping
rippin rappers off of the fuckin map suckers suffering succotash
i need that mark zucker bag zuckerberg
hovercraft flows i dont fuck with that bullshit below
from the ceiling to the floor full schizo for the dough
dual pistol but i know im planting seeds so they can grow
but if they dont then i dont know
but all i know is nigga
chorus
just the other day i was goddamn broke
you got a five i got a five lets smoke
just the other day i was running from them folks
like woah woah nigga you too slow
just the other day i was telling all my bros
woah woah nigga its time to go woah woah
just the other day i was goddamn broke
just the other day i was yeah10embed"
