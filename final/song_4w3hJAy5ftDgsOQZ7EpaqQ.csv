i cant let nothing come in between the two of us
cause its like youre all i need since weve been together
and whenever im in need of a little love
its okay for me to open up
but i just cant give my heart to anyone girl

prechorus
some only come in your life for a season
and stay a while giving you a reason
to take temporary and think that its forever
but youve given me someone that i can believe in
i know that there will be times we cant come to an agreement
but i know well figure out the ups and downs
tell me are you willing to take a chance
baby if so

chorus
here we go here we go
let me put you in my hands
come on come on
i wanna be your man
lets do it right so that youll be with me a lifetime
cause you know and i know
dont think that im talking crazy
come on
your mama and my mama want some grandbabies tonight
would you be with me a lifetime

i used to think it was hopeless and i should just give it up give it up
but i couldnt stop until i found myself a good girl to be in love
i checked every state and city and looked all around the world
and im proud to say that my search ends here
cause youre one in a million to me
and i cant let you go baby

prechorus
some only come in your life for a season
and stay a while giving you a reason
to take temporary and think that its forever
and youve given me someone that i can believe in
i know that there will be times we cant come to an agreement
but i know well figure out the ups and downs
tell me are you willing to take a chance
baby if so

chorus
here we go here we go
let me put you in my hands
come on come on
i wanna be your man
lets do it right so that youll be with me a lifetime
cause you know and i know
you know i aint talking crazy
come on
your mama and my mama want some grandbabies tonight
would you be with me a lifetime
interlude
listen seasons are truly meant to chance
however love can be the reason you fall
but when you find that special someone
youll be willing to give them a lifetime
i love you and i choose you
follow me

prechorus
some only come in your life for a season
and stay a while giving you a reason
to take temporary and think that its forever
and youve given me someone that i can believe in
i know that there will be times we cant come to an agreement
but i know well figure out the ups and downs
tell me are you willing to take a chance
baby if so

chorus
here we go here we go
let me put you in my hands
come on come on
i wanna be your man
lets do it right so that youll be with me a lifetime
cause you know and i know
you know i aint talking crazy
