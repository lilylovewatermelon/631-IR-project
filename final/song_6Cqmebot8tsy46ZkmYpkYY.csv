i got my start on the street
with a monkey next to me
shake you hand for a dollar
if youre nice kiss your cheek
to my left i can see chinese
flipping bowls to their head from there feet yo
strolling on the scene
are my arch enemies
break dancers take your crowd your girl your money
balloon mans telling to turn down please
and the psychic agrees
i begin to see that

prechorus
oh oh
im home
im right where i belong
and theres nowhere else id rather be

chorus
because those moments on the street
when the crowd will rock with me
i felt like the biggest man
the biggest man in los angeles
all i really need
are some ears to hear me dream
ill feel like the biggest man
the biggest man in los angeles
standing on the street
you might also likejust standing in the street

verse 2
a trombone cuts deep through the crowd
doing motown moves with his hat tucked down
a belly dancer passes the tip jar around
and the men are confused slightly aroused
muslims christians preaching
wishing i would shut up so the people could listen
im sposed to cut through all this noise
with my little voice
i begin to see that

pre chorus
oh oh
im home
im right where i belong
and theres nowhere else id rather be

chorus
because those moments on the street
when the crowd will rock with me
i felt like the biggest man
the biggest man in los angeles
all i really need
are some ears to hear me dream
ill feel like the biggest man
the biggest man in los angeles
standing on the street
just standing in the street

bridge
and the day goes dark
i pack my car
and stare out at the ocean
take some time
a quiet smile
let it all just soak in

because those moments on the street
when the crown will rock with me
i felt like the biggest man
the biggest man in los angeles
you see all i really need
for my life to feel complete
are some eears to hear me dream
some ears to hear me dream

chorus
yes those moments on the street
when the crowd will rock with me
i felt like the biggest man
the biggest man in los angeles
all i really need
are some ears to hear me dream
ill feel like the biggest man
the biggest man in los angeles
standing on the street
yeah

just standing on the street oh
just standing on the street
just standing on the street2embed"
