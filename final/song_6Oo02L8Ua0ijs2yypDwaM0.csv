im forty years old
and it looks like the end of the rainbow aint no pot of gold
the things that ive done
i doubt anyone will remember after im gone
the places ive been
theres some id go back to and some where i wont go again
and most of the time im feelin like im fadin into the night

chorus
but when im with you
i feel like a dreamer
thats had all his dreams come true
like my skies are all blue
when im with you

verse 2
i got a good job
and im thankful to be workin when so many good peoplе are not
sometimes i cant stand
how my back and my hands
thеy wont work like they used to
somewhere in my mind
im still searchin for something i know that im not gonna find
when i know for sure
ive got so much more
than a man ever needs

when im with you
i feel like a dreamer
thats had all his dreams come true
like my skies are all blue
when im with you
