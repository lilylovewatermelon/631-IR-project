get some brand new kicks couple hundred on the jeans
i been spendin all this money got me feelin like a g
handmedown gear this some shit you never seen
droppin three stacks now im so fresh so clean

girls see me like damn you look good now you cleaned up
feelin fresh got my teeth brushed
ima new kid been waitin to do this
they hatin up on my plate got some steak and its ruth chris
been feelin like a true pimp biatch
its 05 im the steelers you the seahawks
this weed i keep hittin makin me cough
the jolly giant im jack smokin the beanstalk
i get hoes in boat shoes style i wont lose
welcome to the old school bitch

chorus
now my clothes look cleaner and my kicks look flyer
we be buyin more reefer so my crew gettin high
now the girls keep callin and the money keep comin
i be jumpin off the bridge but ima hit the ground runnin
when the fuck will i wake up wake up

cause every single day somethin new to do

ima keep on dreamin be the straightup best
and im blessed everyday im gettin straightup fresh
my homies like mac damn you get your cake up

high school sellin mixtapes in the hallway
i bet they never thought id be this cool
now they understand why i skip school
had my dreams wasnt worried at all
thats why if im gettin bored i go splurge at the mall
i got money i got money i got bitches i got bitches
i got everything they dreamin of and i aint done shit yet
this major leagues big business
used to have a wish list now i just give gifts
shit it make me happy
heres how to reach me you can get at me

now my clothes look cleaner and my kicks look flyer
we be buyin more reefer so my crew gettin high
now the girls keep callin and the money keep comin
i be jumpin off the bridge but ima hit the ground runnin
when the fuck will i wake up wake up
i ask em when the fuck will i wake up wake up
cause every single day somethin new to do
so ima keep on dreamin hit snooze snooze

i ask em when the fuck will i wake up wake up
cause every single day somethin new to do
so ima keep on dreamin hit snooze snooze

i ask em when the fuck will i wake up wake up
cause every single day somethin new to do
