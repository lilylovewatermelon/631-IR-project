intro zz hill sample
i hear you in the background
whenever i phone
tellin your brother
to say youre gone

chorus
sample
youve been trippin around uptown
wooin some fancy clown

girls mother and viktor vaughn
put your sister on the phone
yo its viktor

verse 1 viktor vaughn
i knew you was ing around
playing all innocent and hoing since the foundation
dont make me have to pound his tin crown face in
and risk being jammed up like traffic inbound from space and
theres been a place for you in my heart since we first met
a teenage love that didnt feel no hurt yet
my boys warned me you was poison like bbd first cassette
and still i put my chips on the worse bet
gave up the skirt now i gotta hear it from the street
how dare you drag my name in the dirt and cheat
you couldve broke it off ended it and dipped
and if you spoke us off we couldve still preserved the friendship
now you apologize thats what they all say
you wasnt sorry when you sucked him off in the hallway
but have it your way raw— no foreplay
thats you if you want a dude who wear a mask all day
and just to think i used to be proud of you
and you had some real good power

youve been trippin around uptown
wooin some fancy clown
no it wasnt it wasnt nothing like that
well my brother he didnt tell me you had called
i wasnt at home

verse 2 viktor vaughn
probably kissed me later that evening i should be hurling
matter fact gimme back my bracelet and my shearling
i rather waste it or give it to your girlfriend
she did let me stab it last week while you was workin
remember our vacation out to maryland
i duked the maid carolyn she made me throw the towel in
like all foul men the time i hit your moms off
i told her knock it off but she had to set the rocket off
aint enough room in this ing town
when you see tin head tell him be ducking down
im not rompin around he better be
ready and prepared to be stomped in the ground
