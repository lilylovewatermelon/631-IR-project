stay young and at the top of our lungs
our hands are free our lives have just begun

verse 1
its getting dark we should go back
but whats the use if what you love is what you have
and i could die right now
for something beautiful to take me somewhere else
oh i i try

chorus
but i cant calm down as i drag myself along
these severed hands are doing the very best they can

verse 2
im gonna buy a cheap bouquet before it dies on the display
gonna break down break down the better side of me
the better side of me
well i know i know if i die young
then we can wake up screaming in your bed
and our lungs are begging us to calm down

chorus
and i scare myself with all that talk of severing
doing the best or so it seems
see pierce the veil liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likebridge
youve been mistaken your fingers on the scale
burn like you never have before
stop drop and roll wont work in hell
so what if i forget regret
so what if i oh
so what if i forget regret
i want you to know that i
that ive wrote this line a thousand times yeah
forget regret
this must be the way it ends

chorus
calm down as i drag myself along
these severed hands are doing the very best they can
as i drive my car into the sea
i taste you like a fucking hammer through my teeth

outro
will someone tell me what it means to be alive
it feels just like the feeling when you die
oh alright
im dead and i dont care if its cold outside anymore
so come on lets have some fucking fun4embed"
