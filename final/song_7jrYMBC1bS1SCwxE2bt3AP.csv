you said at the party that i was too drunk
i told you i liked you you said sober up
but why would i lie its so clear im in love
with you
a tense conversation you like someone else
i say if i waited could that maybe help
you told me that patience wont change how you felt
for me

prechorus
so ill stop being pretentious and loathing our friendship
you taught me a lesson that love isnt precious
its not like the novels no pride and prejudice at all

chorus
so ill just take a footnote in your life
and you could take my body
every linе i would write for you
but a footnote will do
a footnote will do

verse 2
wе ate at a restaurant the host said were cute
they think were a couple they bought us some booze
we shared the moscato and laughed cause its true
to me me
oh and id be embarrassed if i werent so pleased
that everyone else sees what you never see
were perfect together but ill never be the one
you might also likeprechorus
so ill stop being pretentious and loathing our friendship
you taught me a lesson that feelings are reckless
its just like the novels side characters end up alone

chorus
so ill just take a footnote in your life
and you could take my body
every line i would write for you
but a footnote will do
a footnote will do
a footnote will do

outro
please dont forget me
forget me a footnote will do
please dont forget me
forget me a footnote will do
please dont forget me
forget me a footnote will do
please dont forget me
forget me a footnote will do
a footnote will do
forget a footnote will do
a footnote will do6embed"
