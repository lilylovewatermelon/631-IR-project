i remember waiting’ by the curb with mr murphy
when daddy picked me up from school his eyes were red
we drove to the hospital in a hurry
where my family gathered round my grandpa’s bed
he was my best friend
he taught me how to fish
and i cried listening to my daddy pray
for one of those i’ve loved along the way
she had a ribbon in her hair the day i met her
that whole next year we couldn’t get enough
and after graduation she took off for denver
and for a while we both tried to keep in touch
she was my best friend
and it broke my heart
but i don’t regret the day that she became
one of those i’ve loved along the way
and i hope they know
i never would made it this far on my own
where would we all be without those
fathers and mothers sisters and brothers
the friends i’ve made the long lost lovers
i wouldn’t be who i am today
if not for those i’ve loved along the way
along the way
now i’m just a country boy with a guitar
looking’ back down this old road i’ve been traveling’ on
it was never about trying’ to be some big star
for me it’s always been about these songs
you see they’re my best friends
they’re the life i live
and i hope they put a smile on the face
of those that i’ve loved along the way
because i wouldn’t be the man i am today
if not for those i’ve loved along the way
along the way
