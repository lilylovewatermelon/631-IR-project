verse 1
shrug us off our shoulders
we dont do what they told us
so i dont wanna be another face in the crowd
so i cant slow it down no
so i cant slow it down no
they write us off and say its just another opinion
im tired of trying to fit in when im one in a million
so i cant slow it down no
no i cant slow it down no

prechorus
im never gonna follow
just because they say so
im never gonna let go let go
of this high

chorus
ive already hit the low oh oh oh oh
ive already felt the cold oh oh oh oh

never giving in never going back
already fell below oh oh oh oh
i fell deeper than the snow oh oh oh oh
so im never giving up never gonna crack im
never giving in never going back
