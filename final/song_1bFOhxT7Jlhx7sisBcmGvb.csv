if you hear music from down the street
and you find yourself tapping your feet
just ease on by if you want to
theres only one thing expected of you

dance a little dance drink a little wine
come on in the waters fine

chorus 2
enjoy yourself let it all hang out
and youll know exactly what im talking about
if you come on over without a doubt
youll enjoy yourself

verse 2
now you dont have to wonder what to wear
what in the world are you doing alone over there
while were having a ball just shaking it loose
now come on sweet baby aint no excuse
