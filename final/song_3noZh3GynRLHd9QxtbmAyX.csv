it was a beautiful day the sun beat down
i had the radio on i was drivin
trees went by me and del were singin little runaway
i was flyin

chorus
yeah runnin down a dream that never would come to me
workin on a mystery goin wherever it leads
runnin down a dream

verse 2
i felt so good like anything was possible
hit cruise control and rubbed my eyes
the last three days the rain was unstoppable
it was always cold no sunshine

chorus
yeah runnin down a dream that never would come to me
workin on a mystery goin wherever it leads
runnin down a dream

bridge
i rolled on the sky grew dark
i put the pedal down to make some time
theres something good waitin down this road
im pickin up whatevers mine
