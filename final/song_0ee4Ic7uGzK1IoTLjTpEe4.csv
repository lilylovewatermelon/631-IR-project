coldness blackened no sound feel no pain
captured helpless ultimate dreadful fate
powerless lifeless no breath falling down

darkness lost destiny endless far outcry despair they hear you fear no more
coldness numb feeling blackened whole dizziness no sound deep scars feel no pain
captured no sanity helpless body aching ultimate control your dreadful fate
powerless invisible lifeless real enemy no breath ruin your mind falling deep down

deep deep down to the basement
replacement goes as placement
big bucks payment or dirty like enslavement
began to lose patience
to these complacent
successors who assesses rules that assassinate us
what
me
lot of confidence but far from vanity
reason why i got a crew behind me my family
even if you try to bribe me
never ride believe in beauty of destiny its fire
darkness endless
darker the blood the fresher the flesh
despair
but darker the soul the lesser the heart
fear no more
the lessons untaught
coldness blackened
yo backside of tv to somes like dv
no sound feel no pain
bottomless dark so may not for the weak kids
captured helpless
underestimated way of brainwashing illuminated
ultimate dreadful fate
bunch of hallucination but to somes elucidation
powerless lifeless
hell nah wont cave im an outlaw outlaw
no breath falling down
switch my style counterattack from the south paw
you might also likedarkness lost destiny endless far outcry despair they hear you fear no more
coldness numb feeling blackened whole dizziness no sound deep scars feel no pain
captured no sanity helpless body aching ultimate control your dreadful fate
powerless invisible lifeless real enemy no breath ruin your mind falling deep down

nowadays many people abuse informations better choose
recognize the source of course or get accused soon
be careful who you choose to speak in back room
jealousy jealousy running like sonic boom
its messed up how anger and hatred looms large in the dark
leaving scars to some by whos fumed
ive got my third eye to see through their costumes
lies after lies middle finger from lotus juice
darkness endless
this potholes beyond dark bizarre so intriguing
despair fear no more
lost ones drunk off of pool of money dreaming
coldness blackened
damn some still battling against these demons
no sound feel no pain
brave souls even screaming oh please jesus
captured helpless
money makes the world go around who the richest
ultimate dreadful fate
mother theresa but they never listen to me
powerless lifeless
kept dressing with a fake coverage
no breath falling down
spitfire burns these dreads baby baby baby
darkness lost destiny endless far outcry despair they hear you fear no more
coldness numb feeling blackened whole dizziness no sound deep scars feel no pain
captured no sanity helpless body aching ultimate control your dreadful fate
powerless invisible lifeless real enemy no breath ruin your mind falling deep down

darkness darkness darkness darkness

darkness lost destiny endless far outcry despair they hear you fear no more
coldness numb feeling blackened whole dizziness no sound deep scars feel no pain
captured no sanity helpless body aching ultimate control your dreadful fate
powerless invisible lifeless real enemy no breath ruin your mind falling deep down

yeah

backside to everything but were gonna bring it up
even if i die my wordsll live bring it up
until my last breath never ever gonna give it up

but we aint gonna be fooled by these sickness
my brain is safe and sound with pure goodness
darkness endless
