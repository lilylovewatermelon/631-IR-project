im the apocalypse
with a fat lip
i never did
and i still dont give a shit
im such an outcast
you swore id never last
i got news for you
this aint my last dance

prechorus
this aint my last dance

chorus
ive given it all given it all
ive given everything for you
ive given you all given you all
what more do you want me to do

ive taken the fall taken the fall
ive given everything to you
ive given my all given my all
will it ever be enough for you

verse 2
i am your nemesis
i dont regret this
i wrote the fucking book
with no consensus
born to live fast
you said id never last
