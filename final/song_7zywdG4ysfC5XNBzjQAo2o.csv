hard on the side of my head
i just learned to stay out of his way
there been street fights blue lights long nights
with the world sittin on my chest
it just showed me how much i can take
hard times bad luck
sometimes life sucks

thats alright
im okay
it aint nothin but another day
but only god knows where id be
if you ever stop lovin me

the bank man the bossman the law man
all tryin to get their hands on me
and i aint even done a damn thing wrong
ive been waylaid freight trained short changed
by bigger and badder men
and all ive got to say is bring it on
hard rain rough roads so my life goes

thats alright
im okay
it aint nothin but another day
but only god knows where id be
if you ever stop loving me
you might also likei need you
gotta have you
in my life by my side
every day im alive
every night that im breathin
im needin you

thats alright
im okay
it aint nothin but another day
but only god knows where id be
if you ever stop loving me

aint nothin but another day
but only god knows where id be
if you ever stop loving me2embed"
