look i dont know whats gotten into me
i could be off of my rocker potentially
bigger i get the more they thinkin less of me
dont be the one to insult my integrity
put down the whistle im done with you referees
yall dont know nothing you think you ejected me
til i show up in the game like remember me
i gotta make it these people depend on me
ayy thats how im living these days
threaten my wife keep digging that grave
i had a job making minimum wage
told myself that i gotta get paid
prove myself yeah get up my grades
walk into class like gimme that a
think im trash put a bag in your face
and i put you by the road like look were the same
heres a reminder that i still spit
think i need to advise you to watch your lip
or at least realize that im not no kid
dont google my name tryna find my crib
write a pop song then i write a song like this
do a lot wrong doesnt matter i learn quick
im an outlaw my brain has no fence
doesnt matter either way to me cause even if it did
i would destroy it woo woo woo
used to be employee now im employer
making big deals now i gotta get lawyers
people tell me to relax and enjoy it
but when i kick back i see warnings
so much time might pass cant ignore it
every time i rap and im recording
might be my last so i absorb it cause
see nf liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likechorus

verse 2
tool bag without the pliers
intros without the choirs
new car without the tires
music without the writers
ufc without the fighters
smoking without the fire
cigarettes without the lighter
austin powers no michael myers thats me
if i aint got the bars you see
something aint right like im incomplete
outcast yes im a different breed
if you disagree make em all retreat
act like a boss when i compete
take my thoughts into hyperspeed
when its all gone and i hit my peak
at least ill know that i took that leap
cause life is a process
and i am not here for the nonsense
losing everything i worked for likes to weigh on my conscience
that why i block out the comments
whos next whos next
i dont know i aint been watching
closing my ear to the gossip
i gotta make it or make it
man these are the options ooh
no forfeit my course different
changed flows and im bored with it
more livid never more driven i avoid timid
try to tell me i could never be the goat of rap i ignore limits
i was born with this youre trippin thinkin im slippin
im enjoying this
look at me im on the tour selling more tickets
even if the fourth record didnt sell a copy ima do it like a hobby
i aint quitting til the lord tell me
chorus
i gotta make it or make it
i gotta make it or make it yeah

man these are the options these are the options
i gotta make it or make it
i gotta make it or make it woo
i gotta make it or make it
man these are the options these are the options
i gotta make it or make it
i gotta make it or make it woo
