ey3zlow on the beat

verse 1
ayy where all of my city girls at
north miami where it all goes down
heard it aint no pity where youre at
and your dad dont know that your soul in lost and found

refrain
she dont want love
she dont love no one but herself
all she really cares about is a lacefront weave
and the boutiques from chanel

verse 2
what about lust
what about lust do you trust yourself
anytime you walk out the door
its a bag full of ones and lame nigga under your belt
but i wont judge
i wont judge dont judge yourself
promise im not here to burden you
im here to help nah for real

chorus
if youre looking for someone to change your life change your life
i can be the one who can change your life
if youre looking for someone who can change your life
baby i can be the one that can change your life
and i know that youre young and youre filled with life
aint no need to be ashamed i dont judge nor bite
if youre looking for someone who can change your life
aint no need to cry baby wipe your eyes

she dont want love
she dont love no one but herself
only thing she cares about is a lacefront weave
and the boutiques from chanel
she dont want love
she dont want love from no one else
she dont want love
she dont love no one but herself

verse 3
i wanna amuse you oh let me use you
all for the good not for the bad i wont abuse you
wont say i need you just scared to lose you
put down your pride see through your eyes somebody bruised you
know what you been through i wont avenge you
act like you mad act like you sad yet but yet pretend to
say you love honesty but yet it offends you
just hit my line i got some lovin i could lend you

chorus
if youre looking for someone to change your life change your life
i can be the one who can change your life
if youre looking for someone who can change your life
baby i can be the one that can change your life
and i know that youre young and youre filled with life
aint no need to be ashamed i dont judge nor bite
if youre looking for someone who can change your life
aint no need to cry baby wipe your eyes
refrain
she dont want love
she dont love no one but herself
all she really cares about is a lacefront weave
and a bag thats from chanel
she dont want love
she dont want love from no one else
she dont want love
all she love is herself24embed"
