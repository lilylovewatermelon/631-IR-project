verse 2 tyler the creator
i wrote a song about you i want your opinion
opposite of my heart rate it slows down at the ending
cause the love i got for you has exceeded appearance
the lyrics are—
matter of fact ima just call you so you can hear it
if you do answer ill play it to state facts
although i already know the response you gon say back
at that point ill hang up disappear and just stay back
and if you dont ill leave a voicemail with the playback
outro
hello no one is available to take your call
please leave a message after the tone
