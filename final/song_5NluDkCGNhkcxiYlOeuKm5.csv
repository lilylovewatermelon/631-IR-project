but i wont be blue always
cause the sun is gonna shine round my back door someday

im going down to the river
im gonna take me a rocking chair
and if the blues dont leave i rock on away from here

trouble in mind im blue
but i wont be blue always
cause the sun is gonna shine in my back door someday

trouble in mind thats true
i have almost lost my mind
life aint worth living i feel like i could die

trouble in mind im blue
my poor heart is healing slow
ive never had such trouble in my whole life before

im gonna lay my head
on some lonesome railroad line
and let that 219 special ease my troubled mind

trouble in mind im blue
but i wont be blue always
cause the sun is gonna shine in my back door somedayyou might also likeembed"
