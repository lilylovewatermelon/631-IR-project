razaville texas houston to mcallen
deep in san anto screw ritchie valenz
rollin through dallas boritos and corpus
odessa laredo the locos in austin
texas made mexicans north of the border
land of the free smoking weed with my gordo
motherfuckers laid back in yo cadillac
let me jump in this shit like back to back
stay real for life roll down south
for the wreckshop for the hometown crowd
my alias is that gohardmexican
flowin through your veins like medicine
wanna be down on the htown
real ballas fight for the rebound
btown to motherfuckin gtown
creep around everybody gd out
cant see how you can dawg me out
make me out take me out
deep south my hood got more slack
than eightyeight cowboys ridin on horse back
top that the mexicans all that
strike like a snake and attack like a bobcat

verse 2 baby bash
ho ass niggas there aint nothing worse
they do it for panurch but i do it for the purse
and im still on the search sometime i go to church
seven deuce old school cadillac with the skirts
and i speak for motherfuckers on the couch and the flo
cause a mexican like my self is out for the dough
but ya already know if you got big pelotas
anybody now a days might be the chotas
a young baby beesh he dont fuck with police
and all beat the dog shit out your nephew and niece
if they ever get the snitching yelling telling and singing
ima call the whole squad and some heads gone be ringing
im dope house scout fuck a set up and no hear though

verse 9 quota

cause ima street hustler twenty thousand miles just this summer
ever since the first day of june ive been on a come up
got that boomerang fro once i throw it in the pot

feds tap my house phone and they still out of order
im the son of a preacher man momma knows im thuggin
and i should of been a chef the way i cook crack up your oven mit
teachers taught us “just say no” i had to hustle though
either that or stay broke didnt want to struggle so
buy half and eight ball hit the block runnin
though the world was mine till i saw the cops coming
and its too late

verse 10 lowg
my homie died and the cops called it drug related
i was standing right there when his mother fainted
and i felt trapped cause i know i gotta shoot straight
i grabbed my nina and made that bitch loose weight
since eightyeight with a nick in my tube socks
i been a g since you was tryin to do the moonwalk
im from a place that they call honduras
nothing fake about my life except my car insurance
bullet proof vest my jefa sense stress
nothing positive about me except my piss test
i grew up in a house full of empty stomachs
while other kids was at mcdonalds getting twenty nuggets
and im known all across the ghettos
why you think the fuckin laws all up on my huevos
my chrome spits and im know to chase ho clicks
not there at the club dancing with a glow sticks
