for what you did to me and what ill do to you
you get what everyone else gets you get a lifetime go
lets go

verse 1
do you remember that day when we met
you told me this gets harder well it did
been holdin on forever
promise me that when ive gone youll kill my enemies

chorus
the damage youve inflicted temporary wounds
im comin back from the dead
and ill take you home with me
im taking back a life you stole

postchorus
we never got that far
this helps me to think all through the night
woahohohohoh bright lights that wont kill me now or tell me how
just you and i your starless eyes remain

verse 2
hiphiphooray for me you talk to me
but would you kill me in my sleep lay still like the dead
from the razor to the rosary we could lose ourselves
and paint these walls in pitchfork red
see my chemical romance liveget tickets as low as 445you might also likechorus
i will avenge my ghost with every breath i take
im comin back im comin back from the dead from the dead im comin back
and ill take you home with me
im takin back a life you stole

bridge
this hole you put me in wasnt deep enough
and im climbin out right now
youre running out of places to hide from me

outro
when you go just know that i will remember you
if livin was the hardest part well then one day be together
and in the end well fall apart
just like the leaves changin colors
and then i will be with you
i will be there one last time now
when you go just know that i will remember you
ive lost my fear of falling
i will be with you i will be with you26embed"
