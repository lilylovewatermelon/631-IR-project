tyler we uh i i know its short notice but i i i brought all your friends here
for some reason i couldnt get a hold of taco and jasper
but i just brought all your friends here to talk to you
because theyre theyre really worried bout you
and i thought it would be better if they could talk to you

verse 1 domo genesis
it was all a dream i used to read complex magazines
when i rhyme im tryna get pictures in high times
smoke trees and see my dreams hanging in the skyline
swanton bomb off the bed into a fine dime
in my mind im just tryna smoke the finest
and get high sticking bad heinas in vaginas
im the flyest when it come to this fire when i come to spit
i am getting higher when the lighter comes in front of this
im a stoner yeah yeah yeah you get the picture now
thirtythousand feet gon make it hard for me to simmer down
another flight another beat another city wow
thus another couple bitches crying when i kick em out

chorus domo genesis
where we at where we at
where we at where we at
we on top of the world where we at

and five minutes from suicide i biked it to the park
i walked onto the block met a guy burgundy preme snapback wolf
hurling himself at cars and flirting with blonde cadillacs ah
all was gray all was gray frankie had the blues in fact
bunch of pale hipster girls pretty but they booty flat
teenage males couldnt tell i was going through it
had a wallet full of cream amex green bimmer almost black
parked in front the studio bastards recorded at
earl gilbert tyler hodgy domo left taco nakel
sydney lionel juan michael jasper hal and matt
bet im missing several but i had to bring that pattern back
we live inside a house that says fuck em on the welcome mat
deep inside the ear canals of bill oreillys daughter thats where im at where we at

chorus frank ocean

verse 3 hodgy
swell motions get promotions to my whole team

shine chandelier bright might give you nose bleeds
we at randys ordering that 306
milk and glaze is the greed gold mix
me your bitch is comin along yeah she hum to my song
singing like they were for her but they were for the blur
no longer but we were in premature immature
shes unsure im for sure blouse and dress and my shirt
on the floor then pick it up out the door door
chased an imaginary friend a reverie absorption
impregnate the dream until it has an abortion
chorus hodgy

verse 4 mike g
everything they say id never have im seein
now i bet they see that we ballin like allstar weekend

they say life switches pace when you got shit made
so im just tryna get paid dont you remember the days
when your dreams were the only thing that kept you sane
and too often they think that they could stop me
now every show we makin half a maserati
and the only thing blocking me is paparazzi
now its gold rolexs if they try to clock me
everything stay in the box like fighters in hockey
miss me if youre thinking we slack work hard
i got the world sayin every single friday is black

verse 5 tyler the creator
down to fucking earth huh down to fucking earth huh
fuck everybody here goes some extra girth sir
you fucking critics are making my nerves hurt
since im saying fuck everybody i guess that im a fucking pervert
my window is a book and im a fucking crook
stealing phones to call home but the line is off the hook
my mom aint paid the bill guess i cant pay it either
i aint signed a fucking deal yet
but when i do clancy and david are taking percentages
that could pay the whole fucking citys mortgage
hopefully i make a lot of porridge from tourin in fucking oregon
from playing piano organs and hopefully i can pay the bill
shit is getting real people begin to feel
like im changing but theyre complaining making big fucking deals
about some shit they bitch and pout
can we get backstage man — no faggot its sold out
come on why you holding out i thought we was boys
without me you wouldnt be tyler the creator youre from the dirty
i can tell whenever you perform a leopard cant change its spots
but im a fucking unicorn — whatever man

verse 6 tyler the creator

asshole have none
how can i wake up on the wrong side of the bed when i dont even fucking have one

and when im on that stage i feel important
