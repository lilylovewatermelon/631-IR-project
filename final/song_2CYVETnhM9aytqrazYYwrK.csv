mr perfect face mr here to stay
mr looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away
everything was right mr ive been waitin for you all my life
mr every single day until the end i will be by your side

prechorus
but that was when i got to know mr change of heart
mr leaves me all alone i fall apart
it takes everything in me just to get up each day
but its wonderful to see that youre okay

chorus
hello mr perfectly fine
hows your heart after breakin mine
mr always at the right place at the right time baby
hello mr casually cruel
mr everything revolves around you
ive been miss misery since your goodbye
and youre mr perfectly fine

verse 2
mr never told me why mr never had to see me cry
mr insincere apology so he doesnt look like the bad guy
he goes about his day forgets he ever even heard my name
well i thought you might be different than the rest i guess youre all the same
