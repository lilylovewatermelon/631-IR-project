baby everything is all right uptight out of sight
baby everything is all right uptight out of sight

verse 1
im a poor mans son from across the railroad tracks
the only shirt i own is hanging on my back
but im the envy of every single guy
since im the apple of my girls eye
when we go out stepping on the town for a while
my moneys low and my suits out of style
but its all right if my clothes arent new
out of sight because my heart is true

chorus
she says baby everything is alright uptight out of sight
baby everything is alright uptight clean out of sight

verse 2
shes a pearl of a girl i guess thats what you might say
i guess her folks brought her up that way
the right side of the tracks she was born and raised
in a great big old house full of butlers and maids
she says no one is better than i i know im just an average guy
no football hero or smooth don juan
got empty pockets you see im a poor mans son
cant give her the things that money cant buy
but ill never never never make my baby cry
you might also likechorus
and its all right what i cant do
out of sight because my heart is true
she says baby everything is alright uptight clean out of sight
baby everything is all right uptight clean out of sight
baby everything is all right uptight hahahahaha yeah
baby everything is all right uptight way out of sight
baby everything is all right uptight clean out of sightembed"
