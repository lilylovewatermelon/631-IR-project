some said i wasnt gonna show up
well thats what the talk was about
but i showed up to the showdown
to show off when the shows on for all of the crowd
the giant was asleep silently in peace
i advised him to move quietly and sneak beside me but try and be discreet
because if i wake therell be wakes and im no longer tired in the sheets
you woke goliath just as it was time for him to eat and climb into his sethat
the king the new chapter i move faster i put aside my pride so my pride can get a feast
fuck your stripes you tigers seem like newtimers trying to compete
i thought you were the main man all that raw talk and youre just lyin through your teeth

oh this is what you waited for me and you waging war
on a stage for the sake of talk so lets make em talk
its unfair youve been scared since the day started taking course
ive plagued his thoughts but im not here to take your title tony
im here to take your corpse

see it was the real deal when real deal said to give tony a tony award
but i got me some rhymes thatll leave him hospitalised
i came to give tony a ward
class in session
the rulers back with straight lines with drastic measures
your caskets measured practice makes perfect
but ive practised to the point where im past perfection
im just battling my past perfections
they say practice what you preach
but i dont preach you can ask the reverend
its been a minute since i asked for blessings in my last confession
i dont preach i teach and ive got pupils thatll look you in your pupils
and raise arms like theyre asking questions but they dont ask me questions
you need to give a man of my class room stay back like you have detention
you cant take away from ad
i taught math a lesson
im unschoolable
they havent given ad a lesson since adolescence
test me and fail f your circle you wont pass the papers
ill smoke him  pass the papers
fuck dough its linguine linguistics  pasta papers
im trying to give my nation dough my donation to battle rap is past eurghs papers
time to pay your pastor papers
youre about to be baptised with bars
so dont whine when the pastor passed the wafers
tony ds dead you want to know what he passed away for
im the predator hes the same as when you ask your saviour for a massive favour
and when prey meets predator thats just nature
but holy shoulder blades  gods back
you are not martyrs  i said  you do not matter
its got like if youre godlike im gods fathers godfather
since i left ive been streaming it rowan
it seems its upstream that youre rowin
and you havent got farther
you put shuffle and marloon but couldnt brand dough
so you brought back the godfather
and i couldnt bear it its tragic
that tear in the fabric is something ill patch he knows
al pacino im on my tony shit
montana not tony as in this older prick
who defends a title that dont exist im over pissed
ill film a porno of your only chick just to show you it
i mean ill make your bitch wail and we can see your baby moby dicked
jesus faeces  holy shit
ill make a guitar plectrum from your skull if theres a bone to pick
try handle bars and die like hogans lip
ive got a boot i turned sideways i rock jabronis with
you hyped with your mouth im at the side of your house
ssh  right where smokey shits
snub nose in my scruff clothes eat shorts like homers kid
who was last seen in tonys crib
looking like scarface in the last seen with tonys crib
thats my first round in safe star blessed
ive got two more rounds and plenty more space in my graveyard left
you might also likeround 1 tony d
they said it wouldnt be a fair fight
if i battled in manny vers shotty
i said i hear that
just means his people wont have that far to carry his body
thats why i im standing here cocky
you fucking with the wrong man
this patch of stage islamic state
your heads coming off  on cam
god damn this one im running wild
so they gon find this cats head in a bag on curry mile
i dont care if we in your home town and habitat
and its your first match back and you jammed it pack with your fans an that
that aint a handicap chap
cause the plan i hatch was to shrink the planets map
show that it exactly matches the same dimensions of this stage where were standing at
now this is my world you find the tone right at home
yeah imagine that i came to shake mans city like arab cash
i used to battle rap on street this more of a stage show
typical city fan to get ate he had to move from the main road
so that pedestal you put him on i knock him off
swinging ricky hatton haymakers these punches body shotts
you got your head on a chopping block
if tone acts like he in the swing of things
its well executed and your nogins off
why is everybody gassing this bottlejob
cause you put that together then i light him up rags
thats a molotov
a lit match and petrol potion this clash the next explosion
big flash the breddah toasted
dispatch with said opponent
impact the second row where
chins crack heads are swollen
ribs smash legs are broken
singed stache his threads are smoking
if you talking spitting raps
this veteran goes and this chat just extra potent
i step to you run you then keep it moving
bitch thats perpetual motion
dont let the brother front like he aint already ducked me once
the night i beat def and cooked that turkey like sunday lunch
i was basking in my glory till these pair of fucking mugs
got on stage made the announcement and stole all my thunder
cunts
he was cool for a couple months
couldnt stomach it got bubble guts and concocted some cover up
about how he got sucker punched
you said you were drunk and in a state and got your cousin or your mate
who by the way mma fighter  rumbles in a cage
to punch you in the face
if its the truth youre fucking waste
if its a lie shotty horroh sorry its up there with the greats
its different level
its  i did not have sexual relations with that woman bill clinton  level
its  they got weapons of mass destruction we gotta get em  level
its  mark duggan had a pistol so we had to hit him  level
its lies and it remind me of a movie
the great white was the star of that jaw story
unconvincing like spielbergs rubber shark
but you know what done your dance
let tony remind ya when them shots fired at shotts fired got shotts fired
cause rowan aint like ya
you got online sand in your swollen vagina
fuck dont flop this fuck dont flop that
couldnt keep the emotion inside ya
we saw the king of the dot footage
all your commotion been cyber
you act worse on the web than toby maguire in his role as a spider
plus the bloke is a liar
and the reason is absurd to me
we didnt battle cause you wanted to earn a fee and
didnt wanna work for free
if you wouldve said that from the jump we would have understood you perfectly
instead he committed purgery to save face when
i know hes fake  i nose his fake thats cosmetic surgery
why dyou do it shotts you really couldnt stop yourself
well you see when you mek up them deh story
you just look like a proper melt
thats why i dont need to kill you cause you already topped yourself
i dont need a crowd or a squad to help
i sonned adam from that dirt he got bodied from that dirt
like im god himself
round 2 shotty horroh

yo after my verse he was like
quick team huddle we need a rebuttle
im in deep trouble
gemini help me scheme something that means double
locksmyth i know you got a name flip or a theme coming and
mr 13 nothing
poisonous poets or e  daniels i break down both your groups
im like the german manager reserving stamina
ill take out tony kroos
it aint a game one line would split toe like shinobi shoes
im not your friend im the foe to try id
ill snap in front of your face like a photo booth
that means try with those heavy hands its metal bands cause
that will be your death tone
you got writers block i came to write on blocks
i aint talking bout your head stone
you got a way with killing words i got a way with killing rappers like
suge knight and death row
so give the lord salutes or its autotune
well give tpain and correct tone
theres levels to this shit
different zones the distance shows
if this is race i dont mean race
were just different tone
how are you still champ
you got beat off ark def chris and osh
i dont see t in that picture unless its with kermit but
thats none of my business though
you said youre a star on top with the presents
fuck all that christmas flow
but you can kiss the game goodbye when youre under this missile toe
if we dont believe him we question marks like riddlers clothes
theyll get the bam bam before we deuce
were too bigelow
bam bam deuce two bigelows
give me dough ill cut his mouth
the docs are gonna need to give him a new cheek
they said wyclef 
i said i did it for a few gs
tone watch your tone cause if toe squeeze in pumps
its new sneaks
stamp him like hot irons
im branding old man like bruce lee thats too deep
cause brandons old man was bruce lee
for this weird diva with his cheerleaders screaming tell em tony
and he keeps them around cause against real deal
he felt very lonely and he couldnt get his head in focus
if he doesnt have the fellas coaching
hell end up choking
but when hes with them
the buzz goes to his head and the pheromones are replaced by serotonin and
that made him forget who the king of this era tone in

but when i finish killing him
meet me at the bar youre all buying drinks for me
i drink for free if not there will be a bar raucous and
i will not miss the t
this knife aint a joke i be like why so serious if you give me cheek
act lemon and get iced if youre not gonna watch your lip then t

but lets talk about the schemes hes thieving
charlie clips told you he bites bars
him in and john john would make a mean allegiance
i mean we seen this against oshea
you had that title snatch scheme and it was seeming decent
but illmac said that to bender
only he said title taken and liam neeson
and if you say you didnt see it chill that
cause you referenced that exact battle at set the standard
when you went against illmac thats real rap
fuck him fuck him prick
lets have him broken up
lets focus on each component that makes tony up
as far as bars hes a poor mans version of chilla jones stuff
that image  is the dnnnons
he loves hollow so much he stole his look
mannerisms well he strokes his nose as much
as loaded lux  have you noticed much
thats why you choke like your opponents holding you in a cobra clutch
cause you watch smack battles
and clone them all itll come across tryna pose like a phony fuck
but we know whats up cause
its hard remembering your bars when you cant remember who you are
t reckons hes trex
he needs his little dot mobb caressing his ass
when hes projecting his bars well
yo tell them they watch me catch this body
then go back and pretend you was hard
or i can watch them catch this body
when i leave this little fucking prick dead in their arms

bruv dont ever try stare me down
you should know your 4 foot nothing likkle ass isnt man enough to
wear my crown
second round in safe star bless
i got two more rounds one more round and
plenty more space in that graveyard left

round 2 tony d

jesus christ im like the second coming
this like premature ejaculation
a lot of shottys fans hearts gon be aching and breaking
when he herb gets smoked early
thats waking and baking
either lose or lose bad
thats the ultimatum you facing
right now he wish he never been born
he matt damon as jason
he was counting on that hometown bias hype you know
my rounds you quiet like church mouse on a silent night
his rounds  even tthis filler is getting twice the hype
you try catch the win by pulling strings
that only working if you flying kites
thats why you die tonight
unless he got an optician that rock with him
is the only way to test the i and i cause
outrhyming man no
thats an impossible task
you still spitting im course advanced
im on swallowing bars so face it
that gas and air like an oxygen mask
you know its lights out
this just a shott in the dark

its a message to his fans
you tell them all to stop jocking
he aint sick he fake it
like when you call your boss coughing ahem hello
you think he dope with a pen
have you heard his version of jump around
shit banging right like unloading a skeng
no reload and focus again and dont let this joker pretend
that whole flow aint stole from grafh romans revenge
now thats too hip hop for some of you
but if you know you know
thats why this cowboy getting spun like a dosido
his punchlines meh he good for a multi though
check tony bro
and my wins vs losses shotty
im christian slater doing very bad things
each scene i plotted body after body shotty
and you nicer than me
what cause you got more fans than me naturally
you actually pursue this for a salary
this something i do 3 times a year on a saturday
you confusing talent with popularity and
i aint with that shit shotts
not as long as pharoahe monch aint outselling rick ross
you getting me pissed off
ill be clear about it too
im like a bitter blindman cause
i dont wanna hear about them views
especially since were being truthful shotts
well attribute 80 of them views you got
to the dark skin yout with locks
who was rocking the gooners top
the rest of your fan base considered lame
cause they between 12 and 15
and got moshteam in their twitter name

you getting slain but they wont be okay with that
theyll be the reason for that grey area
when this white nose fade to black im stating facts
you cant live with me mate im hitting the stage
a class act  like a nativity play
im booked for spitting them flames
my english lit on fire i did the math
same direction but change course to drop science
its not the wisest move if he let his past battles fool him
they elementary universitys for that real advanced schooling
no i said they elementary
you need verse of ts for that real advanced schooling
see i put him to the test
they assess and then grade him
but ask them what they say and then they mmm
change subject cause your art history like cave paintings
the ed you casing private
schooling to the public you feel the tension
i repeatedly wrote lines for punishment
im tryna 3 rass nil your ass still
21 harsh deal to a degree
thats a pass still no
thats a parr still
i long since graduated from your level fam
i mean we the same school of thought
but you following my lesson plan
its funny how this student and body is what the head had planned

so if theres arms afoot
you get tore so
i wont leave you with a leg to stand
all i knows is he just a next
to lay waste at the veterans hands
what im saying is this body gotta put him in a separate bag

round 3 shotty horroh

me and you type to smoke the full bag and
drink the whole bottle
but theres a difference g i have no kids to feed
i am nobodys role model
e  daniels oh its not a crew its a mixture
of brew and elixir im not condoning that whole motto
thats so hollow
youd rather do cyphers and drink with them guys that you link
than spend time with your kids
and thats some shit i dont follow
i can see it minitony approaching you
happy and vibrant laughing and smiling
tryna climb up your lap when your rhyming
till you push him back and decline him like
dont bother dad when his writing
cause its all about the show
you know clash of titans
you need to write raps and practice the titan
you havent got time to waste on your family surviving
youre on a champions diet but
try to respect this tony
your kids cant eat title defences tony  i feel for them
look at these infants guardian its like an infant guarding em
how do you think they feel you keep disregarding
for drinks and partying shits disheartening
bitch fix your fathering
i cant let you praise him
cause hes about 30 with about 30 bouts and them man never paid him
he just raps to be famous this is about reputation
news flash
there comes a time when a man has to hold up his hands and actually say that hasnt actually made it
this is no longer just your time youre passing and wasting
you need to be bringing back rashers of bacon
for the clan you created
you want them kids to say no my dad is the greatest
but nah theyre gonna say the father was a talent that was wasted
that frazzled out and faded
he put all his time into battle rap so daddy hadnt raised em
the papi was the pavement
its a shame youre so shameless
alcoholism skin has been aging
liver solidification and other symptoms it gave him
they see their old man curled up by the sink till hes sick in the bason
twitching and shaking
their only christmas wish is you’ll kick the addiction before the liquor can take him
father of the year
arteries hardened through marijuana and the beer
sat lethargic on his rear
hes probably on that cocaine ghost train
and too charlie to be near
a young mans crying for his father but nothing farther than his ear
your spaced out looking like bambi in the headlights
and im the car thats startling the deer
you and your peers appear to be stars cause you peer at the stars
and live by that garbage that you hear
wake up bright lights
the valley in the clear
epiphany your kids just need the father to be near cause
raps not working time you should quit tone
your little family need ya go home to your kids tone
but lets talk about that press conference
he said he didnt even want the title
he had that little arrogant speech all smiles flashing his teeth
talking about your gonna give it up after you and unanymous meet
you even said you wanted to drop it after the battle with leese
fast and discreet you get to immaculate streak and say you havent been beat
but you never wanted that title anyway
youre just happy battling guys you can savage in 3
that titles your protection so you dont have to travel the map and compete
with the international scene
see the real deal is that real deal shit is something you still reinact in your dreams
so youd rather stay here and get easy wins
than battle someone you actually class as elite
but listen youre 5 years older than man tony
and im 28
they said its better late than ever are kid
but thats very late
yo listen putting your fingers up like a dumb kid
thats a fucking shame
you came to manny tryna floss like the king
in a wooden chain
youre in manny now are kid
look about a bit
even though it is a fucking wooden chain ill get take note tox to rap it round his fist
and punch him the fuck out it
look where you are sunshine
make sure not to stare me down
if youre wearing a wooden chain of jesus looking like a member of acdc
youre never gonna wear a crown
and the funniest thing about this whole shit is im bodying the fuck out of ya
and only locksmyth thinks youve won
look at him screaming screaming
the only one that thinks youve won
and hes screaming hes screaming
please tony let me drink your cum
yo listen stop talking
you talk pure bowel
why dont you take yourself off the stage
and wipe your fucking sweaty head with that fucking dusty towel
i dare ya you will get kidnapped in this city i fucking dare ya
2 months a month whatever
with this little midget dissing me
i dont give a fuck i done zipped him 3 nil
and me and him made history
dont flop bitch

round 3 tony d

i told locksmyth he would mention this
and hes proving it true
but if i got gods head hanging from my neck
what the fuck i do to you and furthermore
you talking about my kids
thats a different palaver
bruv it was so contradictory
how can i fly around the world battling and then still do my bit as a father

battle rappers expose bios its logical
i dont care wars fair
so i dont care what they write with the pen in they palm
in battle rap i expose biological warfare
i dont care when i write im penning nepalm
cyanide soliloquies my breath got that death smell when i exhale
poison lines going over heads like chemtrails
agent orange horror tour
you wanted it you got a war
its too late to back out now
somebody lock the door
shock and awe i bring a holocaust to shottys door
bombs galore rockets launch
blood guts and lotta gore
ive exposed whats inside and i really show you horrohcore

he bitch made thats his forte
you see this diva act aint staged
he really play the broadway
this tonys award mate
i win and he gotta know
its gon be a real drag for man when i
rockys horror show
i didnt just come here to collect my check
im strongarming bars like a flexed bicep
they voyeuristic they came to see a next guys death
if they stairwell they see it happen stepbystep
its your funeral coffins made
reef preachers on his way
its good you got your people close by
they gonna wanna pray
play gangsta to win and die behind bars like ronnie kray
he thought that he had it in the bag and was on his way
until this thriller jack it and he thinking
but this aint shottyday mkay mkay
but its de ja vu to when i was jamming on blocks
i mean my lines popping so
im breaking down and bagging up shotts
and speaking of it every songs about the zoots rolled
so if you check every date on adams calendar
hes too stoned

and it leads to a pattern in your battles
ask the kids in the crowd
you know them bits that he forgets and starts dicking around
its like last orders and the bartenders kicking you out
you got a full pint on the table you werent quick enough in swigging it down
how is that applicable now you aint figured it out
bruv they call time in your bars cause you cant finish a round
but they say tony choke so often
so tone wont stop him i dont pose no problem
im special move stunning like stone cold austin
picture me ruining shotts like im photobombing
i dont care who im facing tone hits the pen and
blacks out behind bars like the aryan nation
im airing you ace
and its getting air to the nation
you clearly the favourite
them gambler guys got burned for their money
cause that bet is like your comeback
a poor return for the money
you on your job im on my boss shit
im making you work for it money
cause you said you live for this so its gotta be troubling shotty
you getting comfortably boddied in your hometown
by a middleaged man who does this for a hobby

whether its that poisonous legacy
or the champion pedigree
from this point on certain guys will remember me
cause i saw off shotty like im
modifying weaponry
i wont fall victim to shottys gimmicks
of course theres always space in your graveyard
you dont ever put no bodies in it
except for tommy villus but
hes a little walley ainthe
im a monstrosity
at centrestage i show you how to end the game
that hole you dug for tony will forever stay an empty grave
but if you get to dwelling on it and you get dismayed
console yourself with this thought
you didnt kill me but at least your rent was paid2embed"
