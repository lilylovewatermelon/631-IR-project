that we were lying in my bed
and without needing to speak
you heard the words inside my head

then the ground began to shake
we were sure that we were dead

until my arms grew into wings
with you wrapped around my waist
we swam deep into the sea
until we found ourselves in space

in your muffled murmured speech
you admitted you were god
and the reason you were here
was to save me from myself

were gonna be okayyou might also like1embed"
