you with the sad eyes
dont be discouraged oh i realize
its hard to take courage
in a world full of people
you can lose sight of it all
the darkness inside you
can make you feel so small

prechorus justin timberlake
show me a smile then
dont be unhappy
cant remember when
i last saw you laughing
this world makes you crazy
and youve taken all you
can bear
just call me up
cause i will always be there

chrous justin timberlake anna kendrick both
and i see your true colors
shinin’ through
i see your true colors
and thats why i love you
so dont be afraid to let them show
your true colors
true colors are beautiful
i see your true colors
shinin’ through true colors
i see your true colors
and thats why i love you
so dont be afraid to let them show
your true colors
true colors are beautiful
oh like a rainbowyou might also likeembed"
