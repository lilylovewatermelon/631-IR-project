you could be the president
you would get my vote
you could be the captain of whatever floats your boat
you could be the singer girl
you hit every note

like your daddy told ya when you were a little girl
you could be anything
why dont you be with me
why dont you
why dont you
your mama brought you up in a womans world
you could be anything
why dont you be with me
why dont you
why dont you
be my drink
be my song
be my bed
be my car
be my photograph
be my day
be my night
be my right
be my wrong
be my first and last
