i fell in love with the chemicals
i used to pray for a miracle but now
i know that its all over
we used to sit by the waterside
id kiss your cheek and say youre mine
but now i know its over

prechorus
and all these little things they start to slip away hmm
and all these little things they start to fade away
and you said

chorus
hold me im falling apart
cause im scared and lost in the dark
and this feeling surely cannot last
so i took it away i took it away
away from you
mmm woah woah

verse 2
i held your hand but you let it go
and i knew your heart had found a home
and now i know its over
i flew it out into the sky
was tryna run from this mountain i couldnt climb
cause i knew id fall over

chorus
hold me im falling apart
cause im scared and lost in the dark
and this feeling surely cannot last
so i took it away i took it away

bridge
we were making plans and breaking dreams
when you were next to me
its 3am in the back of a cab
and i am begging on my knees
dont go wont you stay
i cant stand to watch you walk away from me
and you said

chorus
hold me im falling apart
cause im scared and lost in the dark
and this feeling surely cannot last
so i took it away i took it away
away from you
mmm woah woah oh1embed"
