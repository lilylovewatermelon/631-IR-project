im about sick and tired of this bar crowd
i’ll throw some money down if you want to slip out
you’ve got me locked in take my hand
come be my queen sitting up in my king ranch
bet you’d look good on a two lane back road
bare feet on the dash hand out the window

chorus
i want to ride all night you sitting to my right
till we get tomorrow shining in the headlights
i want to show you around this little farm town
find some places that we can’t be found girl
just wanna take my time just you and me baby
i wanna ride all night

verse 2
if this keeps going good
i’m gonna make a little stop down by the creek
lay you down in my truck bed
steal another kiss before we drive off
i don’t know what you did but i’m already gone

chorus
i want to ride all night you sitting to my right
till we get tomorrow shining in the headlights
i want to show you around this little farm town
find some places that we can’t be found girl
just wanna take my time just you and me baby
i wanna ride all night

bet you’d look good on a two lane back road
bare feet on the dash hand out the window

chorus
i wanna ride all night you sitting to my right
till we get tomorrow shining in the headlights

find some places that we can’t be found girl
just wanna take my time just you and me baby

i wanna ride all night
