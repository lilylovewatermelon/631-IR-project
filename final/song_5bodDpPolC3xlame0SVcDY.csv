when you left this town with your windows down
and the wilderness inside
let the exits pass all the tar and glass
til the road and sky align

prechorus
the strangers in this town
they raise you up just to cut you down
oh angela its a long time coming

verse 2
and your volvo lights lit up green and white
with the cities on the signs
but you held your course to some distant war
in the corners of your mind

prechorus
from the second time around
the only love i ever found
oh angela its a long time coming

chorus
home at last

verse 3
were you safe and warm in your coat of arms
with your fingers in a fist
did you hear the notes all those static codes
in the radio abyss
you might also likeprechorus
strangers in this town
they raise you up just to cut you down
oh angela its a long time coming
oh angela spent your whole life running away

chorus
home at last
home at last

bridge
vacancy hotel room lost in me lost in you
angela on my knee i belong i believe

chorus
home at last
home at last
home at last
home at last

outro
home at last
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh25embed"
