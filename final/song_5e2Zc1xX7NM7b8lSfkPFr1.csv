i met him in outer space
he asked me what i was doing there
cause i looked out of place
i told him where i come from
i dont wanna go back
he said compared to where hes from
it cant be that bad
and i said yeah well

i asked him if i could go away with him
pack all my bags and just run away with him
and he said

hook
we come from two different worlds girl
youre just an earth girl
you could never understand the type of man i am

verse 2
he told me where he comes from
that everyone has a gun theyre always at war
i told him where i reside
my brother is dying
there is no cure
i got a baby to feed
i barely can eat
im chasing a dream
he told me he could relate
he’s doing the same
and thats when i said
you might also likechorus
we come from two different worlds but
theres only one us
that could make things easier
and he said
you come from a different world girl
but i think im yours girl

hook
lets get lost in our world
start our own world
start our own world
lost in a world
start our own world

hook
we come from two different worlds but
theres only one love
that could make things easier16embed"
