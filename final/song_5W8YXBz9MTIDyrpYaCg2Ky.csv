cut my life into pieces this is my last resort
suffocation no breathing
dont give a fuck if i cut my arm bleeding
this is my last resort

verse 1
cut my life into pieces
ive reached my last resort â€“ suffocation no breathing
dont give a fuck if i cut my arm bleeding
do you even care if i die bleeding
would it be wrong would it be right
if i took my life tonight chances are that i might
mutilation out of sight
and im contemplatin suicide

chorus
cause im losin my sight losin my mind
wish somebody would tell me im fine
losin my sight losin my mind
wish somebody would tell me im fine

verse 2
i never realized i was spread too thin
til it was too late and i was empty within
hungry feeding on chaos and livin in sin
downward spiral where do i begin
it all started when i lost my mother
no love for myself and no love for another
searchin to find a love upon a higher level
findin nothin but questions and devils

cause im losin my sight losin my mind
wish somebody would tell me im fine
losin my sight losin my mind
wish somebody would tell me im fine

verse 3
cut my life into pieces
this is my last resort
suffocation no breathing

would it be wrong would it be right

and im contemplating suicide
