yeah i think im stuck inside nostalgia
my mind are in the times when this love was so divine
but now its feelin like without ya
feelin like how the fuck did
we get into a place we aint accustomed to lovin inside of
i know im out of my mind more often than not
you know im used to givin this all that i got yeah
its not a waste when that smile on your face
you tell me you outta place you parked in my spot
okay baby this a piece of cake
we could lay up on the beach you could feed me grapes
this my favorite song spin it â€˜til the needle breaks
we could quit the whole game do the real estate thing
its how you beat the case
put in work turn that pussy to the office
be on top of your game this here a goddess
