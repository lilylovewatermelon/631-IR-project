they got three in the front and four in the back of a civic
camped out all night on the sidewalk just to get tickets
with their hands on the fence in the back by the buses and the limousines
just to get a glimpse of a drummer or singer yeah anything

and they come from miles around
for that moment when the lights go out
and they scream

its the girls in the front row singing
its the boys with the wheels that bring them
its lighters in the air and you guys up there
youre the heart and soul and the reason we do what we do
heres to you

verse 2

theres a mom and a dad in the aisle not acting their age
there a wet corvette red lipstick print on a coors light cup
and judging by the way shes dancing id say shes had enough

prechorus 2
the guitars come alive
and you make us want to stay all night
