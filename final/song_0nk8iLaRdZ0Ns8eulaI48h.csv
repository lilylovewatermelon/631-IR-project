youre riding right beside me in my car
looking like you wouldnt tell me no
im thinking about taking it too far
i dont think that we can make it home
a hotel room or a parking lot
cause i got it bad and i cant stop
the feeling that i gotta have you right now

chorus
how bout a midnight midnight mess around
i know which road which road to take you down
just let your hair and your dress fall to the ground
how bout a midnight midnight mess around

verse 2
baby keep an eye out for the cops
cause were taking it anything but slow
a little dirty but its hot
you seem to like it when i lose control
girl you know it aint safe to drive
cause i cant seem to keep my eyes
off anything and everything you do

chorus
how bout a midnight midnight mess around
i know which road which road to take you down
just let your hair and your dress fall to the ground
how bout a midnight midnight mess around
see old dominion liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likebridge
its getting late but its too early to be shutting it down
so how bout

chorus
how bout a midnight midnight mess around
i know which road which road to take you down
let your hair and your dress fall to the ground
how bout a midnight midnight mess around
a little midnight midnight mess around
i know which road which road to take you down
just let your hair and your dress fall to the ground
how bout a midnight midnight mess around

outro
a little midnight midnight mess around
a little midnight midnight mess around mess around
just a little mess around
just a little mess around
yeahembed"
