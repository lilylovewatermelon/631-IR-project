but still you accept me anyway
i live with a past i cant get past and it still haunts me
so im askin for the courage to make a change

by your grace i have hope
youve already paid every debt i owe
please take my chains and make me see
that by your grace ive been set free

teach me lord to seek you day by day
let only you define just where i stand
let me not take for granted
all the dеpths of your forgiveness
becausе the only way im gonna be a better man

is by your grace i have hope
youve already paid every debt i owe
please take my chains and make me see
that by your grace ive been set free

ive got a long way to go
but lord i know
theres not a step im gonna take
when youre not with me
