it aint no wonder why we lose control
when were always a heart attack away from falling in love
well i know that weve been hardly holding on
to tell the truth i cant believe we got this far
running near on empty
i wish somebody wouldve told me

chorus
that id end up so caught up in need of your demons
that id be lost without you leading me astray
guess that im a fool for the way that you caught me
girl you make my heart break more every day
but dont fade away

verse 2
and when im just about to pass the point of it all
you come ripping all the air from out of my lungs
and now its so hard to breathe
i wish somebody wouldve told me

chorus
that id end up so caught up in need of your demons
that id be lost without you leading me astray
guess that im a fool for the way that you caught me
girl you make my heart break more every day
you might also likebridge
well i know that weve been hardly holding on
to tell the truth i cant believe we got this far oh
well i know that weve been hardly holding on
to tell the truth i cant believe we got this far
wish somebody woulda told me
wish somebody woulda told me

chorus
that id end up so caught up in need of your demons
that id be lost without you leading me astray
guess im such a fucking fool for the way that you caught me
cause girl you make my heart break more every day

outro
but dont fade away
well i know that weve been hardly holding on
to tell the truth i cant believe we got this far
dont fade away
well i know that weve been hardly holding on
to tell the truth i cant believe we got this far
so dont fade away10embed"
