verse 1 kid cudi
in my head your smile appears clear
wish it wasnt my imagination running away with a dream
your eyes they tell it all called it
hope you have a good heart and youre smart
youve got a good head on your shoulders

howd you get so fuckin cool
fools probably try to spit at you daily
the price you pay cause youre hot
has anyone told you that youre fresh as hell
and i dig the way you wear your hair too
it makes you look more mature
see i just wanna be a man and i think you can be the one to guide me
but who the fuck am i kidding
man you know they say im wild
but real people rarely come around if ever
you got it going on young lady

chorus kid cudi  father john misty
jesus christ girl oh
you got it goin on young lady
jesus christ girl oh
you got it goin on young lady
jesus christ girl oh
you got it goin on young lady
jesus christ girl oh
you got it goin on young lady
