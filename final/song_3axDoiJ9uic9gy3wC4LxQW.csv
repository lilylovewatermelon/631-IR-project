its getting closer to the end every part of me
then disaster takes its toll and now im left with only me
maybe sorrow plays a role when you feel unkind
your abuses matter standing up forever lost in time

chorus
save me save me before i drown
save me save me before i drown

verse 2
its getting closer to the end i look back and smile
we conquered every single bump in my road made it all worthwhile
just remember how i cared when it came crashing down
id like to toast to all those angels that were always hanging round

chorus
save me save me before i drown
save me save me before i drown drown
oh woah

outro
maybe life aint what it seems cause its all a dream
forgive me
sometimes i feel like a fool cause im so uncool
forgive mesee limp bizkit liveget tickets as low as 14you might also like4embed"
