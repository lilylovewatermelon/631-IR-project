staring out my hotel window
too much on my mind
maybe we should keep it simple
we dont have to decide

prechorus
oh no we dont need to overcomplicate it
cause ive been here once before dont even say it

chorus
baby please no promises
cause we wont keep our promises
and i know the consequences
so baby please baby please no promises

verse 2
ive never been a fan of heartbreak
so tell me what you want
take my hands across your body
we dont have to hold on

prechorus
oh no we dont need to overcomplicate it
cause ive been here once before dont even say it
