its really over you made your stand
you got me crying as was your plan
but when my loneliness is through

chorus
im going to find another you

verse 2
you take your sweaters
you take your time
you might have your reasons
but you will never have my rhyme
im going to sing my way away from blue

chorus
im going to find another you

bridge
when i was your lover
no one else would do
if im forced to find another
i hope she looks like you
yeah and shes nicer too

verse 3
so go on baby
make your little get away
my pride will keep me company
and you just gave yours all away
now im going to dress myself for two
once for me and once for someone new
im going to do some things you wouldnt let me do
