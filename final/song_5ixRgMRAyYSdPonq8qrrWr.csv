thick skin soft touch
heart of gold but its nanananot enough
forgiving arms the higher road
working hard but its nanananot enough
you said im not good enough im not good enough
but what you really mean is youre not good enough youre not good enough
you cant deliver so you turn it around

chorus 1
you didn’t let me down
you didn’t tear me apart
you just opened my eyes
while breaking my heart
you didn’t do it for me
i’m not as dumb as you think
you just made me cry
while claiming that you love me
you love me you love me
you said you loved me
but that i’m not good enough i’m not good enough

verse 2
strong hold a fun ride
but rollercoasters are just nanananot enough
i keep it in you wear me out
this kind of love is nanananot enough
you said i’m just a sinkin ship i’m just a sinkin ship
but what that really means is you can’t handle this you can’t handle this
you couldn’t win so you turn it around

you didn’t let me down
you didn’t tear me apart
you just opened my eyes
while breaking my heart
you didn’t do it for me
i’m not as dumb as you think
you just made me cry
while claiming that you love me
you love me you love me
you said you loved me
but that i’m not good enough i’m not good enough

bridge
your love your love feels different
it’s like a blow to the head with your compliments
your love your love hurts deeper
like a brick in the sea and i’m drowning with it

chorus 2
you didn’t let me down
you didn’t tear me apart
you just opened my eyes
while breaking my heart
you didn’t do it for me
i’m not as dumb as you think
you just made me cry
while claiming that you love me
you love me you love me
you said you loved me
but that i’m not good enough i’m not good enough
so understand that it means nothing when you say you love me
you love me you love me when you say you love me
when you say you love me
you love me you love me
