there are flowers
in my heart
theyre growing thorns
and it hurts
every time
youre around
we break up
i feel down

verse 2
and i wont
see you again
youre not a person
youre my friend
if we do
just by chance
can we kiss
can we dancesee current joys liveget tickets as low as 248you might also like17embed"
