bridge choir  daniel caesar
send me kisses when its grey skies
its been so long look how time flies
if you love me wont you let me know
ive been tryna learn to let you go
call my name whenever tears fall
when you face your fears youll stand tall ohh whoa
send me kisses when its grey skies
cant you see
its been so long look how time flies
im spending all
if you love me wont you let me know

ive been tryna learn to let you go
call my name whenever tears fall
come with me
when you face your fears youll stand tall ohh whoa
i hope we can

verse daniel caesar
isnt it nice
human sacrifice
the universe got it
i got too excited
and now were taking life
isnt it nice
human sacrifice
i hate consequences that shits too expensive
you keep chasing delight
isnt it nice
human sacrifice
i take the easy way out every time
i dont deserve my own life
isnt it nice
human sacrifice oh yes
they say im a martyr
charge that to my ego
i just want all the lights15embed"
