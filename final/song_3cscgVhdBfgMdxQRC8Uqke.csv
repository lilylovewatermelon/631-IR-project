i look around the room
whatever i let it go

steves in germany thats it
i try to think of anyone else
no yeah thats it

i resolve to make new friends
i liked my old ones
but i fucked up so ill start again

whats the worst that could happen

strings frayed like my good days
tied around my finger
i felt so afraid

i had my mind on her on my own
but when i looked back up
everybody else was gone

so i resolve to make new friends
someone tell me to quit my head
and help me forget it
you might also likewhats the worst that could happen
the end of summer and im still in love with her
i said
forget it

was it worse that i wasnt sure
the end of summer and im still in love with her
i said
forget it

forget it
forget it2embed"
