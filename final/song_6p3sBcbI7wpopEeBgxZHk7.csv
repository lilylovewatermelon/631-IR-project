well i was sitting in a roadhouse down on highway 41
you were wiping off some ketchup on a table that was done
i knew you didnt see me i was in a corner booth
of course you werent my waitress mine was missing her front tooth
so i flagged you down for coffee but i couldnt say a thing
but im in love with you baby and i dont even know your name

chorus
im in love with you baby i dont even know your name
ive never been too good with all those sexual games
so maybe its just better if we leave it this way
im in love with you baby and i dont even know your name

verse 2
so i ordered straight tequila a little courage in a shot
and i asked you for a date and then i asked to tie the knot
i got a little wasted yeah i went a little far
i finally got to hug you when you helped me to my car
the last thing i remember i heard myself say
im in love with you baby and i dont even know your name

chorus
im in love with you baby i dont even know your name
ive never been too good with all those sexual games
so maybe its just better if we leave it this way
im in love with you baby and i dont even know your name
see alan jackson liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likeverse 3
the next thing i remember i was hearing wedding bells
standing by a woman in a long white lacy veil
i raised the veil and she smiled at me without her left front tooth
and i said where the hell am i and just who the hell are you
she said i was your waitress and our last names now the same
cause im married to you baby and i dont even know your name

outro
yeah im married to a waitress i dont even know her name
ive never been too good at all those sexual games
i never thought my love life would quite turn out this way
hey im married to a waitress and i dont even know her nameembed"
