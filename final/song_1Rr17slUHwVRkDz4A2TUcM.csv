when i offer you survival
you say its hard enough to live
its not so bad its not so bad
how do you know that youre right

verse 1
i awoke on the roadside
in the land of the free ride
and i cant pull it any longer
the sun is beating down my neck
so i ran with the devil
left a trail of excuses
like a stone on the water
the elements decide my fate
watch it go

chorus 1
when i offer you survival
you say its hard enough to live
dont tell me that its over stand up
poor and tired but more than this
how do you know that youre right
if youre not nervous anymore
its not so bad its not so bad
see the killers liveget tickets as low as 54you might also likeverse 2
i feel my vision slipping in and out of focus
but im pushing on for that horizon
im pushing on
now ive got that blowing wind against my face
so you sling rocks at the riptide
am i wrong or am i right
i hit the bottom with a huh quite strange
i get my glory in the desert rain
watch it go when i offer you survival

chorus 2
when i offer you survival
you say its hard enough to live
and ill tell you when its over shut up
poor and tired but more than this
how do you know that youre right
if youre not nervous anymore
its not so bad its not so bad

were gonna take it down to the wire

were gonna take it down to the wire
were gonna make it out of the fire
higher and higher higher and higher
were gonna take it down to the wire
were gonna make it out whoaohoh

when it shines like gold
