were on the sea
were in a ship and we are sailing by
all of the fish and all the octopi
we look them right into their octopi eyes

verse 2
im on the sea
i caught a mermaid looking right at me
i said hey baby why dont you come up top
you could flipflop while we cruise the florida keys

prechorus 1
remember when we said
you gonna see us on a red ship sailing
well think of you on your solid ground
we hope you think of us out here sailing around
sailing around sailing around
sailing

chorus
polynesia polynesia polynesia
oceana oh new caledonia
we dropped the hook on the capricorn

prechorus 2
remember when we said
you gonna see us with a sailor tan
well think of you and your stark white hands
building your model ships wishing you were sailing around
sailing around sailing around
sailing
