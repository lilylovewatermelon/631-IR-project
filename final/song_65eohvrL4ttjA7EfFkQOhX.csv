if you havin girl problems i feel bad for you son
i got ninetynine problems but a bitch aint one—hit me
got em mike

verse 1 mike shinoda
hes got the rap patrol on the gat patrol
foes who wanna make sure his caskets closed
rap critics who say hes money cash hoes
hes from the hood stupid what type of facts are those
if you grew up with holes in your zapatos
youd be celebratin the minute you was havin dough
so fuck critics you can kiss a whole asshole
you dont like the lyrics you can press fast forward
beef with radio if we dont play they show
they dont play our hits we dont give a shit so
all these mags tryin to use our ass
so advertisers can give em more cash for ads fuckers
i dont know what you take us as
or understand the intelligence that jayz has
from rags to riches we aint dumb
we got ninetynine problems but a bitch aint one—hit me

chorus jayz  mike shinoda
ninetynine problems but a bitch aint one
if you havin girl problems i feel bad for you son

now the year is ninetyfour in my trunk is raw
in the rear view mirror is the motherfuckin law
i got two choices yall pull over the car or
bounce on the devil put the pedal to the floor cmon
and i aint tryin to see no highway chase with jake
plus i got a few dollars i can fight the case
so i pull over to the side of the road
i heard son do you know what im stoppin you for
cause im young and im black and my hats real low
do i look like a mind reader sir i dont know
am i under arrest or should i guess some more
you was doin fiftyfive in a fiftyfour
license and registration and step out of the car
are you carryin a weapon on you know a lot of you are
i aint steppin out of shit all my paper legit
well do you mind if i look around the car a little bit
well my glove compartment is locked so is the trunk in the back
and i know my rights so you gon need a warrant for that
arent you sharp as a tack
you some type of lawyer or somethin
somebody important or somethin
ha i aint passed the bar but i know a little bit
enough that you wont illegally search my shit
well well see how smart you are when the canines come
i got ninetynine problems but a bitch aint one—hit me
chorus jayz  mike shinoda
ninetynine problems but a bitch aint one
if you havin girl problems i feel bad for you son
i got ninetynine problems but a bitch aint one—hit me
ninetynine problems but a bitch aint one
if you havin girl problems i feel bad for you son
i got ninetynine problems but a bitch aint one—hit me
ninetynine problems but a bitch aint one
if you havin girl problems i feel bad for you son
i got ninetynine problems but a bitch aint one

verse 3 jayz
now once upon a time not too long ago
a nigga like myself had to strongarm a ho
this is not a ho in the sense of havin a pussy
but a pussy havin no goddamn sense try and push me
i try to ignore him talk to the lord
pray for him but some fools just love to perform
you know the type loud as a motorbike
but wouldnt bust a grape in a fruit fight
and only thing thats gon happen is ima get to clappin and
he and his boys gon be yappin to the captain
and there i go trapped in the kitkat again
back through the system with the riffraff again
fiends on the floor scratchin again
paparazzis with they cameras snappin them
da try to give a nigga shaft again
half a mill for bail cause im african
all because this fool was harassin them
tryin to play the boy like hes saccharine
but aint nothin sweet bout how i hold my gun
i got ninetynine problems bein a bitch aint one
chorus jayz  mike shinoda
ninetynine problems but a bitch aint one
if you havin girl problems i feel bad for you son
i got ninetynine problems but a bitch aint one—hit me
ninetynine problems but a bitch aint one
if you havin girl problems i feel bad for you son
i got ninetynine problems but a bitch aint one  hit me
