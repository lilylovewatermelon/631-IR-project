for tonight its just the two of us
dim the light now just the two of us
like how you roll whisper in my ear
your breath like ghosts that disappear

prechorus
hold me close hold me close hold me tight now
need you more want you most feels so right now
like how your hands feel me up and down
like how your touch send me off the ground

chorus
spread my wings out into the dark
ill fly away on a trip to your heart
break these chains that keep us apart
ill fly away on a trip to your heart
oohoohooh oohoohoohoohooh
ill fly away on a trip to your heart

verse 2
baby cant believe you were sent to me
like a postcard from my memory
your body feels like a fantasy
this moments all that i can see
you might also likeprechorus
pull me close strip me down hold me tight now
need you more want you most feels so right now
like how your hands never let me down
like how your touch send me off the ground

chorus
spread my wings out into the dark
ill fly away on a trip to your heart
break these chains that keep us apart
ill fly away on a trip to your heart
oohoohooh oohoohoohoohooh
ill fly away on a trip to your heart

bridge
trip to your eyes trip to your arms
trip to your kiss trip to your lips
trip to your tongue trip to your voice
trip to your talk trip to your heart
trip to your head trip to your chest
trip to your breath trip to your skin
trip to your sin trip to your touch
trip to your tears trip to your heart

chorus
spread my wings out into the dark
ill fly away on a trip to your heart
break these chains that keep us apart
ill fly away on a trip to your heart
oohoohooh oohoohoohoohooh
ill fly away on a trip to your heart2embed"
