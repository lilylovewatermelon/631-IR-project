i wash away what you long for
and i wave goodbye with the sun in my eyes
i wish i could be there tonight

im like the wind in the canyon
im there then im gone in a second
youre growing older in peace where youre at
i wish i could be there for that
but ive moved on
like a rolling stone
in a crowded room
im alone

im like the rain in a downpour
i wash away what you long for
and i wave goodbye with the sun in my eyes
i wish i could be there tonight
oh oh yeah

youre like the tide in the deep blue
cause youre always there when i need you
and when you need someone to carry you through
im gonna be there for you
im gonna be there for yousee brandi carlile liveget tickets as low as 189you might also likeembed"
