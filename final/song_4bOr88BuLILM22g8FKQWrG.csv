i got knots all up in my chest up in my chest up in my chest

and im a mess and im a mess
and now we high now we high
thats why i left why i left

prechorus
will your tongue still remember the taste of my lips
my lips my lips my lips
will your shadow remember the swing of my hips my hips my hips my hips
will your lover caress you the way that i did i did i did i did
will you notice my charm if he slips up one bit one bit

chorus
cause i dont need to know
