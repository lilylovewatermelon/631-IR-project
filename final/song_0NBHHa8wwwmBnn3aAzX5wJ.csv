storming outside rain
she keeps me home
quiet conversation makes me warm
so

chorus
summer rain
whispers me to sleep
and wakes me up again
sometimes i swear i hear her call my name
to wash away the pain
my summer rain

verse 2
in the middle of the night when im alone
i feel her kisses on me even when shes gone
cant wait till she gets home

chorus
summer rain
whispers me to sleep
and wakes me up again
sometimes i swear i hear her call my name
to wash away the pain
my summer rain

i said i dont mind if it rains forever

refrain
so go ahead and make it rain
you bring the sunshine back again
so go ahead and make it rain
your tender touches wash away my rain

chorus
summer rain
whispers me to sleep
and wakes me up again
sometimes i swear i hear her call my name
to wash away the pain
my summer rain
summer rain
whispers me to sleep
and wakes me up again
sometimes i swear i hear her call my name
to wash away the pain
my summer rain
refrain
so go ahead and make it rain
you bring the sunshine back again
so go ahead and make it rain
your tender touches wash away my rain
so go ahead and make it rain
you bring the sunshine back again
so go ahead and make it rain
your tender touches wash away my rain

chorus
summer rain
whispers me to sleep
and wakes me up again
sometimes i swear i hear her call my name
to wash away the pain
my summer rainembed"
