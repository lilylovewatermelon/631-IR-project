i took your heart
i did things to you only lovers would do in the dark
it made you a god
priests popes and preachers would tell me i did it wrong
but hey
you made a negro flip
what do i say
to make me exist
oh stranger

chorus
still dont know my name
you still dont know my name woo
and i would die your slave
baby right now
but you still dont know my name
yeah

verse 2
wish you wish youd come over mmm
miss you kiss you in makebelieve
im dreamin of all of the possibilities
im kissing all over your body my nefertiti
and every time i think the planets aligning
youre still so close but yet so far

still dont know my name
you still dont know my name woo
and i would die your slave
baby right now
but you still dont know my name
