you’re calloused youre calloused baby
but you don’t even know but you dont even know
i’m picking at my scabs at my scabs
i’ll let all of the bruises show

chorus
i’ll never forget what all these feelings meant
flying home for a funeral was my last regret

verse 2
i hear a telephone three thousand miles from home three thousand miles from home
do you even really care really care
your heart is just a stone

chorus
i’ll never forget what all these feelings meant
flying home for a funeral was my last regret
i’ll never forget what all these feelings meant
flying home for a funeral was my last regretyou might also likeembed"
