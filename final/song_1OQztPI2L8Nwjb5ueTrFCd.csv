im not afraid
of anything in this world
theres nothing you can throw at me
that i havent already heard
im just trying to find
a decent melody
a song that i can sing
in my own company

prechorus
i never thought you were a fool
but darling look at you
you gotta stand up straight
and carry your own weight
these tears are going nowhere baby

chorus
youve got to get yourself together
youve got stuck in a moment
and you cant get out of it
oh love look at you now
youve got yourself stuck in a moment
and you cant get out of it

verse 2
i will not forsake
the colours that you bring
the nights you filled with fireworks
they left you with nothing
i am still enchanted
by thе light you brought to me
i listen through your ears
through your еyes i can see
you might also likeprechorus
and you are such a fool
to worry like you do oh
i know its tough
and you can never get enough
of what you dont really need now
my oh my

chorus
youve got to get yourself together
youve got stuck in a moment
and you cant get out of it
oh love look at you now
youve got yourself stuck in a moment
and you cant get out of it

bridge
i was unconscious halfasleep
the water is warm til you discover how deep
i wasnt jumping for me it was a fall
its a long way down to nothing at all

chorus 2
youve got to get yourself together
youve got stuck in a moment
and you cant get out of it
dont say that later will be better
now youre stuck in a moment
and you cant get out of itembed"
