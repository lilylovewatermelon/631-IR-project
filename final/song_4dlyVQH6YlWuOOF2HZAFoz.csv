when the shirt came off it was all in time
when a mmmminute turned into a mile
and then i broke that grin and i cut it out
and you got all turned on by the taste of the ocean
when i mentioned blue all you thought was color
when you mentioned drugs all i thought was sober
when your pants came off and i turned you over
when you mentioned blue

chorus

smile
cut it out for me this time
smile havent seen him smile in a little while

verse 2
keep the mask aligned
get it up in time
theres a space between valleys
and try and catch a vibe
make a circle square
a rectangle curve
use a smile as a noun and i think like a verb

verse 3
run quick switch sides
spill the filled up cancer
and the room is shaking
now youre changing places
and i switched my pace
and my breathing races when you mention blue
