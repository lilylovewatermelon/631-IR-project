thats a pretty little sundress you got on
and them pink flipflops look brand new
got your toenails painted up midnight red
springtime tan on the back of your neck
girl look at you

verse 2
this white vneck that i got on
is clean as a whistle bright as a day
i got new spit shine on my old boots
starched these wranglers just for you yesterday
we can stay right here and thatd be fine
oh but i got somethin else on my mind

chorus
we can get some grass stains
roll around on the fresh cut ground
we aint gotta lay a blanket down and i know a place
right over the creek and through the pines
we can get a little green where the sun dont shine
in the middle of the day girl what do you say
we get some grass stains

verse 3
come on baby now dont be shy
youre the prettiest thing that ive ever seen
but we can keep this midday rendezvous
just between me and you and the washing machine
if you know what i mean
see cody johnson liveget tickets as low as 15you might also likechorus
we can get some grass stains
roll around on the fresh cut ground
we aint gotta lay a blanket down and i know a place
right over the creek and through the pines
we can get a little green where the sun dont shine
in the middle of the day girl what do you say
we get some grass stains

chorus
yeah we can get some grass stains
roll around on the fresh cut ground
we aint gotta lay a blanket down and i know a place
right over the creek and through the pins
we can get a little green where the sun dont shine
in the middle of the day girl what do you say
we get some grass stains
we can get some grass stainsembed"
