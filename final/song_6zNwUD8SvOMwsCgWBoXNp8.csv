hero rats
fighting for mankind
hero rats
hero rats
sniffing out landmines

hero rats
hero rats
armed with tiny claws
hero rats
hero rats
working for our cause

they are small
yet they are mighty
marching bravely into hell
oh
into the fields
straight into danger
saving the humans from themselves
from ourselves
from ourselves
