girl i understand why
see its burnin me to hold on to this
i know this is somethin i gotta do
but that dont mean i want to
what im tryna say is that i love you i just
i feel like this is comin to an end
and its better for me to let it go now
than hold on and hurt you
but i gotta let it burn

verse 1
its gon burn for me to say this but its comin from my heart
its been a long time coming but we done been fell apart
really wanna work this out but i dont think youre gonna change
i do but you dont think its best we go our separate ways
tell me why i should stay in this relationship
when im hurtin baby i aint happy baby
plus theres so many other things i gotta deal with
i think that you should let it burn

chorus
when your feeling aint the same and your body dont want to
but you know gotta let it go cause the party aint
jumpin like it used to even though this might bruise you no no

hate the thought of her bein with someone else
but you know that its over we knew it was through yeah
