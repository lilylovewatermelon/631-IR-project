the things you made and she took you for
and im so tired  id be lying  i hope the prarie buys you more
the fitness coast is growing near
the shores they dont stay blond this year
thats why the marble lawns stay clear and warm in time
i want to stay but my time is wasting
the magic lands call my name
they want to fire a missle launcher
but i know i need to stay
we all know that by staying here itll be a good high this year
so whats the use to staying there if youve got no use for time
the fitness coast is growing near
the shores they dont stay blond all year
the continent moves with growing fears
its all for expensive lawn
i want to stay but my time is wasting
the magic lawns call my name
i want to fire a missle launcher
but i know i need to stay
i know i need to stay
and fight the day
i know i need to stay
and fight the day
i know i need to stay
and fight the day
i know i need to stay
and fight the dayyou might also likeembed"
