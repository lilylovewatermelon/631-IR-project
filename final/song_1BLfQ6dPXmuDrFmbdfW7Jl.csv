before the story begins
is it such a sin
for me to take whats mine
until the end of time
we were more than friends
before the story ends
and i will take whats mine
create what god would never design

verse 1 m shadows  the rev
our love had been so strong for far too long
i was weak with fear that somethin would go wrong
before the possibilities came true
i took all possibility from you
almost laughed myself to tears ahahaha
conjuring her deepest fears come here you fuckin bitch

prechorus m shadows the rev the rev  m shadows
must have stabbed her fifty fucking times
i cant believe it
ripped her heart out right before her eyes
eyes over easy
eat it eat it eat it
she was never this good in bed even when she was sleepin
now shes just so perfect ive never been quite so fuckin deep in
it goes on and on and on
i can keep you lookin young and preserved forever
with a fountain to spray on your youth whenever

verse 2 m shadows
now possibilities id never considered
are occurring to the likes of which id never heard
now an angry soul comes back from beyond the grave
to repossess a body with which i misbehave
smiling right from ear to ear
almost laughed herself to tears
prechorus m shadows the rev the rev  m shadows
must have stabbed him fifty fuckin times
i cant believe it
ripped his heart out right before his eyes
eyes over easy
eat it eat it eat it eat the shit out of it
now that its done i realize the error of my ways
i must venture back to apologize from somewhere far beyond the grave
i gotta make up for what ive done
cause i was all up in a piece of heaven
while you burned in hell no peace forever

chorus m shadows
