i reside in 209 youre in 208
you moved in last friday night
and i just couldnt wait
so i tried to call across the hall
to ask you out someday
but a lineup formed outside your door and i was way too late

prechorus
well id rather start off slow
this whole things like some sort of race
instead of winning what i want im sitting here in second place

chorus
because somewhere the one i wanna be withs with somebody else
oh god i wanna be that someone that youre with
i wanna be that someone that youre with
and i can talk about it all day long till i run out of breath
but i still wanna be that someone that youre with
ive got to be that someone that youre with
and im pacing by the phone
cause i hate to be alone
and if youre out there with him somewhere and just about to kiss
god i wanna be that someone that youre with

verse 2
well i hear your favorite songs you sing along with everyday
and i borrow things that i dont need for conversation sake
last night i heard your key it hit your lock at 4 am
instead of being out with me you must be out with them
