when the wind is blowin in your face
sometimes in life you dont see straight
pray to him he will show
when your head is in a certain place
nobody around to make you say
stand strong and you will grow

chorus
oooh wait til you see my smile
oooh wait til they see your smile

verse 2
dont they love to see you down
kick you while youre on the ground
dont let emotions show
people always speculate
dont let it get in your way
they say things they dont know

chorus
oooh wait til you see my smile
oooh wait til they see your smile

bridge
hey
so youre doing better now
everybody comes around
but you dont really need em much
cause youre stronger and youre better
and youre ready for whatever sing

oooh wait til you see my smile

oooh wait til you see my smile
oooh wait til they see your smileembed"
