interlude andré 3000
climbing out this hole climbing out this hole
with a frown on my face
in the place to be in the place to be and not to be at the same time

prechorus andré 3000

outkast just know that we wont play round
if it dont stank like they stank then they cant swallow that down

feeling good feeling great
how i feel oh i
feeling great feeling good how are you you
i just want you to know how i feel
feeling good feeling great
how i feel
feeling great feeling good how are you

verse big boi
hot tub bad to the bony im tony
ask my grandmama edna mae kearse—she showed me
how to be the smooth operator dominator
in the state of georgia hiphop standard destroyer
leave a motherfucker open like a foyer
he from the dirty— now here come the paranoia
a lawyer couldnt object or disrespect the technique
sweat me wipe off the sweat
fight off the shit and flush the waste down
the pipes of my life flow deep into the ground
find my purpose on the surface of this earth
this planets standards trust and the purpose
campaign in vain for the same lame fame youve obtained
you ought to be detained
by the hiphop sheriff locked up no possibility
of getting out because the shit you make is killing me
and my ears and my peers
i hear the end is near no fear we disappear
then reappear again in a fresh new light
i hope its peaceful and cloudy cause if its not we gotta fight like
prechorus andré 3000
ghetto musick stay down
outkast just know that we wont wait round
if it dont stank like they stank then they cant swallow that down
your battleship is sunk i wish grandma could see us—

chorus andré 3000
find a way to get out awithout a hit out
you dig in you dig out you get out

ghettomusick woo
find a way to get in to fit in to get on
to get out without a doubt
