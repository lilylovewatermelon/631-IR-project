so far left with nothing hanging by a memory
no stars to give me one wish so lost in the dark
feels like im caving in from the outside
all right all wrong
see you again so long
nothing matters anymore at all
nothing matters anymore
nothing matters anymore at all
nothing matters anymore

chorus
lifes not meant to be disposable
lost found dead
ready and willing cant stop the bleeding
lifes not meant to be expendable
rain sun gone
left robbed unwilling cant fight the feeling

verse 2
so low overwhelming clinging to a tragedy
so clear hear weeping voices
tears fall in the dark
feels like im coming in from the outside
so lost so gone so wrong
see mudvayne liveget tickets as low as 110you might also likechorus
lifes not meant to be disposable
lost found dead
ready and willing cant stop the bleeding
lifes not meant to be expendable
rain sun gone
left robbed unwilling cant fight the feeling

bridge
its never ending
never goes away but you did
its never ending
never goes away but you did
why why

verse 3
the bodys just a vehicle to hold
until we find another space
find another place to start this over
the enemy the action i cant condone
do you suffer with me

can i give you my loss to feel to hold close
can i give you my pain to feel
to be eaten alive by conscience
suffer fucking suffer suffer like me
chorus
lifes not meant to be disposable
lost found dead
ready and willing cant stop the bleeding
lifes not meant to be expendable
rain sun gone
left robbed unwilling cant fight the feelingembed"
