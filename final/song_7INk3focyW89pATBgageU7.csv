it seems like yesterday we were cuttin up in class
no worries in the world cept chasin girls and burnin gas
then one day you wake up youre tossin up them caps
dont it seem like the good times go by too fast

chorus
yeah i wish time would tick a little slower
sometimes it feels like i blink and then its over
better soak it in better make it last
live it up while we can cause the good times go by too fast

verse 2
it feels like yesterday i walked in that bar
wasnt lookin for nothin now look where we are
were watchin our kids growin up in a flash
dont it feel like the good times go by too fast

chorus
yeah i wish time would tick a little slower
sometimes it feels like i blink and then its over
better soak it in better make it last
live it up while we can cause the good times go by too fast

bridge
