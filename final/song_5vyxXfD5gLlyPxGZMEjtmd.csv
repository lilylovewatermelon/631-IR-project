id never gone with the wind just let it flow
let it take me where it wants to go
til you open the door theres so much more
id never seen it before
i was tryin to fly but i couldnt find wings
but you came along and you changed everything

chorus
you lift my feet off the ground
you spin me around
you make me crazier crazier
feels like im fallin and i am lost in your eyes
you make me crazier crazier crazier

verse 2
ive watched from a distance as you made life your own
every sky was your own kind of blue
and i wanted to know how that would feel
and you made it so real
you showed me somethin that i couldnt see
you opened my eyes
and you made me believe

chorus
you lift my feet off the ground
you spin me around
you make me crazier crazier
feels like im fallin and i am lost in your eyes
you make me crazier crazier crazier oh

i dont wanna hide anymore
ohoh

chorus
you lift my feet off the ground
you spin me around
you make me crazier crazier
feels like im fallin and i am lost in your eyes
you make me crazier crazier crazier
