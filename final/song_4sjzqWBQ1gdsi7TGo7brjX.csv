i be that nigga named luda
aka lova lova
fuck that shit nigga what you wanna say one time
southside lets ride say what
and if you love what you do do what you feel
then i know you gonna mark my words
i drop shit like birds
and its about the time for yo ass to get served
just lay it on down just lay it on down
while we relax to the tight raps and the fat tracks
that a nigga timbaland put down
oh yes lets get it on down to the nitty grit
dont have time for the petty shit
cause i got mo dick than a lil bit
and time flies when im havin fun
i can make a ho get like forrest gump and just run baby run
i guess that they cant handle this
the brothers just too scandalous
if you dont wanna get freaked
get up out my way just like in an ambulance say what
gitty up gitty up ride on to the real lay in death to the fake
and tell your boyfriend just to chill dont player hate
kick back relax and just take off yo shoes
while i gotta tell you what i wants to do uh oh

but beginners give me a thigh breast and leg like mrs winter
and let dinner be served

and put so much light in yo life ill make the roaches scatter

verse 3 ludacris
yo love is supacalafragalistic
you dont know how bad i missed it
if it broke then dont fix it
yo stuff is butta like a biscuit
reminisce like mary i gotta pop that cherry
kinda like that coochie you wanna be my hoochie
better than my adversary
dont be so scary
i never thought that you could act up
make a nigga wanna back up
keep it tight through the night while i wet this track up
so we can slip and slide make you wanna dip and dive
trippin while we rip and ride til i get you to cum inside
got you where i want yo ass
in the case of an emergency break the glass
keep yo eyes on the present and erase the past
and be happy if we got mo blunts to pass
get done up and run up
in the guts til yo butt dont shake like it used to
i wake em up like a rooster
take it slow not faster than a turbo booster
no worry no hurry  no pain no gain
better keep yo eyes on strain
cause aint a damn thing changed mayn
sit back relax and just take off yo shoes
while i gotta tell you what i wants to do uh oh
