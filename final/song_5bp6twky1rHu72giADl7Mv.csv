oh skipped a couple beats damn whats wrong with me
strangled by rope nope strangled by words
gimme power god please gotta create art
and facin collations ishard
comparisons nothing you can doll be honorable
but you gotta know originalitys impossible
almost was my own fate a couple times
never was to make a couple dimes
notice any action i take youll hate me
need elisha otis to elevate me
even stars align to form a fuck you to me
whole universe against mе battered brutally
me against thе world ill punch it in its face
only 15 but my mind is old shady days
weakness flooded by confidence
but the question i ask is will i be dominant
dominance i seek wanna speak into existence
sometimes i wonder if theyre even listenin
shattered glass scatters fast
rage at age and growth
wanted it to speed up boast
its like im speaking to ghosts
cuz i think im getting replies but its all
fantasy i try to speak to yall
but yall just wanna hammer me
so i speak to the walls
but they dont wanna answer me
they quiver then they fall
cuz they know bout the profanity
its all insanity im so appalled pusha t

you just feel like youre alone
and you feel like its only you
and youre in your bubble
and and i wish i had someone

verse 2 diverse one
feeling like im always utg
even when i aint and i want immunity
sympathy no change
atmosphere no change
available jobs low pay
snow blind no rhymes
motionless race posed to face
opportunities said opportunitays
host the hate then flip your face
money dont pay words do
wish ive never heard you
im living in an obstacle course
youre striking withim plausible force
possible resistance but it takes a lotta patience
and that will turn to waiting
makes sense that hate stems
but i never leave with no scratches
pain no band aids and no patches
at this point they pointing at me for they pleasure
attention isnt always treasured
i can transform ben hascom
been askin for chances
more anxious still handsome
thank god for that but they dont see it
i aint no street kid but i wish i was
wanna create a buzz john cena bumblebee
itll take mariel orr to trouble me son
i used to fail at it till hope came
d1s coming at you im throat pain
interlude 2 dwayne johnson
and on the other side of your pain
is something good
something good
something good

outro diverse one
