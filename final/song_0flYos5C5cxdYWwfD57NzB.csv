verse 1 rick ross
im not a slim thug im a fat mack
i dont give a fuck ill push ya hat back
still sellin dubs nigga thats fact
you can hit me on the cell pimp thats that
i had to pawn my chain and grab a half ounce
ten years later time for me to cash out
you dealin with a dope dealin dictator
fuck traffickin nigga i get this shit catered
see the clip tailored only the coogi shit
i fucks with damon im in the movies kid
my mom reminisce on the late nights
when i used to reel em in with the straight white
96 seventeen with a lil beamer
first foreign car far from a lil dreamer
daddy severed his relationships
i think momma quit him cause he wasnt makin shit
who ever thought that id make it rich
the bottom of a barrel with a bucket of crys
im tellin you man life a funny thing
