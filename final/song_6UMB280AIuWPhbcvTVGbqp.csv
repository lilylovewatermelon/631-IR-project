hey taxi take me straight to the heart of it
the nucleus of politics where somebody somebody started it
cause they taxed me
with a scalpel piece by piece
they cut me deep and bled me dry
till there was nothing left to bleed

chorus
and this is how i choose to live
as if im jumping off a cliff
knowing that youll save me
knowing that youll save me
and after all the stupid things i did
theres nothing left there to forgive
because you already forgave me
yeah you already forgave me

verse 2
just keep driving
leave this defeat miles behind me
so far back id have to rack my mind to just remind me
i keep trying
to pick myself back up and then move on
and think about the life ill have when this fragile one is gone

and this is how i choose to live
as if im jumping off a cliff
knowing that youll save me
knowing that youll save me
and after all the stupid things i did
theres nothing left there to forgive
cause you already forgave me
yeah you already forgave me

bridge 1
never forget
theres life after death and taxes
and forgiveness comes
then all of the rest is what passes away
death and decay cant touch us now

interlude

bridge 2
every breath that i inhale is followed by exhaling
sure as the one who never fails i know will never fail me

outro
just never forget
theres life after death and taxes
and forgiveness comes forgiveness comes
then all of the rest is what passes
never forget
theres life after death and taxes
and forgiveness comes
then all of the rest is what passes away
death and decay cant touch us nowembed"
