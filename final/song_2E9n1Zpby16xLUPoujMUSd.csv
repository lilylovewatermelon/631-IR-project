it took me five bars
saw thirty license plates
i saw her mustang
and my eyes filled up with rage
i brought my pistol
but i aint some kinda fool
so i walked right in barehanded
she was on his arm while he was playing pool
just like i used to do

chorus 1
she kissed him while i got a beer
she didnt think id show up here
im a crazy exgirlfriend

verse 2
i watched her for a while but i didnt like her walk
came across kinda cheap to me
but hey hows that my fault
she looked at my man
like he didnt have on a stitch
somebody tell that girl
to step up to the plate im gonna pitch
little bitch

well those pretty girls can play their game
but theyre damn well gonna know my name

verse 3
i started throwing things and i scared folks half to death
i got up in his face smelled whiskey on his breath
didnt give a second thought to being thrown in jail
cause baby to a hammer everything looks like a nail
im mad as hell

chorus 3
those pretty girls theyre all the same
but theyre damn well gonna know my name
im a crazy exgirlfriend
im a crazy exgirlfriend
