why do we hate why do we suffer
why do we make our mistakes and constantly blame one another
why is there war and why is there killing
have we forgotten some secret we knew back when we were just children

chorus
if i had wings i would fly up to heaven
i would look down from the clouds on everything
then i could find all the things we have been missing
i would have all the answers if i had wings

verse 2
like why i am here and where did i come from
and where will i go when my time here on this earth is done
and what would i leave that would go on forever
oh no and what can i do while i am here to make someones life better

chorus

outro
oh now if i had wings i would fly up to heaven
