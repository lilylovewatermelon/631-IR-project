look up from the hymnal around at the faces
of families closing their eyes
were taking communion and passing the offering hat
around at the same time

verse 2
i reached for the hat and take all the cash
and slide it into my ragged coat sleeve
and leave in its place a note to explain
all of the reasons the spirit has led me to leave

verse 3
if there was a worthy cause for to give to
may i be so bold as to say
that givers not knowing where their moneys going
is as sinful as throwing away

verse 4
stained glasses shine on my red wine
and the sweat on my brow drips to my shaking knees
a small sacrifice to benefit one mans
journey away from americas seas
sweet sweet sign of relief
sweet sweet o baltic sea
sweet sweet sign of relief
sweet sweet o baltic sea
sweet sweet sign of relief
sweet sweet o baltic sea
