day by day we let love just walk away
and i will be the first to say i was glad to see it go
and day by day ever since you went away
i find that i am still missing you and i have just got to know

chorus
does that blue moon ever shine on you
i want to hold you close to me feel just like it used to be
and baby if you feel like i do
you can come to me
does that blue moon ever shine on you

verse 2
on my mind you were right there all the time
i could search and never find someone that does me like you do
here is the part where i am giving you my heart
i was a fool to let you go girl i have just got to know

chorus
does that blue moon ever shine on you
i want to hold you close to me feel just like it used to be
and baby if you feel like i do
you can come to me
does that blue moon ever shine on you
you might also likeverse 3
night after night i look to the stars
wondering where you might be
and i have thought to myself is that very same moon
shining on you like it is shining on me

chorus
does that blue moon ever shine on you
i want to hold you close to me feel just like it used to be
and baby if you feel like i do
you can come to me
does that blue moon ever shine on youembed"
