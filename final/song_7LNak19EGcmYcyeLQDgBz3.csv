it’s nice to see you again
can you come over today
after school and we can play
build a town with my new blocks
or paint while wearing smocks

we can run around outside
climb a tree or take a ride
on a scooter or on a bike
we’ll go anywhere you like
to the park to the zoo
you know what there’s so much we can do

hello friend hello friend
let’s walk home hand in hand
my mom says it’s okay
if you come and stay the day
maybe we can make a fort
play restaurant and supermart

i‘ll share all my toys with you
even all the stuff that’s new
you want to play a video game
ill even help you type in your name
i know how to wait my turn
we’re gonna have so much fun
you might also likehello friend hello friend
our play date has come to an end
let’s pick up our toys off the floor
ill walk you to the front door
before you go i want to say
thanks for playing with me today
next time i’ll come to your place
i’ll bring my cars we’ll have a race
let’s get together real soon
how about tomorrow afternoon
goodbye friend goodbye friend
goodbye till we meet againembed"
