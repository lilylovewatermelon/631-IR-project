designer names and diamond rings
are just some of the finer things
i thought it took to keep her satisfied
but a bank account and credit cards
a circle drive through an acre yard
couldnt fill that lonesome feeling
that she had inside

chorus
i bought her fancy clothes for all occasions
and that new car so she could go
just any old where she pleased
i bought that golden band she wore
on the hand that closed the door
and i bought the shoes that just walked out on me

verse 2
leaving early and staying out late
i thought for sure her love would wait
until the day that i could find the time
but all the that she expected
were all the things that i neglected
for what she wanted most from me
would not have cost a dime

outro
i bought the golden band she wore
on the hand that closed the door
and i bought the shoes that just walked out on me
yes i bought the shoes that just walked out on meembed"
