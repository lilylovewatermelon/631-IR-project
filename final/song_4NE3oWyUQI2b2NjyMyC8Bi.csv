ive seen jesus play with flames
in a lake of fire that i was standing in
met the devil in seattle
and spent 9 months inside the lions den
met buddha yet another time
and he showed me a glowing light within
but i swear that god is there
every time i glare in the eyes of my best friend
says my son its all been done
and someday youre gonna wake up old and gray
so go and try to have some fun
showing warmth to everyone
you meet and greet and cheat along the way
theres a gateway in our minds
that leads somewhere out there far beyond this plane
where reptile aliens made of light
cut you open and pull out all your pain
tell me how you make illegal
something that we all make in our brain
some say you might go crazy
but then again it might make you go sane
you might also likeevery time i take a look
inside that old and fabled book
im blinded and reminded of
the pain caused by some old man in the sky
marijuana lsd
psilocybin and dmt
they all changed the way i see
but loves the only thing that ever saved my life
so dont waste your mind on nursery rhymes
or fairy tales of blood and wine
its turtles all the way down the line
so to each their own til we go home
to other realms our souls must roam
to and through the myth that we all call space and time25embed"
