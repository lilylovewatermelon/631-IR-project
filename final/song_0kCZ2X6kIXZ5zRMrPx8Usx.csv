dont you get mad at me cause your broad done chose up
glad to see the truck when i pull up
gon pop the lock big booty hoppin in now
dark skin gold teeth man you know we in now
i know thats your baby momma
i know that it hurts some
you know when we get together
imma let her twerk some
let her hit the blunt some
no time of the month some
pull out a condom
then i make her run some
freaky as she wanna be
imma let her go and be
she can be herself anytime that she get wit me
backseat action riverside relaxin
flick in the dvd that ass im waxin
imma keep it real wit cha
imma let her deal wit cha
i dont fight over hoes imma let the steel hit cha
all on the town talkin bad tryna down me
in your heart really sad boy you betta crown me

hundred spoke rims sittin slick on the escalade

imma get a extra couple of gs claimin yo child
yeah its wild but this is the world that we living in
dont get hot stay up off my game and quit meddling
peddlin these weed sacks
nigga give me feedback
i dont need no stems dog

do just like i tell her to
and wit no renegging

branded for life
