ohhhh
baby
baby are you down

you oughta know
tonight is the night to let it go
put on a show
i wanna see how you lose control

so leave it behind cause we have a night to get away
so come on and fly with me as we make our great escape

so baby dont worry you are my only
you wont be lonely even if the sky is falling down
youll be my only no need to worry
baby are you down down down down down
down down
baby are you down down down down down
down down
even if the sky is falling

just let it be
come on and bring your body next to me
ill take you away
ill turn this place into our private getaway
