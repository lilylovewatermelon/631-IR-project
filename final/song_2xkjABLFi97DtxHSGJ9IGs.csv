verse 1
i had someone before that i thought i loved
but i was young and i didnt know
i let her hurt me and work my nerves to the bone
jerk me find another and push me along
but it taught me one thing that love is decievin
you got that phony love where you givin aint recievin
but things are different now
i put that all behind me im sure this time that

chorus
i i think i really know what love is now
how itll get you how it looks how it sounds
and how it makes you feel
when you finally found somebody special
and i i think i really know what love is now
and how it makes you smile when youre down and out
when the world treats you cold
it sees you love when youve found somebody special

verse 2
everything everything everything will make you smile
when you find somebody to hold ya
dont you know dont you know dont you know ill never lie
its easier to breath when you need somebody
who makes you laugh
who makes you glad
glad that you didnt just give it up
somebody that your comfortable to live it up with
what i got is what i missin and ooh what im feelin

how itll get you how it looks how it sounds
