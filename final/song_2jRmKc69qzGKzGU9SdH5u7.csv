ronny j please turn me up

verse 1
tell all my competition that i love em
but i brought em back just to kill em again
tell all the listeners that i said fuck em
if they thought id never be breathing again
i keep some drink in the cup
in case anyone got some more beef i can eat em again
i made a promise to beat their ass up
like adonis if i ever meet em again
