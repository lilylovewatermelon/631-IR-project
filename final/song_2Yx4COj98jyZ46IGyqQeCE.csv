listen everyone

there were objects so peculiar
they were not to be believed
all around things to tantalize my brain

its a world unlike anything ive ever seen
and as hard as i try
i cant seem to describe
like a most improbable dream

but you must believe when i tell you this
its as real as my skull and it does exist

here let me show you

this is a thing called a present
the whole thing starts with a box

harlequin demon devil  werewolf
a box
is it steel
are there locks
is it filled with a pox
a pox
how delightful a pox
you might also likejack
if you please

just a box with brightcolored paper
and the whole things topped with a bow

witch 1  witch 2 together
a bow
but why
how ugly
whats in it
whats in it

jack
thats the point of the thing not to know

clown creature under the stairs  monster from the black lagoon
its a bat
will it bend
its a rat
will it break
perhaps its the head that i found in the lake

jack
listen now you dont understand
thats not the point of christmas land
now pay attention

we pick up an oversized sock
and hang it like this on the wall

mr hyde smaller mr hyde  smallest mr hyde
oh yes does it still have a foot
let me see let me look
is it rotted and covered with gook

jack
um let me explain

theres no foot inside but theres candy
or sometimes its filled with small toys

mummy  winged demon together
small toys
do they bite
do they snap
or explode in a sack

corpse kid  mayor
or perhaps they just spring out
and scare girls and boys
what a splendid idea
this christmas sounds fun
i fully endorse it
lets try it at once
jack
everyone please now not so fast
theres something here that you dont quite grasp
well i may as well give them what they want

and the best i must confess i have saved for the last
for the ruler of this christmas land
is a fearsome king with a deep mighty voice
least thats what ive come to understand

and ive also heard it told
that hes something to behold
like a lobster huge and red
and he sets out to slay with his rain gear on
carting bulging sacks with his big great arms
that is so ive heard it said

and on a dark cold night
under full moonlight
he flies into a fog
like a vulture in the sky
and they call him sandy claws
well at least theyre excited
but they dont understand
that special kind of feeling in christmas land

oh wellembed"
