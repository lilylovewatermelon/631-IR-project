little ghost little ghost one im scared of the most
can you scare me up a little bit of love
im the only one that sees you and i cant do much to please you
and its not yet time to meet the lord above

verse 1
the first moment that i met her i did not expect a specter
when i shook her hand i really shook a glove
she looked into me so sweetly and we left the room discreetly
no one else could know the secret of our love

chorus
little ghost little ghost one im scared of the most
can you scare me up a little bit of love
im the only one that sees you and i cant do much to please you
and its not yet time to meet the lord above

verse 2
every morning i awoke and i see my little ghost
wondering if its really her thats lying there
i lean to touch her and i whisper but not brave enough to kiss her
when i held her i was really holdin air

chorus
little ghost little ghost one im scared of the most
can you scare me up a little bit of love
im the only one that sees you and i cant do much to please you
and its not yet time to meet the lord above

though i tried my best to keep it there really was no secret
must have looked like i was dancing with the wall
no one else could see this apparition
but because of my condition
i fell in love with a little ghost and that was all

chorus
little ghost little ghost one im scared of the most
can you scare me up a little bit of love
im the only one that sees you and i cant do much to please you
and its not yet time to meet the lord above
no its not your time to meet the lord above1embed"
