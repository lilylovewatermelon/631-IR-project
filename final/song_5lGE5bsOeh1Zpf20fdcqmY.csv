well i started out down a dirty road
started out all alone
and the sun went down as i crossed the hill
and the town lit up the world got still

chorus
im learning to fly but i aint got wings
coming down is the hardest thing

verse 2
well the good old days may not return
and the rocks might melt and the sea may burn

chorus
im learning to fly learning to fly
but i aint got wings learning to fly
coming down learning to fly
is the hardest thing learning to fly

verse 3
well some say life will beat you down
break your heart steal your crown
so ive started out for god knows where
i guess ill know when i get there

im learning to fly around the clouds
but what goes up learning to fly
must come down

outro
im learning to fly learning to fly
but i aint got wings
coming down is the hardest thing
im learning to fly learning to fly
around the clouds
but what goes up learning to fly
must come down
im learning to fly learning to fly learning to fly
im learning to fly learning to fly learning to fly
