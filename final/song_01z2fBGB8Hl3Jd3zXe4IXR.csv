my regrets look just like texts i shouldnt send
and i got neighbors theyre more like strangers
we could be friends
i just need a way out
of my head
ill do anything for a way out
of my head

verse
in my own way this feel like livin
some alternate reality
and i was drownin but now im swimmin
through stressful waters to relief
yeah oh the things id do
to spend a little time in hell
and what i wont tell you
ill prolly never even tell myself
dont you know that sunshine dont feel right
when you inside all day
i wish it was nice out but it look like rain
grey skies are driftin not livin forever
they told me it only gets better

chorus
my regrets look just like texts i shouldnt send
and i got neighbors theyre more like strangers
we could be friends
i just need a way out
of my head
ill do anything for a way out
of my headyou might also like71embed"
