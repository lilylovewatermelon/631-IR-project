drells on the track

verse
this for them tribulations and trials
i finally got a smile for all the frowns
i finally get to make my mama proud
start a family bought a house
i finally see what pops was talking bout
but it was hard looking up when i was down
i was down bad and bummy
they was laughing at me but it wasnt funny
imagine me in that bottom as a youngin
on to any given sunday
tryna find a way to get some money
we cut grass to get cash when i was hungry
stealing chicken out of publix
nigga grab a box and go to running
niggas never gave me nothing so its fuck em
was balling on a budget
i remember balling on a budget
i was fine til my mind got corrupted
used to want to be a firefighter or a teacher
til niggas came through on twentytwos and booming speakers
my mind changed instantly
mom didnt even know what gotten into me
thuggin hard stealin cars and shootin at the enemies
i used to hit my knees and pray id find them things for ten a piece
til then we slow grind and break it down to ten a g
til then we slow grind and break it down to ten a g
i know you remember me
back in eleventh grade was addicted to popping seals
i love to sip that lean i like the way it make me feel
the smile up on my face bae cause i been swallowing pills
couldnt focus in class my mind was stuck on them ms
get to thinking bout my past that shit be giving me chills
i never thought id see the day i get a record deal
move my baby mama to the hills fuck the drama babe lets live
in the bahamas tryna heal
tell me your problems and your fears yeah
and all of them niggas on the internet be hoes
you the type of nigga i hated when i was broke
you the type of nigga see this pole and be froze
im the type of nigga get jealous and rob him out his clothes
by the time you jumped off the porch i was in the middle of the road
when you got down the street i was already headed home
on the porch knocking looking for love but it was gone
thank god i found my passion in these songs
you might also likechorus
this for them tribulations and trials
things looking up when it was down
it was hard tryna get it off the ground
tribulations and trials
you couldnt take my shoes and walk a mile
finna put them diamonds in my mouth cause now
i got a reason to smile
a reason to smile reason to smile
a reason to smile
reason to smile a reason to smile a reason to smile
reason to smile a reason to smile haha1embed"
