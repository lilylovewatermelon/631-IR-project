keep the noise low
she doesnt wanna blow it
shaking head to toe while your left hand does the show me around
quickens your heartbeat
it beats me straight into the ground
you dont recover from a night like this
a victim still lying in bed completely motionless
a hand moves in the dark to a zipper
hear a boy bracing tight against sheets barely whisper
this is so messed up
upon arrival the guests had all stared
dripping wet and clearly depressed hed headed straight for the stairs
no longer cool but a boy in a stitch
unprepared for a life full of lies and failing relationships

prechorus 1
he keeps his hands low up the stairs
he doesnt wanna blow it the station where
hes wet from head to toe and his eyes give her the up and the down
his stomach turns and he thinks of throwing up the act becomes
but the body on the bed beckons forward and he starts growing up the art of growing up

chorus
the fever the focus
the reasons that i had to believe you werent too hard to sell
die young and save yourself
the tickle the taste of
it used to be the reason i breathed but now its choking me up
die young and save yourself

she hits the lights
this doesnt seem quite fair
despite everything he learned from his friends he doesnt feel so prepared
shes breathing quiet and smooth
hes gasping for air
this is the first and last time he says
she fakes a smile and presses her hips into his
and keeps his hands pinned down at his sides
hes holding back from telling her exactly what it really feels like
he is the lamb she is the slaughter
shes moving way too fast and all he wanted was to hold her
nothing that he tells her is really having an effect
he whispers that he loves her but shes probably only looking for s

prechorus 2
so much more than he could ever give up the stairs
a life free of lies and a meaningful relationship the station where
he keeps his hands pinned down at his sides the act becomes
he waits for it to end and for the aching in his guts to subside the art of growing up

chorus
the fever the focus
the reasons that i had to believe you werent too hard to sell
die young and save yourself
the tickle the taste of
it used to be the reason i breathed but now its choking me up
die young and save yourself
bridge
up the stairs the station where
the act becomes the art of growing up

chorus
the fever the focus
the reasons that i had to believe you werent too hard to sell
die young and save yourself
they take all the taste out
it used to be the reason i breathed but now its choking me up
die young and save yourself17embed"
