your light is inside of me
like a raging roar
like an ocean born
youre in my veins
your voice is serenity when the sun goes down
and the strength ive found is in my veins

prechorus
our story binds us like right and wrong
your hand in mine
marching to the beat of the storm

chorus
and we walk together into the light
and my love will be your armor tonight
we are lionhearts
and we stand together facing a war
and our love is gonna conquer it all
we are lionhearts

verse 2
youre here like a silhouette
when the darkness rules
youre the brightest moon
and i am safe

youre never far from where i am
