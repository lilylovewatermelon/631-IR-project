oh my god i have the remedy for love
i struck the glass and broke the bones inside my fist but im ok

refrain
i cannot change you i cannot change you
youll never change youll never change
i never would expect to break this in the end

verse 1
something so profound something you wont expect
take this scripture like a picture and wear it around your neck
the sky it opens up
dont get swallowed by the flames
whats mine is yours and yours is mine so take me away

chorus
you hear the sounds theyre carried out
theres no sympathy for the dead
it swells and i was never the same
theres no sympathy for the dead
we dance like zombies do in the middle of the rain
we see the stones falling from the sky on fire
the blinding light beaming from your eyes our desire
life has died yet were still alive and down below
a sea of damned crashing like a tidal wave wave
you might also likerefrain
i cannot change you
youll never change youll never change
i never would expect to break this in the end

verse 2
i cant breathe
wake up from this nightmare that im in
dive into a holy river and wash away my sins
as i reach sanctified the surface of the water now
i will breathe and burn out my eyes

chorus
you hear the sounds theyre carried out
theres no sympathy for the dead
it swells and i was never the same
theres no sympathy for the dead
we dance like zombies do in the middle of the rain
we see the stones falling from the sky on fire
the blinding light beaming from your eyes our desire
life has died yet were still alive and down below
a sea of damned crashing like a tidal wave wave

bridge
so take the medicines to quench the pain we have
and walk until the end until youve reached the sand
a hundred thousand wings soaring through the sky
at intense speeds we cant catch with our eyes
you hear the sounds of a third carried out
just wait just wait
you hesitate
verse 3
i have the remedy to the poisonous kiss
i struck the glass it shatters bones in my fist you hesitate
i have the remedy to the poisonous kiss
i struck the glass it shatters bones in my fist you hesitate
i have the remedy to the poisonous kiss theres no sympathy for the dead
i struck the glass it shatters bones in my fist you hesitate
i have the remedy to the poisonous kiss theres no sympathy for the dead
i struck the glass it shatters bones in my fist
you hesitate

outro
theres no sympathy for the dead
you hesitate
theres no sympathy for the dead
you hesitate
theres no sympathy for the dead
