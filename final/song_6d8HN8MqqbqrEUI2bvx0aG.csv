god in my cells thats my celly
made in the image of god thats a selfie
pray five times a day so many felonies
who gon post my bail lord help me
hol up donda im with your baby when i touch back road
told him stop all of that red cap we goin home
not me with all of these sins castin stones
this might be the return of the throne throne
hova and yeezus like moses and jesus
you are not in control of my thesis
you already know what i think bout think pieces
before you ask he already told you who he think he is
dont try to jail my thoughts and think precincts
i cant be controlled with programs and presets
reset
on my cell in my cell tonight
dont have to see you to touch you
this is what braille look like its on sight
if they take me to jail call my girl tell her send my mail
we know what hell look like
still its a hell of a life yikes

chorus kanye west
guess whos goin to jail tonight
guess whos goin to jail tonight
guess whos goin to jail tonight
god gon post my bail tonight80embed"
