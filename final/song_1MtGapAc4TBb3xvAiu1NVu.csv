verse 1 johnny 3 tears
wake up in the middle of its any other night
with some tears on my pillow and theres blood on my knife
and my soul has stained the sheets but theyre pulled off to the side
whose blood could this be is it yours or is it mine
take the knife and twist it wheres my heart you missed it
you know i dont wanna die but baby you insisted
breathing is a luxury that i just shouldnt have
my heart just keeps on beating and its more than you can stand
baby please just tell me how we ever went so wrong
we used to sing together when we used to sing this song
we could never sing forever cause now my voice is gone
guess im gone forever and you knew it all along

chorus danny
i can see blood all over my hands
the longer you laid next to me the further i ran
whats it all worth how much can you stand
the longer you stayed close to me the further i ran

verse 2 charlie scene
im only evil when i need to be but you did this so easily
i tried to treat you equally and listen to your reasoning
but you waited so eagerly while plotting and deceiving me
you came behind me secretly and shattered every piece of me
i had nothing to give so i gave you my life
didnt wanna see me live so you gave me your knife
didnt hear you as you tiptoed coming from behind
you took away my kid so i guess you killed me twice
dragged me into the night cause its the one thing you keep
you knew that i had to die so you could finally sleep
theres blood all over your knife you know you earned yourself
and its a matter of time until you burn in hell

chorus danny
i can see blood all over my hands
the longer you laid next to me the further i ran
whats it all worth how much can you stand
the longer you stayed close to me the further i ran

bridge danny
your remorse holds no recourse no im breathing slowly
oh wont you hold me
your remorse holds no recourse no im breathing slowly
oh wont you hold me

chorus danny
i can see blood all over my hands
the longer you laid next to me the further i ran
whats it all worth how much can you stand
the longer you stayed close to me the further i ran
i can see blood all over my hands
the longer you laid next to me the further i ran
whats it all worth how much can you stand
the longer you stayed close to me the further i ran
