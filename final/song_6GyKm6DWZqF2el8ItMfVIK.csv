lets watch it burn
lets watch it burn
lets watch this city burn the world

chorus deuce
lets watch this city burn
from the skylines on top of the world
till theres nothing left in her
lets watch this city burn the world

verse 1 charlie scene
my body doused in ash
with two empty cans of gas
the only evidence they have
is a police sketch of my mask
and its hard at times to ask
if you can save my heart for last
and its hard to face the facts
when the darkness fades to black
its not just makebelieve
when they make me take a seat
and they put amphetamines
in the air and make me breathe
so come on and grab your children
look out for burning buildings
and villains who pillage
theyre killin by the millions
and billions of people die for a lost cause
so now i pray to my nation destroyed under god

its the end of the world
all my battles have been won
but the war has just begun

chorus deuce
lets watch this city burn
from the skylines on top of the world
till theres nothing left in her
lets watch this city burn the world

verse 2 johnny 3 tears  deuce
the city looks so pretty
do you wanna burn it with me
till the skies bleed ashes
and the fucking skyline crashes
they catch us with matches ignite the flame
and all the hopes of a youth deemed fucking insane
they say take the pill in god we trust
go and kill god loves us
as in life as in death
breathing till there is no breath
i will not die in the night but in the light of the sun
with the ashes of this world in my lungs
but who am i to say
lets all just run away
grab your saints and pray
and well burn this world today
prechorus deuce  johnny 3 tears
its the end of the world
as in heaven as on earth
weve been dead since our birth

chorus deuce
lets watch this city burn
from the skylines on top of the world
till theres nothing left in her
lets watch this city burn the world

interlude deuce
lets watch it burn
