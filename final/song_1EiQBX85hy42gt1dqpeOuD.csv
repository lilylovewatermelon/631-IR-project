boy what have you done for me
ive been going down on you

i dont have to take you there

chorus shaggy
across the hall neighbors hear the sound
mr lover lovers in town
carpet burns from being on the ground
rudy have hot gal a moan and groan
crash oh dawn the phone
baby dont stop yeah you like that simone
champion lover the best pound for pound
take you to the clouds without going downtown

verse 2 toni seawright  shaggy
why why dont you just change your ways
wont you open up your mind
boy were living in modern days
girl im coming from the school
where if you want the job done right
you have to use the proper tool
you never been loved until youve been filled
filled full of pleasure from the rude boys skill
passion and ecstasy you know the drill
full up your cup til your juices spill
leave the door open just for the thrill
now youre at the point where you cant keep still
covered in sweat but feeling the chill
thats the effect of a lover mans pill

chorus shaggy
across the hall neighbors hear the sound
mr lover lovers in town

crash oh dawn the phone
