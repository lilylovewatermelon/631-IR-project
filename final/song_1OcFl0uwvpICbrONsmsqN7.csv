heart of steel
born to kill
mothers milk
left me dressed in shame
i just go my way
move too fast
it wont last
hammerhead
daddy went away
he still knows my name

chorus
ooh somethings gotta give
the paper on the wall
soon will peel and fall
ooh and then you see my face
painted up with sin
cover me
cover me again

verse 2
i outgrew my old shoes
my backyard
was cluttered up with lies
kept it easy on the eyes
fresh homemade
undershade
black and red
paint my fingers blue
still hiding from the truth
mm my best friend kills the pain
hmm but only for a day
mm keeps chewing on my veins
see cage the elephant liveget tickets as low as 399you might also likechorus
ooh somethings gotta give
the paper on the wall
soon will peel and fall
ooh and then you see my face
painted up with sin
cover me
cover me again
cover me againembed"
