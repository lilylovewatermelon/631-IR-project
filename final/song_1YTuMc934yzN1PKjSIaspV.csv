shes gonna pack her bags shes gonna find her way
shes gonna get right out of this
she dont want new york she dont want la
shes gonna find her special kiss
she dont want no sleep she dont want no high
oh like peaches and cream
shes gonna wish on stars and touch the sky
ah you know what i mean

pre chorus
she wants the good life no need to rewind
she needs to really really find what she wants
she lands on both feet wont take a back seat
theres a brave new girl and shes coming out tonight

chorus
shes gonna step outside uncover her eyes
who knew she could feel so alive
her mos changed
she dont wanna behave
aint it good to be a brave girl tonight

postchorus

so she met this man he was kind of rough
he said girl what you looking for
she said i dont know i go with the flow
he said lets get on the floor
he said you look real cute with your low ride jeans and your pink little bebe tee
lets get a room girl come and ride with me
