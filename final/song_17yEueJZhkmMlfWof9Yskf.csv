her finger traced i love you
in the palm of my hand
thats still the only time
my bellys ever hit the floor
like that

prechorus
your feet in my lap
we drove away the past
knowing we would turn around again

chorus
tell her im not sorry
mention my ferrari
just dont tell her that
i miss her
she wanted in i wanted out
and thats the last thing we talked about

verse 2
remember how our hands matched
love lines same size
i guess i should have checked
to see the life lines werent in line
see bowling for soup liveget tickets as low as 52you might also likeprechorus
i call on the phone
you still felt alone
and talked about the songs that made you cry

chorus
tell her im not sorry
mention my ferrari
just dont tell her that
i miss her
she wanted in i wanted out
and thats the last thing we talked about
she wanted in i wanted out
and thats the last thing we talked about

bridge
campfire cookies and john hughes movies
junior mints and cold shower tuesdays
november shivers and rearview mirrors
and the little things like that
little things like that

chorus
tell her im not sorry
mention my ferrari
just dont tell her that
i miss her
she wanted in i wanted out
and thats the last thing we talked about
outro
campfire cookies and john hughes movies
junior mints
and thats the last thing we talked about
november shivers and rearview mirrors
and the little things
and thats the last thing we talked aboutembed"
