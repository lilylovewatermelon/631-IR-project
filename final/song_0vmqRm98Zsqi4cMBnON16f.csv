i dont look the way the average cowboy singer looks
ill admit ive taken things i never should have took
you can read a different story in a lot of different books
but even then you wont really know
how it was a long time ago

verse 2
women have been my trouble since i found out they werent men
in spite of that i stopped and took a wife now and then
they built their fences high but they couldnt hold me in
i was born with a fire down below
and i learned to fly a long time ago yeah

verse 3
dont ask me about the years i spent out in the rain
about the ones i spent in love or the ones i spent insane
dont ask me who i gave my seat to on that plane
i think you already know
i told you that a long time ago

verse 4
me and ol willie lordy weve been sold and bought
i guess yall heard about some kind of system that we fought
we aint the only outlaws just the only ones they caught
they tried to run us off but willies slow
i quit running a long time agoyou might also like1embed"
