chorus booka600
the jet just cleared now
i dont posed to be here where im from they kicked me down
you cant be deceitful shoot you right between your eyes
i done seen some shit that got some bloodstain in my eyes
met a couple niggas in the sandbox made some ties
put the vests in the light put the rollies in the sky
we was livin a whole lie thought gangsters made it out
troy want word of mouth true story this not clout
told my killers one way out

verse 1 booka600
600 never doubt em in the hood like a stout
roll a backwood full of opps do a hit then we out
quarter milli in the bank did my thing get my props
and lil bro tryna bang told him slang fuck the opps
lost fouro i tried to dodge
city on fire like a carpet
told my niggas silence while we mobbin
this that hold your lighter for the stars
this that catchin redrum with my glock
this that movin as one get us far

and i broke down to myself and i cried on them steps yeah
