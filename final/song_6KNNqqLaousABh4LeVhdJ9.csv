verse 1 jid
2007 cole dropped the come up
i was in high school playin corner
i never dreamt of mumblin words in front of hundreds
studyin plays all summer
ill hit the league if my growth spurt come in on my mom
2009 bro dropped the warm up
i was in warmups playin weezy
and yukimi little dragon flame breathin the weed
patrick had the studio dorm room next to me
i freestyled ovеr his beats
my nigga keese transferrеd in from tennessee
hes a receiver i played db like aqib
snatch a nigga chain talib
talib kweli i could be lyrically but i put on cleats
scribbled lines goin through my mind like a paper piece
while i covered three playin nickel doin safety reads watch the flats
i can rap but i rather tackle and pedal back
get a pick when my growth spurt hit it dont matter bout the size its in here man
ima be captain and i was around 2010 no cap
i got freshman player of the year and figured i was on track
this nigga pat been in my ear talkin bout rhymin on tracks
so after practice we record and then we got it on wax
and on campus i heard about a couple rappers from atlanta earthgang
said them niggas was snappin maybe we could make somethin happen and shit
i wasnt serious enough to even be curious
and we lose like every game so every day i be furious
so the spirit of a nigga had changed
to the point i had to reframe and focus my skills for other things
i took the steel wheel im steerin in other lanes
but my fuel on low and my oil need to be changed
amongst all the other shit thats goin in my brain
my brother got out of jail i only know him by name
he did a nickel and a dime in time probably be stayin with my mom
and dad probably get mad actin lame some times

uh look
the sideline story came out september of 2011
ib said around that time
we was huntin for a record under lots of pressure
just combine the leverage with a better effort
you could find a sound to get us out the underground forever
maybe you can bless a little brown effervescent kid
youngest of seven from the six eight sections
section80 dropped yeah we used to play that shit to death
and if i recollect correct you tried to sign him for yourself
all the while i was round my out of  town college wildin out
restaurants destin dinin dashin call it dinin out
fuckin bitches posed to be in class but i was hiding out
my friends take a little shot smoke a lot of cannabis coolest nigga on the campus
now a nigga skippin practices and actin like a rock star
going from in the dorm to in the car leavin the football field
but fuck that we still sorry and the problems from the home front
on my home screen callin me i dont wanna answer
my brother carl hit me said my granny had cancer
im posed to graduate and make my way back to atlanta
no job no money or nothin from ballin
because between that and school that was really all
and maybe heres the back that broke the camel with the straw
i wasnt on camera with them amateurs that they saw
but they said they still caught me and my dawgs stealin boxes
like craig on his day off
called us in the office day before we posed to walk uh
called a squad car a couple officers
i know bro was finna tell he was lookin nauseous
now im sittin in a cell nigga double crossed us
crossed me off the list for scholarship because i lost it
no more football my redshirt senior season exhausted so im off it
and im right back in atlanta with a half a gram of weed
and a gold pontiac that my granny had bought for me
i was sleepin in the back my dad kicked me in the streets
when he saw my neck tatted then i told him i was rappin
fuck school no goin back he said
if i can not follow his rules just go and pack
told you he be actin lame some times
interlude carl route jr
this my son he came from these nuts
this negro come back from school
all tatted up like the sistine chapel
talkin bout he aint playin football no more
because he know he aint goin pro hey its a stamina that you left the house with
but he left on a full scholarship to go to school and get a degree
because we taught education was the number one thing
anyway every one of you gon be like your oldest brother
he came back determined to do what he was determined to do
and i know because he he is who he is we taught him
hey whatever you do put your full self into it
so he did that anyway do it your best damn what other people want
hes back home i aint with that
so im sayin hey you got to go to work
and he sayin hey this is my job what im about to do
so im like hey man some times you got to work or dont be a partner
to do what you really wanna do
we went through this whole brain wrestle
but anyway he won im standing by you
he decided that hey dad im puttin this thing im doin this
this is my job and he committed to it
and hey the rest is history you can do anything that you want to do
im lookin at him i believe in him
i know what was in him
all him and his brothers and sisters
they all got the same mindset
do your best give a hundred percent or dont do it at all
so i know whatever he put his all into it was gon be golden
anyway
verse 3 jid
look
march 10th 2017 the never story dropped
and im comin off of tour with 
that was three years after openin up for absoul
but its earthgangs set i only came to do a song
doeburger used to say ayy bro this lil nigga cold
keep on doin what you doin you gon make it you gon blow
i aint know that ced had went ahead and played my shit for cole
but i knew he knew the game and he pulled up to his show
and then thats where we first met but i aint think of it no more
til ced brown said that i should open up for omen on my own shit if i wanted
only four cities maybe we get rob gibbs on the phonin i got to hone in
in the game grown men uncomfortable in they own skin
but all i wanted was a chance
it feel like im in a mannequin challenge
still stance but im still standin
til my nigga lend a hand and im no longer stranded
lookin for strengths in the streets of east atlanta
momma said dont take advice they gon try and take advantage
i was bout to sign with coach k i aint take the advance
cole say hold on wait bro i got the plan
so come on damn lil nigga come on shit lets roll fuck

outro j cole
shsh yo thats crazy
thats crazy yo jid i remember
i remember you came to the crib
you remember this after we had met
and i told you and earthgang to pull up
to the crib in carolina its the studio house
i wasnt on no shit like yo im tryna do some dreamville shit with yall nah
it wasnt no talk of no deal i didnt even know if i wanted to sign niggas
i just knew i yall was dope i fuck with you
just pull up lets see what the vibe is like lets work
in my mind if something happen it happen
if not then cool niggas just got a chance to link and kick it
but while we was there the thing that i noticed off rip
i said oh this nigga want it this nigga really want it
that look in your eye nigga i know that look
i know that look too well
but a lot of niggas want it
the thing i noticed about you my nigga off rip
this nigga dont just want it he willin to do the work that it takes to get it
and thats the difference thats the separator
thats the difference between the niggas that never get what they want
and the niggas whose names ring out forever
