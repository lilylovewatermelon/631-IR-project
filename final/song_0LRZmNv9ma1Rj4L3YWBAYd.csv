i dont wanna be your friend
i dont wanna be your friend
im not trying to chill

verse 1
i dont wanna be your friend
if you still talk to him
why would i be your friend
if you dont wanna win
i dont fuck with the ops i dont roll like that
yeah i got my friends and were gonna fucking win

chorus 2
i dont wanna be your friend
why would i be like them
when i could be better than them
doing so much better than them

verse 2
theyre all about the competition
they care about the recognition
after hours spreading lies
but i just keep it inside
dont wanna lose my mind
dont wanna lose my tongue
i got a piece of mind
i just wanna be wise
i just wanna be wise
