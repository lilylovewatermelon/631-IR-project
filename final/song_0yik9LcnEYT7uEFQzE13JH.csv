girl theres something about the shine and the pop of your lip gloss
and all that high busting out of your tiny little tank top
im picking up every little bit of the tease youve been laying down
got my head spinning round damn near knocking me out yeah

verse 2
see i was headed to get a drink at the bar round the back
but you pumped the brakes on my nikes stopped them dead in their tracks
flipped my snapback back spun a whole 180
had to work up the nerve jus to tell you baby

chorus
u turn you turn the heat on
u turn every little bit of me on
a little drawl when you talk little wiggle in your walk
the way you moving it yeah you got me losing it

to the wind the wind without no drinks
we got the band rocking right
got the green light in your eyes
want to hold you all night
watching u turn u turn

and now were swaying swaying side to side
and ive got wandering hands getting lost in your wonderland
