verse 1 rick ross
way up in them cali hills burnin like the sunset
a nigga wit a attitude take it outta context
ridin with that big thang lookin like a bomb threat
bin laden beard afghan in a bomb vest

she wanna gaze at the stars
pull a panoramic view pull the haze out the jar
rick ross im the best in the flesh
gettin blessed on a jet is a way to reflect
hard work pays off im a boss you can tell
by the bottles in the pail and the models that we share
im into real estate in a realer state of mind
