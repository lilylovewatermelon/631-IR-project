so im feeling much worse now
youre better youre better
your designer drug
wont work wont work for me
connect to a three volt
i hope your battery dies
how could you run
on such on such voltage

prechorus
all the same i remain
the one to blame
and im demonized purified
justified as you let yourself show

chorus
so now youll love these screams whats left of me
dont speak
love these screams like i do
my name

verse 2
as the infinite stops cold
just nine and the six are gone
guess i was the one to
ride that ride that dirty ride
that is turning too fast now
i cccannot cannot hold on
but at this pace
who would who would want to
you might also likeprechorus
all the same i remain
the one to blame
and im demonized purified
justified as you let yourself show

so now youll love these screams whats left of me
