she cant see the way your eyes
light up when you smile
shell never notice how you stop and stare
whenever she walks by

prechorus
and you cant see me wanting you the way you want her
but you are everything to me

chorus
and i just wanna show you
she dont even know you
shes never gonna love you like i want to
and you just see right through me
but if you only knew me
we could be a beautiful miracle unbelievable
instead of just invisible

postchorus
oh yeah oh

verse 2
theres a fire inside of you
that cant help but shine through
shes never gonna see the light
no matter what you do
