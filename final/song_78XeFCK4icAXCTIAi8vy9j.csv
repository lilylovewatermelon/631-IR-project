staring at the ceiling
she dont wait to begin
she bets on long shots
she wants what theyve got
she skates where the ice thins

chorus
on and on we keep going
crowded like subway cars
on and on to the beat of our noisy hearts
our hearts

she was her mothers secret
she was daddys girl
she brought weekend boys home in her curls
she said my love is a fever
come on touch my skin
they all think im easy
im easy cause i let them win

chorus
on and on we keep going
crowded like subway cars
on and on to the beat of our noisy hearts
chorus
on and on we keep going
crowded like subway cars
on and on to the beat of our noisy hearts
to the beat of our noisy hearts
you might also likeshe said pick up the phone
cause i need to get more alone
and your voice drives me crazy

chorus
on and on we keep going
crowded like subway cars
on and on to the beat of our noisy hearts
chorus
on and on we keep going
crowded like subway cars
on and on to the beat of our noisy hearts hearts hearts
chorus
on and on we keep going
crowded like subway cars
on and on to the beat of our noisy heartsembed"
