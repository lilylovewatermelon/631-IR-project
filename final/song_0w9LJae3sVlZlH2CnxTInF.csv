ive been a walking heartache
ive made a mess of me
the person that ive been lately
ain’t who i want to be
but you stay here right beside me
watch as the storm blows through
and i need you

chorus
cause god gave me you for the ups and downs
god gave me you for the days of doubt
and for when i think ive lost my way
there are no words here left to say its true
god gave me you
gave me you

verse 2
theres more here than what we’re seeing
a divine conspiracy
that you an angel lovely
could somehow fall for me
youll always be loves great martyr
and ill be the flattered fool
and i need you
yeah

god gave me you for the ups and downs
god gave me you for the days of doubt
and for when i think ive lost my way
there are no words here left to say its true
god gave me you

verse 3
on my own im only
half of what i could be
i cant do without you
we are stitched together
and what love has tethered
i pray we never undo

chorus
cause god gave me you for the ups and downs
god gave me you for the days of doubt
god gave me you for the ups and downs
god gave me you for the days of doubt
and for when i think ive lost my way
there are no words here left to say its true
god gave me you gave me you
he gave me you14embed"
