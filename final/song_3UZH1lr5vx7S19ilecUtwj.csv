verse 1
hey he had a whole lot of cheese
plus he was a mack had a whole lot of steez
made a lot of niggas fat gave a whole lot of gs
grams man he had a whole lot of these
and he would let you hold like a whole lot of kis
even if you lose some he would give you new ones
twice the bread its like he had two buns
and he had a whole lot of seeds
even his kids had meals for reals
some rich small fries wrapped in paper since they was lil

verse 2
he was a heart breaker
and a law shaker
if it was about caking he was a partaker
international he would take trips
bon voyage thats how hard he was fishing for the chips
so greedy never gave to the needy thats what some say
the way he shunned all the bums hanging in the subways
he called em fruits and laughed at em
delivery man on the pickup
drive through and throw a bag at em
and it was hard to understand him sometimes
making a killing the way he had em standing in line
like

verse 3
lovers call him king haters call him clown
he would say bite me thats the way its going down
he was having thoughts that maybe he should retire
went to church on a sunday and saw a deep friar
said he had beef and people want him dead
he loved the hungry ones was only scared of the feds
he lived the fast life couldnt get his path right
the friar just told him bout the hooters that he had last night
turn yourself in to the paddy wagon said no
bacon wouldnt take him had the pigs on the payroll

chorus
my man said life aint easy
when niggas gotta eat thats when shit get greasy
streets be all like feed me feed me
when niggas gotta eat thats when shit get greasy
my man said life aint easy
when niggas gotta eat thats when shit get greasy

outro

my man said life aint easy
when niggas gotta eat thats when shit get greasy
