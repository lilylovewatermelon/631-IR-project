you used to say if i kept dragging my feet
one day i would wake up alone
you told me if i wasnt careful i was gonna mess around and hurt someone
i didnt know that it was me you were talking about
didnt listen to the words falling out of your mouth

chorus
oh but i can hear you now hear you now hear you now
in the middle of the night i can
hear you now clear and loud hear you now
like a wheel in my mind
someday youll be sorry
someday when i leave
youll find out you dont wanna be free yeah i can
hear you now hear you now hear you now
now that you aint talking to me

verse 2
you used to wake me with a whisper but now the only voice is the pouring rain
and the echo of goodbye just rattles through my mind like a midnight train
yeah you warned me that the days and the nights would be cold
you dont have to say i told you so

chorus
oh cause i can hear you now hear you now hear you now
in the middle of the night i can
hear you now clear and loud hear you now
like a wheel in my mind
someday youll be sorry
someday when i leave
youll find out you dont wanna be free yeah i can
hear you now hear you now hear you now
now that you aint talking to me no more
