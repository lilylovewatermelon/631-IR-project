i looked out this morning and the sun was gone
turned on some music to start my day
i lost myself in a familiar song
i closed my eyes and i slipped away

chorus
its more than a feeling more than a feeling
when i hear that old song they used to play more than a feeling
and i begin dreaming more than a feeling
til i see marianne walk away

postchorus
i see my marianne walkin away

verse 2
so many people have come and gone
their faces fade as the years go by
yet i still recall as i wander on
as clear as the sun in the summer sky

chorus
its more than a feeling more than a feeling
when i hear that old song they used to play more than a feeling
and i begin dreaming more than a feeling
til i see marianne walk away
postchorus
i see my marianne walkin away

verse 3
when im tired and thinking cold
i hide in my music forget the day
and dream of a girl i used to know
i closed my eyes and she slipped away
she slipped away

chorus
its more than a feeling more than a feeling
when i hear that old song they used to play more than a feeling
i begin dreaming more than a feeling
til i see marianne walk away
