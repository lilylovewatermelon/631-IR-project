verse 1
i ride like a soldier
put nothin before ya
anything you ask
ill be right there to do it
but if i react you tell me to relax
too late to take it back
cause boy you put me through it

prechorus
this circular motion is all we do
im so sick of going back and forth with you
you should have been happy to have me
you said you wanted to have some kids build a family
now i wish it wasnt true
its killing me to do what i gotta do
the problem here is you
aint nobody new not even my crew
could take the place of you
the problem here is you
you might also likechorus
cause if you only knew what i felt for you
you would have held on tighter fought a little harder
been a little smarter and now youre gonna miss my love
and one day soon youll see
youll reach out for me
boy you had a keeper
didnt know how to treat her
should have felt a little deeper and now youre gonna miss my love

verse 2
kick it with ya friends go
go out with other chicks go
be all up in the mix go
you got the right to do it
you wanna be a pimp
be treated like a prince
go head and click the switch
cause now you got ya crown back

prechorus
this circular motion is all we do
im so sick of going back and forth with you
you should have been happy to have me
you said you wanted to have some kids build a family
now i wish it wasnt true
its killing me to do what i gotta do
the problem here is you
aint nobody new not even my crew
could take the place of you
the problem here is you
chorus
cause if you only knew what i felt for you
you would have held on tighter fought a little harder
been a little smarter and now youre gonna miss my love
and one day soon youll see
youll reach out for me
boy you had a keeper
didnt know how to treat her
should have felt a little deeper and now youre gonna miss my love

breakdown
my hugs and my kisses
you know youre gonna miss it
and while youre tripping on the love we could have had
im moving on
i got to
and aint no looking back

chorus
cause if you only knew what i felt for you
you would have held on tighter fought a little harder
been a little smarter and now youre gonna miss my love
and one day soon youll see
youll reach out for me
boy you had a keeper
didnt know how to treat her
should have felt a little deeper and now youre gonna miss my love
