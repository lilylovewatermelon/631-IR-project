wait til after dark
well try to make a mark
one that stays until were done
and well pretend again
letâ€™s try not to forget where we are
and who were with who we will find

chorus
miles can cut this tie weve made
the sharp side of the blade

verse 2
as these words play out theyll try and drag you down
you feel like one of them who we will find

chorus
miles can cut this tie weve made
the sharp side of the blade
make sure that you can keep it
make sure you keep it in your heart
miles can cut this tie weve made
the sharp side of the blade

bridge
make sure you keep it in your heart
make sure you keep it
in your heart

miles can cut this tie weve made
the sharp side of the blade
miles can cut this tie weve made
the sharp side of the blade

make sure you keep it in your heart
miles can cut this tie weve made
the sharp side of the blade
