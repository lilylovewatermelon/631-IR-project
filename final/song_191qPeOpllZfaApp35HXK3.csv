youre mumbling words
but i cant hear anymore
youre totally entertained
but i am absolutely bored
to the sharks with your conversation
and see what they say
as youre thrown overboard
and disappear into the waves

verse 2
down to neptunes kingdom
in the inkblack drink
octopus bartenders
you can hear the mermaids sing
thatll teach you all to try and disobey
now heres a oneway ticket to your watery grave
and we say

chorus
to all our enemies well see you in hell
were gonna walk em off the plank into the wishin well
down to davy jones locker where the fishes sleep
wont be prayin for you so dont be prayin for me oh
to all our enemies well see you in hell
were gonna walk em off the plank into the wishin well
down to davy jones locker where the fishes sleep
wont be prayin for you so dont be prayin
dont be prayin for me

keelhaul those prisoners until their skin turns green
let the salts of the ocean wash them skeleton clean
raise up those oars and let them fall
as the wind steady sings you can hear the crew call

chorus
to all our enemies well see you in hell
were gonna walk em off the plank into the wishin well
down to davy jones locker where the fishes sleep
wont be prayin for you so dont be prayin for me oh
to all our enemies well see you in hell
were gonna walk em off the plank into the wishin well
down to davy jones locker where the fishes sleep
wont be prayin for you so dont be prayin
dont be prayin for me2embed"
