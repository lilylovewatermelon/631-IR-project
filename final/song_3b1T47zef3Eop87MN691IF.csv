what you gonna do when the show is over
what you gonna sing when the song ends yeah yeah
how you gonna cope when there is no closure
where you gonna reach when the goal gets higher
how you gonna make it through
when you think you lost your chance

when youre losing the game

even when the floodgates swing wide open
never let the current sink you down no
even when youre not sure where youre goin
swimming through a mess and you cant get out
just going through the motions and tryin not to drown

chorus

when youre losing the game
play on
cause youre gonna make mistakes
its always worth the sacrifice
even when you think youre wrong
so play on
