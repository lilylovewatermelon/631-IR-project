another dream that will never come true
just to compliment your sorrow
another life that ive taken from you
a gift to add onto your pain and suffering

another truth you can never believe
has crippled you completely
all the cries youre beginning to hear
trapped in your mind and the sound is deafening

prechorus
let me enlighten you
this is the way i pray

chorus
living just isnt hard enough
burn me alive inside
living my lifes not hard enough
take everything away

verse 2
another nightmare about to come true
will manifest tomorrow
another love that ive taken from you
lost in time on the edge of suffering
see disturbed liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likeanother taste of the evil i breed
will level you completely
bring to life everything that you fear
live in the dark and the world is threatening

prechorus
let me enlighten you
this is the way i pray

chorus
living just isnt hard enough
burn me alive inside
living my lifes not hard enough
take everything away

bridge
return to me return to me return to me
turn to me leave me no one
turn to me return to me return to me
turn to me cast aside

return to me return to me return to me
turn to me leave me no one
turn to me return to me return to me
youve made me turn away
chorus
living just isnt hard enough
burn me alive inside
living my lifes not hard enough
they take everything from you

living just isnt hard enough
burn me alive inside
living my lifes not hard enough
take everything away5embed"
