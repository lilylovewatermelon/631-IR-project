in the heat of the fight i walked away
ignoring words that you were saying
tryin to make me stay
i said this time ive had enough
and youve called a hundred times
but im not picking up

prechorus
cause im so mad
i might tell you that its over
but if you look a little closer

chorus
i said leave but all i really want is you
to stand outside my window throwing pebbles
screaming im in love with you
wait there in the pouring rain coming back for more
and dont you leave cause i know all i need is on
the other side of the door

verse 2
me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
going through the photographs staring at the phone
i keep going back over things we both said
and i remember the slamming door
and all the things that i misread

so babe if you know everything
tell me why you couldnt see
when i left i wanted you to chase after me yeah

chorus
i said leave but all i really want is you
to stand outside my window throwing pebbles
screaming im in love with you
wait there in the pouring rain coming back for more
and dont you leave cause i know all i need is on
the other side of the door

bridge
and ill scream out the window
i cant even look at you
i dont need you but i do i do i do
ill say theres nothing you can say
to make this right again i mean it i mean it
what i mean is

chorus
i said leave but baby all i want is you
to stand outside my window throwing pebbles
screaming im in love with you
wait there in the pouring rain coming back for more
and dont you leave cause i know all i need is on
the other side of the door
outro
with your face and the beautiful eyes
and the conversation with the little white lies
and the faded picture of a beautiful night
you carried me from your car up the stairs
and i broke down crying was she worth this mess
after everything and that little black dress
after everything i must confess i need you11embed"
