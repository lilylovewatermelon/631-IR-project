im stuck in this bed you made
alone with a sinking feeling
i saw through the words you said
to the secrets youve been keeping
its written upon your face
all the lies how they cut so deeply
you cant get enough you take
and take and take and never say

chorus chester bennington
no youve gotta get it inside
you push it back down you push it back down
no youll never get it inside
push it back down blackout blood in your eye

verse 2 chester bennington
you say that its not your fault
and swear that i am mistaken
you said its not what it seems
no remorse for the trust youre breakin
you run but then back you fall
suffocate in the mess youre makin
you cant get enough you take
and take and take and take and take
fuck it are you listening

no youll never get it inside
push it back down blackout blood in your eye

bridge mike shinoda
floating down as colors fill the light
we look up from the ground in fields of paper white
and floating up you pass us in the night
a future gazing out a past to overwrite
so come down far below
weve been waiting to collect the things you know
come down far below
weve been waiting to collect what youve let go

outro mike shinoda  chester bennington
come down oh
come down oh
come down oh
come down oh
