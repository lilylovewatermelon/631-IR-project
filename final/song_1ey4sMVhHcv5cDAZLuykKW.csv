the way hold up neyo ya
the way you switch
little mama so thick
i’m so sick
body like a shotgun bang
she’s a hot one

and everywhere you have a problem
probably tired of hearing it

it ain’t a secret baby girl you fine
you could have anybody here that you want that’s right
including this fella
cause you’re a diamond and i dig your shine
