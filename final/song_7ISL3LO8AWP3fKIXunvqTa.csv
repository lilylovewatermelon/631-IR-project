verse 1
i said the joker is a wanted man
he makes his way all across the land
i see him siftin through the sand
so ill tell you all the story bout the joker and the thief in the night

verse 2
hes always laughing in the midst of power
always living in the final hour
there is always sweet in sour
so we are not goin home

chorus
can you see the joker flying over
as shes standing in the field of clover
watching out everyday i wonder what would happen if he took her away

verse 3
what you see well you might not know
you get the feelin comin after the glow
the vagabond is amoving slow
so ill tell you all the story bout the joker and the thief in the night

verse 4
all the people that you see in the night
hold their dreams up to the light
the wilder beast is searching for sight
and we are not going home
