there aint much to do here in this town
when the work is done and the sun goes down
theres a place that we all go
where its two for one just to watch the show
yeah me and the boys hanging around
hands in our pockets getting lost in the crowd

chorus
watching pretty girls drinking tall boys
swinging their hips to a country song
silver cans up in the air
theyre singing along singing along
aint nothing like getting right
chasing a buzz with a cold bud light
watching pretty girls drinking tall boys
pretty girls drinking tall boys yeah

verse 2
yeah you ought to see them in summer time
they cant wait to show off those tan lines
out at a cove that we all know
where its string bikinis and tied up boats
out in the sun all getting baked
me and the boys kicking back in our shades

watching pretty girls drinking tall boys
swinging their hips to a country song
silver cans up in the air
theyre singing along singing along
aint nothing like getting right
chasing a buzz with a cold bud light
watching pretty girls drinking tall boys
pretty girls drinking tall boys yeah
