sneaky greedy money seeking
always peeping fucking creeping
got it on the down low
so you think you always squeaky
what if i had told your mother
her son was a cruel motherfucker ah
its not just me its everybody
who thinks that youre fucking ugly
when you come and hurt us
just so you can get your money
forced to follow the leader
whos being possessed by demons

chorus
ive tried to make you listen
but you wont its your way right
killin kids all day and night
prescription pills and online fights
shootin at the angels while
claiming youre the good guy
all you want is cash and hype
fuck our dreams and thats not right

complicated overrated
youre fixated and elated
by the separation
in this place that youve created
fuck all of your rules and guidelines
you shouldnt even be on the sidelines
cant you see that were all hurtin
if youre not teachin were not learnin
excuse me how much are you earnin

chorus
ive tried to make you listen
but you wont its your way right
killin kids all day and night
prescription pills and online fights
shootin at the angels while
claiming youre the good guy
all you want is cash and hype
fuck our dreams and thats not right

postchorus
the principal oh woah oh
oh wheres the principle
oh wheres the principle
oh wheres the principle oh woah oh
oh wheres the principle
oh wheres the principle
