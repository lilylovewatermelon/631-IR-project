from trying to slow down
im always burning my tires
and my horn is to loud
i catch people staring looking funny at me
when i step to the window and i toss a tv
sometimes i get crazy and it makes a big scene
but when i hit 21 i wanna stand up and scream
im filthy rich with laughter im too big for the room
you know from two stories up
a zenith makes a big boom

its hard to get around in a six foot town
when your ten feet tall everything is so small
im always bumping my head
im way to long for the bed
its hard to get around
in a six foot town

some people live inside a tiny little box
theyre preoccupied about mismatching their socks
i never been one to worry about much
i just wanna laugh and love
i just wanna live it up

its hard to get around in a six foot town
when your ten feet tall everything is so small
im always bumping my head
im way to long for the bed
its hard to get around
in a six foot town
you might also likesometimes i stumble just because of my size
but hey yall thats alright
thats the way god made me
i am what i am
and i cant do nothing bout that

its hard to get around in a six foot town
when your ten feet tall everything is so small
im always bumping my head
im way to long for the bed
its hard to get around

its hard to get around in a six foot town
when your ten feet tall everything is so small
im always bumping my head
im way to long for the bed
its hard to get around
in a six foot townembed"
