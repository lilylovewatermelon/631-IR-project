just when i had you off my head
your voice comes thrashing wildly through my quiet bed
you say you want to try again
but ive tried everything but giving in

why do you want to break my heart again
why am i going to let you try when

all we ever do is say goodbye
all we ever do is say goodbye
all we ever do is say goodbye
all we ever do is say goodbye

verse 2
i bought a ticket on a plane
and by the time it landed you were gone again
i love you more than songs can say
but i cant keep running after yesterday so

prechorus
why do you want to break my heart again
why am i going to let you try when
