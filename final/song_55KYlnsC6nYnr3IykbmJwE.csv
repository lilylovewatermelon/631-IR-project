the good life is what i need
too many people stepping over me
the only thing thats been on my mind
is the one thing i need before i die

chorus
all i want is a little of the good life
all i need is to have a good time
oh oh oh
the good life
all i want is a little of the good life
all i need is to have a good time
oh oh oh
the good life
the good life

verse 2
i dont really know who i am
its time for me to take a stand
i need a change and i need it fast
i know that any day could be the last

chorus
all i want is a little of the good life
all i need is to have a good time
oh oh oh
the good life
all i want is a little of the good life
all i need is to have a good time
oh oh oh
the good life
