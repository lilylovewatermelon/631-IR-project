i cant be the only one who’s lonely tonight
i cant be the only—

verse 1 nf
yeah does anybody feel like me
show of hands i dont need a lot i just wanna find my peace
yeah why you throwin’ rocks oh you wanna kill my dreams
okay tell me everything im not
you think i didnt know those things
always been a little lost and i still might be
lifes hard but its okay its okay
watchin the comments feels like im at a court date
how could i complain
with a house like this and a car like that in the driveway
half of what i say
kinda feels like a dream that i’m gonna wake from someday
wishin’ that id pray
a little more often and put more time into my faith
travel in my brain woo might find damage and no grace
things that i hold on to but i won’t say things that i wont let go
so i chain my soul to the heartbreak
havin a nice day thats not a average in my case
don’t like cameras in my face glamour its all fake
love my job but it might seem odd that im here cause i hate fame oh
yeah pain might get to me throwin threats at me
they cant tell disconnectin me its affectin me
hide that well theyll write checks to me but dont check on me
find myself always questioning what comes next for me
i cant be the only—

verse 2 nf  sasha alex sloan
yeah if you made a list of people that you trusted would you put your name down
do you know who you are
when you look at life and you talk about yours do you feel proud lonely
are you leaving a mark or scared to make a bad impression so you just go hide in the dark lonely
livin and playin a part knowin regretll come back up tomorrow
thats what it does aint it dont know what were chasin but we all do it
just a part of life i guess were all foolish
running after what we think will make us happy til it falls through lonely
and then we find out later it aint what we wanted
so we give up on it then we pile the garbage lonely
and we watch it grow and find a drug to numb it
til we hit the point that we can barely function
am i motivated is my music dated
would i be the same if i was medicated
even therapists say i need medication
i avoid it though because im scared to take it
am i the only one that has a loaded gun
thats full of doubts and memories to overcome
and i complain about em when they shoot at me
but i know truthfully i like to load em up and let em—
thats so sad to see thats so sad to see i need help
they talk passively then come after me by myself
lost that half of me god there has to be someone else
dont feel bad for me i just cant believe that im the only
