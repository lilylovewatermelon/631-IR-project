standing still but still moving
lying down but not resting
breathing air suffocating
all the while im debating
life was never what i thought
never what i wanted it to be
had a plan couldnt follow
had a dream it was hollow
everywhere felt like nowhere
everything was so boring
life was never what i wanted
never what i thought
until you came and turned it all around

chorus
oh you found the peace of me
it was missing it was broken
you put soul into it
oh you found the whole of me
i was empty now im better
all my peace is back together

verse 2
restless ways for a living
fitting in cause i was driven
saying yes when i meant no
holding on shouldve let go
i was scattered all around
left shattered on the ground
you picked me up
all i wanted was a little bit of hope
couldnt find it
you showed me something that i never knew i owned
you put a light to it
you might also likechorus
oh you found the peace of me
it was missing it was broken
you put soul into it
oh you found the whole of me
i was empty now im better
cause you pieced me back together

bridge
what a life always tried
what a life lived without you
dont leave me and i wont fall apart
i wont leave you
and its cold and im blind
and i would and it feels good
what a waste of my mind
every time all the time

chorus
oh yeah yeah yeah
oh yeah oh oh oh ohoh
oh you found the whole of me
it was missing it was broken
you put it back together
oh youve found the whole of me haha yeah oh
outro
i was empty now im better
cause you pieced me back togetherembed"
