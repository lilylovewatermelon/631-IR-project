chorus

verse 1
ooh i just wanna lay right by your side
we dont gotta love each other right
we just gotta make it through the night
you dont gotta say
youre not into me no more
when we pass out on the floor
see the sun rise through the door
by the way you move i know you want me to
tell you all the rules i know im searching too
give me all your clues and things to guide me through
the end of the world the end of thе world
dont blow out the fuse when darknеss comes to light
so much i could do to make you come to life
fingers coming loose i see theres no more time
dont tell me im gone dont tell me im gone
