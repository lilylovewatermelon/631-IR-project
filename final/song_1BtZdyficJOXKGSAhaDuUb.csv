cause ill be running late
dont you wait for me
by the flowers upon my grave
dont you wait for me
i wont be coming home
dont you wait for me
unplug the telephone

cause im wild running through the hills
and my eyes are wondering how you feel
and the miles upon miles keep falling from the sky
dont you wait for me
when the flowers die

dont you wait for me
i have many miles to go
dont you wait for me
i have nothing left to show
dont you wait for me
wonderin what is wrong
dont you wait for me
ill catch you in the break of dawn

cause im wild running through the hills
and my eyes are wondering how you feel
and the miles upon miles keep falling from the sky
dont you wait for me
when the flowers die
see ryan bingham liveget tickets as low as 142you might also likedont you wait for me
sleepin in the summer sun
dont you wait for me
with my pillow lies my gun
dont you wait for me
im gonna finish last
dont you wait for me
im mending fences of my past

cause im wild running through the hills
and my eyes are wondering how you feel
and the miles upon miles keep falling from the sky
dont you wait for me
when the flowers die

dont you wait for me
when the flowers dieembed"
