im so passive too sarcastic
shut you out just out of habit
i don’t know
so i spent five months out here treading water
now i wonder why you bothered
i dont know
let me go

chorus
why do you keep reaching for my hand
do you see something i cant
why do you try to save me
this fate is well deserved
i only make things worse
why do you try to save me

verse 2
have i served my sentence learned my lesson
healed those wounds from my indiscretions
i don’t know
am i still so selfish exile ended
what do you see in my misdirections
i dont know
let me go
see noah kahan liveget tickets as low as 104you might also likechorus
why do you keep reaching for my hand
do you see something i cant
why do you try to save me
this fate is well deserved
i only make things worse
why do you try to save me

bridge
and sometimes i pray
that maybe i will change
into who you think i am

chorus
why do you keep reaching for my hand
do you see something i cant
why do you try to save me
this fate is well deserved
i only make things worse
why do you try to save me
why do you try to save me2embed"
