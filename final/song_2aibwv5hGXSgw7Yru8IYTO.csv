come to decide that the things that i tried
were in my life just to get high on
when i sit alone come get a little known
but i need more than myself this time
step from the road to the sea to the sky
and i do believe that we rely on
when i lay it on come get to play it on
all my life to sacrifice

verse 2 anthony kiedis
when will i know that i really cant go
to the well once more time to decide on
when its killing me when will i really see
all that i need to look inside
come to believe that i better not leave
before i get my chance to ride
when its killing me what do i really need
all that i need to look inside

the more i like to let it go
hey oh whoawhoa

chorus anthony kiedis with john frusciante
deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
where its so white as snow
privately divided by a world so undecided
and theres nowhere to go
in between the cover of another perfect wonder
and its so white as snow
running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
and theres nowhere to go
ho

verse 3 anthony kiedis  john frusciante
when to descend to amend for a friend
all the channels that have broken down

and i do believe what we rely on
when i lay it on come get to play it on
all my life to sacrifice
