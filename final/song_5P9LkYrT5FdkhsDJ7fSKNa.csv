not enough never too much
baby look just like love
rolling stone gathers no moss
but leave a trail of busted stuff

chorus
you know shes going to leave my broken heart behind her
ill take what shes giving up
you know shes going to leave my broken heart behind her
ill take what shes giving up yeah

verse 2
moveing to kiss those sweet sugar lips
baby look just like love
without a care she floats above me
she got me down here looking up

chorus
you know shes going to leave my broken heart behind her
i dig what shes giving up
you know shes going to leave this broken man behind
shes the one for me

verse 3
when she move she move so cool
got me feel just like a fool
but inside is where the devil rides
woman look just like love
