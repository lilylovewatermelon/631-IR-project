if you ever start to wonder
why all the rain and all the thunder
follows her around
you better cut that girl loose
most of time everythings fine
but as soon as she starts to whine
if you have no patience
you better cut that girl loose
what are you a coward
who are you helping
you got the power
then do it yourself king
and do it for her
you better cut that girl loose ahhahhahhahh
set her free let her be
leave her be oh yes
outro daniel caesar girl
you dont love me anymore
lets see how you like this song
see you walking out the door
wonder why it took you so long
ever since the day that i met you
knew you were the girl of my dreams
but we could never be
hello
yeah sorry i was just getting everything out right now
ill be outside
sorry i was actually just gonna take my phone
take it
so write down any phone number if you need ityou might also like12embed"
