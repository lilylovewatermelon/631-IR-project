had a bottle of wine
and a perfectly fine dinner
talked about school work life
and how cold it was last winter
laid down in this big old bed
and you turned on the tv
fell asleep without a goodnight kiss
or even an i love you baby
oh baby

chorus  darius rucker
how can we go all night
and not even touch one another
how can we say were still in love
and not be lovers
how did we get here
where you can be right there
and i can be with you
and miss you

verse 2  darius rucker
i remember the time
when every time you saw me you had to kiss me
oh but lying here tonight girl
that all just seems like ancient history
oh what happened baby
see darius rucker liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likechorus  darius rucker
how can we go all night
and not even touch one another
how can we say were still in love
and not be lovers
how did we get here
where you can be right there
and i can be with you
and miss you

verse 3  darius rucker
baby i still need you
hold and touch you
please say its not the end
oh baby please say were not just friends

we can go all night
and not even touch one another no
baby im im still in love
so lets be lovers
you know its not fair
that you can be right there
and i can be with you
oh oh and miss you
oh baby i i miss you darling
oh i do oh i do laying right next to you
i miss you girl
oh yeah oh baby i miss youembed"
