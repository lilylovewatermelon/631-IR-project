i keep the letters that you wrote in a secret place
every now and then i go down memory lane
october passed me by just like any month
but i still think of the times you took the breath out of my

refrain
lungs
you dont have to run

verse 2
yeah i got bitter when you got cold
and could you really blame me though
cause im still tied up when you go
you know this song is about you
who else could it be
you were the first to make me feel like i was

refrain
me
just a memory

verse 3
it wasnt all good yeah it wasnt all pretty
lost our grip whilе tryna go steady
holding on to you like maybe onе day well meet
see ​girl in red liveget tickets as low as 23you might also likebridge
i met you at the wrong time didnt wanna see
i was busy with the stars you were looking at me
for better or for worse i dont know but for what its worth

i made you my whole world
i made you my whole world
screaming at the top of my lungs i love you my girl
always in the back of my mind youll be my girl4embed"
