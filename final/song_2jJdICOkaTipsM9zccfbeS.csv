what do you say we pack our things and get out of here
i’ve been saving all my life just to disappear
can i hold you can i hold you to that
you can’t go on living life hiding behind fear
all the thoughts in my fucked up head are finally coming clear
can i hold you can i hold you to that

chorus
we could see the world
we could see the world
we could see the world
we could see the world
we could see the world
whoa

verse 2
what do you say we pack the car and get behind the wheel
all we have to do is drive and let the feeling steer
can i hold you can i hold you to that

chorus
we could see the world
we could see the world
we could see the world
we could see the world
we could see the world
