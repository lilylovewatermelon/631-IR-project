she looked me in the eye and said its over
i cant take this heartache anymore
she said dont tell me lies and try to please me
ive heard it all so many times before

verse 2
and i took her by the arm and said dont leave me
theres nothing in this world i wouldnt do
just give me time ill be the man youve needed
she said i wish that i could take that for the truth

chorus
and i said someday ill get my life straight
and she said its too late whats done is done
and i told her someday she said i cant wait
cause sometimes someday just never comes

verse 3
she said all ive ever wanted was to love you
and somewhere deep inside me i still do
but now i think its time i stopped believin
cause im never gonna see a change in you

chorus
and i said someday ill get my life straight
and she said its too late whats done is done
and i told her someday she said i cant wait
cause sometimes someday just never comes
