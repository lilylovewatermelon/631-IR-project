she said what she wants is a man to be faithful
a true heart somebody willing and able
to stay by her side through thick and thin
a tender touch every now and then
shes not hung up on fairy tales
or some dream at the bottom of a wishing well
fancy cars or diamond rings
what she wants most are the little things

chorus
thats what she gets
thats what she gets
thats what she gets for loving me
mmmhmm

verse 2
at times i lay awake at night
stare at her laying by my side
knowing there in her heart as she sleeps
she can forever count on me

chorus
thats what she gets
thats what she gets
thats what she gets for loving me
see brooks  dunn liveget tickets as low as 30you might also likebridge
whatever turns her on
im here to do it
till the day they write my name in stone
ill live to prove it

chorus
oh thats what she gets
yeah thats what she gets
thats what she gets for loving me

chorus
oh thats what she gets
yeah thats what she gets
thats what she gets for loving me
