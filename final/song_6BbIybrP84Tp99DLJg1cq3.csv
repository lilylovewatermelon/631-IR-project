lord i dont know which way i am going
which way the river going to flow
it just seems that upstream i keep rowing
still got such a long way to go
still got such a long way to go

verse 2
then that light hits your eye
i know i swear
well find somewhere
the streets are paved with gold
bullets fly split the sky
but thats alright sometimes
sunlight comes streaming through the holes
