verse 1 ohgeesy
shooter one call away just like chingy
diamonds dancing and they drip yeah they vv

thirtysix in a brick and i sell it by the zip
chopper got a kick like david beckham in this bitch
and i just dropped a six i aint rememberin this bitch
lil wayne in my coupe bitch no ceilings
little baby get the boot got no feelings
she wanna fuck on me cause its appealing
wanna fuck a rap nigga its appealing
got your bitch on my dick cause she wanna fuck the boy
beat it up knock it down like im oscar de la hoya
i dont fight got a toy im a man not a boy
count the money then recount it cause it bring it a lot of joy

verse 2 rob vicious
its the young vicious savage you can call me the boss
had hop up on the track and spit a little bit of sauce
all these dirty ass hoes and you fake ass pimps
got some youngins in the field plot to take your shit
when im coming to collect you better tuck your strips
probably fucking up a check before i fuck your bitch
and youre hard she over here because she love my clique
and we put money over tits so dont you trust that bitch
set him up knock him off its a go like shit
and he say he aint ever ever met a ho like this
even told lil mama where he hidin four five bricks
we tied him up before we robbed him left him broke like shit
steady thinking bout some dough man i just get to the guap
feel like im playing with myself mixing the molly with wock
fuck your lady hella wavy til the day that i drop
vicious till the death you know how lil robbie rock
