shes yelling on the phone again
and shes banging on the door
shes losing all control again

whats she doing in the tub
shes shooting up the junk again
and all the water in the stream
couldnt ever wash her clean in my head

and im leaving
demon with the needles leaning over your shoulder
its over

i pictured this differently
i cast us in perfect light
id trade an eternity
for whats been taken away

feels like the future for you and me
our love fades in the failing light
this time you drowned us in misery
thats why now youve forced me to say

goodbye my love
so long
youve thrown us away
you might also likeits been going on for months
said shed only done it once with friends
i couldnt keep her clean at all
every dealer that she called was a friend

believe it
demon with the needles leaning over your shoulder
its over

i pictured this differently
i cast us in perfect light
id trade an eternity
for whats been taken away

feels like the future for you and me
our love fades in the failing light
this time you drowned us in misery
thats why now youve forced me to say

goodbye my love
so long
youve thrown us away

goodbye my love
so long
youve thrown us away
i remember how it worked
back when we were both in love again
madeup memories
they were few and far between
no it wasnt meant to be
from then

been stuck inside a dream
woke up and i could breathe the air
been down this road before
ill make it on my own i swear

feels like i pictured this differently
our lives i cast us in perfect light
this time id trade an eternity
thats why you fucking forced me to say

goodbye im saving her
my love i wave to her
so long youve thrown us away

goodbye im saving her
my love i wave to her
so long youve thrown us away3embed"
