verse 1
took a ride to the end of the line
where no one ever goes
ended up on a broken train
with nobody i know
but the pain and the longings the same when youre dying
now im lost and im screaming for help alone

chorus
relax take it easy
for there is nothing that we can do
relax take it easy
blame it on me or blame it on you

postchorus
its as if im scared
its as if im terrified
its as if im scared
its as if im playing with fire

scared
its as if im terrified
are you scared
are we playing with fire

verse 2
oh there is an answer
to the darkest times
its clear we dont understand it
but the last thing on my mind

is to leave you i believe that were in this together
dont scream there are so many roads left to run

chorus
relax take it easy
for there is nothing that we can do
relax take it easy
blame it on me or blame it on you

relax take it easy
for there is nothing that we can do
relax take it easy
blame it on me or blame it on you
