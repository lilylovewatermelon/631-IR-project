she got out of town
on a railway new york bound
took all except my name
another alien out on broadway

prechorus 1
theres some things in this world
you just cant change
some things you cant see
until it gets too late

chorus
and baby baby baby
when all your love is gone who will save me
from all im up against out in this world
and maybe maybe maybe
youll find somethin thats enough to keep you
but if the bright lights dont receive you
you should turn yourself around and come on home

verse 2
i got a hole in me now
yeah i got a scar i can talk about
she keeps a picture of me
in her apartment in the city
