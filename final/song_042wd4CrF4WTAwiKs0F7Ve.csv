verse 1
everyday i come late
wash my clothes in the same sink
i dont give a damn bout what they think
as long as i pay rent
i dont even whine bout my paycheck
i know its short but i make ends
cause it could be a worse situation

prechorus
all that glitters aint gold
and all that shines bright aint a diamond
all that wrinkles isnt old
and as far as you see aint the horizon

chorus
a death in designer aint everything
to live on an island aint everything
we keep on tryin why do we keep on trying
well end up dyin over anything

verse 2
everyday i leave late
i wait out front in the same place
and i dont give a damn bout what they say
long as the day ends
i made some plans with some good friends
i dont even know where the day went
but it could be the worst conversation
you might also likeinterlude
you know theres a roach on the floor
right there
ah man

prechorus
all that glitters aint gold
and all that shines bright aint a diamond ohoh ohh
and all that wrinkles isnt old
and as far as you see aint the horizon ohoh ohoh ohoh ohohh

chorus
a death in designer aint everything
to live on an island to live on an island
we keep on tryin why do we keep on trying
well end up dyin over anything

part ii nobody carez

intro
everybody want a motherfuckin benz or beamer
designer sneakers aint no motherfuckin dreamers
shit is deeper than neiman
mark us on your hollywood starlets
underneath theres niggas starvin impoverished
people dont give no fucks nigga
trump dont give a fuck
your niggas dont give a fuck
your favorite artists dont give a motherfuckin fuck
do you give a fuck nigga
interlude
keep playin motherfucker

chorus
if you told em you was down and out
would they pull up or would they wait it out
would they ever call you just to talk about
whatever they wanna talk about
if you borrowed money cause its life or death
would they ask you for their money back
would they tell the world all of your business
and this and that your business and this and that

verse
maybe youre too friendly or maybe youre too real
you put your time and faith in people that cant seal the deal
trials and tribulation often force one to reveal
that maybe you just dont know what to feel
did you know you were you with the devil last night
couldnt see where you was goin with a flashlight
i know it burns im just concerned when will you learn
i know that you were with the devil last night
and baby i aint sayin you dont act right
this world dont love but that dont mean that you cant hope it does

chorus
if you told em you was down and out
would they pull up or would they wait it out
would they ever call you just to talk about
whatever they wanna talk about
if you borrowed money cause its life or death
would they ask you for their money back
would they tell the world all of your business
and this and that your business and this and that14embed"
