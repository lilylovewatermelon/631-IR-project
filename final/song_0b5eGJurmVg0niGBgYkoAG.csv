well i drank a lot of whiskey in my time
and ive held a lot of women that were fine
and i made a little money i blew every dime
tryin to untangle my mind
well ive made a lot of choices that were wrong
that the good lord spend too many nights alone
and ive been out on the edge and ive stumbled cross the line
tryin to untangle my mind

chorus
so if you see me and im lonesome and stoned
so far down the devils lookin high
im just trying to untangle my mind

verse 2
well i do what i do and i dont know why
but i do what i do til the day i die
no heartache for the ticket
so i guess ill pay the fine
tryin to untangle my mind

chorus
if you see me and im lonesome and stoned
so far down the devils lookin high
im just tryin to untangle my mind
yes im tryin to untangle my mindsee chris stapleton liveget tickets as low as 36you might also like1embed"
