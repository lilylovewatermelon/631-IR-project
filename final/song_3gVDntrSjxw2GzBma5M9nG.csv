i dont wanna talk now i dont wanna hear you scream no mo
wont somebody save me everything i do feel like its wrong
all we do is fall down even though we try to stay afloat
i swear its gon kill me even though you think it wont
so why rock the boat and make waves
when everythings calm and okay
so why am i confused if you love me
i thought this would be smooth sailing

chorus the fray joe king
cause i dont wanna let you go
but were caught in the undertow
cause i am losing my control
but were caught in the undertow
our only prayer is all our own
but we need air we go alone
cause i dont wanna let you go
but were caught in the undertow

verse 2 esthero
i dont want to cry every time we try it never fails
we change the illusion whenever you go and set the sail
my hearts in your hand dont you go hurt me again
all we got is one chance and its sink or swim
so why rock a boat and make waves make waves
when everythings calm and okay im okay
why am i confused if you love me love me
i thought this would be smooth sailing

we need air we go alone
