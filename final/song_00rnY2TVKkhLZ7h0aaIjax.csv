i know you caught me cheating and you tired of me lyin
imma be honest with you baby i know i crossed tha line
if you dont wanna fuck with me no mo than cool its fine
but before you go baby can we fuck one more time

verse 1
i know i fucked up and sorry aint what you wanna hear
but i cant change that shit dog it is what it is
you can go fuck another nigga if thats how you feel
if thats goin to make you feel better than gone do it hell
you asked me about this lil petty shit and i kept it real
know that shit probably hard for you to swallow still
i aint know how bad i hurt you til i seen ya tears
i aint asking you to accept how a nigga live
if you feel like another nigga can treat you better than it is what it is
but let the truth be told its been my pussy for years
now you got all ya lil home girls up in ya ear
just lets fuck one more time before you dip

chorus x2
i know you caught me cheating and you tired of me lyin
imma be honest with you baby i know i crossed tha line
if you dont wanna fuck with me no mo than cool its fine
but before you go baby can we fuck one more time

i know its probably best for us to go our seperate ways
cause i know me imma fuck up again anyway
but in my muhfuckin heart a nigga want you to stay
cause once you fuck up this shit can never be straight
im dead ass wrong thats why i aint got shit to say
bet you think a nigga didnt give a fuck anyway
i just had to fuck you good the other day
and how that pussy was bitin i didnt wanna scape
you rode that dick so long until you started to shake
and i can tell when you would nothin i can see it in ya face
imma miss fuckin you from the back and how i grabbed ya waist
but most of all imma miss how that pussy taste

chorus x2
i know you caught me cheating and you tired of me lyin
imma be honest with you baby i know i crossed tha line
if you dont wanna fuck with me no mo than cool its fine
but before you go baby can we fuck one more time

verse 3
it aint another nigga whos goin to fuck you like i do
you can talk that shit all you want but baby you know its true
i fucked up i said im sorry now its on you
you can play stupid and give me away if you want too
if you say fuck it its over then i guess we through
i know if i caught you cheating ill probably cut you loose
dont get it fucked up i aint tryin to tell you what to do
whatever decision you make i gotta live with it
but whatever your answer is just make sure you can deal with it
but if we do break up imma keep tryin to get it this
shit we goin through right now is real silly
gone cuss me out and lets fuck and gone kill it
chorus x2
i know you caught me cheating and you tired of me lyin
imma be honest with you baby i know i crossed tha line
if you dont wanna fuck with me no mo than cool its fine
but before you go baby can we fuck one more timeembed"
