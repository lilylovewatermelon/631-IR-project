with just for a dollar a day
been workin for a dollar a day
ive been workin for a dollar a day

man i never understand why all my money
goes down to man at the bank
and all he does is sit and think
about the money that im gonna make

and all of my brothers well their jumpin on planes
and they going off fighting in wars
they are lowered on a desert shore
fighting for my freedom and a little bit of oh

man it sure does cost well a whole lot of money
well to live in the land of the free
well i think ill go and plant me a seed
grow a marijuana money tree

well then im gonna head down to south louisiana
with a guitar on my back
corn bread and a gunny sack
maybe uncle samll cut me some slack

ive been digging in the rock since five oclock
and my calluses is cut to the bone
well the soles in my shoes is worn
cuz ive been diggin in the rocks since dawn
