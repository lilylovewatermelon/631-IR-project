uh
im head over heels for someone high
that i really cant deal with deal with
i want to block her out my mind
but i really cant do it do it
i tell myself this the last time
imma let her do this to me
whenever we do spend time
i realize that i cant get enough of you

interlude patrick stump from fall out boy  timbaland
wipe that smile off your fuckin face and i say to you
wipe that smile off your face then i say to you
wipe that smile off your fuckin face and i say to you
wipe that smile off your face

chorus patrick stump
to be despised to be loved
to be dreamt of to be sought
on the inside i dont care
right in the middle im right in the middle
to be despised to be loved
to be dreamt of to be sought
on the inside i dont care
be my unholy my one and my lonely

cause theyre the only poker face that ive got left
and everything i love about you is a mess
smash the mirror and break the palm readers hand
i want to be better than i am
