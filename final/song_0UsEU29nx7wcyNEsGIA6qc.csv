i got a hankerin for doin’ somethin crazy
dont have to tell me girl yeah i know that it’s wednesday
but youre lookin so good it feels like friday night huh
that ripped up tshirt makes me want you in the worst way
just take a sip and lets pretend like its your birthday
just dive right in girl the tequilas fine so fine
she said you know i love a party
dont threaten me with a good time

chorus thomas rhett  little big town
hop on up on that counter
let me see how you move
let me up there beside ya
stand back watch me cut loose
pour a little liquor make this living room twirl
watch me set this night on fire
baby you know i love a party
dont threaten me with a good time

verse 2 thomas rhett  karen fairchild
