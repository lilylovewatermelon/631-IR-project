tell me you like it
tell me you like it

verse 1
you say youve found yourself a new sound
the shits loaded and ready to go
a bit too much just like the old sound
already heard it for the hundredth time
one hundred more all have the same sound
running around with all the sheep that you know
its so sublime theyre breaking new ground
theyre sure to have another hit this time

prechorus
come on cant you just leave it alone
it doesnt have any soul
just find a thing of your own
and stop pretending to know

chorus
as the countless numbers hunger
for worldwide renown
all the pimping sons of plunder
will roll up their sleeves
all searching for the answers
they dont even care to know
give it to me give it to me
you like it
see disturbed liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likeverse 2
im still surrounded by the new sound
ive had enough and im ready to go
a stranglehold throughout the world now
the new obsession will fade in time
a thin reminder of the past now
all convoluted hardly ready to go
their whines and moans will never last now
i think youve given us our fill this time

prechorus
come on cant you just leave it alone
it doesnt have any soul
just find a thing of your own
and stop pretending to know

chorus
as the countless numbers hunger
for worldwide renown
all the pimping sons of plunder
will roll up their sleeves
all searching for the answers
they dont even care to know
give it to me give it to me
you like it
bridge
as its blown apart
hundreds thrown away
makes me question just what i believe
brothers torn apart
mindless drones enslaved
makes me search for an answer
i dont want to know
its like a plague from below
killing all that i know
one hundred voices the same
drench their sorrow in flame

chorus
as the countless numbers hunger
for worldwide renown
all the pimping sons of plunder
will roll up their sleeves
all searching for the answers
they dont even care to know
give it to me give it to me

as the countless numbers hunger
for worldwide renown
all the pimping sons of plunder
will roll up their sleeves
all searching for the answers
they dont even care to know
give it to me give it to me
you like it
outro
tell me you like it
tell me you like it
