mmm

verse 1
ive been spinnin now for time
couple women by my side
i got sinnin on my mind
sippin on red wine
ive been sittin here for ages
rippin out the pages
howd i get so faded
howd i get so faded

prechorus
oh no no dont leave me lonely now
if you loved me howd you never learn
ooh coloured crimson in my eyes
one or two could free my mind

chorus
this is how it ends
i feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
fading out again
i feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
so tell me when it kicks in

well tell me when it kicks in

verse 2
ive been lookin for a lover
thought id find her in a bottle
god make me another one
ill be feeling this tomorrow
lord forgive me for the things ive done
i was never meant to hurt no one
and i saw scars upon a brokenhearted lover

prechorus
oh no no dont leave me lonely now
if you loved me howd you never learn
ooh coloured crimson in my eyes
one or two could free my mind

chorus
this is how it ends
i feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
fading out again
i feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
so tell me when it kicks in

postchorus
well tell me when it kicks in
tell me when it kicks in
bridge
all the voices in my mind
callin out across the line
all the voices in my mind
callin out across the line
all the voices in my mind
callin out across the line
all the voices in my mind
callin out across the line
all the voices in my mind
callin out across the line
all the voices in my mind
callin out across the line
all the voices in my mind tell me when it kicks in
callin out across the line and i saw scars upon her
all the voices in my mind tell me when it kicks in
callin out across the line brokenhearted
all the voices in my mind tell me when it kicks in
callin out across the line and i saw scars upon her
all the voices in my mind tell me when it kicks in
callin out across the line brokenhearted
all the voices in my mind tell me when it kicks in
callin out across the line and i saw scars upon her
all the voices in my mind tell me when it kicks in
callin out across the line brokenhearted
all the voices in my mind tell me when it kicks in
callin out across the line and i saw scars upon her
all the voices in my mind tell me when it kicks in
callin out across the line brokenhearted
outro
so tell me when it kicks in
and i saw scars upon her
tell me when it kicks in
brokenhearted
and tell me when it kicks in
and i saw scars upon her
tell me when it kicks in
