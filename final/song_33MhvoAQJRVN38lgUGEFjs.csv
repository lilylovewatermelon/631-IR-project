little white church south of palestine
baby bump and a pretty bouquet
yeah i went to work the very next day
punching that clock working that line
double shifts and overtime
my hands are numb and bodys sore
getting by and wanting more

so many dreams that i aint showin
so many lives that i cant live
oh the years just keep on rollin
i wish i had so much more to give

yeah times get tough but love is strong
here in this trailer that we call home

she got one on her hip and one on the way
grocery lists and bills to pay
mama by day and school at night
i tried so hard to get it right
i got dreams what can i say
sometimes life gets in the way
well getting by and wanting more
baby there aint no shame in being poor
see whiskey myers liveget tickets as low as 56you might also likeyeah times get tough but love is strong
here in this trailer that we call home
yeah times get hard but we carry on
here in this trailer that we call home
