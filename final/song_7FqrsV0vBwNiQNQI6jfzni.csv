i guess i grew up on an old dirt road
apedal to the metal always did what is told
til i found out that my brand new clothes
acame second hand from the rich kids next door
and i grew up fast i guess i grew up mean
theres a thousand things inside my head i wish i aint seen
and now i just wander through a real bad dream
afeelin like im comin apart at the seams

chorus
well thank you jack daniels old number seven
tennessee whiskey got me drinkin in heaven
ana angels start to look good to me
theyre gonna have to deport me to the fiery deep
oh thank you jack daniels old number seven
tennessee whiskey got me drinkin in heaven
ana i know i cant stay here too long
cause i cant go a week without doin wrong
old number seven
without doin wrong im drinkin in heaven
without doin wrong old number seven
without doin wrong im drinkin in heaven

verse 2
so im sittin as the barstool it starts to grow roots
im feelin like an old wornout pair of shoes
oh tell me what is it that i should do
when im aswimmin in the liquor only halfway through
so im watchin as his wings spread as wide as could be
acome on now and wrap them around me
cause all i want to do now is fall to sleep
acome down here and lay next to me

oh thank you jack daniels old number seven
tennessee whiskey got me drinkin in heaven
ana up here the bottle never runs dry
and you never wake up with those tears in your eyes
oh thank you jack daniels old number seven

ana angels start to look good to me
theyre gonna have to deport me to the fiery deeps
