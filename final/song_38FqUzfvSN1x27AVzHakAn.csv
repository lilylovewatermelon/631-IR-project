and what befel them of things seldseen and peregrinefn138

the king asked her and what was their story and she answered it hath reached me o auspicious king that there was in the city of safety baghdad before the caliphate of abd almalik bin marwánfn139 a king omar bin alnuumán highs who was of the mighty giants and had subjected the chosroës of persia and the kaysars of eastern rome for none could warm himself at his firefn140 nor could any avail to meet him in the field of foray and fray and when he was angered there came forth from his nostrils sparks of flame he had made himself king over all quarters and allah had subjected to him all his creatures his word went forth to all great cities and his hosts had harried the farthest lands east and west had come under his command with whatsoever regions lay interspersed between them hind and sind and sinfn141 the holy land alhijaz the rich mountains of alyaman and the archipelagos of india and china moreover he reigned supreme over the north country and diyár bakr or mesopotamia and over sudán the eastern negro land and the islands of the ocean and all the far famed rivers of the earth sayhún and jayhúnfn142 nile and euphrates he sent envoys and ambassadors to capitals the most remote to provide him with true report and they would bring back tidings of justice and peace with assurance of loyalty and obedience and of prayers in the pulpits for king omar bin alnuuman for he was o ruler of the age a right noble king and there came to him presents of rarities and toll and tribute from all lands of his governing this mighty monarch had a son yclept sharrkanfn143 who was likest of all men to his father and who proved himself one of the prodigies of his time for subduing the brave and bringing his contemporaries to bane and ban for this his father loved him with love so great none could be greater and made him heir to the kingdom after himself this prince grew up till he reached mans estate and was twenty years old and allah subjected his servants to him by reason of his great might and prowess in battle now his father king omar had four wives legally married but allah had vouchsafed him no son by them save sharrkan whom he had begotten upon one of them and the rest were barren moreover he had three hundred and sixty concubines after the number of days in the coptic year who were of all nations and he had furnished for each and every a private chamber within his own palace for he had built twelve pavilions after the number of the months each containing thirty private chambers which thus numbered three hundred and three score wherein he lodged his handmaids and he appointed according to law for each one her night when he lay with her and came not again to her for a full yearfn144 and on this wise he abode for a length of time meanwhile his son sharrkan was making himself renowned in all quarters of the world and his father was proud of him and his might waxed and grew mightier so that he passed all bounds and bore himself masterfully and took by storm castles and cities presently by decree of the decreer a handmaid among the handmaids of omar bin nuuman became pregnant and her pregnancy being announced to the harim the king was informed thereof whereupon he rejoiced with exceeding joy and said haply it will be a son and so all my offspring will be males then he documented the date of her conception and entreated her with all manner of kindness but when the tidings came to sharrkan he was troubled and the matter seemed to him a sore one and a grievous and he said verily one cometh who shall dispute with me the sovereignty so quoth he to himself if this concubine bear a male child i will kill it but he kept that intention hidden in his heart such was the case with sharrkan but what happened in the matter of the damsel was as follows she was a roumiyah a greek girl by name sofiyah or sophiafn145 whom the king of roum and lord of cæsarea had sent to king omar as a present together with great store of gifts and of rarities she was the fairest of favour and loveliest of all his handmaids and the most regardful of her honour and she was gifted with a wit as penetrating as her presence was fascinating now she had served the king on the night of his sleeping with her saying to him o king i desire of the god of the heavens that he bless thee this night with a male child by me so i may bring him up with the best of rearing and enable him to reach mans estate perfect in intelligence good manners and prudent bearingfn146—a speech which much pleased the king during her pregnancy she was instant in prayer fervently supplicating the lord to bless her with a goodly male child and make his birth easy to her and allah heard her petition so that after her months were accomplished she sat safely upon the birth stoolfn147 now the king had deputed a eunuch to let him know if the child she should bring forth were male or female and in like way his son sharrkan had sent one to bring him tidings of the same in due time sophia was delivered of a child which the midwives examined and found to be a girl with a face sheenier than the moon so they announced this to all present in the room whereupon the kings messenger carried the news to him and sharrkans eunuch did the like with his master who rejoiced with exceeding joy but after the two had departed quoth sophia to the midwives wait with me awhile for i feel as if there were still somewhat in my womb then she cried out and the pains of child bed again took her and allah made it easy to her and she gave birth to a second child the wise women looked at it and found it a boy like the full moon with forehead flower white and cheek ruddy bright with rosy light whereupon the mother rejoiced as did the eunuchs and attendants and all the company and sophia was delivered of the after birth whilst all in the palace sent forth the trill of joyfn148 the rest of the concubines heard it and envied her lot and the tidings reached omar son of al nuuman who was glad and rejoiced at the excellent news then he rose and went to her and kissed her head after which he looked at the boy and bending over him kissed him whilst the damsels struck the tabors and played on instruments of music and the king gave order that the boy should be named zau almakán and his sister nuzhat alzamánfn149 they answered hearing and obedience and did his bidding so he appointed wet nurses and dry nurses and eunuchs and attendants to serve them and assigned them rations of sugar and diet drinks and unguents and else beside beyond the power of tongue to rehearse moreover the people of baghdad hearing that allah had blessed their king with issue decorated the city and made proclamation of the glad tidings with drum and tom tom and the emirs and wazirs and high dignitaries came to the palace and wished king omar bin alnuuman joy of his son zau almakan and of his daughter nuzhat alzaman wherefore he thanked them and bestowed on them dresses of honour and further favoured them with gifts and dealt largesse to all gentle and simple who were present after this fashion he did for four days full told and he lavished upon sophia raiment and ornaments and great store of wealth and every few days he would send a messenger to ask after her and the newborns and when four years had gone by he provided her with the wherewithal to rear the two children carefully and educate them with the best of instructions all this while his son sharrkan knew not that a male child had been born to his father omar son of alnuuman having news only that he had been blessed with the birth of nuzhat alzaman and they hid the intelligence from him until days and years had sped by whilst he was busied in battling with the brave and fighting single handed against the knights one day as king omar was sitting in his palace his chamberlains came in to him and kissing the ground before him said o king there be come ambassadors from the king of roum lord of constantinople the great and they desire admission to thee and submission to thy decree if the king commend us to introduce them we will so do and if not there is no disputing his behest he bade them enter and when they came in he turned to them and courteously receiving them asked them of their case and what was the cause of their coming they kissed the ground before him and said o king glorious and strong o lord of the arm that is long know that he who despatched us to thee is king afrídúnfn150 lord of ionia landfn151 and of the nazarene armies the sovereign who is firmly established in the empery of constantinople to acquaint thee that he is now waging fierce war and fell with a tyrant and a rebel the prince of casarea and the cause of this war is as follows one of the kings of the arabs in past time during certain of his conquests chanced upon a hoard of the time of alexanderfn152 whence he removed wealth past compute and amongst other things three round jewels big as ostrich eggs from a mine of pure white gems whose like was never seen by man upon each were graven characts in ionian characters and they have many virtues and properties amongst the rest that if one of these jewels be hung round the neck of a newborn child no evil shall befal him and he shall neither wail nor shall fever ail him as long as the jewel remain without failfn153 when the arab king laid hands upon them and learned their secrets he sent to king afridun presents of certain rarities and amongst them the three jewels afore mentioned and he equipped for the mission two ships one bearing the treasure and the other men of might to guard it from any who might offer hindrance on the high seas albeit well assured that none would dare waylay his vessels for that he was king of the arabs and more by token that their course lay over waters subject to the king of constantinople and they were bound to his port nor were there on the shores of that sea any save the subjects of the great king afridun the two ships set out and voyaged till they drew near our city when there sallied out on them certain corsairs from that country and amongst them troops from the prince of caesarea who took all the treasures and rarities in the ships together with the three jewels and slew the crews when our king heard of this he sent an army against them but they routed it then he marched a second and a stronger but they put this also to flight—whereupon the king waxed wroth and swore that he would not go forthfn154 against them save in his own person at the head of his whole army nor would he turn back from them till he had left caesarea of armeniafn155 in ruins and had laid waste all the lands and cities over which her prince held sway so he sent us to the lord of the age and the time sultan omar bin alnuuman king of baghdad and of khorasan desiring that he aid us with an army so may honour and glory accrue to him and he hath also forwarded by us somewhat of various kinds of presents and of the kings grace he beggeth their acceptance and the friendly boon of furtherance then the ambassadors kissed the ground before him—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the fortysixth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that after the ambassadors and retinue from the constantinopolitan king had kissed the ground before omar and had delivered their embassage they brought out the presents which were fifty damsels of the choicest from graecialand and fifty mamelukes in tunics of brocade belted with girdles of gold and silver each wearing in his ears hoops of gold with pendants of fine pearls costing a thousand ducats every one the girls were adorned in like fashion and were clad in stuffs worth a treasury of money when the king saw them he rejoiced in them and accepted them then he bade the ambassadors be honourably entreated and summoning his wazirs took counsel with them of what he should do herewith rose up among them a wazir an ancient man dandanfn156 highs who kissed the ground before omar and said o king there is nothing better to do in this matter than equip an army valiant and victorious and set over it thy son sharrkan with us as his lieutenants and this rede commendeth itself to me on two counts first because the king of roum hath invoked thine assistance and hath sent thee gifts which thou hast accepted and secondly because while no enemy dareth attack our country thine army may go forth safely and should it succour the king of graecialand and defeat his foe the glory will be thine moreover the news of it will be noised abroad in all cities and countries and especially when the tidings shall reach the islands of the ocean and the kings of mauritania shall hear it they will send thee offerings of rarities and pay thee tribute of money the king pleased by the wazirs words and approving his rede gave him a dress of honour and said to him of the like of thee should kings ask counsel and it seemeth fit that thou shouldst conduct the van of our army and our son sharrkan command the main battle then he sent for his son who came and kissed ground before him and sat down and he expounded to him the matter telling him what the ambassadors and the wazir dandan had said and he charged him to take arms and equip himself for the campaign enjoining him not to gainsay dandan in aught he should do moreover he ordered him to pick out of his army ten thousand horsemen armed capàpie and inured to onset and stress of war accordingly sharrkan arose on the instant and chose out a myriad of horsemen after which he entered his palace and mustered his host and distributed largesse to them saying ye have delay of three days they kissed the earth before him in obedience to his commands and began at once to lay in munitions and provide provisions for the occasion whilst sharrkan repaired to the armouries and took therefrom whatsoever he required of arms and armour and thence to the stable where he chose horses of choice blood and others when the appointed three days were ended the army drew out to the suburbs of baghdad cityfn157 and king omar came forth to take leave of his son who kissed the ground before him and received from the king seven parcels of moneyfn158 then he turned to danden and commended to his care the army of his son and the wazir kissed the ground before him and answered i hear and i obey and lastly he charged sharrkan that he should consult the wazir on all occasions which he promised to do after this the king returned to his city and sharrkan ordered the officers to muster their troops in battle array so they mustered them and their number was ten thousand horsemen besides footmen and camp followers then they loaded their baggage on their beasts and the war drums beat and the trumpets blared and the bannerols and standards were unfurled whilst sharrkan mounted horse with the wazir dandan by his side and the colours fluttering over their heads so the host fared forth and stinted not faring with the ambassadors preceding them till day departed and night drew nigh when they alighted and encamped for the night and as soon as allah caused the morn tomorrow they mounted and tried on guided by the ambassadors for a space of twenty days and by the night of the twenty first they came to a fine and spacious wady well grown with trees and shrubbery here sharrkan ordered them to alight and commanded a three days halt so they dismounted and pitched their tents spreading their camp over the right and the left slopes of the extensive valley whilst the wazir dandan and the ambassadors of king afridun pitched in the sole of the wadyfn159 as for sharrkan he tarried behind them for awhile till all had dismounted and had dispersed themselves over the valley sides he then slacked the reins of his steed being minded to explore the wady and to mount guard in his own person because of his fathers charge and owing to the fact that they were on the frontier of graecia land and in the enemys country so he rode out alone after ordering his armed slaves and his body guard to camp near the wazir dandan and he fared on along the side of the valley till a fourth part of the night was passed when he felt tired and drowsiness overcame him so that he could no longer urge horse with heel now he was accustomed to take rest on horseback so when slumber overpowered him he slept and the steed ceased not going on with him till half the night was spent and entered one of the thicketsfn160 which was dense with growth but sharrkan awoke not until his horse stumbled over wooded ground then he started from sleep and found himself among the trees and the moon arose and shone brightly over the two horizons eastern and western he was startled when he found himself alone in this place and said the say which neer yet shamed its sayer there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great but as he rode on in fear of wild beasts behold the moon spread her glad light over a meadow as if it were of the meads of paradise and he heard pleasant voices and a loud noise of talk and laughter captivating the senses of men so king sharrkan alighted and tying his steed to one of the trees went over a little way till he came upon a stream and heard a woman talking in arabic and saying now by the crush of the messiah this is not well of you but whose utters a word i will throw her and truss her up with her own girdlefn161 he kept walking in the direction of the sound and when he reached the further side he looked and behold a stream was gushing and flowing and antelopes at large were frisking and roving and wild cattle amid the pasture moving and birds expressed joy and gladness in their divers tongues and that place was purfled with all manner flowers and green herbs even as a poet described it in these couplets

most beautiful is earth in budding bloom  when lucid waters
            course through plain and wood
no work but his th all great th all glorious  giver of all
            gifts giver of all good

and as sharrkan considered the place he saw in it a christian monastery within whose enceinte a castle towered high in air catching the light of the moonfn162 through the midst of the convent passed a stream the water flowing amongst its gardens and upon the bank sat the woman whose voice he had heard while before her stood ten handmaids like moons and wearing various sorts of raiment and ornaments that dazed and dazzled the beholder high bosomed virgins as saith of them the poet in these couplets

the mead is bright with what is ont  of merry maidens
            debonnair
double its beauty and its grace  those trooping damsels slender
           fair
virgins of graceful swimming gait  ready with eye and lip to
            ensnare
and like the tendrild vine they loose  the rich profusion of
            their hair
shooting their shafts and arrows from  beautiful eyes beyond
          compare
overpowering and transpiercing  every froward adversaire
sharrkan gazed upon the ten girls and saw in their midst a lady like the moon at fullest with ringleted hair and forehead sheeny white and eyes wondrous wide and black and bright and temple locks like the scorpions tail and she was perfect in essence and attributes as the poet said of her in these couplets

she beamed on my sight with a wondrous glance  and her
            straight slender stature enshamed the lance
she burst on my sight with cheeks rosy red  where all manner of
            beauties have habitance
and the locks on her forehead were lowering as night  whence
            issues a dawn tide of happiest chance

then sharrkan heard her say to the handmaids come ye on that i may wrestle with you and gravel you ere the moon set and the dawn break so each came up to her in turn and she grounded them forthright and pinioned them with their girdles and ceased not wrestling and pitching them until she had overthrown one and all then there turned to her an old woman who was before her and the beldam said as in wrath o strumpet cost thou glory in grounding these girls behold i am an old woman yet have i thrown them forty times so what hast thou to boast of but if thou have the strength to wrestle with me stand up that i may grip thee and set thy head between thy heels the young lady smiled at her words but she was filled with inward wrath and she jumped up and asked o my lady zat aldawahifn163 by the truth of the messiah wilt thou wrestle with me in very deed or dost thou jest with me and she answered yea—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the fortyseventh night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the young lady asked zat aldawahi by the truth of the messiah wilt wrestle with me or dost jest and she answered yea i will wrestle with thee in very deed sharrkan looking on the while the damsel cried rise up for the fall an thou have spunk so to do when the old woman heard this she raged with exceeding rage and her body hair stood on end like the bristles of a fretful hedgehogfn164 then she sprang to her feet whilst the damsel stood up to her and said now by the truth of the messiah i will not wrestle with thee unless i be naked mistress whorefn165 so she loosed her petticoat trousers and putting her hand under her clothes tore them off her body then twisted up a silken kerchief into cord shape girt it round her middle and became as she were a scald head if ritah or a spotted snake with this she inclined towards the damsel and said do thou as i have done all this time sharrkan was gazing at the twain and laughing at the beldams loathly semblance so the damsel leisurely rose and taking a sash of yamani stuff passed it twice round her waist then she tucked up her trousers and displayed two calves of alabaster carrying a mound of crystal smooth and rounded and a stomach which exhaled musk from its dimples as it were a bed of nuumans anemones and breasts like double pomegranates then the old woman leant towards her and the two laid hold either of each while sharrkan raised his head heavenwards and prayed allah that the belle might beat the beldam presently the young woman get beneath the old woman and gripping her waist cloth with the left and circling her neck with the right hand hoisted her off the ground with both whereupon the old woman strove to free herself and in so doing fell on her back arsiversy with her legs high in air and her hairy bush between them showed manifest in the moonshine furthermore she let fly two great fartsfn166 one of which blew up the dust from the earths face and the other steamed up to the gate of heaven sharrkan laughed till he fell back upon the ground then he arose and baring his brand looked right and left but he saw no one save the old woman sprawling on her back and said to himself he lied not who named thee lady of calamities verily thou knewest her prowess by her performance upon the others so he drew near them to hear what should pass between them then the young lady went up to the old one and throwing a wrapper of thin silk upon her nakedness helped her to don her clothes and made excuses saying o my lady zat al dawahi i intended only to throw thee and not all this but thou triedst to twist out of my hands so laud to allah for safety she returned her no answer but rose in her shame and walked away till out of sight leaving the handmaids prostrate and pinioned with the fair damsel standing amongst them quoth sharrkan to himself every luck hath its cause sleep did not fall upon me nor the war horse bear me hither save for my good fortune for doubtless this maid and what is with her shall become booty to me so he made towards his steed and mounted and heeledfn167 him on when he sped as the shaft speeds from the bow and in his hand he still hent his brand bare of sheath which he brandished shouting the while his war cry allah is all mightyfn168 when the damsel saw him she sprang to her feet and taking firm stand on the bank of the stream whose breadth was six ells the normal cubits made one bound and landed clear on the farther sidefn169 where she turned and cried out with a loud voice who art thou o thou fellow that breakest in upon our privacy and pastime and that too hanger in hand as if charging a host whence camest thou and whither art thou going speak sooth for truth will stand thee in good stead and lie not for lies come of villein breed doubtless thou hast wandered this night from thy way that thou chancedst upon this place whence escape were the greatest of mercies for thou art now in an open plain and did we shout but a single shout would come to our rescue four thousand knightsfn170 so tell me what thou wantest and if thou wouldst only have us set thee on the right road we will do so when sharrkan heard her words he replied i am a stranger of the moslems who fared forth this night single handed seeking for spoil nor could this moonlight show me a fairer booty than these ten maidens so i shall seize them and rejoin my comrades with them quoth she i would have thee know that as for the booty thou hast not come at it and as for the handmaids by allah they shall never be thy spoil have i not told thee that to lie is villein vile quoth he the wise man is he who taketh warning by others thereupon quoth she by the truth of the messiah did i not fear that thy death would be on my hands i would shout a shout should fill the mead for thee with war steeds and with men of might but i take pity upon the stranger so if thou seek booty i require of thee that thou alight from thy steed and swear to me by thy faith that thou wilt not advance against me aught like arms in hand and we will wrestle i and thou if thou throw me set me on thy steed and take all of us to thy booty but if i throw thee thou shalt become under my command swear this to me for i fear thy treachery indeed it hath become a common saw where perfidy is innate there trust is a weakly mate now an thou wilt swear i will return and draw near to thee and tackle thee answered sharrkan and indeed he lusted to seize her and said in his soul truly she knoweth not that i am a champion of champions swear me by what oath thou wilt and by what thou deemest most binding and i will not approach thee with aught till thou hast made thy preparation and sayest draw near that i wrestle with thee if thou throw me i have money where withal to ransom myself and if i throw thee twill be booty and booty enough for me rejoined the damsel i am content herewith and sharrkan was astounded at her words and said and by the truth of the apostle whom allah bless and keep i too am content on the other part then said she swear to me by him who sprite in body dight and dealt laws to rule man kind aright that thou wilt not offer me aught of violence save by way of wrestling else mayst thou die without the pale of al islam sharrkan replied by allah were a kazi to swear me even though he were a kazi of the kazisfn171 he would not impose upon me such an oath as this then he sware to her by all she named and tied his steed to a tree but he was drowned in the sea of thought saying in himself praise be to him who fashioned her from dirty waterfn172 then he girt himself and made ready for wrestling and said to her cross the stream to me but she replied it is not for me to come over to thee if thou wilt pass thou over here to me i cannot do that quoth he and quoth she o boy i will come across to thee so she tucked up her skirts and leaping landed on the other side of the stream by his side whereupon he drew near to her and bent him forwards and clapped palmsfn173 but he was confounded by her beauty and loveliness for he saw a shape which the hand of power had tanned with the dye leaves of the jann which had been fostered by the hand of beneficence and fanned by the zephyrs of fair fortune and whose birth a propitious ascendant had greeted then she called out to him o moslem come on and let us wrestle ere the break of morning and tucked up her sleeves from a forearm like fresh curd which illumined the whole place with its whiteness and sharrkan was dazzled by it then he bent forwards and clapped his palms by way of challenge she doing the like and caught hold of her and the two grappled and gripped and interlocked hands and arms presently he shifted his hands to her slender waist when his finger tips sank into the soft folds of her middle breeding languishment and he fell a trembling like the persian reed in the roaring gale so she lifted him up and throwing him to the ground sat upon his breast with hips and hinder cheeks like mounds of sand for his soul had lost mastery over his senses then she asked him o moslem the slaying of nazarenes is lawful to you folk what then hast thou to say about being slain thyself and he answered o my lady thy speech as regards slaying me is not other than unlawful for our prophet mohammed whom allah bless and preserve prohibited the slaying of women and children old men and monks as it was thus revealed to your prophet she replied it behoveth us to render the equivalent of his mercy so rise i give thee thy life for generosity is never lost upon the generous then she got off his breast and he rose and stood shaking the dust from his head against the owners of the curved rib even women and she said to him be not ashamed but verily one who entereth the land of roum in quest of booty and cometh to assist kings against kings how happeneth it that he hath not strength enough to defend himself from one made out of the curved rib twas not for lack of strength in me he answered nor didst thou throw me by thy force it was thy loveliness overthrew me so if thou wilt grant me another bout it will be of thy courtesy she laughed and said i grant thee thy request but these handmaids have long been pinioned and their arms and sides are weary and it were only right i should loose them for haply this next wrestling bout will be long then she went to the slave girls and unbinding them said to them in the tongue of greece get ye to some safe place till i foil this moslems lust and longing for you so they went away whilst sharrkan kept gazing at them and they kept turning to look at the two then each approached the adversary and he set his breast against hers but when he felt waist touch waist his strength failed him and she waxing ware of this lifted him with her hands swiftlier than the blinding levenflash and threw him to the ground he fell on his backfn174 and then she said to him rise i give thee thy life a second time i spared thee in the first count because of thy prophet for that he made unlawful the slaying of women and i do so on the second count because of thy weakliness and the greenness of thine years and thy strangerhood but i charge thee if there be in the moslem army sent by omar bin alnuuman to succour the king of constantinople a stronger than thou send him hither and tell him of me for in wrestling there are shifts and trips catches and holds such as the feint or falsing and the snap or first grip the hug the feetcatch the thigh litefn175 the jostle and the leglock by allah o my lady quoth sharrkan and indeed he was highly incensed against her had i been master alsafdí master mohammed kimál or ibn alsaddífn176 as they were in their prime i had kept no note of these shifts thou mentionest for o my mistress by allah thou hast not grassed me by thy strength but by the blandishments of thy back parts for we men of mesopotamia so love a full formed thigh that nor sense was left me nor foresight but now an thou wish thou shalt try a third fall with me while my wits are about me and this last match is allowed me by the laws of the game which sayeth the best of three moreover i have regained my presence of mind when she heard his words she said to him hast thou not had a belly full of this wrestling o vanquished one however come on an thou wilt but know that this must be the last round then she bent forward and challenged him and sharrkan did likewise setting to it in real earnest and being right cautious about the throw so the two strove awhile and the damsel found in him a strength such as she had not observed before and said to him o moslem thou art now on thy mettle yes he replied thou knowest that there remaineth to me but this one round after which each of us will wend a different way she laughed and he laughed toofn177 then she overreached at his thigh and caught firm hold of it unawares which made him greet the ground and fall full on his back she laughed at him and said art thou an eater of bran thou are like a badawis bonnet which falleth off with every touch or else the father of windsfn178 that droppeth before a puff of air fie upon thee o thou poor thing adding get thee back to the moslem army and send us other than thyself for thou fairest of thews and proclaim for us among the arabs and persians the turks and daylamitesfn179 whoso hath might in him let him come to us then she made a spring and landed on the other side of the stream and said to sharrkan laughing parting with thee is right grievous to me o my lord but get thee to thy mates before dawn lest the knights come upon thee and pick thee up on their lance points thou hast no strength to defend thee against a woman so how couldst thou hold thine own amongst men of might and knights sharrkan was confounded and called to her as she turned from him making towards the convent o my lady wilt thou go away and leave the miserable stranger the broken hearted slave of love so she turned to him laughing and said what is thy want i will grant thee thy prayer have i set foot in thy country and tasted the sweetness of thy courtesy replied he and shall i return without eating of thy victual and tasting thy hospitality i who have become one of thy servitors none baulk kindliness save the base she rejoined honour us in allahs name on my head and eyes be it mount thy steed and ride along the brink of the stream over against me for now thou art my guest at this sharrkan was glad and hastening back to his horse mounted and walked him abreast of her and she kept faring on till they came to a drawbridgefn180 built of beams of the white poplar hung by pullies and steel chains and made fast with hooks and padlocks when sharrkan looked he saw awaiting her upon the bridge the same ten handmaids whom she had thrown in the wrestling bouts and as she came up to them she said to one in the greek tongue arise and take the reins of his horse and conduct him across into the convent so she went up to sharrkan and led him over much puzzled and perturbed with what he saw and saying to himself o would that the wazir dandan were here with me that his eyes might look upon these fairest of favours then he turned to the young lady and said to her o marvel of loveliness now i have two claims upon thee first the claim of good fellowship and secondly for that thou hast carried me to thy home and offered me thy hospitality i am now under thy commandance and thy guidance so do me one last favour by accompanying me to the lands of alislam where thou shalt look upon many a lion hearted warrior and thou shalt learn who i am when she heard this she was angered and said to him by the truth of the messiah thou hast proved thyself with me a man of keen wit but now i see what mischief there is in thy heart and how thou canst permit thyself a speech which proveth thy traitorous intent how should i do as thou sayest when i wot that if i came to that king of yours omar bin al nuuman i should never get free from him for truly he hath not the like of me or behind his city walls or within his palace halls lord of baghdad and of khorasan though he be who hath built for himself twelve pavilions in number as the months of the year and in each a concubine after the number of the days and if i come to him he would not prove shy of me for your folk believe i am lawful to have and to hold as is said in your writ or those women whom your right hand shall possess as slavesfn181 so how canst thou speak thus to me as for thy saying thou shalt look upon the braves of the moslems by the truth of the messiah thou sayest that which is not true for i saw your army when it reached our land these two days ago and i did not see that your ordinance was the ordinance of kings but i beheld only a rabble of tribesmen gathered together and as to thy words thou shalt know who i am i did not do thee kindness because of thy dignity but out of pride in myself and the like of thee should not talk thus to the like of me even wert thou sharrkan omar bin al nuumans son the prowess name in these days knowest thou sharrkan asked he and she answered yes and i know of his coming with an army numbering ten thousand horsemen also that he was sent by his sire with this force to gain prevalence for the king of constantinople o my lady said sharrkan i adjure thee by thy religion tell me the cause of all this that sooth may appear to me clear of untruth and with whom the fault lies now by the virtue of thy faith she replied did i not fear lest the news of me be bruited abroad that i am of the daughters of roum i would adventure myself and sally forth single handed against the ten thousand horsemen and slay their leader the wazir dandan and vanquish their champion sharrkanfn182 nor would aught of shame accrue to me thereby for i have read books and studied the rules of good breeding in the language of the arabs but i have no need to vaunt my own prowess to thee more by token as thou hast proved in thy proper person my skill and strength in wrestling and thou hast learnt my superiority over other women nor indeed had sharrkan himself been here this night and it were said to him clear this stream could he have done it and i only long and lust that the messiah would throw him into my hands in this very convent that i might go forth to him in the habit of a man and drag him from his saddle seat and make him my captive and lay him in bilboes and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the fortyeighth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the nazarene damsel said to sharrkan and he listening impatiently enow verily if sharrkan fell into my hands i would go forth to him in the habit of a man and drag him from his saddle seat and make him my captive and lay him in bilboes pride and passion and knightly jealousy took possession of him and he desired to discover and declare himself and to lay on load but her loveliness restrained him and he began repeating

an faulty of one fault the beauty prove  her charms a thousand advocates shall move

so she went up and sharrkan after her and when he saw the maidens back and hinder cheeks that clashed against each other like rollers in the rolling sea he extemporised these couplets 

for her sins is a pleader that brow  and all hearts its fair
             pleading must bow
when i saw it i cried to night  the moon at its fullest doth
            show
tho balkis own ifritfn183 try a bout  spite his force she
            would deal him a throw
the two fared on till they reached a gate over which rose a marble archway this she opened and ushered sharrkan into a long vestibule vaulted with ten connected arches from each of which hung a crystal lamp glistening like a spark of fire the handmaids met her at the further end bearing wax candles of goodly perfume and wearing on their heads golden fillets crusted with all manner bezel gemsfn184 and went on before her sharrkan still following till they reached the inner convent there the moslem saw couches and sofas ranged all around one opposite the other and all over hung with curtains flowered in gold the monastery floor was paved with every kind of vari coloured marbles and mosaic work and in the midst stood a basin that held four and twenty jetting fountains of gold whence the water ran like molten silver whilst at the upper end stood a throne spread with silks fit only for kings then said the damsel ascend o my lord this throne so he went up to it and sat down and she withdrew to remain absent for some time sharrkan asked of her from one of the servants who answered him she hath gone to her dormitory but we will serve thee even as she ordered so they set before him viands of rare varieties and he ate his sufficiency when they brought him a basin of gold and an ewer of silver and he washed his hands then his thoughts reverted to his army knowing not what had befallen it in his absence and calling to mind also how he had forgotten his fathers injunctions so he was troubled about his case repenting of what he had done till the dawn broke and the day appeared when he lamented and sighed and became drowned in sea of sadness and repeated

i am not lost to prudence but indeed  here im bewildered
            what shall be my rede
would any aid me in mine ails of love  by my own might and
            sleight would i be freed
but ah my heart is lost and passionshent  to none save allah
          can i trust my need

when he ended his verse behold there came up to him a rare show and a fair more than twenty maidens like crescents encompassing the young lady who shone in their midst as the full moon among the constellations guarding and girding her she was clad in brocades befitting kings her breasts were like twin pomegranates a woven zone set with all kinds of jewels tightly clasped her waist which expanded below into jutting hips and her hinder cheeks stood out as a mound of crystalfn185 supporting a silvern shaft when sharrkan looked at her his wits went nigh to fly away from him with delight and he forgot army and wazir as he gazed on her fair head decked and dight with a net work of pearls set off by divers sorts of gems handmaids on her right and handmaids on her left bore her train as she paced with dainty graceful gait in all the pride of seemlihead he sprang to his feet seeing such beauty and loveliness and cried aloud beware and beware of that zone rarely fair and broke out into these couplets

with heavy back parts high breasts delicate  and lissome form
           that sways with swimming gait
she deftly hides love longing in her breast  but i may never
           hide its ban and bate
while hosts of followers her steps precedefn186  like pearls
            now necklaced and now separate

she gazed upon him for a long time and considered him till she was assured of him when she came up to him and said in very sooth the place is honoured and illumined by thee o sharrkan how sped thy night o hero after we went away and left thee adding verily lying is a vile thing and a shameful especially in great kings and thou art crown prince sharrkan son and heir of king omar bin alnuuman so henceforth make no secret of thy rank and condition nor let me hear aught from thee but the truth for leasing bequeatheth hate and despite and as thou art pierced by the shaft of fate be resignation thine and abide content to wait when he heard her words he saw that artifice availed him naught and he acknowledged the truth saying i am sharrkan bin omar bin alnuuman whom fortune hath afflicted and cast into this place so whatso thou willest do it in my case she hung her head groundwards a long while then turned to him and said be of good cheer and let thine eyes be cool and clearfn187 for thou art the guest of my hospitality and bread and salt hath made a tie between me and thee wherefore thou art in my ward and under my safeguard have no fear for by the truth of the messiah if all on earth sought to do thee hurt they should not come at thee till life had left my body for thy sake indeed thou art now under the charge of the messiah and of me hereat she sat her down by his side and fell to playing with him till his alarm subsided and he knew that had she desired to slay him she would have done so during the past night presently she bespoke in the grecian tongue one of her slave girls who went away and soon came back bringing a beaker and a tray of food but sharrkan abstained from eating and said to himself haply she hath put somewhat in this meat she knew what was in his thought so she turned to him and said by the truth of the messiah the case is not on such wise nor is there aught in this meat of what thou suspectest had my mind been set on slaying thee i had slain thee ere now then she walked up to the tray and ate of every dish a mouthful where upon sharrkan came forward and ate too she was pleased at this and both ate till they were satisfied they washed their hands and after that she rose and ordered a handmaid to bring perfumes and herbs of sweet savour wines of all colours and kinds and a wineservice with vessels of gold silver and crystal she filled a first goblet and drank it off before offering it to him even as she had done with the food then she crowned a second and handed it to him he drank and she said to him o moslem see how thou art here in all solace and delight of life and she ceased not to drink and ply him with drink till he took leave of his wits and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the fortyninth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the damsel ceased not to drink and ply sharrkan with drink till he took leave of his wits for the wine and the intoxication of love he bore her presently she said to the slave girl o marjanahfn188 bring us some instruments of music to hear is to obey said the hand maid and going out returned in the twinkling of an eye with a damascus lutefn189 a persian harp a tartar pipe and an egyptian dulcimer the young lady took the lute and after tuning each several string began in gentle undersong to sing softer than zephyrs wing and sweeter than tasminfn190 spring with heart safe and secure from everything the couplets following

allah assain those eyne what streams of blood they shed  how
           many an arrowy glance those lids of thine have sped
i love all lovers who to lovers show them cure  twere wrong to
           rue the love in wrong head born and bred
haply fall hapless eye for thee no sleeping kens  heaven help
          the hapless heart by force of thee misled
thou doomest me to death who art my king and i  ransom with
          life the deemster who would doom me dead
thereupon each and every of the maidens rose up and taking an instrument played and recited couplets in the roumi tongue then their mistress sang also and seeing sharrkan in ecstasies asked him o moslem dost thou understand what i say and he answered nay my ecstasy cometh from the beauty of thy finger sips she laughed and continued if i sing to thee in arabic what wouldst thou do i should no longer quoth he be master of my senses then she took an instrument and changing the measure began singing these verses

the smack of partings myrrh to me  how then bear patience
            aloë
im girt by ills in trinity  severance distance
             cruelty
my freedom stole that fairest she  and parting irks me
            bitterly

when she ended her verse she looked at sharrkan and found him lost to existence and he lay for a while stretched at full length and prone among the maidensfn191 then he revived and remembering the songs again inclined to mirth and merriment and the twain returned to their wine and wassail and continued their playing and toying their pastime and pleasure till day ceased illuminating and night drooped her wing then the damsel went off to her dormitory and when sharrkan asked after her they answered she is gone to her sleeping chamber whereto he rejoined under allahs ward and his good guard as soon as it was morning a handmaid came to him and said to him my mistress biddeth thee to her so he rose and followed her and as he drew near her lodging the damsels welcomed him with smitten tabrets and songs of greeting and led him through a great door of ivory studded with pearls and jewels thence they passed with him into a tall and spacious hall at the upper end of which was a wide dais carpeted with all kinds of silks and round it open lattices commanding a view of trees and streams about the saloon were figures carved in human form and fashioned on such wise that the air passed through them and set in motion musical instruments within so that the beholder would fancy they spokefn192 here sat the young lady looking at the figures but when she saw sharrkan she sprang to her feet and taking him by the hand made him sit down by her side and asked him how he had passed the night he blessed her and the two sat talking awhile till she asked him knowest thou aught touching lovers and slaves of love and he answered yes i wot somewhat in verse on that matter let me hear it quoth she so he began quoting

pleasure and health good cheer good appetite  to azzah
           freest with our name and fame
by allah would i near her off she flies  at tangent granting
           less the more i claim
i dote on azzah but when clear i off  my rivals clears me too
           that dearest dame
like wandering wight that chose for shade a cloud  which ere
            siesta done thin air became

when she heard this she said verily alkuthayyirfn193 was conspicuous for sweet speech and chaste and he was superlative in his praise of azzah when he sang and she began to recite

did azzah deal behest to sun o noon  the judge had judged her
             beautys bestest boon
and girls who come to me and carp at her  god make their rosy
           cheeks her sandalshoon

and indeed quoth she twas said that azzah boasted exceeding beauty and loveliness then she asked sharrkan saying o prince cost thou know aught of jamilsfn194 verses to buthaynah if so repeat to us somewhat of them and he answered yes i know them better than any whereupon he began repeating these couplets

jamil in holy war go fight to me they say  what war save
            fight for fair ones would i eer essay
to me their every word and work are mere delight  and martyrs
           crepe i all they slay in fight and fray
an ask i o buthaynah whats this love i pray  which eats
            my heart quoth she  twill stay for ever and aye
and when i cry of wits return some small display  for daily
            use quoth she far far tis fled away
thou seekst my death naught else thy will can satisfy  while i
             no goal espy save thee and thee alway

thou hast spoken right well said she o kings son and jamil also spoke excellently well but what would buthaynah have done with him that he saith in his hemistich

thou seekst my death naught else thy will can satisfy

o my lady quoth sharrkan she willed to do him what thou willest to do with me and even that will not satisfy thee she laughed at his opportune reply and they ceased not carousing till day put out her light and night came in darkness dight then she rose and went to her dormitory and slept while sharrkan slept in his place till morning dawned as soon as he awoke the hand maids came to him with tabrets and other instruments of mirth and merriment as wont and kissing the ground between his hands said to him bismillah in allahs name be so kind as to comefn195 our mistress biddeth thee to her presence so he rose and accompanied the slave girls who surrounded him playing on tabrets and other instruments of music till they passed from that saloon into another and a yet more spacious hall decorated with pictured likenesses and figures of birds and beasts passing all description sharrkan marvelled at the art and artifice of the place and began reciting

he plucks fruits of her necklace in rivalry  and her breast
           pearls that bedded in gold mine lie
pure water on silvern bars is her brow  and her cheeks show
             roses with rubies vie
meseems in her eyne that the violets hue  lies purpling set in
            the ithmidsfn196 dye
when the lady saw sharrkan she stood up to him in honour and
taking his hand seated him by her side and asked o son of king
omar bin alnuuman hast thou any cunning in the game of chess
yes he answered but do not thou with me as said the poet
i speak and longing love upties me and unties me  till with
             her honey dew of inner lip she plies me
i brought the chess board and my liefest lover plays me  with
            white and blackfn197 but black cum white neer satisfies
             me
twas as if king for castle i were fain to place me  till wilful
             loss of game atwixt two queens surprise me
and if i seek to read intent in eyes that eye me  oh man that
             glance askance with hint of wish defies me

then she brought the chessboard and played with him but sharrkan instead of looking at her moves kept gazing at her fair mouth and putting knight in place of elephant and elephantfn198 instead of knight she laughed and said to him if thy play be after this fashion thou knowest naught of the game this is only our first replied he judge not by this bout when she beat him he replaced the pieces in position and played again with her but she beat him a second time a third a fourth and a fifth so she turned to him and said thou art beaten in everything and he replied o my lady how should one playing with the like of thee avoid being beaten then she bade bring food and they ate and washed their hands after which the wine was set before them and they drank presently she took the dulcimer for her hand was cunning in smiting it and she began repeating to an accompaniment these couplets

twixt the close tied and open wide no medium fortune knoweth 
            now ebb and flow then flow and ebb this wise her likeness
             showeth
then drink her wine the syne shes thine and smiling thou dost
             find her  anon shell fall and fare away when all thy good
             forth goeth

they ceased not to carouse till nightfall and this day was pleasanter even than the first when darkness set in the lady betook her to her dormitory leaving him alone with the hand maids so he threw himself on the ground and slept till dawn when the damsels came to him with tambourines and other instruments according to custom seeing them he roused him hastily and sat up and they carried him to their mistress who came to meet him and taking him by the hand seated him by her side then she asked him how he had passed his night whereat he prayed that her life be prolonged and she took the lute and sang to it these verses which she improvised

neer incline thee to part  which embitters the heart
een the sun when he sets  shall in pallor depart

while they were solacing themselves after this fashion behold there arose a great and sudden clamour and a confused crowd of knights and men rushed in holding drawn swords that glittered and gleamed in their hands and cried aloud in the grecian tongue thou hast fallen into our hands o sharrkan so make thee sure of death when he heard this he said to himself by allah she hath entrapped me and held me in play till her men should come these are the knights with whom she threatened me but tis i who have thrown myself into this strait then he turned towards the young lady to reproach her but saw that she had changed colour and her face was pale and she sprang to her feet and asked the crowd who are ye o most gracious princess and peerless onion pearl answered the leading knight dost thou weet who is yon man by thy side not i she replied who may he be quoth the patrician this is of towns the highwayman this is he who rideth in the horsemans van this is sharrkan son of king omar bin alnuuman this is he that forceth fortalice and penetrateth every impregnable place the news of him reached king hardub thy father by report of the ancient dame zat al dawahi and thy sire our sovereign hath made sure that thou hast rendered good service to the army of the greeks by taking captive this ominous lion when she heard this she looked at the knight and asked him what be thy name and he answered i am másúrah son of thy slave mausúrah bin káshardah knight of knights and how quoth she durst thou enter my presence without leave quoth he o my lady when i came to the gate none forbade me neither chamberlain nor porter but all the door keepers rose and forewent us as of wont although when others come they leave them standing at the gate while they ask permission to admit them but this is not a time for long talking when the king is expecting our return with this prince the scorpion stingfn199 of the islamitic host that he may kill him and drive back his men whither they came without the bane of battling with them these words be ill words rejoined the princess and dame zat aldawahi lied avouching an idle thing and a vain whereof she weeteth not the truth for by the virtue of the messiah this man who is with me is not sharrkan nor is he a captive but a stranger who came to us seeking our hospitality and i made him my guest so even were we assured that this be sharrkan and were it proved to us that it is he beyond a doubt i say it would ill befit mine honour that i should deliver into your hands one who hath entered under my protection so make me not a traitor to my guest and a disgrace among men but return to the king my father and kiss the ground before him and inform him that the case is contrariwise to the report of the lady zat aldawahi o abrízah replied masurah the knight i cannot return to the kings majesty without his debtor and enemy quoth she and indeed she had waxed very wroth out on thee return to him with my answer and no blame shall befal thee quoth masurah i will not return without him thereupon her colour changed and she exclaimed exceed not in talk and vain words for verily this man had not come in to us were he not assured that he could of himself and single handed make head against an hundred riders and if i said to him thou art sharrkan son of king omar bin alnuuman he would answer yes but tis not of your competence to let or hinder him for if you do so he will not turn back from you till he hath slain all that are in this place behold here he is by my side and i will bring him before you sword and targe in hand albeit i were safe from thy wrath answered masurah the knight i am not safe from that of thy father and when i see him i shall sign to the knights to take him captive and we will carry him to the king bound and in abject sort when she heard this she said the matter shall not pass thus for twould be blazoning mere folly this man is but one and ye are an hundred knights so if you would attack him come out against him one after one that it may appear to the king which is the valiant amongst you—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the fiftieth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that princess abrizah said to the knight this man is but one and ye are an hundred so if ye would attack him come out against him one after one that it may appear to the king which is the valiant quoth masurah the knight by the truth of the messiah thou sayest sooth and none but i shall sally out against him first quoth she wait till i go to him and acquaint him with the case and hear what answer he will make if he consent tis well but if he refuse ye shall on no wise come to him for i and my hand maids and whosoever is in the convent will be his ransom so she went to sharrkan and told him the news whereat he smiled and knew that she had not informed any of the emirs but that tidings of him had been bruited and blazed abroad till the report reached the king against her wish and intent so he again began reproaching himself and said how came i to adventure and play with my life by coming to the country of the greeks but hearing the young ladys proposal he said to her indeed their onset one after one would be overburdensome to them will they not come out against me ten by ten that would be villainy said she let one have at one when he heard this he sprang to his feet and made for them with his sword and battle gear and masurah the knight also sprang up and bore down upon him sharrkan met him like a lion and delivered a shoulder cutfn200 which clove him to the middle and the blade came out gleaming and glittering from his back and bowels when the lady beheld that swashingblow sharrkans might was magnified in her sight and she knew that when she overthrew him in the wrestle it was not by her strength but by her beauty and loveliness so she turned to the knights and said take wreak for your chief thereupon out came the slain mans brother a fierce and furious knight and rushed upon sharrkan who delayed not but smote him also with the shoulder cut and the sword came out glittering from his vitals then cried the princess o ye servants of the messiah avenge your comrade so they ceased not charging down upon him one after one and sharrkan also ceased not playing upon them with the blade till he had slain fifty knights the lady looking on the while and allah cast a panic into the hearts of the survivors so that they held back and dared not meet him in the duello but fell upon him in a body and he laid on load with heart firmer than a rock and smote them and trod them down like straw under the threshing sledfn201 till he had driven sense and soul out of them then the princess called aloud to her damsels saying who is left in the convent and they replied none but the gate keepers whereupon she went up to sharrkan and took him to her bosom he doing the same and they returned to the palace after he had made an end of the melee now there remained a few of the knights hiding from him in the cells of the monastery and when the princess saw this she rose from sharrkans side and left him for a while but presently came back clad in closely meshed coat of ring mail and holding in her hand a fine indian scymitar and she said now by the truth of the messiah i will not be a niggard of myself for my guest nor will i abandon him though for this i abide a reproach and a by word in the land of the greeks then she took reckoning of the dead and found that he had slain fourscore of the knights and other twenty had taken to flightfn202 when she saw what work he had made with them she said to him allah bless thee o sharrkan the cavaliers may well glory in the like of thee then he rose and wiping his blade clean of the blood of the slain began reciting these couplets

how oft in the mellay ive cleft the array  and given their
             bravest to lions a prey
ask of me and of them when i proved me prow  oer creation on
             days of the foray and fray
when i left in the onslaught their lions to lie  on the sands of
             the low landsfn203 in fieriest day

when he ended his verse the princess came up to him with smiles and kissed his hand then she doffed her hauberk and he said to her o lady mine wherefore didst thou don that coat of mail and bare thy brand to guard thee against these caitiffsfn204 she replied then she summoned the gate keepers and asked them how came ye to admit the kings knights into my dwelling without leave of me and they answered o princess it is not our custom to ask leave of thee for the kings messengers and especially for the chief of his knights quoth she i think ye were minded only to disgrace me and murder my guest and bade sharrkan smite their necks he did so and she cried to the rest of her servants of a truth they deserved even more than that then turning to sharrkan she said to him now that there hath become manifest to thee what was concealed thou shalt be made acquainted with my history know then that i am the daughter of king hardub of roum my name is abrizah and the ancient dame yclept zat aldawahi is my grandmother by the sword side she it certainly is who told my father of thee and as surely she will compass a sleight to slay me more by token as thou hast slain my fathers chivalry and it is noised abroad that i have separated myself from the nazarenes and have become no better than i should be with the moslems wherefore it were wiser that i leave this dwelling while zat aldawahi is on my track but i require of thee the like kindness and courtesy i have shown thee for enmity will presently befal between me and my father on thine account so do not thou neglect to do aught that i shall say to thee remembering all this betided me not save by reason of thee hearing her words sharrkan joyed greatly his breast broadened and his wits flew from him for delight and he said by allah none shall come at thee while life is in my bosom but hast thou patience to bear parting from thy parents and thy people even so she answered and sharrkan swore to her and the two plighted their troth then said she now is my heart at ease but there remaineth one other condition for thee what is it asked he and she answered it is that thou return with thy host to thine own country quoth he o lady mine my father king omar bin al nuuman sent me to wage war upon thy sire on account of the treasure he plundered from the king of constantinople and amongst the rest three great jewels noted givers of good fortune quoth she cheer thy heart and clear thine eyes i will tell thee the whole of the tale and the cause of our feud with the king of constantinople know that we have a yearly festival highs the convent feast whereat kings from all quarters and the noblest women are wont to congregate thither also come merchants and traders with their wives and families and the visitors abide there seven days i was wont to be one of them but when there befel enmity between us my father forbade me to be present at the festival for the space of seven years one year it chanced that amongst the daughters of the great who resorted to the patron as was their custom came a daughter of the king of constantinople a beautiful girl called sophia they tarried at the monastery six days and on the seventh the folk went their waysfn205 but sophia said i will not return to constantinople save by water so they equipped for her a ship in which she embarked with her suite and making sail they put out to sea but as they were voyaging behold a contrary wind caught them and drove the vessel from her course till as fate and fortune would have it she fell in with a nazarene craft from the camphor islandfn206 carrying a crew of five hundred armed franks who had been cruising about a long time when they sighted the sails of the ship wherein sophia and her women were they gave chase in all haste and in less than an hour they came up with her then they laid the grappling irons aboard her and captured her then taking her in tow they made all sail for their own island and were but a little distant from it when the wind veered round and splitting their sails drove them on to a shoal which lies off our coast thereupon we sallied forth and looking on them as spoil driven to us by fatefn207 boarded and took them and slaying the men made prize of the wreck wherein we found the treasures and rarities in question and forty maidens amongst whom was the kings daughter sophia after the capture we carried the princess and her women to my father not knowing her to be a daughter of king afridun of constantinople and he chose out for himself ten including her and divided the rest among his dependents presently he set apart five damsels amongst whom was the king s daughter and sent them to thy father king omar bin alnuuman together with other gifts such as broadclothfn208 and woollen stuffs and grecian silks thy father accepted them and chose out from amongst the five girls sophia daughter of king afridun nor did we hear more of her till the beginning of this year when her father wrote to my father in words unfitting for me to repeat rebuking him with menaces and saying to him two years ago you plundered a ship of ours which had been seized by a band of frankish pirates in which was my daughter sophia attended by her maidens numbering some threescore yet ye informed me not thereof by messenger or otherwise nor could i make the matter public lest reproach befal me amongst the kings by reason of my daughters honour so i concealed my case till this year when i wrote to certain frankish corsairs and sought news of my daughter from the kings of the isles they replied by allah we carried her not forth of thy realm but we have heard that king hardub rescued her from certain pirates and they told me the whole tale then he added in the writing which he writ to my father except you wish to be at feud with me and design to disgrace me and dishonour my daughter you will the instant my letter reacheth you send my daughter back to me but if you slight my letter and disobey my commandment i will assuredly make you full return for your foul dealing and the baseness of your practicesfn209 when my father read this letter and understood the contentsfn210 it vexed him and he regretted not having known that sophia king afriduns daughter was among the captured damsels that he might have sent her back to her sire and he was perplexed about the case because after so long a time he could not send to king omar bin alnuuman and demand her back from him especially as he had lately heard that heaven had granted him boon of babe by this sophia so when we pondered that truth we knew that this letter was none other than a grievous calamity and my father found nothing for it but to write an answer to king afridun making his excuses and swearing to him by strong oaths that he knew not his daughter to be among the bevy of damsels in the ship and setting forth how he had sent her to king omar bin al nuuman who had gotten the blessing of issue by her when my fathers reply reached king afridun he rose up and sat downfn211 and roared and foamed at the mouth crying—what shall he take captive my daughter and even her with slave girls and pass her on from hand to hand sending her for a gift to kings and they lie with her without marriage contract by the messiah and the true faith said he i will not desist till i have taken my blood vengeance for this and have wiped out my shame and indeed i will do a deed which the chroniclers shall chronicle after me so he bided his time till he devised a device and laid notable toils and snares when he sent an embassy to thy father king omar to tell him that which thou hast heard accordingly thy father equipped thee and an army with thee and sent thee to king afridun whose object is to seize thee and thine army to boot as for the three jewels whereof he told thy father when asking his aid there was not one soothfast word in that matter for they were with sophia his daughter and my father took them from her when he got possession of her and of her maidens and gave them to me in free gift and they are now with me so go thou to thy host and turn them back ere they be led deep into and shut in by the land of the bevy of damsels in the ship and setting forth the franks and the country of the greeks for as soon as you have come far enough into their interior they will stop the roads upon you and there will be no escape for you till the day of retribution and retaliation i know that thy troops are still halting where thou leftest them because thou didst order a three days rest withal they have missed thee all this time and they wot not what to do when sharrkan heard her words he was absent awhile in thought then he kissed princess abrizahs hand and said praise be to allah who hath bestowed thee on me and appointed thee to be the cause of my salvation and the salvation of whoso is with me but tis grievous to me to part from thee and i know not what will become of thee after my departure go now to thine army she replied and turn them back while ye are yet near your own country if the envoys be still with them lay hands on them and keep them that the case may be made manifest to you and after three days i will be with you all and we will enter baghdad together as he turned to depart she said forget not the compact which is between me and thee then she rose to bidfn212 him farewell and embrace him and quench the fire of desire so she took leave of him and throwing her arms round his neck wept with exceeding weeping and repeated these verses

i bade adieu my right hand wiped my tears away  the while my
             left hand held her in a close embrace
fearest thou naught quoth she of shame i answered nay 
             the lovers parting day is lovers worst disgrace

then sharrkan left her and walked down from the convent they brought his steed so he mounted and rode down stream to the drawbridge which he crossed and presently threaded the woodland paths and passed into the open meadow as soon as he was clear of the trees he was aware of horsemen which made him stand on the alert and he bared his brand and rode cautiously but as they drew near and exchanged curious looks he recognized them and behold it was the wazir dandan and two of his emirs when they saw him and knew him they dismounted and saluting him asked the reason of his absence whereupon he told them all that had passed between him and princess abrizah from first to last the wazir returned thanks to almighty allah for his safety and saidfn213 let us at once leave these lands for the envoys who came with us are gone to inform the king of our approach and haply he will hasten to fall on us and take us prisoners so sharrkan cried to his men to saddle and mount which they did and setting out at once they stinted not faring till they reached the sole of the valley wherein the host lay the ambassadors meanwhile had reported sharrkans approach to their king who forthright equipped a host to lay hold of him and those with him but sharrkan escorted by the wazir dandan and the two emirs had no sooner sighted the army than he raised the cry march march they took horse on the instant and fared through the first day and second and third day nor did they cease faring for five days at the end of which time they alighted in a well wooded valley where they rested awhile then they again set out and stayed not riding for five and twenty days which placed them on the frontiers of their own country here deeming themselves safe they halted to rest and the country people came out to them with guest gifts for the men and provender and forage for the beasts they tarried there two days after which as all would be making for their homes sharrkan put the wazir dandan in command bidding him lead the host back to baghdad but he himself remained behind with an hundred riders till the rest of the army had made one days march then he called to horse and mounted with his hundred men they rode on two parasangsfn214 space till they arrived at a gorge between two mountains and lo there arose before them a dark cloud of sand and dust so they checked their steeds awhile till the dust opened and lifted discovering beneath it an hundred cavaliers lion faced and in mail coats cased as soon as they drew within earshot of sharrkan and his meiny they cried out to them saying by the virtue of john and mary we have won to our wish we have been following you by forced marches night and day till we forewent you to this place so dismount and lay down your arms and yield yourselves that we may grant you your lives when sharrkan heard this his eyes stood out from his head and his cheeks flushed red and he said how is it o nazarene dogs ye dare enter our country and overmatch our land and doth not this suffice you but ye must adventure yourselves and address us in such unseemly speech do you think to escape out of our hands and return to your country then he shouted to his hundred horsemen up and at these hounds for they even you in number so saying he bared his sabre and bore down on them he and his but the franks met them with hearts firmer than rocks and wight dashed against wight and knight dashed upon knight and hot waxed the fight and sore was the affright and nor parley nor cries of quarter helped their plight and they stinted not to charge and to smite right hand meeting right nor to hack and hew with blades bright white till day turned to night and gloom oppressed the sight then they drew apart and sharrkan mustered his men and found none wounded save four only who showed hurts but not death hurts said he to them by allah my life long have i waded in the clashing sea of fight and i have met many a gallant sprite but none so unfrightened of the sword that smites and the shock of men that affrights like these valiant knights know o king said they that there is among them a frankish cavalier who is their leader and indeed he is a man of valour and fatal is his spear thrust but by allah he spares us great and small for whoso falls into his hands he lets him go and forbears to slay him by allah had he willed he had killed us all sharrkan was astounded when he heard what the knight had done and such high report of him so he said when the morn shall morrow we will draw out and defy them for we are an hundred to their hundred and we will seek aid against them from the lord of the heavens so they rested that night in such intent whilst the franks gathered round their captain and said verily this day we did not win our will of these and he replied at early dawn when the morrow shall morn we will draw out and challenge them one after one they also rested in that mind and both camps kept guard until almighty allah sent the light of day dawn thereupon king sharrkan and his hundred riders took horse and rode forth to the plain where they found the franks ranged in line of battle and sharrkan said to his followers our foes have determined like ourselves to do their devoir so up and at them and lay on load then came forth an herald of the franks and cried out saying let there be no general engagement betwixt us this day save by the duello a champion of yours against a champion of ours whereupon one of sharrkans riders dashed out from the ranks and crave between the two lines crying ho who is for smiting let no dastard engage me this day nor niderling hardly had he made an end of his vaunt when there sallied forth to him a frankish cavalier armed capàpie and clad in a surcoat of gold stuff riding on a grey white steedfn215 and he had no hair on his cheeks he urged his charger on to the midst of the battle plain and the two fell to derring do of cut and thrust but it was not long before the frank foined the moslem with the lance point and toppling him from his steed took him prisoner and led him off crestfallen his folk rejoiced in their comrade and forbidding him to go out again to the field sent forth another to whom sallied out another moslem brother to the captive and offered him battle the two fell to either against other and fought for a little while till the frank bore down upon the moslem and falsing him with a feint tumbled him by a thrust of the lance heel from his destrier and took him prisoner after this fashion the moslems ceased not dashing forwards one after one and the franks to unhorse them and take them captive till day departed and the night with darkness upstarted now they had captured of the moslems twenty cavaliers and when sharrken saw this it was grievous to him and he mustered his men and said to them what is this thing that hath befallen us to morrow i myself will go forth to the field and offer singular combat to their chief and learn what is the cause of his entering our land and warn him against doing battle with our band if he persist we will punish him with death and if he prove peaceable we will make peace with him they righted on this wise till allah almighty caused the morn to dawn when mounted the twain and drew up for battle fain and sharrkan was going forth to the plain but behold more than one half of the franks dismounted and remained on foot before one of them who was mounted till they reached the midst of the battle plain sharrken looked at that horseman and lo he was their chief he was clad in a surcoat of blue satin and a close ringed mail shirt his face was as the moon when it rises and no hair was upon his cheeks he hent in hand an indian scymitar and he rode a sable steed with a white blaze on brow like a dirham and he smote the horse with heel till he stood almost in the midst of the field when signing to the moslems he cried out in fluent arab speech ho sharrkan ho son of omar bin al nuuman ho thou who forcest fortalice and overthrowest cities and countries up and out to battle bout and blade single handed wield with one who halves with thee the field thou art prince of thy people and i am prince of mine and whoso overcometh his adversary him let the others men obey and come under his sway hardly had he ended his speech when out came sharrkan with a heart full of fury and urging his steed into the midst of the field closed like a raging lion with the frank who encountered him with wariness and steadfastness and met him with the meeting of warriors then they fell to foining and hewing and they stinted not of onset and offset and give and take as they were two mountains clashing together or two seas together dashing nor did they cease fighting until day darkened and night starkened then they drew apart and each returned to his own party but as soon as sharrkan foregathered with his comrades he said never looked i on the like of this cavalier he hath one quality i have not yet seen in any and this it is that when his foemen uncovereth a place for the death blow he reverseth his weapon and smiteth with the lanceheel in very deed i know not what will be the issue twixt him and me but tis my wish that we had in our host his like and the like of his men then he went to his rest for the night and when morning dawned the frank came forth and rode down to the mid field where sharrkan met him and they fell to fighting and to wheeling left and right and necks were stretched out to see the sight nor did they stint from strife and sword play and lunge of lance with main and might till the day turned to night and darkness overwhelmed the light then the twain drew asunder and returned each to his own camp where both related to their comrades what had befallen them in the duello and at last the frank said to his men tomorrow shall decide the matter so they both passed that night restfully till dawn and as soon as it was day they mounted and each bore down on other and ceased not to fight till half the day was done then the frank bethought him of a ruse first urging his steed with heel and then checking him with the rein so that he stumbled and fell with his rider thereupon sharrkan threw himself on the foe and would have smitten him with the sword fearing lest the strife be prolonged when the frank cried out to him o sharrkan champions are not wont to do thus this is the act of a man accustomed to be beaten by a womanfn216 when sharrkan heard this he raised his eyes to the franks face and gazing steadfastly at him recognized in him princess abrizah with whom that pleasant adventure had befallen him in the convent whereupon he cast brand from hand and kissing the earth before her asked her what moved thee to a deed like this and she answered i desired to prove thy prowess afield and test thy doughtiness in tilting and jousting these that are with me are my handmaids and they are all clean maids yet they have vanquished thy horsemen in fair press and stress of plain and had not my steed stumbled with me thou shouldst have seen my might and prowess in combat sharrkan smiled at her speech and said praise be to allah for safety and for my reunion with thee o queen of the age then she cried out to her damsels to loose the twenty captives of sharrkans troop and dismount they did as she bade and came and kissed the earth before her and sharrkan who said to them it is the like of you that kings keep in store for the need hour then he signed to his comrades to salute the princess so all alighted and kissed the earth before her for they knew the story after this the whole two hundred took horse and fared on night and day for six days space till they drew near to baghdad when they halted and sharrkan bade abrizah and her handmaids doff the frankish garb that was on them—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the fiftyfirst night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that sharrkan bade princess abrizah and her damsels doff the garb that was on them and don the garments of daughters of greece and thus did they then he despatched a company of his companions to baghdad to acquaint his father omar bin alnuuman with his arrival and report that he was accompanied by princess abrizah daughter of king hardub lord of graecialand they halted forthright in the place they had reached and sharrkan also halted and all righted there and when almighty allah made morning dawn sharrkan and his company and abrizah and her company took horse and fared on towards the city when lo on the way they met the wazir dandan who had come out amongst a thousand horse to honour abrizah and sharrkan by especial commandment of king omar son of al nuuman when the two drew near they turned towards them and kissed ground before them then they mounted again and escorted them into the city and went up with them to the palace sharrkan walked in to his father who rose and embraced him and questioned him of his case so he told him all that abrizah had told him and what had passed between them and said she hath parted from her sire and departed from her reign and hath chosen to take part with us and make her abode with us and indeed he said to his father the king of constantinople hath plotted to do us a mischief because of his daughter sophia for that the king of greece had made known to him her story and the cause of her being given to thee and he the grecian king not knowing her to be daughter of king afridun lord of constantinople and had he known that he would not have bestowed her upon thee but he would have restored her to her parent and of a verity he continued we were saved from these perils only by the lady abrizah and never saw we a more valiant than she and he went on to tell his father all that had passed from first to last of the wrestling and the single fighting when king omar heard the story of sharrkan abrizah was exalted in his eyes and he longed to see her and question her thereupon sharrkan went out to her and said the king calleth for thee she replied i hear and i obey and he took her and brought her in to his father who was seated on his throne and who having dismissed his high officers was attended only by his eunuchs the princess entered and kissing the ground between his hands saluted him in choice terms he was amazed at her eloquent speech and thanked her for her dealing with his son sharrkan and bade her be seated so she sat down and unveiled her facefn217 and when the king saw her beauty his reason fled his head and he made her draw near and showed her favour appointing her an especial palace for herself and her damsels and assigning them solde and allowances then began he to ask her of the three jewels aforesaid and she answered here be they with me o king of the age so saying she rose and going to her lodging unpacked her baggage and from it brought out a box and from the box a casket of gold she opened the casket and taking out those three jewels kissed them and gave them to the king then she went away bearing his heart with her after her going the king sent for his son sharrkan and gave him one jewel of the three and when he enquired of the other two replied o my son i mean to give one to thy brother zau almakan and the other to thy sister nuzhat al zaman but when sharrkan heard that he had a brother for to that time he knew only of his sister he turned to his sire and said to him o king hast thou a son other than myself he answered yes and he is now six years old adding that his name was zau al makan and that he and nuzhat alzaman were twins born at a birth this news was grievous to sharrkan but he kept his secret and said the bless ing of allah most high be upon them and he cast the jewel from his hand and shook the dust off his clothes quoth the king how do i see thee change thy manner when hearing of this considering that after me thou becomes heir of the kingdom of a truth the troops have sworn to thee and the emirs and grandees have taken the oath of succession to thee and this one of the three jewels is thine sharrkan bowed his head to the ground and was ashamed to bandy words with his parent so he accepted the jewel and went away knowing not what to do for exceeding wrath and stayed not walking till he had entered abrizahs palace as he approached she stood up to meet him and thanked him for what he had done and prayed for blessings on him and his sire then she sat down and seated him by her side but when he had taken his place she saw rage in his face and questioned him whereupon he told her that allah had blessed his father with two children by sophia a boy and a girl and that he had named the boy zau almakan and the girl nuzhat alzaman adding he hath kept the other two jewels for them and hath given me one of thine so i left it behind i knew naught of zau almakans birth till this day and the twain are now six years old so when i learnt this wrath possessed me and i tell thee the reason of my rage and hide nothing from thee but now i fear lest my father take thee to wife for he loveth thee and i saw in him signs of desire for thee so what wilt thou say if he wish this quoth she know o sharrkan that thy father hath no dominion over me nor can he have me without my consent and if he prevail over me by force i will take my own life as for the three jewels it was not my intent that he should give any of them to either of his children and i had no thought but that he would lay them up in his treasury with his things of price but now i desire of thy favour that thou make me a present of the jewel which he gave thee if thou have accepted it hearkening and obedience replied sharrkan and gave it to her then said she fear nothing and talked with him awhile and continued i fear lest my father hear that i am with you and sit not patiently under my loss but do his endeavours to find me and to that end he may ally himself with king afridun on account of his daughter sophia and both come on thee with armies and so there befal great turmoil when sharrken heard these words he said to her o my lady if it please thee to sojourn with us take no thought of them though there gather together against us all that be on land and on sea  tis well rejoined she if ye entreat me fair i will tarry with you and if ye deal evilly by me i will depart from you then she bade her slave maidens bring food so they set the tables and sharrkan ate a little and went away to his own house disturbed and perturbed such was his case but regarding the affairs of his father omar bin alnuuman after dismissing his son sharrkan he arose and taking the other two jewels betook himself to the lady sophia who stood up when she saw him and remained standing till he was seated presently his two children zau almakan and nuzhat alzaman came to him and he kissed them and hung a jewel round each ones neck at which they rejoiced and kissed his hands then went they to their mother who joyed in their joy and wished the king long life so he asked her why hast thou not informed me all this time that thou art the daughter of king afridun lord of constantinople that i might have honoured thee still more and enlarged thee in dignity and raised thy rank o king answered sophia and what could i desire greater or higher than this my standing with thee overwhelmed as i am with thy favours and thy benefits and furthermore allah hath blessed me with two children by thee a son and a daughter her reply pleased the king and after leaving her he set apart for her and her children a wondrous fine palace moreover he appointed for them eunuchs and attendants and doctors of law and doctors of philosophy and astrologers and physicians and surgeons to do them service and in every way he redoubled his favour and entreated them with the best of treatment and presently he returned to the palace of his dominion and to his court where he distributed justice among the lieges so far concerning him and sophia and her children but in the matter of abrizah the king was greatly occupied with love of her and burnt with desire of her night and day and every night he would go in to her and converse with her and pay his court to her but she gave him no answer only saying o king of the age i have no desire for men at this present when he saw her withdraw from him his passion waxed hotter and his longing and pining increased until when weary of this he summoned his wazir dandan and opening his very heart to him told him of his love for princess abrizah daughter of hardub and informed him how she refused to yield to his wishes and how desire for her was doing him to die for that he could get no grace of her the wazir hearing these words said to the king as soon as it is dark night take thou a piece of bhang the measure of a miskal about an ounce and go in to her and drink somewhat of wine with her when the hour of ending the carousel shall draw near fill her a last cup and dropping therein the bhang give it to her to drink and she will not reach her sleeping chamber ere the drug take effect on her then do thou go in to her and take thy will of her and such is my advicefn218 thy rede is aright quoth the king and seeking his treasury he took thence a piece of concentrated bhang if an elephant smelt it he would sleep from year to year this he put in his bosom pocket and waited till some little of the night went by when he betook himself to the palace of princess abrizah who seeing him stood up to receive him but he bade her sit down so she sat down and he sat by her and he began to talk with her of wine and wassail whereupon she furnished the carousing tablefn219 and placed it before him then she set on the drinking vessels and lighted the candles and ordered to bring dried fruits and sweet meats and all that pertaineth to drinking so they fell to tippling and the king ceased not to pledge her till drunkenness crept into her head and seeing this he took out the bit of bhang from his pocket and holding it between his fingers filled a cup with his own hand and drank it off then filling a second he said to thy companionship and dropped the drug into her cup she knowing naught of it she took it and drank it off then she rose and went to her sleeping chamber he waited for less than an hour till he was assured that the dose had taken effect on her and had robbed her of her senses when he went in to her and found her thrown on her back and she had doffed her petticoat trousers and the air raised the skirt of her shift and discovered what was between her thighs when the king saw the state of things and found a lighted candle at her head and another at her feet shining upon what her thighs enshrined he took leave of his five senses for lust and satan seduced him and he could not master himself but put off his trousers and fell upon her and abated her maiden head then he rose off her and went to one of her women by name marjánah and said go in to thy lady and speak with her so she went in to her mistress and found her lying on her back insensible with the blood running down to the calves of her legs whereupon she took a kerchief and wiped away the blood and lay by her that night as soon as almighty allah brought the dawn the handmaid marjanah washed her mistresss hands and feet and brought rose water and bathed her face and mouth with it where upon she sneezed and yawned and cast up from her inside that bit of bhang like a bolusfn220 then she revived and washed her hands and mouth and said to marjanah tell me what hath befallen me so she told her what had passed and how she had found her lying on her back with the blood running down wherefore she knew that king omar bin alnuuman had lain with her and had undone her and taken his will of her at this she grieved with exceeding grief and retired into privacy saying to her damsels deny me to whoso would come in to me and say to him that i am ill till i see what allah will do with me presently the news of her sickness came to the king so he sent her sherbets and sugar electuaries some months she thus passed in solitude during which time the kings flame cooled and his desire for her was quenched so that he abstained from her now she had conceived by him and when the months of child breeding had gone by her pregnancy appeared and her belly swelled and the world was straitened upon her so she said to her handmaid marjanah know that it is not the folk who have wronged me but i who sinned against my own selffn221 in that i left my father and mother and country indeed i abhor life for my spirit is broken and neither courage nor strength is left me i used when i mounted my steed to have the mastery of him but now i am unable to ride if i be brought to bed among them i shall be dishonoured before my hand women and every one in the palace will know that he hath taken my maidenhead in the way of shame and if i return to my father with what face shall i meet him or with what face shall i have recourse to him how well quoth the poet

say what shall solace one who hath nor home nor stable stead 
             nor cup companion nor a cup nor place to house his head

marjanah answered her it is thine to command i will obey and abrizah said i desire at once to leave this place secretly so that none shall know of me but thou and return to my father and my mother for when flesh stinketh there is naught for it but its own folk and allah shall do with me een as he will o princess marjanah replied what thou wouldest do is well then she made matters ready and kept her secret and waited for some days till the king went out to chase and hunt and his son sharrkan betook himself to certain of the fortresses to sojourn there awhile then said she to marjanah i wish to set out this night but how shall i do against my destiny for already i feel the pangs of labour and child birth and if i abide other four or five days i shall be brought to bed here and i shall be unable to travel to my country but this is what was written on my forehead then she considered awhile and said to marjanah look us out a man who will go with us and serve us by the way for i have no strength to bear arms by allah o my lady replied marjanah i know none but a black slave called al ghazbánfn222 who is one of the slaves of king omar bin al nuuman he is a valiant wight and he keepeth guard at our palace gate the king appointed him to attend us and indeed we have overwhelmed him with our favours so lookye i will go out and speak with him of this matter and promise him some monies and tell him that if he have a mind to tarry with us i will marry him to whom he will he told me before to day that he had been a highwayman so if he consent to us we shall win our wish and reach to our own land she rejoined call him that i may talk with him whereupon marjanah fared forth and said to the slave o ghazban allah prosper thee so thou fall in with what my lady saith to thee then she took him by the hand and brought him to the princess whose hands he kissed but as she beheld him her heart took fright at him how ever she said to herself of a truth need giveth the law and she approached to speak with him yet her heart started away from him presently she said o ghazban say me wilt thou help me against the perfidies of fortune and conceal my secret if i discover it to thee when the slave saw her his heart was taken by storm and he fell in love with her forthright and could not but reply o my mistress whatsoever thou biddest me do i will not depart therefrom quoth she i would have thee take me at this hour and take this my handmaid and saddle us two camels and two of the kings horses and set on each horse a saddle bag of goods and somewhat of provaunt and go with us to our own country where if thou desire to abide with us i will marry thee to her thou shalt choose of my handmaidens or if thou prefer return to thine own land we will marry thee and give thee whatso thou desires after thou hast taken of money what shall satisfy thee when al ghazban heard this he rejoiced with great joy and replied o my lady i will serve both of you with mine eyes and will go at once and saddle the horses then he went away gladsome and saying to himself i shall get my will of them and if they will not yield to me i will kill them both and take their riches but he kept this his intent to himself and presently returned with two camels and three head of horses one of which he rode and princess abrizah made marjanah mount the second she mounting the third albeit she was in labour pains and possessed not her soul for anguish and the slave ceased not travelling with them night and day through the passes of the mountains till there remained but musingly march between them and their own country when the travail pangs came upon abrizah and she could no longer resist so she said to alghazban set me down for the pains of labour are upon me and cried to marjanah do thou alight and sit by me and deliver me then marjanah dismounted from her horse and alghazban did in like sort and they made fast the bridles and helped the princess to dismount for she was aswoon from excess of anguish when alghazban saw her on the ground satan entered into him and he drew his falchion and brandishing it in her face said o my lady vouchsafe me thy favours hearing these words she turned to him and said it remaineth for me only that i yield me to negro slaves after having refused kings and braves—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the fiftysecond night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that princess abrizah said to the black slave al ghazban it remaineth for me only that i yield me to negro slaves after having refused kings and braves and she was wroth with him and cried woe to thee what words are these thou sayest out on thee and talk not thus in my presence and know that i will never consent to what thou sayest though i drink the cup of death wait till i have cast my burden and am delivered of the after birth and then if thou be able thereto do with me as thou wilt but an thou leave not lewd talk at this time assuredly i will slay myself with my own hand and quit the world and be at peace from all this and she began reciting extemporefn223

o spare me thou ghazban indeed enow for me  are heavy strokes
            of time mischance and misery
whoredom my lord forfends to all humanity  quoth he who
           breaks my bidding hell for home shall see
and if thou leave not suing me to whoredoms way  against th
          almightys choicest gift my chastity
upon my tribesmen i with might and main will call  and gather
          all however far or near they be
and with yamáni blade were i in pieces hewn  neer shall he
           sight my face who makes for villeiny
the face of free born come of noble folk and brave  what then
            can be to me the seed of whoreson slave

when ghazban heard these lines he was wroth exceedingly his eyes reddened with blood and his face became a dusty greyfn224 his nostrils swelled his lips protruded and the repulsiveness of his aspect redoubled and he repeated these couplets

ho thou abrizah mercy leave me not for i  of thy love and
             yamánifn225 glance the victim lie
my heart is cut to pieces by thy cruelty  my body wasted and my
                   patience done to die
from glances ravishing all hearts with witchery  reason far
           flies the while desire to thee draws nigh
though at thy call should armies fill the face of earth  een
           now id win my wish and worlds in arms defy

when abrizah heard these words she wept with sore weeping and said to him woe to thee o ghazban how dareth the like of thee to address me such demand o base born and obscene bred dost thou deem all folk are alike when the vile slave heard this from her he waxt more enraged and his eyes grew redder and he came up to her and smiting her with the sword on her neck wounded her to the death then he drove her horse before him with the treasure and made off with himself to the mountains such was the case with alghazban but as regards abrizah she gave birth to a son like the moon and marjanah took the babe and did him the necessary offices and laid him by his mothers side and lo and behold the child fastened to its mothers breast and she dyingfn226 when marjanah saw this she cried out with a grievous cry and rent her raiment and cast dust on her head and buffeted her cheeks till blood flowed saying alas my mistress alas the pity of it thou art dead by the hand of a worthless black slave after all thy knightly prowess and she ceased not weeping when suddenly a great cloud of dust arose and walled the horizonfn227 but after awhile it lifted and discovered a numerous conquering host now this was the army of king hardub princess abrizahs father and the cause of his coming was that when he heard of his daughter and her handmaids having fled to baghdad and that they were with king omar bin al nuuman he had come forth leading those with him to seek tidings of her from travellers who might have seen her with the king when he had gone a single days march from his capital he espied three horse men afar off and made towards them intending to ask whence they came and seek news of his daughter now these three whom he saw at a distance were his daughter and marjanah and the slave al ghazban and he made for them to push inquiry seeing this the villain blackamoor feared for himself so he killed abrizah and fled for his life when they came up king hardub saw his daughter lying dead and marjanah weeping over her and he threw himself from his steed and fell fainting to the ground all the riders of his company the emirs and waxirs took foot and forth right pitched their tents on the mountain and set up for the king a great pavilion domed and circular without which stood the grandees of the realm when marjanah saw her master she at once recognized him and her tears redoubled and when he came to himself he questioned her and she told him all that had passed and said of a truth he that hath slain thy daughter is a black slave belonging to king omar bin alnuuman and she informed him how sharrkans father had dealt with the princess when king hardub heard this the world grew black in his sight and he wept with sore weeping then he called for a litter and therein laying his dead daughter returned to caesarea and carried her into the palace where he went in to his mother zat aldawahi and said to that lady of calamities shall the moslems deal thus with my girl verily king omar bin alnuuman despoiled her of her honour by force and after this one of his black slaves slew her by the truth of the messiah i will assuredly take blood revenge for my daughter and clear away from mine honour the stain of shame else will i kill myself with mine own hand and he wept passing sore quoth his mother none other than marjanah killed thy daughter for she hated her in secret and she continued to her son fret not for taking the blood wit of thy daughter for by the truth of the messiah i will not turn back from king omar bin alnuuman till i have slain him and his sons and of a very truth i will do with him a deed passing the power of sage and knight whereof the chroniclers shall tell chronicles in all countries and in every place but needs must thou do my bidding in all i shall direct for whoso be firmly set on the object of his desire shall surely compass his desire by the virtue of the messiah replied he i will not cross thee in aught thou shalt say then quoth she bring me a number of hand maids high bosomed virgins and summon the wise men of the age and let them teach them philosophy and the rules of behaviour before kings and the art of conversation and making verses and let them talk with them of all manner science and edifying knowledge and the sages must be moslems that they may teach them the language and traditions of the arabs together with the history of the caliphs and the ancient annals of the kings of alislam and if we persevere in this for four years space we shall gain our case so possess thy soul in patience and wait for one of the arabs saith if we take man bote after years forty the time were short to ye when we have taught the girls these things we shall be able to work our will with our foe for he doteth on women and he hath three hundred and sixty concubines whereto are now added an hundred of the flowers of thy handmaidens who were with thy daughter she that hath found mercyfn228 as soon as i have made an end of their education as described to thee i will take them and set out with them in person when king hardub heard his mothers words he rejoiced and arose and kissed her head and at once despatched messengers and couriers to lands sundry and manifold to fetch him moslem sages they obeyed his commands and fared to far countries and thence brought him the sages and the doctors he sought when these came into presence he honoured them with notable honorurs and bestowed dresses on them and appointed to them stipends and allowances and promised them much money whenas they should have taught the damsels then he committed the handmaidens to their hands—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the fiftythird night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the sages and the doctors stood in presence of king hardub he honoured them with notable honours and committed the hand maidens to their hands enjoining that these be instructed in all manner of knowledge philosophy and polite accomplishments and they set themselves to do his bidding such was the case with king hardub but as for king omar bin al nuuman when he returned from coursing and hunting and entered his palace he sought princess abrizah but found her not nor any one knew of her nor could any give him news of her this was grievous to him and he said how could the lady leave the palace unknown of any had my kingdom been at stake in this case it were in perilous condition there being none to govern it i will never again go to sport and hunt till i have stationed at the gates those who shall keep good guard over them and he was sore vexed and his breast was straitened for the loss of princess abrizah hereupon behold his son sharrkan returned from his journey and the father told him what had happened and informed him how the lady had fled whilst he was chasing and hunting whereat he grieved with exceeding grief then king omar took to visiting his children every day and making much of them and brought them learned men and doctors to teach them appointing for them stipends when sharrkan saw this he raged with exceeding rage and envied thereupon his brother and sister till the signs of chagrin appeared in his face and he ceased not to languish by reason of this matter so one day his father said to him why do i see thee grown weak in body and yellow of face o my father replied sharrkan every time i see thee fondle my brother and sister and make much of them jealousy seizeth on me and i fear lest it grow on me till i slay them and thou slay me in return and this is the reason of my weakness of body and change of complexion but now i crave of thy favour that thou give me one of thy castles outlying the rest that i may abide there the remnant of my life for as the sayer of bywords saith absence from my friend is better and fitter for me and whatso eye doth not perceive that garreth not heart to grieve and he bowed his head towards the ground when king omar bin alnuuman heard his words and knew the cause of his ailment and of his being broken down he soothed his heart and said to him o my son i grant thee this and i have not in my reign a greater than the castle of damascus and the government of it is thine from this time thereupon he forthright summoned his secretaries of state and bade them write sharrkans patent of investiture to the viceroyalty of damascus of syria and when they had written it he equipped him and sent with him the wazir dandan and invested him with the rule and government and gave him instructions as to policy and regulations and took leave of him and the grandees and officers of state did likewise and he set out with his host when he arrived at damascus the townspeople beat the drums and blew the trumpets and decorated the city and came out to meet him in great state whilst all the notables and grandees paced in procession and those who stood to the right of the throne walked on his right flank and the others to the left thus far concerning sharrkan but as regards his father omar bin al nuuman soon after the departure of his son the childrens tutors and governors presented themselves before him and said to him o our lord thy children have now learnt knowledge and they are completely versed in the rules of manners and the etiquette of ceremony the king rejoiced thereat with exceeding joy and conferred bountiful largesse upon the learned men seeing zau al makan grown up and flourishing and skilled in horsemanship the prince had reached the age of fourteen and he occupied himself with piety and prayers loving the poor the olema and the koran students so that all the people of baghdad loved him men and women one day the procession of the mahmilfn229 of irák passed round baghdad before its departure for the pilgrimage to meccah and visitation of the tomb of the prophet whom allah bless and preserve when zau almakan the mahmil procession he was seized with longing desire to become a pilgrimfn230 so he went in to his sire and said i come to ask thy leave to make the pilgrimage but his father forbade him saying wait till next year and i will go and thou too when the prince saw that the matter was postponed he betook himself to his sister nuzhat alzaman whom he found standing at prayer as soon as she had ended her devotions he said to her i am dying with desire of pilgrimage to the holy house of allah at meccah and to visit the tomb of the prophet upon whom be peace i asked my fathers leave but he forbade me that so i mean to take privily somewhat of money and set out on the pilgrimage without his knowledge allah upon thee exclaimed she take me with thee and deprive me not of visitation to the tomb of the prophet whom allah bless and keep and he answered as soon as it is dark night do thou come forth from this place without telling any accordinglywhen it was the middle of the night she arose and took somewhat of money and donned a mans habit and she ceased not walking to the palace gate where she found zau almakan with camels ready for marching so he mounted and mounted her and the two fared on till they were in the midst of the irakifn231 pilgrimparty and they ceased not marching and allah wrote safety for them till they entered meccah the holy and stood upon arafát and performed the pilgrimage rites then they made a visitation to the tomb of the prophet whom allah bless and assain and thought to return with the pilgrims to their native land but zau almakan said to his sister o my sister it is in my mind to visit the holy housefn232 jerusalem and abraham the friend of allahfn233 on whom be peace i also desire so to do replied she so they agreed upon this and he fared forth and took passage for himself and her and they made ready and set out in the ship with a company of jerusalem palmers that very night the sister fell sick of an aguish chill and was grievously ill but presently recovered after which the brother also sickened she tended him during his malady and they ceased not wayfaring till they arrived at jerusalem but the fever increased on him and he grew weaker and weaker they alighted at a khan and there hired a lodging but zau al makans sickness ceased not to increase on him till he was wasted with leanness and became delirious at this his sister was greatly afflicted and exclaimed there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great this is the decree of allah they sojourned in that place awhile his weakness ever increasing and she attending him and buying necessaries for him and for herself till all the money she had was expended and she became so poor that she had not so much as a dirham left then she sent a servant of the khan to the bazar with some of her clothes and he sold them and she spent the price upon her brother then sold she something more and she ceased not selling all she had piece by piece till nothing was left but an old rug whereupon she wept and exclaimed verily is allah the orderer of the past and the future presently her brother said to her o my sister i feel recovery drawing near and my heart longeth for a little roast meat by allah o my brother replied she i have no face to beg but tomorrow i will enter some rich mans house and serve him and earn somewhat for our living then she bethought herself awhile and said of a truth tis hard for me to leave thee and thou in this state but i must despite myself he rejoined allah forbid thou wilt be put to shame but there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah and he wept and she wept too then she said o my brother we are strangers who have dwelt here a full year but none hath yet knocked at our door shall we then die of hunger i know no resource but that i go out and do service and earn somewhat to keep us alive till thou recover from thy sickness when we will travel back to our native land she sat weeping awhile and he wept too propped upon his elbow then nuzhat alzaman arose and veiling her head with a bit of camletfn234 which had been of the cameleers clothes and which the owner had forgotten and left with them she kissed the head of her brother and embraced him and went forth from him weeping and knowing not whither she should wend and she stinted not going and her brother zau almakan awaiting her return till the supper time but she came not and he watched for her till the morning morrowed but still she returned not and this endured till two days went by he was greatly troubled thereat and his heart fluttered for her and hunger was sore upon him at last he left the chamber and calling the servant of the caravanserai said i wish thee to bear me to the bazar so he carried him to the market street and laid him down there and the people of jerusalem gathered round him and were moved to tears seeing his condition he signed to them begging for somewhat to eat so they brought him some money from certain of the merchants who were in the bazar and bought food and fed him therewith after which they carried him to a shop where they spread him a mat of palm leaves and set an ewer of water at his head when night fell all the folk went away sore concerned for him and in the middle of the night he called to mind his sister and his sickness redoubled on him so that he abstained from eating and drinking and became insensible to the world around him then the bazar people arose and took for him from the merchants thirty seven dirhams and hiring a camel said to the driver carry this sick man to damascus and leave him in the hospital haply he may be cured and recover health on my head be it replied the camel man but he said to himself how shall i take this sick man to damascus and he nigh upon death so he carried him away to a place and hid with him till the night when he threw him down on the ash heap near the fire hole of a hammam and went his way when morning dawned the stokerfn235 of the bath came to his work and finding zau almakan cast on his back exclaimed why did they not throw their dead body anywhere but here so saying he gave him a kick and he moved whereupon quoth the fireman some one of you who hath eaten a bit of hashish and hath thrown himself down in whatso place it be then he looked at his face and saw his hairless cheeks and his grace and comeliness so he took pity on him and knew that he was sick and a stranger in the land and he cried there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah verily i have sinned against this youth for indeed the prophet whom allah bless and keep enjoineth honour to the stranger more especially when the stranger is sick then he carried him home and went in with him to his wife and bade her tend him so she spread him a sleeping rug and set a cushion under his head then warmed water for him and washed therewith his hands and feet and face meanwhile the stoker went to the market and bought some rose water and sugar and sprinkled zau almakans face with the water and gave him to drink of the sherbet then he fetched a clean shirt and put it on him with this zau almakan sniffed the zephyr of health and recovery returned to him and he sat up and leant against the pillow hereat the fireman rejoiced and exclaimed praise be to allah for the welfare of this youth o allah i beseech thee by thy knowledge of hidden things that thou make the salvation of this youth to be at my hands—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the fiftyfourth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the fireman exclaimed o allah i beseech thee of thy knowledge of hidden things that thou make this young mans life the work of my hands and he ceased not to nurse him for three days giving him to drink of sherbet of sugar and willow flower water and rose water and doing him all manner of service and kindness till health began to return to his body and zau almakan opened his eyes presently came in the fireman and seeing him sitting up and showing signs of amendment said to him what is now thy state o my son praise be to allah replied zau almakan i am well and like to recover if such be the will of allah almighty at this time the stoker praised the lord of all for this and wending fast to the market bought ten chickens which he carried to his wife and said kill two of these for him every day one at dawn of day and the other at fall of day so she rose up and killed a fowl and brought it to him boiled and fed him with the flesh and made him drink its broth when he had done eating she fetched hot water and he washed his hands and lay back upon the pillow whereupon she covered him up with the coverlet and he slept till the time of the mid afternoon prayer then she arose and killed another fowl and boiled it after which she cut it up and bringing it to zau almakan said eat o my son while he was eating behold her husband entered and seeing her feeding him sat down at his head and said to him how is it with thee now o my son thanks be to allah for recovery he replied may the almighty requite thee thy kindness to me at this the fireman rejoiced and going out bought sherbet of violets and rose water and made him drink it now the stoker used to work at the hammam all day for a wage of five dirhams whereof he spent every day for zau almakan one dirham upon sugar and sherbet of rose water and willow flower waterfn236 and another dirham for fowls and he ceased not to entreat him thus kindly during a whole month till the traces of illness ceased from him and he was once more sound and whole thereupon the fireman and his wife rejoiced and asked him o my son wilt thou go with me to the bath whereto he answered yes so the stoker went to the bazar and fetched a donkey boy and he mounted zau almakan on the ass and supported him in the saddle till they came to the bath then he made him sit down and seated the donkey boy in the furnaceroom and went forth to the market and bought iote leaves and lupinflourfn237 with which he returned to the bath and said to zau almakan o my master in allahs name walk in and i will wash thy body so they entered the inner room of the bath and the fireman took to rubbing zau almakans legs and began to wash his body with the leaves and meal when there came to them a bathman whom the bath keeper had sent to zau almakan and he seeing the stoker washing and rubbing him said this is doing injury to the keepers rights replied the fireman the master overwhelmeth us with his favours then the bathman proceeded to shave zau almakans head after which he and the stoker washed themselves and returned to the house where he clad zau almakan in a shirt of fine stuff and a robe of his own and gave him a handsome turband and girdle and a light kerchief which he wound about his neck meanwhile the firemans wife had killed and cooked two chickens so as soon as zau almakan entered and seated himself on the carpet the husband arose and dissolving sugar in willow flower water made him drink of it then he brought the food tray and cutting up the chickens fed him with the flesh and gave him the broth to drink till he was satisfied when he washed his hands and praised allah for recovery and said to the fireman thou art he whom the almighty vouchsafed to me and made the cause of my cure leave this talk replied the other and tell us the cause of thy coming to this city and whence thou art thy face showeth signs of gentle breeding tell me first how thou camest to fall in with me said zau almakan and after i will tell thee my story rejoined the fireman as for that i found thee lying on the rubbish heap by the door of the fire house as i went to my work near the morning and knew not who had thrown thee there so i carried thee home with me and this is all my tale quoth zau almakan glory to him who quickeneth the bones though they be rotten indeed o my brother thou hast not done good save to one worthy of it and thou shalt presently gather its fruitage and he added but where am i now thou art in the city of jerusalem replied the stoker where upon zau almakan called to mind his strangerhood and remembered his separation from his sister and wept then he discovered his secret to the fireman and told him his story and began repeating

in love they bore me further than my force would go  and for
            them made me suffer resurrection throe
oh have compassion cruel on this soul of mine  which since
            ye fared is pitied by each envious foe
nor grudge the tender mercy of one passing glance  my case to
            lighten easing this excess of woe
quoth i heart bear this loss in patience patience cried 
             take heed no patience in such plight im wont to show 

then he redoubled his weeping and the fireman said to him weep not but rather praise allah for safety and recovery asked zau almakan how far is it hence to damascus answered the other six days journey then quoth zau almakan wilt thou send me thither o my lord quoth the stoker how can i allow thee to go alone and thou a youth and a stranger to boot if thou would journey to damascus i am one who will go with thee and if my wife will listen to and obey me and accompany me i will take up my abode there for it is no light matter to part with thee then said he to his wife wilt thou travel with me to damascus of syria or wilt thou abide here whilst i lead this my lord thither and return to thee for he is bent upon going to damascus of syria and by allah it is hard to me to part with him and i fear for him from highway men replied she i will go with you both and he rejoined praised be allah for accord and we have said the last word then he rose and selling all his own goods and his wifes gear—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the fiftyfifth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the fire man and his wife agreed with zau almakan to travel with him damascus wards then the stoker sold his goods and his wifes gear and bought a camel and hired an ass for zau almakan and they set out and ceased not wayfaring for six days till they reached damascus and they arrived there towards eventide when the fireman went forth and as was his wont bought some meat and drink they had dwelt but five days in damascus when his wife sickened and after a short illness was translated to the mercy of almighty allah her death was a heavy matter to zau almakan for he was grown used to her as she had tended him assiduously and the fireman grieved for her with excessive grief presently the prince turned to the stoker and finding him mourning said to him grieve not for at this gate we must all go in replied he allah make weal thy lot o my son surely he will compensate us with his favours and cause our mourning to cease what sayst thou o my son about our walking abroad to view damascus and cheer thy spirits replied zau almakan thy will is mine so the fireman arose and placed his hand in that of zau al makan and the two walked on till they came to the stables of the viceroy of damascus where they found camels laden with chests and carpets and brocaded stuffs and horses ready saddled and bactrian dromedaries while mamelukes and negro slaves and folk in a hubbub were running to and fro quoth zau almakan i wonder to whom belong all these chattels and camels and stuffs so he asked one of the eunuchs whither this dispatching and he answered these are presents sent by the emir of damascus to king omar bin alnuuman with the tribute of syria now when zau almakan heard his fathers name his eyes brimmed over with tears and he began repeating

oh ye gone from the gaze of these ridded eyne  ye whose sight
             in my spirit shall ever dwell
your charms are gone but this heart of me  hath no sweet and
             no pleasures its sour dispel
if allahs grace make us meet again  in long drawn lovetale my
             love ill tell

and when he had ended his verse he wept and the fireman said to him o my son we hardly believed that thy health had returnedfn238 so take heart and do not weep for i fear a relapse for thee and he ceased not comforting and cheering him whilst zau almakan sighed and moaned over his strangerhood and separation from his sister and his family and tears streamed from his eyes and he recited these couplets

get thee provaunt in this world ere thou wend upon thy way 
           and know how surely death descends thy life lot to waylay
all thy worldly goods are pride and the painfullest repine  all
           thy worldly life is vexing of thy soul in vain display
say is not worldly wone like a wanderers place of rest  where
           at night he nakhsfn239 his camels and moves off at dawn
           of day

and he continued to weep and wail over his separation whilst the fireman also bewept the loss of his wife yet ceased not to comfort zau almakan till morning dawned when the sun rose he said to him meseemeth thou yearnest for thy native land yes replied zau almakan and i can no longer tarry here so i will commend thee to allahs care and set out with these folk and journey with them little by little till i come to my mother land said the stoker and i with thee for of a truth i cannot bear to part with thee i have done thee kindly service and i mean to complete it by tending thee on thy travel at this zau almakan rejoiced and said allah abundantly requite thee for me and was pleased with the idea of their travelling together the fireman at once went forth and bought another ass selling the camel and laid in his provaunt and said to zau almakan this is for thee to ride by the way and when thou art weary of riding thou canst dismount and walk said zau almakan may allah bless thee and aid me to requite thee for verily thou hast dealt with me more lovingly than one with his brother then he waited till it was dark night when he laid the provisions and baggage on that ass and set forth upon their journey this much befel zau almakan and the fireman but as regards what happened to his sister nuzhat alzaman when she left her brother in the khan where they abode and wrapped in the old camlet went out to seek service with some one that she might earn wherewithal to buy him the roast meat he longed for she fared on weeping and knowing not whither to go whilst her mind was occupied with thoughts of her brother and of her family and her native land so she implored allah almighty to do away with these calamities from them and began versifying

dark falls the night and passion comes sore pains to gar me
            dree  and pine upstirs those ceaseless pangs which work my
           tormentry
and cease not separation flames my vitals to consume  and
           drives me on destruction way this sorrows ecstacy
and longing breeds me restlessness desire for ever fires  and
          tears to all proclaim what i would keep in secrecy
no cunning shift is known to me a meeting to secure  that i may
            quit this sickly state may cure my malady
the love which blazeth in my heart is fed with fancy fuel  the
           lover from its hell of fire must bear hells agonyfn240
o thou who blamest me for all befel me tis enough  patient i
           bear what ever wrote the reed of doom for me
by love i swear ill never be consoled no never more  i swear
             the oath of loves own slaves who know no perjury
o night to chroniclers of love the news of me declare  that
           sleep hath fed mine eyelids of thy knowledge witness bear

then she walked on weeping and turning right and left as she went when behold there espied her an old badawifn241 who had come into the town from the desert with wild arabs other five the old man took note of her and saw that she was lovely but she had nothing on her head save a piece of camlet and marvelling at her beauty he said to himself this charmer dazzleth mens wits but she is in squalid condition and whether she be of the people of this city or she be a stranger i needs must have her so he followed her little by little till he met her face to face and stopped the way before her in a narrow lane and called out to her asking her case and said tell me o my little daughter art thou a free woman or a slave when she heard this she said to him by thy life do not add to my sorrows quoth he allah hath blessed me with six daughters of whom five died and only one is left me the youngest of all and i came to ask thee if thou be of the folk of this city or a stranger that i might take thee and carry thee to her to bear her company so as to divert her from pining for her sisters if thou have no kith and kin i will make thee as one of them and thou and she shall be as my two children nuzhat alzaman bowed her head in bashfulness when she heard what he said and communed with herself haply i may trust myself to this old man then she said to him o nuncle i am a maiden of the arabs and a stranger and i have a sick brother but i will go with thee to thy daughter on one condition which is that i may spend only the day with her and at night may return to my brother if thou strike this bargain i will fare with thee for i am a stranger and i was high in honour among my tribe and i awoke one morning to find myself vile and abject i came with my brother from the land of alhijaz and i fearless he know not where i am when the badawi heard this he said to himself by allah i have got my desire then he turned to her and replied there shall none be dearer to me than thou i wish thee only to bear my daughter company by day and thou shalt go to thy brother at earliest nightfall or if thou wilt bring him over to dwell with us and the badawi ceased not to console her heart and coax her till she trusted in him and agreed to serve him then he walked on before her and when she followed him he winked to his men to go in advance and harness the dromedaries and load them with their packs and place upon them water and provisions ready for setting out as soon as he should come up with the camels now this badawi was a base born churl a highway thief and a traitor to the friend he held most fief a rogue in grain past master of plots and chicane he had no daughter and no son and was only passing through the town when by the decree of the decreer he fell in with this unhappy one and he ceased not to hold her in converse on the highway till they came without the city of jerusalem and when outside he joined his companions and found they had made ready the dromedaries so the badawi mounted a camel having seated nuzhat alzaman behind him and they rode on all night then she knew that the badawis proposal was a snare and that he had tricked her and she continued weeping and crying out the whole night long while they journeyed on making for the mountains in fear any should see them now when it was near dawn they dismounted from their dromedaries and the badawi came up to nuzhat alzaman and said to her o city strumpet what is this weeping by allah an thou hold not thy peace i will beat thee to death o thou town filth when she heard this she loathed life and longed for death so she turned to him and said o accursed old man o gray beard of hell how have i trusted thee and thou hast played me false and now thou wouldst torture me when he heard her reply he cried out o lazy baggage dost thou dare to bandy words with me and he stood up to her and beat her with a whip saying an thou hold not thy peace i will kill thee so she was silent awhile then she called to mind her brother and the happy estate she had been in and she shed tears secretly next day she turned to the badawi and said to him how couldst thou play me this trick and lure me into these bald and stony mountains and what is thy design with me when he heard her words he hardened his heart and said to her o lazy baggage of ill omen and insolent wilt thou bandy words with me and he took the whip and came down with it on her back till she felt faint then she bowed down over his feet and kissedfn242 them and he left beating her and began reviling her and said by the rights of my bonnetfn243 if i see or hear thee weeping i will cut out thy tongue and stuff it up thy coynte o thou city filth so she was silent and made him no reply for the beating pained her but sat down with her arms round her knees and bowing her head upon her collar began to look into her case and her abasement after her lot of high honour and the beating she had endured and she called to mind her brother and his sickness and forlorn condition and how they were both strangers in a far country which crave her tears down her cheeks and she wept silently and began repeating

time hath for his wont to upraise and debase  nor is lasting
           condition for human race
in this world each thing hath appointed turn  nor may man
            transgress his determined place
how long these perils and woes ah woe  for a life all woeful
            in parlous case
allah bless not the days which have laid me low  i the world
            with disgrace after so much grace
my wish is baffled my hopes cast down  and distance forbids me
             to greet his face
o thou who passeth that dear ones door  say for me these
             tears shall flow evermore

when she had finished her verses the badawi came up to her and taking compassion on her bespoke her kindly and wiped away her tears then he gave her a barley scone and said i love not one who answereth at times when i am in wrath so henceforth give me no more of these impertinent words and i will sell thee to a good man like myself who will do well with thee even as i have done yes whatso thou doest is right answered she and when the night was longsome upon her and hunger burnt her she ate very little of that barley bread in the middle of the night the badawi gave orders for departure—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the fiftysixth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the badawi gave the barley scone to nuzhat alzaman and promised he would sell her to a good man like himself she replied whatso thou doest is right and about midnight when hunger burned herfn244 she ate a very little of that barley bread and the badawi ordered his party to set out so they loaded their loads and he mounted a camel setting nuzhat alzaman behind him then they journeyed and ceased not journeying for three days till they entered the city of damascus and alighted at the sultans khan hard by the viceroys gate now she had lost her colour by grief and the fatigue of such travelling and she ceased not to weep over her misfortunes so the badawi came up to her and said o thou city filth by the right of my bonnet if thou leave not this weeping i will sell thee to none but a jew then he arose and took her by the hand and carried her to a chamber and walked off to the bazar and he went round to the merchants who dealt in slave girls and began to parley with them saying i have brought a slave girl whose brother fell ill and i sent him to my people about jerusalem that they might tend him till he is cured as for her i want to sell her but after the dog her brother fell sick the separation from him was grievous to her and since then she doth nothing but weep and now i wish that whoso is minded to buy her of me speak softly to her and say thy brother is with me in jerusalem ill and i will be easy with him about her price then one of the merchants came up to him and asked how old is she he answered she is a virgin just come to marriageable age and she is endowed with sense and breeding and wit and beauty and loveliness but from the day i sent her brother to jerusalem her heart hath been yearning for him so that her beauty is fallen away and her value lessened now when the merchant heard this he set forth with the badawi and said o shaykhfn245 of the arabs i will go with thee and buy of thee this girl whom thou praisest so highly for wit and manners and beauty and loveliness and i will pay thee her price but it must be upon conditions which if thou accept i will give thee ready money and if thou accept not i will return her to thee quoth the badawi an thou wilt take her up to the sultan sharrkan son of omar bin alnuuman lord of baghdad and of the land of khorasan and condition me any conditions thou likest for when thou hast brought her before king sharrkan haply she will please him and he will pay thee her price and a good profit for thyself to boot rejoined the merchant it happens that i have just now something to ask from him and it is this that he write me an order upon the office exempting me from custom dues and also that he write me a letter of recommendation to his father king omar bin alnuuman so if he take the girl i will weighfn246 thee out her price at once i agree with thee to this condition answered the badawi so they returned together to the place where nuzhat alzaman was and the wild arab stood at the chamber door and called out saying o nájiyahfn247 which was the name wherewith he had named her when she heard him she wept and made no answer then he turned to the merchant and said to him there she sitteth go to her and look at her and speak to her kindly as i enjoined thee so the trader went up to her in courteous wise and saw that she was wondrous beautiful and loveable especially as she knew the arabic tongue and he said to the badawi if she be even as thou saddest i shall get of the sultan what i will for her then he bespake her peace be on thee my little maid how art thou she turned to him and replied this also was registered in the book of destiny then she looked at him and seeing him to be a man of respectable semblance with a handsome face she said to herself i believe this one cometh to buy me and she continued if i hold aloof from him i shall abide with my tyrant and he will do me to death with beating in any case this person is handsome of face and maketh me hope for better treatment from him than from my brute of a badawi may be he cometh only to hear me talk so i will give him a fair answer all this while her eyes were fixed on the ground then she raised them to him and said in a sweet voice and upon thee be peace o my lord and allahs mercy and his benedictionfn248 this is what is commanded of the prophet whom allah bless and preserve as for thine enquiry how i am if thou wouldst know my case it is such as thou wouldst not wish but to thy foe and she held her peace when the merchant heard what she said his fancy took wings for delight in her and turning to the badawi he asked him what is her price for indeed she is noble thereupon the badawi waxed angry and answered thou wilt turn me the girls head with this talk why dost thou say that she is noblefn249 while she is of the scum of slave girls and of the refuse of folk i will not sell her to thee when the merchant heard this he knew the man to be weak of wits and said to him calm thyself for i will buy her of thee with these blemishes thou mentionest and how much wilt thou give me for her enquired the badawi replied the merchant name thy price for her none should name the son save his sire rejoined the badawi none shall name it but thou thyself quoth the merchant to himself this wildling is a rudesby and a maggotty head by allah i cannot tell her price for she hath won my heart with her fair speech and good looks and if she can read and write it will be complete fair luck to her and to her purchaser but this badawi does not know her worth then he turned and said to him o shaykh of the arabs i will give thee in ready money clear of the tax and the sultans dues two hundred gold pieces now when the badawi heard this he flew into a violent rage and cried at the merchant saying get up and go thy ways by allah wert thou to offer me two hundred diners for the bit of camlet she weareth i would not sell it to thee and now i will not sell her but will keep her by me to pasture the camels and grind my grist and he cried out to her saying come here thou stinkard i will not sell thee then he turned to the merchant and said to him i used to think thee a man of judgment but by the right of my bonnet if thou begone not from me i will let thee hear what shall not please thee quoth the merchant to himself of a truth this badawi is mad and knoweth not her value and i will say no more to him about her price at the present time for by allah were he a man of sense he would not say by the rights of my bonnet by the almighty she is worth the kingdom of the chosroës and i have not her price by me but if he ask even more i will give him what he will though it be all my goods then he turned and said to him o shaykh of the arabs take patience and calm thyself and tell me what clothes she hath with thee cried the badawi and what hath the baggage to do with clothes by allah this camlet in which she is wrapped is ample for her with thy leave said the merchant i will unveil her face and examine her even as folk examine slave girls whom they think of buyingfn250 replied the other up and do what thou wilt and allah keep thy youth examine her outside and inside and if thou wilt strip off her clothes and look at her when she is naked quoth the trader allah forfend i will look at naught save her facefn251 then he went up to her and was put to shame by her beauty and loveliness—and shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the fiftyseventh night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the merchant went up to nuzhat alzaman and was put to shame by her beauty and loveliness so he sat by her side and asked her o my mistress what is thy name she answered doss thou ask what is my name this day or what it was before this day thereupon the merchant enquired hast thou then two names to days and yesterdays yes replied she my name in the past was nuzhat alzaman the delight of the age but my name at this present is ghussatfn252 alzaman the despight of the age when the merchant heard this his eyes brimmed over with tears and quoth he to her hast thou not a sick brother ay by allah o my lord i have quoth she but fortune hath parted me and him and he lieth sick in jerusalem the merchants head was confounded at the sweetness of her speech and he said to himself verily the badawi spake the truth of her then she called to mind her brother and his sickness and his strangerhood and her separation from him in his hour of weakness and her not knowing what had befallen him and she thought of all that had happened to her with the badawi and of her severance from her mother and father and native land and the tears coursed down her cheeks and fast as they started they dropped and she began reciting

allah whereer thou be his aid impart  to thee who distant
             dwellest in my heart
allah be near thee how so far thou fare  ward off all shifts of
            time all dangers thwart
mine eyes are desolate for thy vanisht sight  and start my
            tearsah me how fast they start
would heaven i kenned what quarter or what land  homes thee and
           in what house and tribe thou art
a fount of life thou drain in greenth of rose  while drink i
             tear drops for my sole desert
an thou joy slumber in those hours when i  peel twixt my side
           and couch coals burning smart
all things were easy save to part from thee  for my sad heart
           this grief is hard to dree

when the merchant heard her verses he wept and put out his hand to wipe away the tears from her cheeks but she let down her veil over her face saying heaven forbid o my lordfn253 then the badawi who was sitting at a little distance watching them saw her cover her face from the merchant while about to wipe the tears from her cheeks and he concluded that she would have hindered him from handling her so he rose and running to her dealt her with a camels halter he had in his hand such a blow on the shoulders that she fell to the ground on her face her eyebrow struck a stone which cut it open and the blood streamed down her cheeks whereupon she screamed a loud scream and felt faint and wept bitterly the merchant was moved to tears for her and said in himself there is no help for it but that i buy this damsel though at her weight in gold and free her from this tyrant and he began to revile the badawi whilst nazhat al zaman lay in sensible when she came to herself she wiped away the tears and blood from her face and she bound up her head then raising her glance to heaven she besought her lord with a sorrowful heart and began repeating

and pity one who erst in honour throve  and now is fallen into
             sore disgrace
she weeps and bathes her cheeks with railing tears  and asks
            what cure can meet this fatal case

when she had ended her verse she turned to the merchant and said in an undertone by the almighty do not leave me with a tyrant who knoweth not allah the most high if i pass this night in his place i shall kill myself with my own hand save me from him so allah save thee from gehennafire then quoth the merchant to the badawi o shaykh of the arabs this slave is none of thine affair so do thou sell her to me for what thou wilt take her quoth the badawi and pay me down her price or i will carry her back to the camp and there set her to feed the camels and gather their dungfn254 said the merchant i will give thee fifty thousand diners for her allah will openfn255 replied the badawi seventy thousand said the merchant allah will open repeated the badawi this is not the capital spent upon her for she hath eaten with me barley bread to the value of ninety thousand gold pieces the merchant rejoined thou and thine and all thy tribe in the length of your lives have not eaten a thousand ducats worth of barley but i will say thee one word wherewith if thou be not satisfied i will set the viceroy of damascus on thee and he will take her from thee by force the badawi continued say on an hundred thousand quoth the merchant i have sold her to thee at that price answered the badawi i shall be able to buy salt with her the merchant laughed and going to his lodgings brought the money and put it into the hand of the badawi who took it and made off saying to himself needs must i go to jerusalem where haply i shall happen on her brother and i will bring him here and sell him also so he mounted and journeyed till he arrived at jerusalem where he went to the khan and asked for zau almakan but could not find him such was the case with him but for what regards the merchant and nazhat alzaman when he took her he threw some of his clothes over her and carried her to his lodgings—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the fiftyeighth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the trader saved nuzhat alzaman from the badawi and bore her to his lodgings and robed her in the richest raiment he went down with her to the bazar where he bought her what ornaments she chose and put them in a satin bag which he set before her saying all is for thee and i ask nothing of thee in return but that when i lead thee to the sultan viceroy of damascus thou acquaint him with the price i paid for thee albeit it was little compared with thy value and if seeing thee he buy thee of me thou tell him how i have dealt with thee and ask of him for me a royal patent and a written recommendation wherewith i can repair to his father king omar bin alnuuman lord of baghdad to the intent that he may forbid the tax on my stuffs or any other goods in which i traffic when she heard his words she wept and sobbed and the merchant said to her o my lady i observe that every time i mention baghdad thine eyes are tearful is there any one there whom thou lovest if it be a trader or the like tell me for i know all the merchants and so forth there and if thou wouldst send him a message i will bear it for thee replied she by allah i have no acquaintance among merchant folk and the like i know none there but king omar bin nuuman lord of baghdad when the merchant heard her words he laughed and rejoiced with exceeding joy and said in himself by allah i have won my wish then he said to her hast thou been shown to him in time past she answered no but i was brought up with his daughter and he holdeth me dear and i have high honour with him so if thou wouldst have the king grant thee thy desire give me ink case and paper and i will write thee a letter and when thou reachest the city of baghdad do thou deliver it into the hand of king omar bin alnuuman and say to him thy handmaid nuzhat alzaman would have thee to know that the chances and changes of the nights and days have struck her as with a hammer and have smitten her so that she hath been sold from place to place and she sendeth thee her salams and if he ask further of her say that i am now with the viceroy at damascus the merchant wondered at her eloquence and his affection for her increased and he said to her i cannot but think that men have played upon thine understanding and sold thee for money tell me dost thou know the koran by heart yes answered she and i am also acquainted with philosophy and medicine and the prolegomena of science and the commentaries of galen the physician on the canons of hippocrates and i have commented him and i have read the tazkirah and have commented the burhán and i have studied the simples of ibn baytár and i have something to say of the canon of meccah by avicenna i can ree riddles and can solve ambiguities and discourse upon geometry and am skilled in anatomy i have read the books of the sháfiífn256 school and the traditions of the prophet and syntax and i can argue with the olema and discourse of all manner learning moreover i am skilled in logic and rhetoric and arithmetic and the making of talismans and almanacs and i know thoroughly the spiritual sciencesfn257 and the times appointed for religious duties and i understand all these branches of knowledge then quoth she to the merchant bring me ink case and paper that i write thee a letter which shall aid thee on thy journey to baghdad and enable thee to do without passports now when the merchant heard this he cried out brava bravafn258 then o happy he in whose palace thou shalt thereupon he brought her paper and ink case and a pen of brass and bussed the earth before her face to do her honour she took a sheet and handled the reed and wrote therewith these verses

i see all power of sleep from eyes of me hath flown  say did
           thy parting teach these eyne on wake to wone
what makes thy memory light such burnings in my heart  hath
            every lover strength such memories to own
how sweet the big dropped cloud which rained on summer day 
            tis gone and ere i taste its sweets afar tis flown
i pray the wind with windy breath to bring some news  from thee
            to lover wightwi love so woe begone
complains to thee a lover of all hope forlorn  for parting
             pangs can break not only heart but stone

and when she had ended writing the verses she continued these words are from her who saith that melancholy destroyeth her and that watching wasteth her in the murk of whose night is found no light and darkness and day are the same in her sight she tosseth on the couch of separation and her eyes are blackened with the pencils of sleeplessness she watcheth the stars arise and into the gloom she strains her eyes verily sadness and leanness have consumed her strength and the setting forth of her case would run to length no helper hath she but tears and she reciteth these verses

no ring dove moans from home on branch in morning light  but
             shakes my very frame with sorrows killing might
no lover sigheth for his love or gladdeth heart  to meet his
             mate but breeds in me redoubled blight
i bear my plaint to one who has no ruth for me  ah me how love
             can part mans mortal frame and sprite 
then her eyes welled over with tears and she wrote also these two couplets

love smote my frame so sore on parting day  that severance
             severed sleep and eyes for aye
i waxt so lean that i am still a man  but for my speaking thou
             wouldst never say

then she shed tears and wrote at the foot of the sheet this cometh from her who is far from her folk and her native land the sorrowful hearted woman nuzhat alzaman in fine she folded the sheet and gave it to the merchant who took it and kissed it and understood its contents and exclaimed glory to him who fashioned thee—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the fiftyninth night

she said it reached me o auspicious king that nuzhat alzaman wrote the letter and gave it to the merchant and he took it and read it and understood the contents and exclaimed glory to him who fashioned thee then he redoubled his kindness and made himself pleasant to her all that day and when night came he sallied out to the bazar and bought some food wherewith he fed her after which he carried her to the hammam and said to the bath woman as soon as thou hast made an end of washing her head dress her and send and let me know of it and she replied hearing is obeying meanwhile he fetched food and fruit and wax candles and set them on the bench in the outer room of the bath and when the tire woman had done washing her she dressed her and led her out of the bath and seated her on the bench then she sent to tell the merchant and nuzhat alzaman went forth to the outer room where she found the tray spread with food and fruit so she ate and the tire woman with her and gave the rest to the people and keeper of the bath then she slept till the morning and the merchant lay the night in a place apart from her when he aroused himself from sleep he came to her and waking her presented her with a shift of fine stuff and a head kerchief worth a thousand diners a suit of turkish embroidery and walking boots purfled with red gold and set with pearls and gems moreover he hung in each of her ears a circlet of gold with a fine pearl therein worth a thousand diners and threw round her neck a collar of gold with bosses of garnet and a chain of amber beads that hung down between her breasts over her navel now to this chain were attached ten balls and nine crescents and each crescent had in its midst a bezel of ruby and each ball a bezel of balass the value of the chain was three thousand diners and each of the balls was priced at twenty thousand dirhams so that the dress she wore was worth in all a great sum of money when she had put these on the merchant bade her adorn herself and she adorned herself to the utmost beauty then she let fall her fillet over her eyes and she fared forth with the merchant preceding her but when folk saw her all wondered at her beauty and exclaimed blessed be allah the most excellent creator o lucky the man in whose house the hall be and the trader ceased not walking and she behind him till they entered the palace of sultan sharrkan when he sought an audience and kissing the earth between his hands said o auspicious king i have brought thee a rare gift unmatched in this time and richly gifted with beauty and with good qualities quoth the king let me see it so the merchant went out and brought her she following him till he made her stand before king sharrkan when he beheld her blood yearned to blood though she had been parted from him in childhood and though he had never seen her having only heard a long time after her birth that he had a sister called nuzhat al zaman and a brother zau almakan he having been jealous of them because of the succession and such was the cause of his knowing little about them then having placed her before the presence the merchant said o king of the age besides being peerless in her time and beauty and loveliness she is also versed in all learning sacred and profane including the art of government and the abstract sciences quoth the king to the trader take her price according as thou boughtest her and go thy ways i hear and i obey replied the merchant but first write me a patent exempting me for ever from paying tithe on my merchandise said the king i will do this but first tell me what price thou paidest for her said the merchant i bought her for an hundred thousand diners and her clothes cost me another hundred thousand when the sultan heard these words he declared i will give thee a higher price than this for her and calling his treasurer said to him pay this merchant three hundred and twenty thousand ducats so will he have an hundred and twenty thousand diners profit thereupon the sultan summoned the four kazis and paid him the money in their presence and then he said i call you to witness that i free this my slave girl and purpose to marry her so the kazis wrote out the deed of emancipation and the contract of marriage when the sultan scattered much gold on the heads of those present and the pages and the eunuchs picked up this largesse then after paying him his monies sharrkan bade them write for the merchant a perpetual patent exempting him from toll tax or tithe upon his merchandise and forbidding each and every in all his government to molest him and lastly bestowed on him a splendid dress of honour—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the sixtieth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that king sharrkan bade them write for the merchant a mandate after paying him his monies and they wrote a perpetual patent exempting him from the tithe upon his merchandise and forbidding any in his government to molest him and lastly bestowed upon him a splendid dress of honour then all about him retired and none remained save the kazis and the merchant whereupon said he to the judges i wish you to hear such discourse from this damsel as may prove her knowledge and accomplishments in all aimed for her by this trader that we ascertain the truth of his assertions they answered there is no evil in that and he commanded the curtain to be let down between him and those with him and the maiden and those with her and the women about the damsel behind the curtains began to wish her joy and kiss her hands and feet when they learned that she was become the kings wife then they came round her and took off her dresses easing her of the weight of her clothes and began to look upon her beauty and loveliness presently the wives of the emirs and wazirs heard that king sharrkan had bought a hand maiden unmatched for her beauty and learning and philosophy and account keeping and versed in all branches of knowledge that he had paid for her three hundred and twenty thousand dinars and that he had set her free and had written a marriage contract with her and had summoned the four kazis to make trial of her how she would answer all their questions and hold disputetion with them so they asked leave of their husbands and repaired to the palace wherein was nuzhat al zaman when they came in to her they found the eunuchs standing before her and as soon as she saw the wives of the emirs and wazirs and grandees of the realm coming to call upon her she arose to them on her feet and met them with courtesy her handmaidens standing behind her and she received them saying ye be welcome the while she smiled in their faces so as to win their hearts and she promised them all manner of good and seated them in their proper stations as if she had been brought up with them so all wondered at her beauty and loveliness and said to one another this damsel is none other than a queen the daughter of a king then they sat down magnifying her worth and said to her o our lady this our city is illumined by thee and our country and abode and birth place and reign are honoured by thy presence the kingdom indeed is thy kingdom and the palace is thy palace and we all are thy handmaids so by allah do not shut us out from thy favours and the sight of thy beauty and she thanked them for this all this while the curtains were let down between nuzhat alzaman and the women with her on the one side and king sharrkan and the four kazis and the merchant seated by him on the other presently king sharrkan called to her and said o queen the glory of thine age this merchant hath described thee as being learned and accomplished and he claimeth that thou art skilled in all branches of knowledge even to astrology so let us hear something of all this he hath mentioned and favour us with a short discourse on such subjects she replied saying o king to hear is to obeyfn259 the first subjects whereof i will treat are the art of government and the duties of kings and what behoveth governors of command meets according to religious law and what is incumbent on them in respect of satisfactory speech and manners know then o king that all mens works tend either to religious or to laical life for none attaineth to religion save through this world because it is the best road to futurity now the works of this world are not ordered save by the doings of its people and mens doings are divided into four divisions government commerce husbandry and craftsmanship now government requireth perfect administration with just and true judgment for government is the pivot of the edifice of the world which world is the road to futurity since allah almighty hath made the world for his servants as viaticum to the traveller for the attainment of his goal and it befitteth each man that he receive of it such measure as shall bring him to allah and that he follow not herein his own mind and his individual lust if folk would take of worldly goods with justice and equity all cause of contention would be cut off but they take thereof with violence ant after their own desires and their persistence therein giveth rise to contentions so they have need of the sultan that he do justice between them and order their affairs and if the king restrain not his folk from one another the strong will drive the weak to the wall hence ardeshirfn260 saith religion and kingship be twins religion is a hidden treasure and the king is its keeper and the divine ordinances and mens intelligence point out that it behoveth the people to adopt a sultan who shall withhold oppressor from oppressed and do the weak justice against the strong and restrain the violence of the proud and the rebels against rule for know o king that according to the measure of the sultans good morals even so will be the time as saith the apostle of allah on whom be peace and salvation there be two classes who if they be good the people will be good and if they be bad the people will be bad even the olema and the emirs and it is said by a certain sage there be three kinds of kings the king of the faith the king who protecteth things to which reverence is due and the king of his own lusts the king of the faith obligeth his subjects to follow their faith and it behoveth he be the most faithfulfn261 for it is by him that they take pattern in the things of the faith and it becometh the folk to obey him in whatso he commandeth according to divine ordinance but he shall hold the discontented in the same esteem as the contented because of submission to the decrees of destiny as for the king who protecteth things to be reverenced he upholdeth the things of the faith and of the world and compelleth his folk to follow the divine law and to preserve the rights of humanity and it fitteth him to unite pen and sword for whoso declineth from what pen hath written his feet slip and the king shall rectify his error with the sharp sword and dispread his justice over all mankind as for the king of his own lusts he hath no religion but the following his desire and as he feareth not the wrath of his lord who set him on the throne so his kingdom inclineth to deposition and the end of his pride is in the house of perdition and sages say the king hath need of many people but the people have need of but one king wherefore it beseemeth that he be well acquainted with their natures that he reduce their discord to concord that with his justice be encompass them all and with his bounties overwhelm them all and know o king that ardeshir styled jamr shadíd or the live coal third of the kings of persia conquered the whole world and divided it into four divisions and for this purpose get for himself four seal rings one for each division the first seal was that of the sea and the police of prohibition and on it was written alterna lives the second was the seal of tribute and of the receipt of monies and on it was written building up the third was the seal of the provisioning department and on it was written plenty the fourth was the seal of the oppressed and on it was written justice and these usages remained valid in persia until the revelation of alislam chosroës also wrote his son who was with the army be not thou too open handed with thy troops or they will be too rich to need thee—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the sixtyfirst night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that chosroës wrote his son be not thou too open handed with thy troops or they will be too rich to need thee nor be thou niggardly with them or they will murmur against thee give thy giving deliberately and confer thy favours advisedly open thy hand to them in time of success and stint them not in time of distress there is a legend that a desert arab came once to the caliph al mansúrfn262 and said starve thy dog and he shall follow thee when the caliph heard his words he was enraged with the arab but abu labbás of tús said to him i fear that if some other than thou should show him a scone the dog would follow him and leave thee alone thereupon the caliph almansurs wrath subsided and he knew that the wild arab had intended no offence and ordered him a present and know o king that abd almalik bin marwán wrote to his brother abd alazíz when he despatched him to egypt as follows pay heed to thy secretaries and thy chamberlains for the secretaries will acquaint thee with estate fished matters and the chamberlains with matters of official ceremony whilst thine expenditure will make thy troops known to thee omar bin alkhattábfn263 whom allah accept when engaging a servant was in the habit of conditioning him with four conditions the first that he should not ride the baggage beasts the second that he should not wear fine clothes the third that he should not eat of the spoil and the fourth that he should not put off praying till after the proper period it is said that there is no wealth more profitable than understanding and there is no understanding like common sense and prudence and there is no prudence like piety that there is no means of drawing near to god like good morals no measure like good breeding no traffic like good works and no profit like earning the divine favour that there is no temperance like standing within the limits of the law no science like that of meditation no worship like obeying the divine commends no faith like modesty no calculation like self abasement and no honour like knowledge so guard the head and what it containeth and the belly and what it compriseth and think of death and doom ere it ariseth saith ali whose face allah honour beware of the wickedness of women and be on thy guard against them consult them not in aughtfn264 but grudge not complaisance to them lest they greed for intrigue and eke quoth he whoso leaveth the path of moderation his wits become perplexed and there be rules for this which we will mention if it be allahs will and omar whom allah accept saith there are three kinds of women firstly the true believing heaven fearing love full and fruit full who helpeth her mate against fate not helping fate against her mate secondly she who loveth her children but no more and lastly she who is a shackle allah setteth on the neck of whom he will men be also three the wise when he exerciseth his own judgement the wiser who when befalleth somewhat whereof he knoweth not the issue seeketh folk of good counsel and acteth by their advice and the unwise irresolute ignoring the right way nor heeding those who would guide him straight justice is indispensable in all things even slave girls have need of justice and men quote as an instance highway robbers who live by violenting mankind for did they not deal equitably among themselves and observe justice in dividing their booty their order would fall to piecesfn265 in short for the rest the prince of noble qualities is beneficence cum benevolence and how excellent is the saying of the poet

by open hand and ruth the youth rose to his tribes command  go and do likewise for the same were easy task to thee

and quoth another

in ruth and mildness surety lies and mercy wins respect  and
             truth is best asylum for the man of soothfast soul
whoso for wealth of gold would win and wear the worlds good
             word  on glorys course must ever be the first to gain the
             goal

and nazhat alzaman discoursed upon the policy of kings till the bystanders said never have we seen one reason of rule and government like this damsel haply she will let us hear some discourse upon subject other than this when she heard their words and understood them she said as for the chapter of good breeding it is wide of comprehension being a compend of things perfect now it so happened that one day there came to the caliph muáwiyahfn266 one of his companions who mentioned the people of irak and the goodness of their wit and the caliphs wife maysún mother of yezíd heard his words so when he was gone she said to the caliph o prince of the faithful i would thou let some of the people of irak come in and talk to thee that i may hear their discourse therewith muawiyah said to his attendants see who is at the door and they answered the banu tamim let them come in said he so they came in and with them alahnáf son of kaysfn267 then quoth muawiyah enter o abu bahr and drew a curtain between himself and maysun that she might hear what they said without being seen herself then he said to alahnaf o son of the sea draw near and tell me what counsel thou hast for me quoth alahnaf part thy hair and trim thy moustachio and pare thy nails and pluck thine armpits and shave thy pubesfn268 and ever use the toothstick because therein be two and seventy virtues and make the ghusl or complete ablution on friday as an expiation for all between the fridays—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that nuzhat al zaman said to her brother sharrkan and the four kazis here endeth the second section of the first chapter and it so happened that omar bin abd alaziz wrote to the people of the festival at meccah as follows i call allah to witness in the holy month in the holy city and on the day of the greater pilgrimagefn293 that i am innocent of your oppression and of his wrongs that doth wrong you in that i have neither commanded this nor purposed it neither hath any report of aught thereof hitherto reached me nor have i compassed any knowledge thereof and i trust that a cause for pardon will be found in that none hath authority from me to oppress any man for i shall assuredly be questioned concerning every one oppress and if any of my officers swerve from the right and act otherwise than the holy book and the traditions of the apostle do authorise obey him not so that he may return to the way of righteousness he said also allah accept of him i do not wish to be relieved from death because it is the supreme thing for which the true believer is rewarded quoth one of authority i went to the prince of the faithful omarbin abd alaziz who was then caliph and saw before him twelve dirhams which he ordered for deposit in the public treasury so i said to him o commander of the faithful thou impoverishest thy children and reducest them to beggary having nothing whereon to live an thou wouldst appoint somewhat by will to them and to those who are poor of the people of thy house it were well draw near to me answered he so i drew near to him and he said now as for thy saying thou beggarest thy children provide for them and for the poor of thy household it is without reason for allah of a truth will replace me to my children and to the poor of my house and he will be their guardian verily they are like other men he who feareth allah right soon will allah provide for him a happy issue and he that is addicted to sins i will not up hold him in his sin against allah then he summoned his sons who numbered twelve and when he beheld them his eyes dropped tears and presently he said to them your father is between two things either ye will be well to do and your parent will enter the fire or ye will be poor and your parent will enter paradise and your fathers entry into paradise is liefer to him than that ye should be well to dofn294 so arise and go allah be your helper for to him i commit your affairs khálid bin safwánfn295 said yúsuf bin omarfn296 accompanied me to hishám bin abd almalikfn297 and as i met him he was coming forth with his kinsmen and attendants he alighted and a tent was pitched for him when the people had taken their seats i came up to the side of the carpet whereon he sat reclining and looked at him and waiting till my eyes met his eyes bespoke him thus may allah fulfil his bounty to thee o commander of the faithful i have an admonition for thee which hath come down to us from the history of the kings preceding thee at this he sat up whenas he had been reclining and said to me bring what thou hast o son of safwan quoth i o commander of the faithful one of the kings before thee went forth in a time before this thy time to this very country and said to his companions saw ye ever any state like mine and say me hath such case been given to any man even as it hath been given unto me now there was with him a man of those who survive to bear testimony to truth upholders of the right and wayfarers in its highway and he said to him o king thou askest of a grave matter wilt thou give me leave to answer yes replied the king and the other said dost thou judge thy present state to be short lasting or ever lasting it is temporary replied the king how then rejoined the man do i see thee exulting in that which thou wilt enjoy but a little while and whereof thou wilt be questioned for a long while and for the rendering an account whereof thou shalt be as a pledge which is pawned quoth the king whither shall i flee and what must i seek for me that thou abide in thy kingship replied the other or else robe thee in ragsfn298 and apply thyself to obey almighty allah thy lord until thine appointed hour i will come to thee again at daybreak khalid bin safwan further relates that the man knocked at the door at dawn and behold the king had put off his crown and resolved to become an anchorite for the stress of his exhortation when hishám bin abd almalik heard this he wept till his beard was wet and bidding his rich apparel be put off shut himself up in his palace then the grandees and dependents came to khalid and said what is this thou hast done with the commander of the faithful thou hast troubled his pleasure and disturbed his life then

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that king omar bin alnuuman wrote in his letter my absence while sporting and hunting endured for a whole month and when i returned i found that thy brother and sister had taken somewhat of money and had set out with the pilgrim caravan for pilgrimage by stealth when i knew this the wide world narrowed on me o my son but i awaited the return of the caravan hoping that haply they would come back with it accordingly when the palmers appeared i asked concerning the twain but they could give me no news of them so i donned mourning for them being heavy at heart and in sleep i have no part and i am drowned in the tears of my eyes then he wrote in verse

that pair in image quits me not one single hour  whom in my
             hearts most honourable place i keep
sans hope of their return i would not live one hour  without my
             dreams of them i neer would stretch me in sleep

the letter went on and after the usual salutations to thee and thine i command thee neglect no manner of seeking news of them for indeed this is a shame to us when sharrkan read the letter he felt grief for his father and joy for the loss of his brother and sister then he took the missive and went in with it to nuzhat alzaman who knew not that he was her brother nor he that she was his sister albeit he often visited her both by night and by day till the months were accomplished and she sat down on the stool of delivery allah made the child birth easy to her and she bare a daughter whereupon she sent for sharrkan and seeing him she said to him this is thy daughter name her as thou wilt quoth he it is usual to name children on the seventh day after birthfn300 then he bent over the child to kiss it and he saw hung about its neck a jewel which he knew at once for one of those which princess abrizah had brought from the land of the greeks now when he saw the jewel hanging from his babes neck he recognised it right well his senses fled and wrath seized on him his eyes rolled in rage and he looked at nuzhat al zaman and said to her whence hadst thou this jewel o slave girl when she heard this from sharrkan she replied i am thy lady and the lady of all in thy palace art thou not ashamed to say to me slave girl i am a queen daughter of king omar bin alnuuman hearing this he was seized with trembling and hung his head earthwards—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when he ended his verse he cried out and fell down in a fainting fit this is how it fared with him but as regards nuzhat al zaman when she heard that voice in the night her heart was at rest and she rose and in her joy she called the chief eunuch who said to her what is thy will quoth she arise and bring me him who recited verses but now replied he of a truth i did not hear him—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the seventysecond night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when nuzhat alzaman heard her brother reciting she called the chief eunuch and said to him go fetch me the man who is repeating this poetry replied he of a truth i heard him not and i wot him not and folks are all sleeping but she said whomsoever thou seest awake he is the reciter so he went yet found none on wake save the stoker for zau almakan was still insensible and when his companion saw the eunuch standing by his head he was afraid of him then said the eunuch art thou he who repeated poetry but now and my lady heard him the stoker fancied that the dame was wroth with the reciter and being afraid he replied by allah twas not i rejoined the eunuch who then was the reciter point him out to me thou must know who it was seeing that thou art awake the fireman feared for zau al makan and said in himself haply the eunuch will do him some hurt so he answered by allah i know not who it was said the eunuch by allah thou liest for there is none on wake here but thou so needs must thou know him by allah replied the fireman i tell thee the truth some passer by some wayfarer must have recited the verses and disturbed me and kept me awake allah requite him quoth the eunuch if thou happen upon him point him out to me and i will lay hands on him and bring him to the door of our ladys litterfn309 or do thou take him with thine own hand said the fireman go thou back and i will bring him to thee so the eunuch left him and went his ways and going in to his mistress told her all this and said to her none knoweth who it was it must have been some passer by some wayfarer and she was silent meanwhile zau almakan came to himself and saw that the moon had reached the middle heavens the breath of the dawn breezefn310 breathed upon him and his heart was moved to longing and sadness so he cleared his throat and was about to recite verses when the fire man asked him what wilt thou do answered zau almakan i have a mind to repeat somewhat of poetry that i may quench therewith the fire of my heart quoth the other thou knowest not what befel me whilst thou wast a faint and how i escaped death only by beguiling the eunuch tell me what happened quoth zau almakan replied the stoker whilst thou wast aswoon there came up to me but now an eunuch with a long staff of almond tree wood in his hand who took to looking in all the peoples faces as they lay asleep and asked me who it was recited the verses finding none awake but myself i told him in reply it was some passerby some wayfarer so he went away and allah delivered me from him else had he killed me but first he said to me if thou hear him again bring him to us when zau almakan heard this he wept and said who is it would forbid me to recite i will surely recite befal me what may for i am near mine own land and care for none rejoined the fireman thy design is naught save to lose thy life and zau almakan retorted needs must i recite verses verily said the stoker needs must there be a parting between me and thee in this place albeiti had intended not to leave thee till i had brought thee to thy native city and reunited thee with thy mother and father thou hast now tarried with me a year and a half and i have never harmed thee in aught what ails thee then that thou must needs recite verses seeing that we are tired out with walking and watching and all the folk are asleep for they require sleep to rest them of their fatigue but zau almakan answered i will not be turned away from my purposefn311 then grief moved him and he threw off concealment and began repeating these couplets

stand thou by the homes and hail the lords of the ruined stead
           cry thou for an answer belike reply to thee shall be
           sped
if the night and absence irk thy spirit kindle a torch  wi
           repine and illuminate the gloom with a gleaming greed
if the snake of the sand dunes hiss i shall marvel not at all
            let him bite so i bite those beauteous lips of the
           luscious red
o eden my soul hath fled in despite of the maid i love  had i
           lost hope of heaven my heart in despair were dead
and he also improvised the two following distichs

we were and were the days enthralled to all our wills 
           dwelling in union sweet and homed in fairest site
who shall restore the home of the beloved where showed  light
            of the place for aye conjoined with times
            delightfn312

and as he ceased his verses he shrieked three shrieks and fell senseless to the ground and the fireman rose and covered him when nuzhat alzaman heard the first improvisation she called to mind her father and her mother and her brother and their whilome home then she wept and cried at the eunuch and said to him woe to thee he who recited the first time hath recited a second time and i heard him hard by by allah an thou fetch him not to me i will assuredly rouse the chamberlain on thee and he shall beat thee and cast thee out but take these hundred diners and give them to the singer and bring him to me gently and do him no hurt if he refuse hand to him this purse of a thousand diners then leave him and return to me and tell me after thou hast informed thyself of his place and his calling and what countryman he is return quickly and linger not—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the seventythird night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that nuzhat al zaman sent the eunuch to make enquiries concerning the singer and said beware how thou come back to me and report i could not find him so the eunuch went out and laid about the people and trod in their tents but found none awake all being asleep for weariness till he came to the stoker and saw him sitting up with his head uncovered so he drew near and seizing him by the hand said to him it was thou didst recite the verses the fireman was afeard for his life and replied no by allah o chief of the people it was not i but the eunuch said i will not leave thee till thou show me who it was that recited the verses for i dread returning to my lady without him now when the fireman heard these words he feared for zau almakan and wept with exceeding weeping and said to the eunuch by allah it was not i and i know him not i only heard some passer by some wayfarer recite verses so do not thou commit sin on me for i am a stranger and come from the holy city of jerusalem and abraham the friend of allah be with you all rise up and fare with me rejoined the eunuch and tell my lady this with thine own mouth for i have seen none awake save thyself quoth the stoker hast thou not come and seen me sitting in the place where i now am and dost thou not know my station thou wottest none can stir from his place except the watchman seize him so go thou to thy station and if thou again meet any one after this hour reciting aught of poetry whether he be near or far it will be i or some one i know and thou shalt not learn of him but by me then he kissed the eunuchs head and spake him fair till he went away but the castrato fetched a round and returning secretly came and stood behind the fireman fearing to go back to his mistress without tidings as soon as he was gone the stoker arose and aroused zau almakan and said to him come sit up that i may tell thee what hath happened so zau almakan sat up and his companion told him what had passed and he answered let me alone i will take no heed of this and i care for none for i am mine own countryfn313 quoth the stoker why wilt thou obey thy flesh and the devil if thou fear no one i fear for thee and for my life so allah upon thee recite nothing more of verses till thou come to thine own land indeed i had not deemed thee so ill conditioned dost thou not know that this lady is the wife of the chamberlain and is minded to chastise thee for disturbing her belike she is ill or restless for fatigue of the journey and the distance of the place from her home and this is the second time she hath sent the eunuch to look for thee however zau almakan paid no heed to the firemans words but cried out a third time and began versifying with these couplets

i fly the carpers injury whose carping sorely vexeth me
he chides and taunts me wotting not  he burns me but more
            grievously
the blamer cries he is consoled  i say my own dear
            landfn314 to see
they ask why be that land so dear  i say it taught me in
            love to be
they ask what raised its dignity  i say what made my
            ignomy
whateer the bitter cup i drain  far be fro me that land to
             flee
nor will i bow to those who blame  and for such love would deal
             me shame

hardly had he made an end of his verses and come to a conclusion when the eunuch who had heard him from his hiding place at his head came up to him whereupon the fireman flea end stood afar off to see what passed between them then said the eunuch to zau almakan peace be with thee o my lord and on thee be peace replied zau almakan and the mercy of allah and his blessings o my lord continued the eunuch—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the seventyfourth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the eunuch said to zau almakan o my lord i have sought thee these several times this night for my mistress biddeth thee to her quoth zau al makan and who be this bitch that seeketh for me allah curse her and curse her husband with herfn315 and he began to revile the eunuch who could make him no answer because his mistress had charged him to do zau almakan no hurt nor bring him save of his own especial free will and if he would not accompany him to give him the thousand diners so the castrato began to speak him fair and say to him o my lord take this purse and go with me we will do thee no upright o my son nor wrong thee in aught but our object is that thou bend thy gracious steps with me to my mistress to receive her answer and return in weal and safety and thou shalt have a handsome present as one who bringeth good news when zau al makan heard this he arose and went with the eunuch and walked among the sleeping folk stepping over them whilst the fireman followed after them from afar and kept his eye upon him and said to himself alas the pity of his youth tomorrow they will hang him and he ceased not following them till he approached their stationfn316 without any observing him then he stood still and said how base it will be of him if he say it was i who bade him recite the verses this was the case of the stoker but as regards what befel zau almakan he ceased not walking with the eunuch till he reached his station and the castrato went in to nuzhat alzaman and said o my lady i have brought thee him whom thou soughtest and he is a youth fair of face and bearing the marks of wealth and gentle breeding when she heard this her heart fluttered and she cried let him recite some verses that i may hear him near hand and after ask him his name and his condition and his native land then the eunuch went out to zau almakan and said to him recite what verses thou knowest for my lady is here hard by listening to thee and after i will ask thee of thy name and thy native country and thy condition replied he with love and gladness but an thou ask my name it is erased and my trace is unplaced and my body a waste i have a story the beginning of which is not known nor can the end of it be shown and behold i am even as one who hath exceeded in wine drinking and who hath not spared himself one who is afflicted with distempers and who wandereth from his right mind being perplexed about his case and drowned in the sea of thought when nuzhat alzaman heard this she broke out into excessive weeping and sobbing and said to the eunuch ask him if he have parted from one he loveth even as his mother or father the castrato asked as she bade him and zau almakan replied yes i have parted from every one i loved but the dearest of all to me was my sister from whom fate hath separated me when nuzhat al zaman heard this she exclaimed allah almighty reunite him with what he loveth—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the seventyfifth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when nuzhat alzaman heard his words she said allah reunite him with what he loveth then quoth she to the eunuch tell him to let me hear somewhat anent his separation from his countrymen and his country the eunuch did so and zau almakan sighed heavily and began repeating these coupletsfn317

is not her love a pledge by all mankind confest  the house
            that hometh hinda be forever blest
her love all levels man can reck of naught beside  naught or
           before or after can for man have zest
tis though the vale is paved with musk and ambergris  that day
           when hindas footstep on its face is prest
hail to the beauty of our camp the pride of folk  the dearling
           who en slaves all hearts by her behest
allah on times delight send large dropped clouds that teem 
           with genial rain but bear no thunder in their breast
and also these

i vow to allah if at home i sight  my sister nuzhat alzamani
           highs
ill pass the days in joyance and delight  mid bashful minions
             maidens soft and white
to sound of harps in various modes they smite  draining the
            bowl while eyes rain lively light
neath half closed lids a sipping lips red bright  by stream
            bank flowing through my garden site

when he had finished his verse nuzhat alzaman lifted up a skirt of the litter curtain and looked at him as soon as her eyes fell on his face she knew him for certain and cried out o my brother o zau almakan he also looked at her and knew her and cried out o my sister o nuzhat alzaman then she threw herself upon him and he gathered her to his bosom and the twain fell down in a fainting fit when the eunuch saw this case he wondered at them and throwing over them somewhat to cover them waited till they should recover after a while they came to themselves and nuzhat alzaman rejoiced with exceeding joy oppression and depression left her and gladness took the mastery of her and she repeated these verses

time sware my life should fare in woeful waste  forsworn art
           time expiate thy sin in hastefn318
comes weal and comes a welcome friend to aid  to him who brings
           good news rise gird thy waist
i spurned old world tales of eden bliss  till came i
            kausarfn319 on those lips

when zau almakan heard this he pressed his sister to his breast tears streamed from his eyes for excess of joy and he repeated these coupletsfn320

long i lamented that we fell apart  while tears repentant
            railed from these eyne
and sware if time unite us twain once more  severance shall
            never sound from tongue of mine
joy hath so overwhelmed me that excess  of pleasure from mine
            eyes draws gouts of brine
tears o mine eyes have now become your wont  ye weep for
            pleasure and you weep for pine

they sat awhile at the litter door till she said to him come with me into the litter and tell me all that hath befallen thee and i will tell thee what happened to me so they entered and zau almaken said do thou begin thy tale accordingly she told him all that had come to her since their separation at the khan and what had happened to her with the badawi how the merchant had bought her of him and had taken her to her brother sharrkan and had sold her to him how he had freed her at the time of buying how he had made a marriage contract with her and had gone in to her and how the king their sire had sent and asked for her from sharrkan then quoth she praised be allah who hath vouchsafed thee to me and ordained that even as we left our father together so together shall we return to him and she added of a truth my brother sharrkan gave me in marriage to this chamberlain that he might carry me to my father and this is what befel me from first to last so now tell me how it hath fared with thee since i left thee thereupon he told her all that had happened to him from beginning to end and how allah vouchsafed to send the fireman to him and how he had journeyed with him and spent his money on him and had served him night and day she praised the stoker for this and zau almakan added of a truth o my sister this fireman hath dealt with me in such benevolent wise as would not lover with lass nor sire with son for that he fasted and gave me to eat and he walked whilst he made me ride and i owe my life to him said she allah willing we will requite him for all this according to our power then she called the eunuch who came and kissed zau al makans hand and she said take thy reward for glad tidings o face of good omen it was thy hand reunited me with my brother so the purse i gave thee and all in it are thine but now go to thy master and bring him quickly to me the castrato rejoiced and going in to the chamberlain him to his mistress accordingly he came in to his wife and finding zau almakan with her asked who he was so she told him all that had befallen them both first and last and added know o chamberlain that thou hast married no slave girl far from it thou hast taken to wife the daughter of king omar bin alnuuman for i am nuzhat al zaman and this is my brother zau almakan when the chamberlain heard the story he knew it to be sooth and its manifest truth appeared to him and he was certified that he was become king omar bin alnuumans son in law so he said to himself  twill be my fate to be made viceroy of some provincefn321 then he went up to zau almakan and gave him joy of his safety and reunion with his sister and bade his servants forthwith make him ready a tent and one of the best of his own horses to ride thereupon said nuzhat alzaman we are now near our country and i would be left alone with my brother that we may enjoy each others company and take our fill of it ere we reach baghdad for we have been parted a long long time be it as thou biddest replied the chamberlain and going forth from them sent them wax candles and various kinds of sweetmeats together with three suits of the costliest for zau almakan then he returned to the litter and related the good he had done and nuzhat alzaman said to him bid the eunuch bring me the fireman and give him a horse to ride and ration him with a tray of food morning and evening and let him be forbidden to leave us the chamberlain called the castrato and charged him to do accordingly so he replied i hear and i obey and he took his pages with him and went out in search of the stoker till he found him in the rear of the caravan girthing his ass and preparing for flight the tears were running adown his cheeks out of fear for his life and grief for his separation from zau almakan and he was saying to himself indeed i warned him for the love of allah but he would not listen to me oh would i knew what is become of him ere he had done speaking the eunuch was standing by his head whilst the pages surrounded him the fireman turned and seeing the eunuch and the pages gathered around him became yellow with fear—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the seventysixth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the stoker girthed his ass for flight and bespake himself saying oh would i knew what is become of him ere he had done speaking the castrato was standing by his head and his side muscles quivered for fear and he lifted up his voice and cried verily he knoweth not the value of the good offices i have done him i believe he hath denounced me to the eunuch hence these pages et about me and he hath made me an accomplice in his crime then the effeminated one cried at him saying who was it recited the verses o liar why didst thou say i never repeated these couplets nor do i know who repeated them when it was thy companion but now i will not leave thee between this place and baghdad and what betideth thy comrade shall betide thee quoth the fireman what i feared hath befallen me and he repeated this couplet

twas as i feared the coming ills discerning  but unto allah we are all returning

then the eunuch cried upon the pages saying take him off the ass so they carried him along with the caravan surrounded by the pages as the white contains the black of the eye and the castrato said to them if a hair of him be lost you will be lost with it and he bade them privily treat him with honour and not humiliate him but when the stoker saw himself beset by the pages he despaired of his life and turning to the eunuch said to him o chief i am neither this youths brother nor am i akin to him nor is he sib to me but i was a fireman in a hammam and found him cast out in his sickness on the dung heap then the caravan fared on and the stoker wept and imagined in himself a thousand things whilst the eunuch walked by his side and told him nothing but said to him thou disturbedst our mistress by reciting verses thou and this youth but fear nothing for thy self and kept laughing at him the while to himself whenever the caravan halted they served him with food and he and the castrato ate from one dishfn322 then the eunuch bade his lads bring a gugglet of sugared sherbet and after drinking himself gave it to the fireman who drank but all the while his tears never dried out of fear for his life and grief for his separation from zau almakan and for what had befallen them in their strangerhood so they both travelled on with the caravan whilst the chamberlain now rode by the door of his wifes litter in attendance on zau almakan and his sister and now gave an eye to the fireman and nuzhat alzaman and her brother occupied themselves with converse and mutual condolence and they ceased not after this fashion till they came within three days journey from baghdad here they alighted at eventide and rested till the morning morrowed and as they awoke and they were about to load the beasts behold there appeared afar off a great cloud of dust that darkened the firmament till it became black as gloomiest nightfn323 thereupon the chamberlain cried out to them stay and your loading delay then mounting with his mamelukes rode forward in the direction of the dust cloud when they drew near suddenly appeared under it a numerous conquering host like the full tide sea with flags and standards drums and kettledrums horsemen and footmen the chamberlain marvelled at this and when the troops saw him there detached itself from amongst them a plump of five hundred cavaliers who fell upon him and his suite and surrounded them five for one whereupon said he to them what is the matter and what are these troops that ye do this with us asked they who art thou and whence comest thou and whither art thou bound and he answered i am the chamberlain of the emir of damascus king sharrkan son of omar bin alnuuman lord of baghdad and of the land of khorasan and i bring tribute and presents from him to his father in baghdad when the horsemen heard his words they let their head kerchiefs fall over their faces and wept saying in very sooth king omar is dead and he died not but of poison so fare ye forwards no harm shall befal you till you join his grand wazir dandan now when the chamberlain heard this he wept sore and exclaimed oh for our disappointment in this our journey then he and all his suite wept till they had come up with the host and sought access to the wazir dandan who granted an interview and called a halt and causing his pavilion to be pitched sat down on a couch therein and commanded to admit the chamberlain then he bade him be seated and questioned him and he replied that he was chamberlain to the emir of damascus and was bound to king omar with presents and the tribute of syria the wazir hearing the mention of king omars name wept and said king omar is dead by poison and upon his dying the folk fell out amongst themselves as to who should succeed him until they were like to slay one another on this account but the notables and grandees and the four kazis interposed and all the people agreed to refer the matter to the decision of the four judges and that none should gainsay them so it was agreed that we go to damascus and fetch thence the kings son sharrkan and make him sultan over his fathers realm and amongst them were some who would have chosen the cadet zau almakan for quoth they his name be light of the place and he hath a sister nuzhat alzaman highs the delight of the time but they set out five years ago for alhijaz and none wotteth what is become of them when the chamberlain heard this he knew that his wife had told him the truth of her adventures and he grieved with sore grief for the death of king omar albeit he joyed with exceeding joy especially at the arrival of zau almakan for that he would now become sultan of baghdad in his fathers stead—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the seventyseventh night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when sharrkans chamberlain heard of the death of king omar bin al nuuman he mourned but he rejoiced because of his wife and her brother zau almakan who would become sultan of baghdad in his fathers stead so he turned to the wazir dandan and said to him verily your tale is a wonder of wonders know o chief wazir that here where you have encountered me allah hath given you rest from fatigue and bringeth you your desire after the easiest of fashions for that his almighty will restoreth to you zau almakan and his sister nuzhat alzaman whereby we will settle the matter as we easily can when the minister heard these words he rejoiced with great joy and said o chamberlain tell me the tale of the twain and what befel them and the cause of their long absence so he repeated to him the whole story and told him that nuzhat alzaman was his wife and related to him the adventures of zau almakan from first to last as soon as he had ended his tale the wazir sent for the emirs and wazirs and chief officers and acquainted them with the matter whereat they rejoiced with great joy and wondered at the happy chance then they gathered in a body and went in to the chamberlain and did their service to him kissing the ground between his hands and the wazir dandan also rose and went out to meet him and stood before him in honour after this the chamberlain held on that day a divan council and he and the wazir sat upon a throne whilst all the emirs and grandees and officers of state took their places before them according to their several ranksfn324 then they melted sugar in rose water and drank after which the emirs sat down to hold council and permitted the rest of the host to mount and ride forward leisurely till they should make an end of their debate and overtake them so the officers kissed the ground between their hands and mounting rode onwards preceded by the standards of war when the grandees had finished their conference they took horse and rejoined the host and the chamberlain approached the wazir dandan and said i deem it well to ride on before you and precede you that i may get ready a place for the sultan and notify him of your coming and of your choosing him as sultan over the head of his brother sharrkan aright thou reckest answered the wazir then the chamberlain rose up in haste and dandan also stood up to do him honour and brought him presents which he conjured him to accept in similar guise did all the emirs and grandees and officers of state bringing him gifts and calling down blessings on him and saying to him haply thou wilt mention our case to sultan zau almakan and speak to him to continue us in our dignitiesfn325 the chamberlain promised all they required and bade his pages be ready to march whereupon the wazir dandan sent with him tents and bade the tent pitchers set them up at a days journey from the city and they did his bidding then the chamberlain mounted and rode forward full of joy and saying to himself how blessed is this gurney and indeed his wife was exalted in his eyes she and her brother zau almakan they made all haste over their wayfare till they reached a place distant a days journey from baghdad where the chamberlain called a halt for rest and bade his men alight and make ready a sitting place for the sultan zau almakan son of king omar bin alnuuman while he rode forward with his mamelukes and alighting at a distance from nuzhat alzamans litter commanded the eunuchs to ask leave of admission to the presence they did so and she gave permission whereupon he went in to her and conversed with her and her brother and told them of the death of their father and of zau almakan how the heads of the people had made him king over them in the stead of his sire and he gave them joy of the kingdom they both wept for their father and asked the manner of his being killed but the chamberlain answered the news rests with the wazir dandan who will be here tomorrow leading all the host and it only remaineth for thee o king to do what they counsel since they have unanimously chosen thee sultan for if thou do not this they will choose some one else and thou canst not be sure of thy life with another sultan haply he will kill thee or discord may befal between you twain and the kingdom pass out of the hands of both zau almakan bowed his head awhile and then said i accept this position for indeed there was no refusing and he was certified that the chamberlain had counselled him well and wisely and set him on the right way then he added o my uncle how shall i do with my brother sharrkan o my son replied the chamberlain thy brother will be sultan of damascus and thou sultan of baghdad so take heart of grace and get ready thy case zau almakan accepted this and the chamberlain presented him with a suit of royal raiment and a daggerfn326 of state which the wazir dandan had brought with him then leaving him he bade the tent pitchers choose a spot of rising ground and set up thereon a spacious pavilion wherein the sultan might sit to receive the emirs and grandees moreover he ordered the kitcheners to cook rich viands and serve them and he commanded the water carriers to dispose the water troughs they did as he bade them and presently arose a cloud of dust from the ground and spread till it walled the horizon round after awhile the dust dispersed and there appeared under it the army of baghdad and khorasan a conquering host like the full tide sea—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the seventyeighth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the chamberlain bade the tent pitchers set up a pavilion spacious enough to receive the subjects flocking to their sultan they planted a splendid sháhmiyánahfn327 befitting kings and as they ended their labours behold a dust cloud spired aloft and the breeze made it lift and beneath it showed a conquering host and presently it appeared that this was the army of baghdad and khorasan preceded by the wazir dandan and in it all rejoiced at the accession of the light of the place now zau almakan had donned robes of royal estate and girt himself with the sword of state so the chamberlain brought him a steed and he mounted surrounded by the mamelukes and all the company from the tents on foot to do him service and he rode on until he came to the great pavilion where he sat down and he laid the royal dagger across his thighs whilst the chamberlain stood in attendance on him and his armed slaves stationed themselves under the entrance awning of the shahmiyanah with drawn swords in their hands presently up came the troops and the host and craved admission so the chamberlain went in to zau almakan and asked his leave whereupon he bade admit them ten by ten the chamberlain acquainted them with the kings commands to which they replied we hear and we obey and all drew up before the pavilion entrance then he took ten of them and carried them through the vestibule into the presence of sultan zau almakan whom when they saw they were awed but he received them with most gracious kindness and promised them all good so they gave him joy of his safe return and invoked allahs blessings upon him after which they took the oath of fealty never to gainsay him in aught and they kissed ground before him and withdrew then other ten entered and he entreated them as he had entreated the ethers and they ceased not to enter ten by ten till none was left but the wazir dandan lastly the minister went in and kissed the ground before zau almakan who rose to meet him saying welcome o wazir and sire sans peer verily thine acts are those of a counsellor right dear and judgement and foreseeing clear are in the hands of the subtle of lere then bade he the chamberlain forthwith go out and cause the tables to be spread and order all the troops thereto so they came and ate and drank moreover the sultan commanded his wazir dandan call a ten days halt of the army that he might be private with him and learn from him how and wherefore his father had been slain the wazir obeyed the commands of the sultan with submission and wished him eternity of glory and said this needs must be he then repaired to the heart of the encampment and ordered the host to halt ten days they did as he bade them and moreover he gave them leave to divert themselves and ordered that none of the lords in waiting should attend upon the king for service during the space of three days then the wazir went to the sultan and reported all to him and zau almakan waited until nightfall when he went in to his sister nuzhat alzaman and asked her dost thou know the cause of my fathers murder or not i have no knowledge of the cause she answered and drew a silken curtain before herself whilst zau almakan seated himself without the curtain and commanded the wazir to the presence and when he came said to him i desire thou relate to me in detail the cause of the killing of my sire king omar bin alnuuman know then o king replied dandan that king omar bin al nuuman when he returned to baghdad from his chasing and hunting and entered the city enquired for thee and thy sister but could not find you and knew that you twain had gone on the pilgrimage whereat he was greatly grieved and much angered and his breast was straitened and he abode thus half a year seeking news of you from all who came and went but none could give him any tidings now while we were in attendance upon him one day after a whole year had sped since ye were lost to his sight lo there came to us an ancient dame with signs of being a devotee accompanied by five damsels high bosomed virgins like moons endowed with such beauty and loveliness as tongue faileth to describe and to crown their perfections of comeliness they could read the koran and were versed in various kinds of learning and in the histories of bygone peoples then that old woman sought audience of the king and he bade admit her whereupon she entered the presence and kissed the ground between his hands i was then sitting by his side and he seeing in her the signs of asceticism and devoutness made her draw near and take seat hard by him and when she had sat down she addressed him and said know o king that with me are five damsels whose like no king among the kings possesseth for they are endowed with wit and beauty and loveliness and perfection they read the koran—and the traditions and are skilled in all manner of learning and in the history of bygone races they stand here between thy hands to do thee service o king of the age and it is by trial that folk are prized or despised thy father who hath found mercyfn328 looked at the damsels and their favour pleased him so he said to them let each and every of you make me hear something of what she knoweth anent the history of the folk of yore and of peoples long gone before—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased

when it was the seventyninth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the wazir dandan said unto king zau almakan thy father who hath found mercy glanced at the damsels and their favour pleased him and he said to them let each and every of you make me hear something of what she knoweth anent the history of the folk of yore and of peoples long gone before thereupon one of them came forward and kissing the ground before him spake as followsfn329 know o king that it behoveth one of good breeding to eschew impertinence and adorn himself with excellencies and observe the divine injunctions and avoid mortal sins and to this he should apply himself with the assiduity of one who if he stray therefrom falleth into perdition for the foundation of good breeding is virtuous behaviour and know that the chief cause and reason of mans existence is the endeavour after life everlasting and the right way thereto is the service of allah wherefore it behoveth thee to deal beneficently with the people and swerve not from this canon for the mightier men are in dignity the more their need of prudence and foresight and indeed monarchs need this more than the many for the general cast themselves into affairs without taking thought to the issue thereof be thou prodigal of thy life and thy good in the way of allah and know that if an enemy dispute with thee thou mayst dispute with him and refute him with proofs and be proof against him but as for thy friend there is none can judge between thee and him save righteousness and fair dealing choose therefore thy friend for thyself after thou hast proved him if he be of the brotherhood of futurityfn330 let him be zealous in observing the externals of the holy law and versed in its inner meaning as far as may be and if he be of the brotherhood of the world let him be free born sincere neither a fool nor a perverse for the fool man is such that even his parents might well flee from him and a liar cannot be a true friend indeed the word siddíkfn331 friend deriveth from sidk truth that welleth up from the bottom of the heart and how can this be the case when falsehood is manifest upon the tongue and know that the observance of the law profiteth him who practiseth it so love thy brother if he be of this quality and do not cast him off even if thou see in him that which irketh thee for a friend is not i like a wife whom one can divorce and remarry nay his heart is like glass once broken it may not be mended and allah bless him who saith

ware how thou hurtest man with hurt of heart  tis hard to win
             thee back the heart offended
for hearts indeed whence love is alien made  like broken glass
             may nevermore be mended

the maiden continued and concluded with pointing out to us what sages say the best of brethren is he who is the most constant in good counsel the best of action is that which is fairest in its consequence and the best of praise is not that which is in the mouths of men it is also said it behoveth not the servant to neglect thanking allah especially for two favours health and reason again it is said whoso honoureth himself his lust is a light matter to him and he who maketh much of his small troubles allah afflicteth him with the greater he who obeyeth his own inclination neglecteth his duties and he who listeneth to the slanderer loseth the true friend he who thinketh well of thee do thou fulfill his thought of thee he who exceedeth in contention sinneth and he who against upright standeth not on ward is not safe from the sword now will i tell thee somewhat of the duties of kazis and judges know o king that no judgement serveth the cause of justice save it be given after proof positive and it behoveth the judge to treat all people on the same level to the intent that the great may not hunger for oppression nor the small despair of justice furthermore he should extract proof from the complainant and impose an oath upon the defendant and mediation is admissible between moslems except it be a compromise sanctioning the unlawful or forbidding the lawfulfn332 if thou shalt have done aught during the day of which thy reason is doubtful but thy good intention is proved thou o kazi shouldst revert to the right for to do justice is a religious obligation and to return to that which is right is better than persistence in wrong then o judge thou shouldest study precedents and the law of the case and do equal justice between the suitors withal fixing thine eyes upon the truth and committing thine affair to allah be he extolled and exalted and require thou proof of the complainant and if he adduce evidence let him have due benefit of it and if not put the defendant to his oath for this is the ordinance of allah receive thou the testimony of competent moslem witnesses one against other for almighty allah hath commanded judges to judge by externals he himself taking charge of the inner and secret things it behoveth the judge also to avoid giving judge meet whilst suffering from stress of pain or hungerfn333 and that in his decisions between folk he seek the face of allah almighty for he whose intent is pure and who is at peace with himself allah shall guarantee him against what is between him and the people quoth alzuhrifn334 there are three things for which if they be found in a kazi he should be deposed namely if he honour the base if he love praise and if he fear dismissal and omar bin abd alaziz once deposed a kazi who asked him why hast thou dismissed me it hath reached me answered omar that thy converse is greater than thy condition it is said also that iskandarfn335 said to his kazi i have invested thee with this function and committed to thee in it my soul and mine honour and my manliness so do thou guard it with thy sense and thine understanding to his cook he said thou art the sultan of my body so look thou tender it as thine own self to his secretary he said thou art the controller of my wit so do thou watch over me in what thou writest for me and from me thereupon the first damsel backed out from the presence and a second damsel came forward—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the eightieth night

she continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that the wazir dandan said to zau almakan thereupon the first damsel backed out from the presence and a second damsel came forward and kissing the ground seven times before the king thy father spake as follows the sage lukmánfn336 said to his son there be three who are known only in three several cases the merciful man is unknown save in time of wrath the brave only in battle and thy friend in time of need it is said that the oppressor shall be depress though by people praised and that the oppress is at rest though by people blamed quoth allah almightyfn337 assuredly deem not that those who rejoice in what they have done and who love to be praised for what they have not done shall escape reckoning of punishment indeed there is reserved for them a grievous penalty and he saidfn338 on whom be salvation and salutation works are according to intention and to each man is attributed that which he intendeth he said also in the body is a part which being sound the rest is sound and which being unsound the whole is unsound and this is the heart now this heart is the most marvellous of what is in man since it is that which ordereth his whole affair if covetise stir in it desire destroyeth him and if affliction master it anguish slayeth him if anger rage in it danger is hard upon him if it be blest with contentment he is safe from discontent if fear surprise it he is full of mourning and if calamity overtake it affliction betideth him if a man gain the use of wealth peradventure he is diverted thereby from the remembrance of his lord if poverty choke him his heart is distracted by woe or if disquietude waste his heart weakness causeth him to fall thus in any case nothing profiteth him but that he be mindful of allah and occupy himself with gaining his livelihood in this world and securing his place in the next it was asked of a certain sage who is the most ill conditioned of men and he answered the man whose lusts master his manhood and whose mind soareth over high so that his knowledge dispreadeth and his excuse diminisheth and how excellently saith the poet

freest am i of all mankind fro meddling wight  who seeing
            others err self error neer can sight
riches and talents are but loans to creature lent  each wears
            the cloak of that he bears in breast and sprite
if by mistaken door attempt on aught thou make  thou shalt go
            wrong and if the door be right go right

continued the maiden as for anecdotes of devotees quoth hisham bin bashar i asked omar bin ubayd what is true piety and he answered the apostle of allah to whom be salutation and salvation hath explained it when he sayeth the pious is he who forgetteth not the grave nor calamity and who preferreth that which endureth to that which passeth away who counteth not the morrow as of his days but reckoneth himself among the dead and it is related that abu zarrfn339 used to say want is dearer to me than wealth and unheal is dearer to me than health quoth one of the listeners may allah have mercy on abu zarr for my part i say whoso putteth his trust in the goodness of the election of almighty allah should be content with that condition which allah hath chosen for him quoth one of the companions of the prophet ibn abi aufafn340 once prayed with us the dawn prayer when he had done he recited o thou enwrappedfn341 till he came to where allah saith when there shall be a trumping on the trumpet and fell down dead it is said that sabit albanani wept till he well nigh lost his eyes they brought him a man to medicine him who said to him i will cure thee provided thou obey my bidding asked sabit in what matter quoth the leach in that thou leave weeping what is the worth of mine eyes rejoined sabit if they do not weep quoth a man to mohammed bin abdillah exhort thou me—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

be as thou wilt for allah still is bounteous lord  and care
            dispeller dread not therefore bane and ban
to two things only never draw thee nigh nor give  partner to
            allah trouble to thy brother man
and how well saith the poet

an thou of pious works a store neglect  and after death meet
             one who did collect
thou shalt repent thou diddest not as he  nor madest ready as
             he did elect

allah for her that her two children may be restored to her thou hast said well replied she for that indeed was her grievousest want thy sire gave not over finishing his fast till the old woman said to him o my son i am going to the invisible controuls so bring me sophia accordingly he summoned her and she came forthright and he delivered her to the old woman who mixed her up with the other damsels then she went in to her chamber and bringing out a sealed cup presented it to the sultan saying on the thirtieth day do thou repair to the hammam and when thou comest out enter one of the closets in thy palace and drink what is in this cup then sleep and thou shalt attain what thou seekest and peace be with thee thereat the king was glad and thanked her and kissed her hands quoth she i commend thee to allahs care whereat quoth he and when shall i see thee again o pious lady in very sooth i love not to part with thee then she called down blessings on him and departed with the five damsels and the queen whilst the king fasted after her departure other three days till the month ended when he arose and went to the hammam and coming out shut himself up in a closet of his palace commanding that none should go in to him there after making fast the door he drank what was in the cup and lay down to sleep and we sat awaiting him till the end of the day but he did not come out and we said perchance he is tired with the bath and with watching by night and fasting by day wherefore he sleepeth so we waited till next day but still he did not come forth then we stood at the closet door and cried aloud so haply he might awake and ask what was the matter but nothing came of that so at last we lifted up the doorfn375 and going in found him dead with his flesh torn into strips and bits and his bones brokenfn376 when we saw him in this condition it was grievous to us and we took up the cup and found within its cover a piece of paper whereon was inscribed whoso doeth evil leaveth no regrets and this be the reward of him who playeth traitor with the daughters of kings and who debaucheth them and we make known to all who fall upon this scroll that sharrkan when he came to our country seduced our queen abrizah nor did that suffice him but he must needs take her from us and bring her to you then hefn377 sent her away in company of a black slave who slew her and we found her lying dead on the desert sward and thrown out to wild beasts this be no kingly deed and he who did this is requited with naught but what he merited so do ye suspect none of having killed him for no one slew him but the cunning witch whose name is zat aldawahi and behold i have taken the kings wife sophia and have carried her to her father afridun king of constantinople moreover there is no help for it but that we wage war upon you and kill you and take your country from you and ye shall be cut off even to the last man nor shall a living soul be spared by death nor one who bloweth fire with his breath save he who cross and beltfn378 worshippeth when we read this paper we knew that the ancient woman had beguiled us and carried out her plot against us whereupon we cried aloud and buffeted our faces and wept sore when weeping availed us naught and the troops fell out as to whom they should make sultan some would have thee and others would have thy brother sharrkan and we ceased not to dispute about this for the space of a month at the end of which certain of us drew together and agreed to repair to thy brother sharrkan so we set out and journeyed on till we fell in with thee and such is the manner of the death of sultan omar bin alnuuman now when the wazir dandan had made an end of his story zau al makan and his sister nuzhat alzaman wept and the chamberlain who wept also said to zau almakan o king weeping will avail thee naught nor shall aught profit thee but that thou harden thy heart and strengthen thy stress and establish thy sovranty for verily whoso leaveth the like of thee is not dead thereupon zau almakan gave over his weeping and caused his throne to be set up without the pavilion and then commanded the army to pass in review order before him and the chamberlain sat by his side and all the armourbearersfn379 behind him whilst the wazir dandan and the rest of the emirs and grandees stood each in his individual stead then quoth king zau almakan to the minister dandan inform me concerning my sires treasures and he replied i hear and i obey and gave him to know of the late kings hoards and monies and what was in the treasury of amassed wealth and jewels and acquainted him with other precious things so zau almakan opened his hand to the army and gave a sumptuous robe of honour to the wazir dandan saying thou continues in office whereupon dandan kissed the ground before him and wished him long life then he bestowed dresses on the emirs after which he said to the chamberlain bring out before me the tribute of damascus that is with thee so he was shown the chests of money and rarities and jewels when he took them and parted them all amongst the troops—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the eightyseventh night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that zau al makan ordered the chamberlain to bring out before him what he had brought of the tribute of damascus and when he was shown the chests of money and rarities and jewels he took them and parted them all amongst the troops till nothing was left and the emirs kissed the ground before him and wished him long life saying never saw we a king who gave the like of these gifts then all went away to their tents and when it was morning he gave orders for marching so they marched for three days till on the fourth day they drew near to baghdad when they entered the city they found it decorated and zau almakan the sultan went up to his fathers palace and sat down on the throne whilst the emirs of the army and the wazir dandan and the chamberlain of damascus stood between his hands then he bade his private secretary write a writ to his brother sharrkan acquainting him with all that had passed from first to last and he concluded as soon as thou hast read this letter make ready thine affair and join us with thine army that we may turn to holy war upon the infidels and take man bote for our father and wipe out the stain upon our honour then he folded the letter and sealed it with his seal ring and said to the minister dandan none shall carry this letter but thou and it behoveth thee speak my brother fair and say to him if thou have a mind to thy fathers kingdom it is thine and thy brother shall be viceroy for thee in damascus for to this effect am i instructed by him so the wazir went down from before him and made ready for his march then zau almakan bade set apart a magnificent house for the fireman and furnished it with the best of furniture and long is the tale of that firemanfn380 presently zau almakan went out chasing and hunting and as he was returning to baghdad one of the emirs presented him with blood horses and with beauteous handmaids whose description the tongue evades one of the damsels pleased him so he went in unto her and knew her that night and she conceived by him forthright after a while the wazir dandan returned from his journey bringing him news of his brother sharrkan and that he was then on his way to him and said it were fitting thou go forth to meet him zau al makan replied i hear and i consent and riding forth with his grandees a days journey from baghdad he pitched his pavilions there awaiting his brother next morning appeared king sharrkan amid the army of syria a horseman of might a lion fierce in fight a prow and doughty knight as the squadrons drew nigh and the dust clouds came hard by and the troops rode up with banners on high zau almakan and those with him pushed forward to meet sharrkan and his men and when zau almakan saw his brother he desired to dismount but sharrkan conjured him not to do on this wise and himself footed it and walked a few paces towards himfn381 as soon as he reached zau almakan the new sultan threw himself upon him and sharrkan embraced him and wept with great weeping and the twain condoled with each other then they mounted and rode onward they and their troops till they reached baghdad where they alighted and went up to the royal palace and there they passed that night and when next morning came zau al makan went forth and bade summon the troops from all parts and proclaimed a holy war and a razziafn382 they then awaited the coming of the levies from each quarter of the kingdom and every one who came they entreated with honour and promised him all manner of good till in so doing a full month had sped and the fighting men flocked to them in a continuous body then sharrkan said to zau almakan o my brother tell me thy history so he told him all that had befallen him from first to last including the benevolent dealing of the fireman with him asked sharrkan hast thou requited his kindness and he answered o my brother i have not rewarded him as yet but inshallah i will recompense him whenas i return from this raid—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the eightyeighth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that sharrkan asked his brother zau almakan hast thou requited the fireman for his kindness and he answered o my brother i have not rewarded him as yet but inshallah i will recompense him whenas i return from this raid and find time so to do therewith sharrkan was certified that his sister nuzhat alzaman had told him the whole truth but he concealed what had passed between them and offered his salutation to her by her husband the chamberlain she sent him back her greeting calling down blessings on him and enquiring after her daughter kuziafakan to which he replied that the maiden was well and in the best of health and safety where upon she praised almighty allah and gave him thanks then sharrkan went to his brother to take counsel with him for departure and zau almakan said o my brother as soon as the army is complete and the arabs have come in from all parts we will march forth so he bade make ready the commissariat and prepare munitions of war and went in to his wife who was now five months gone with child and he put under her astrologers and mathematicians to whom he appointed stipends and allowances then he set out three months after the arrival of the army of syria and as soon as the arabs were come in and the troops were assembled from all directions and as he fared forth he was followed by the warriors and the united host now the name of the general of the daylam army was rustam and that of the general of the army of the turksfn383 bahram and zau al makan marched in mid host and on his right was his brother sharrkan and on his left the chamberlain his brotherinlaw so the squadrons broke up and pushed forward and the battalions and companies filed past in battle array till the whole army was in motion they ceased not to fare on for the space of a month and each body dismounted at its own ground and there rested every week three days for the host was great and they advanced in this order till they came to the country of the greeks then the people of the villages and hamlets and the poorer sort took fright at them and fled to constantinople but when king afridun heard the tidings he arose and betook himself to zat aldawahi the same who had contrived the stratagem and had travelled to baghdad and had slain king omar bin alnuuman and who after carrying off her slaves and queen sophia had returned with them all to her native land now when she had been restored to her son the king of greece and felt herself safe she said to king hardub cool thine eyes for i have avenged by blood the shame of thy daughter abrizah and have killed omar bin alnuuman and have brought back sophia so now let us go to the king of constantinople and carry to him his daughter and acquaint him with what hath happened that all of us be on guard and prepare our forces and i will fare with thee to king afridun lord of constantinople for i opine that the moslems will not await our attack said hardub tarry thou till they draw near our country that we may make us ready meantime and assemble our power accordingly they took to levying their forces and preparing for war and when the news of the moslems advance reached them they were prepared for defence and zat al dawahi had preceded them now when she and her son arrived at constantinople the king of kings afridun hearing of the approach of hardub king of the greeks came forth to meet him and asked how it was with him and the cause of his visit so hardub acquainted him with the cunning doings of his mother zat aldawahi how she had slain the moslem king and recovered from him queen sophia and had said the moslems have assembled their forces and are on their way to attack us wherefore it behoveth that we two join hands in single band and meet them now king afridun rejoiced in the return of his daughter and the killing of king omar bin alnuuman and he sent to all countries seeking succour and acquainting the folk with the cause of slaying the moslem king so the nazarene troops flocked to him and three months were not past ere the army of the greeks was complete besides which there joined themselves to him franks from all their lands french germansfn384 and ragusansfn385 with men of zarafn386 venetians genoese and all the hosts of the yellow facesfn387 and when the gathering was at its full earth was straitened on them by reason of their multitude then afridun the great king ordered a march so they set out and ceased not to defile through the city for ten days they fared on till they reached the wady highs alnuuman a broad sided vale hard by the salt sea where they halted three days and on the fourth they were about to set out again when news came that the army of alislam on them press and the defenders of the faith of mohammed of men the best so they halted in it other three days and on the eighth they espied a dust cloud which towered till it walled the whole land nor was an hour of the day past ere that dust began to drift and was torn to shreds in the lift and pierced through its shades the starry radiance of lance and the white levee of blades presently there appeared beneath it the banners islamitan and the ensigns mahometan the horsemen urged forward like the letting loose of seas that surged clad in mail as they were mackerelback clouds which the moon enveil whereupon the two hosts clashed like two torrents on each other dashed eyes fell upon eyes and the first to seek combat singular was the wazir dandan he and the army of syria numbering thirty thousand bridles and with him were the general of the turks and the general of daylam rustam and bahram amid twenty thousand horse behind whom came the men from the shores of the salt sea clad in iron mail as they were full moons that past through a night oercast then the nazarene host called out on jesus and mary and the defiledfn388 cross and they heaped themselves upon the wazir dandan and those with him of the syrian host now all this was in pursuance of a stratagem devised by that ancient woman zat aldawahi for before his departure king afridun had gone in to her and asked her how shall i do and what plan shall i pursue it is thou hast caused this great distress to us and she had answered o great king and mighty cohenfn389 i will teach thee a trick would baffle iblis himself though he summon to his assistance all his grisly hosts—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the eightyninth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king all this was a stratagem of the ancient woman for that the king before his departure had gone to her and asked how shall i do and what plan shall i pursue it is thou hast caused this great distress to us and she had answered o great king and mighty cohen i will teach thee a trick would baffle the devil himself though he summon to his assistance all his grisly hosts it is that thou send fifty thousand men going down in ships and sailing over the sea to the mountain of smoke and there let them land and stir not till he standards of alislam come upon thee when do thou up and at them then bid the troops from the seaward sally out upon the moslems and take them in rear whilst we confront them from the landward so not one of them shall escape and our sorrows shall tease and peace abide with us now the counsel of this ancient woman commended itself to king afridun and he replied right is the recking thou reckest o princess of wits and recourse of kings and cohens warring for their blood wit so when the army of alislam came upon them in chat valley before they knew of it the flames began to burn up the tents and the swords in mens bodies to make rents then hurried up the army of baghdad and khorasan who numbered one hundred and twenty thousand horse with zau almakan in the front of war when the host of the infidels that lay by the sea saw them they sallied out against them and followed in their tracks and when zau al makan espied this he cried out to his men turn back to the infidels o people of the chosen apostle and slay those who deny and hate the authority of the compassionating the compassionate so they turned and fought with the christians then sharrkan marched up with another corps of the moslem host some hundred thousand men whilst the infidels numbered nigh upon a thousand and six hundred thousand men when the moslems were united their hearts were strengthened and they cried out saying verily allah hath pro mised us victory and to the infidels hath assigned defeat and they clashed together with sword and spear now sharrkan tare through rank and row and raged among the masses of the foe fighting so fierce a fight as to make children grey grow nor did he cease tourneying among the infidel horde and working havoc among them with the keen edged sword shouting allaho akbar allah is most great till he drove back the host to the coast then failed the force of the foe and allah gave victory to the faith of alislam and folk fought folk drunken without strong drink till they slew of the infidels in this affair forty and five thousand while of the moslems but three thousand and five hundred fell moreover the lion of the faith king sharrkan and his brother zau almakan slept not that night but occupied themselves with congratulating their braves and with looking to the wounded and with assuring the army of victory and salvation and promise of reward in the world to come thus far concerning the moslem but as regards king afridun lord of constantinople and sovran of roum and zat aldawahi they assembled the emirs of the host and said to them verily we had worked our will and solaced our hearts but our over confidence in our numbers and that only defeated us then quoth to them the ancient one the lady of calamities in very sooth nought shall profit you except ye draw you nigh unto the messiah and put your trust in the true belief for by the virtue of the messiah the whole strength of the moslem host lieth in that satan king sharrkan tomorrow said king afridun i have resolved to draw up in battle array and to send out against them that redoubtable cavalier lúká bin shamlút for if king sharrkan come forth as a champion to fight single handed our man will slay him and will slay the other moslem knights till not one is left and i purpose this night to sacre you all with the holy incense when the emirs heard these words they kissed the ground before him now the incense which he designated was the excrement of the chief patriarch the denier the defiler of the truth and they sought for it with such instance and they so highly valued it that the high priests of the greeks used to send it to all the countries of the christians in silken wraps after mixing it with musk and ambergris hearing of it kings would pay a thousand gold pieces for every dram and they sent for and sought it to fumigate brides withal and the chief priests and the great kings were wont to use a little of it as collyrium for the eyes and as a remedy in sickness and colic and the patriarchs used to mix their own skitefn390 with it for that the skite of the chief patriarch could not suffice for ten countriesfn391 so as soon as dawn was seen and the morning shone with its shine and sheen the horsemen ran to their spears full keen and king afridun—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the ninetieth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king as soon as dawn was seen and the morning shone with its shine and sheen the horsemen ran to their spears full keen and king afridun summoned his chief knights and nobles and invested them with dresses of honour and drawing the sign of the cross on their brows incensed them with the incense which as aforesaid was the skite of the chief patriarch the cohen the heresiarch this incensing done he called for luka bin shamlut surnamed the sword of the messiah and after fumigating him and rubbing his palate with the holy merde caused him to snuff it and smeared his cheeks and anointed his moustaches with the rest now there was no stouter champion in the land of roum than this accursed luka nor any better at bending of bow or sway of sword or lunge with lance on the day of devoir but he was foul of favour for his face was as the face of an ass his shape that of an ape and his look as the look of a malignant snake his presence was grievouser than parting from the beloved make and blacker than night was his blackness and more fetid than the lion was his breath for foulness more crooked than a bow was his crookedness and grimmer than the leopard was his ugliness and he was branded with the mark of the infidels on facefn392 after this he came up to king afridun and kissed his feet and stood before him and the king said to him i desire thou go out against sharrkan king of damascus son of omar bin alnuuman and deliver us from this affliction quoth luka hearkening and obedience and the king made the sign of the cross on his forehead and felt assured of help from heaven being near hand then luka went out from the presence and the accursed one mounted a sorrel horse he was clad in a red robe and a hauberk of gold set with jewels and he bore a trident spear as he were iblis the damned on the day of drewing out his hosts war to darraign then he rode forward he and his horde of infidels even as though they were driving to the fire preceded by a herald crying aloud in the arabic tongue and saying ho sect of mohammed upon whom be salutation and salvation let none of you come out but your champion sharrkan the sword of alislam lord of damascus in shámfn393 nor had he made an end of speaking when arose a tumult in the plain all the people heard the strain and the whole moving bodies of the armies twain called to mind the day of complain then the cowards trembled and all necks turned towards the sound and lo it was king sharrkan son of king omar bin alnuuman for when his brother zau almakan saw that accursed one push out on the plain and heard the pursuivant he turned to sharrkan and said to him of a surety they seek for thee said he should it so be twere most pleasing to me so when they made sure of the matter and heard the herald crying in the plain let none of you come out against me save sharrkan they knew this cursed luka to be champion of the land of roum who had sworn to sweep the earth clean of moslems now he was one of the greatest of villains a wretch who caused hearts to pain and the dayiamites turks and kurds dreaded his might and main presently sharrkan crave at him like a lion angry grim mounted on a courser like a wild gazelle flying snell and slim and coming nigh to him made the spear he hent to shake as it were a darting snake and recited these couplets

i have a sorrel steed whose pride is fain to bear the rein 
             shall give thee what thou likest not and make thee feel his
             main
i have a handy limber spear full bright and keen of point  upon
             whose shaft the dam of death her throny seat hath taen
i have a trenchant glaive of hind and when i bare its face  of
             scabbard veil from out its brow the rays of levee rain

luka understood not the sense of his speech nor did he apprehend the vehemence of the verse but he smote his forehead with his hand in honour of the cross drawn thereon and kissed it then he couched his throw spear and ran at sharrkan but first he tossed the javelin with one hand in air to such height that it was lost to the spectators sight and catching it with the other hand as do the jugglers hurled it at sharrkan it flew from his grasp like a shooting star and folk clamoured and feared for sharrkan but as the spear flew near him he put out his hand and caught it in full flight to the amazement of all who saw the sight then he shook it with the hand that took it till it was well nigh broken and hurled it so high into the welkin that it disappeared from view as it descended he caught it again with the other hand in less than the twinkling of an eye and cried out from his heart core saying by the truth of him who created the sevenfold skies i will assuredly make this cursed wight a byword for mankind to despise then threw he the throw spear at luka who thought to do as sharrkan had done and put forth his hand to trend it in mid flight but sharrkan prevented him and sped at him a second throw spear which smote him and the point fell on his forehead in the very centre of the sign of the cross and allah hurried his soul to the fire and dwelling place direfn394 but when the infidels saw luka bin shamlut fall slain they buffeted their faces and they cried alas and woe worth the day and called for aid upon the abbots of the monasteries—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the ninetyfirst night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the infidels saw luka bin shamlut fall slain they buffeted their faces and cried alas and woe worth the day and called upon the abbots of the monasteries and cried where be the crosses so the religious offered up prayers and the christians all drew together against sharrkan and brandishing their scymitars and lances rushed forward to the attack then army met army and breasts fell under hoof whilst spear and sword ruled the day and forearms and wrists grew weak and the coursers seemed created without legsfn395 nor did the herald ofwar cease calling to fight till arms were aweary and day took flight and night came on with darkness dight so the two hosts drew apart whilst every brave staggered like a drunken knave for that with so much cut and thrust they strave and the place was choked with the slain fell were the wounds and the hurt knew not by whom they fell then sharrkan joined his brother zau almakan and the chamberlain and the wazir dandan and said to them verily allah hath opened a door for the infidels to fall praised be the lord of the worlds one and all replied zau almakan let us never cease to praise allah for that he hath dispelled trouble from the arab and the ajam indeed the folk generation after generation shall tell of thy derring do against the accursed luka the falsifier of the evangelfn396 of thy catching the throng spear in midflight and how the enemy of allah among men thou didst smite and thy fame shall endure until the end of time then said sharrkan harkye o grand chamberlain and doughty capitayne and he answered adsumfn397 quoth sharrkan take with thee the wazir dandan and twenty thousand horse and lead them seven parasangs towards the sea and force the march till ye shall have come near the shore and there remain only two parasangs between thee and the foe then ambush ye in the hollows of the ground till ye hear the tumult of the infidels disembarking from their ships and the war cry from every side strike your ear and ye know that the sabres have begun labour between us and them and whenso ye see our troops falling back as if defeated and all the infidels following them as well those in front as those from the seaward and the tents do ye still lie in wait for them but as soon as ye see the standard with the words there is no god but the god and mohammed is gods apostle on whom be salutation and salvation then up with the green banner and do your endeavour and fall on their rear and shout alla ho akbar allah is most great and circle round that they may not interpose between the retreating army and the sea he replied to hear is to obey and forthright they agreed upon this matter and they went forth now the chamberlain took with himself the wazir dandan and twenty thousand men even as sharrkan had commanded as soon as dawned the morn the troops sprung to horse when they had donned their armour gear and drawn the scymitar and slung the spear then the christians dispread themselves over hill and dale and the ecclesiastsfn398 cried out and all heads were bared and those in the ships hoisted the cross at their mast heads and began making for shore from every side and landed their horses and get them ready for fight and fray whilst the sword blades glittered bright and the javelins glanced like levee light on mail shirt white and all joined fight and the grind mill of death whirled round and ground those who fought from horse and aground heads from bodies flew end tongues mute grew and eyes no vision knew scymitars strave with utmost strain and heads flew over the battle plain gall bladders crave and wrists were shorn in twain steeds plashed in pools of gore and beards were gripped right sore the host of alislam called out saying on the prince of mankind be blessings and peace and to the compassionate glory and praise which neer shall cease for his boons which aye increase and the host of the infidels shouted glory to the cross and the belt and the vine press juice and the wine presser and the priests and the monks and the festival of palms and the metropolitan now zau almakan and sharrkan held back and their troops gave way and feigned flight from before the enemy while the infidel array pressed hard upon them deeming them in rout and made ready to foin and hew then the meiny of the moslems raised their voices reciting the first verses of the chapter of the cowfn399 whilst the dead were trampled under hoofs of steeds and the heralds of the greeks cried out ho servants of the messiah ho people of the true faith ho followers of the primatefn400 verily divine grace upon you opes for see the hosts of al islam like birds with broken wings incline to elope so turn ye not to them your backs but let your swords cleave deep in their necks and hold not your hands from them else are ye outcasts from the messiah marys son who spoke even when a cradled onefn401 now afridun king of constantinople deemed that the infidels were victorious knowing not that this was but a clever stratagem of the moslems and sent to king hardub of roum congratulations on success adding availed us naught but the holy merde of the arch patriarch whose fragrance exhaled from the beards and mustachios of the slaves of the cross near and far and i swear by the miracles of the messiah and by thy daughter abrizah the nazarene the mariolater and by the waters of baptism that i will not leave upon the earth a single defender of al islam and to the bitter end will i carry out this plan so the messenger betook himself with the address to king hardub whilst the infidels called to one another saying take we vengeance wreak for luka—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the ninetysecond night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the infidels called to one another saying take we vengeance wreak for luka while hardub king of greece cried aloud ho to our revenge for abrizah thereupon king zau almakan shouted ho servants of the requiting king smite the children of denial and disobedience with the blanch of sword and the brown of spear so the moslems returned to the infidels and plied them with the keen edged scymitar whilst their herald cried aloud up and at the foes of the faith all ye who love the prophet elect with hope of salvation on the day of fear to win favour of the bountiful the forgiving one for verily the garden of paradise is under the shadow of swords and behold sharrkan and his men charged down upon the infidels and cut off their retreat and wheeled and tourneyed among the ranks when lo a knight of goodly presence opened a passage through the army of unbelievers and circled hither and thither amongst the deniers cutting and thrusting and covering the ground with heads and trunks so that the faithless feared him and their necks bent under his lunge and hew he was girt with two swords his glances and his brand and he was armed with two lances one of bamboo cane and the other his straight wand like shape and his flowing hair stood him in stead of many warriors even as saith the poet

laud not long hairfn402 except it be dispread  in two fold
            locks on day of fight and fray
oer youth who bears his lance twixt flank and thigh  from
             many a whis kered knight to win the day
and as singeth another

i say to him what while he slings his sword  for sword shall
             serve those looks that sword like show
says he my sabre looks for those i love  my sword for those
             who sweets of love unknow

when sharrkan saw him he said to him i conjure thee by the koran and the attributes of the compassionate one o champion of the champions tell me who thou art for verily by thy deeds this day thou hast pleased the requiting king whom one thing distracteth not from other thing in that thou hast been discomforting the children of impiety and in rebellion revelling then cried the cavalier to him saying thou art he who madest brother covenant with me but yesterday how quickly thou hast forgotten me thereupon he withdrew his mouth veilfn403 so that what was hidden of his beauty was disclosed and lo it was none other than zau almakan then sharrkan rejoiced in his brother save that he feared for him the rush of fighting and the crush of braves a smiting and this for two reasons the first his tender age and exposure to the evil eye and the second that his safety was to the kingdom the greater of the two overshadowing wings so he said to him o king thou riskest thy life so join thy steed to mine in very sooth i fear for thee from the foe and better thou stint hazarding thyself forth of these squadrons that we may shoot at the enemy thine unerring shaft quoth zau almakan i desire to even thee in fray and i will not be niggard of myself before thee in the melay then the host of alislam heaping itself upon the infidels girt them on all sides warred on them a right holy war and brake the power of the children of impiety and pride and stowre but king afridun sighed when he saw the evil wreak that had fallen on the greek and they turned their backs from fight and addressed themselves to flight making for the ships when lo there came out upon them from the seacoast another host led by the minister dandan the champion who was wont to make champions bite the dust and to lay load on them with cut and thrust nor less came forth the emir bahram lord of the provinces of sham amid twenty thousand horse doughty of arm and the host of alislam pressed them in front and on flank and wrought them grievous harm then a body of the moslems turned against those who in the ships remained and perdition on them rained till they threw themselves into the main and they slew of them many slain more than a hundred thousand noblemen nor was one of their champions great or small saved from bale and bane moreover they took their ships with all the money and treasure and cargo save a score of keel and the moslems got that loot whose like was never gotten in by gone years nor was such cut and thrust ever heard of by mens earsfn404 now amongst the booty were fifty thousand horses besides treasure and spoil past reckoning and arithmetic whereat the moslems rejoiced with an exceeding joy for that allah had given them victory and protection such was the case with them but as regards the fugitive infidels they soon reached constantinople whither the tidings preceded them that king afridun had prevailed over the moslems so quoth the ancient dame zat aldawahi i know that my son hardub king of roum is no runagate and that he feareth not the islamitic hosts but will restore the whole world to the nazarene faith then she bade the great king afridun give command that the city be decorated and the people held festival high and drank their wines drunkenly and knew not the decrees of destiny now whilst they were in the midst of their rejoicings behold the raven of dule and downfall croaked over them and up came the twenty fugitive ships wherein was the king of cæsarea so king afridun lord of constantinople met them on the sea shore and they told him all that had befallen them from the moslem and they wept sore and groaned and moaned and rejoicing at weal was turned into dismay for unheal and they informed him concerning luka son of shamlut how calamity had betided him and how death had shot him with his shaft thereat the horrors of doomday rose upon king afridunfn405 and he knew that there was no making straight their crook then came up from them the sound of weeping and wailing the city was full of men mourning and the keepers were keening and sighs and cries were heard from all sides and when king hardub of greece met king afridun he told him the truth of the case and how the flight of the moslems was by way of stratagem and deceit and said to him look not to see any of the army save those who have already reached thee when king afridun heard these words he fell down in a fainting fit with his nose under his feet and as soon as he revived he exclaimed surely the messiah was wroth with them that he caused the moslems to prevail over them then came the arch patriarch sadly to the king who said to him o our father annihilation hath overtaken our army and the messiah hath punished us replied the patriarch grieve not nor feel concerned for it cannot be but that one of you have sinned against the messiah and all have been punished for his offence but now we will read prayers for you in the churches that the mohammeden hosts may be repelled from you after which the old woman zat aldawahi came to afridun and said to him o king verily the moslem hosts are many and we shall never overcome them save by wile wherefore i purpose to work upon them by guile and repair to this army of alislam haply i may win my wish of their leader and slay their champion even as i slew his father if my stratagem succeed in his case not one of the host he leads shall return to his native land for all are strong only because of him but i desire to have some christian dwellers of syria such as go out every month and year to sell their goods that they may help me for this they can do in carrying out my plan replied the king be it so whenever thou wilt so she bade fetch an hundred men natives of najránfn406 in sham and the king asked them have ye not heard what hath befallen the christians with the moslems yes answered they and he rejoined know ye that this woman hath devoted her life to the messiah and purposeth to go forth with you disguised as monotheists and mohammedans to work out a device which shall profit us and hinder the moslem from us say then are ye also willing to devote yourselves to the anointed and i will give you a quintal of goldfn407 he of you who escapeth shall have the money and him of you who dieth will the messiah reward o king replied they we will devote our lives to the messiah and we will be thy sacrifice thereupon the old woman took all she required of aromatic roots and placed them in water which she boiled over the fire till the black essence of them was extracted she waited till the decoction was cold then dipped the corner of a long kerchief therein and stained her face therewith moreover she donned over her clothes a long gaberdine with an embroidered border and took in her hand a rosary and afterwards went in to king afridun who knew her not nor did any of his companions know her till she discovered herself to them and there was none in the assembly but who thanked and praised her for her cunning and her son rejoiced and said may the messiah never fail thee thereupon she took with her the syrian christians and set out for the army of baghdad— and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the ninetythird night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when king afridun heard these words he fell into a fainting fit with his nose under his feet and as soon as he revived fear fluttered the scrotumfn408 below his belly and he complained to the ancient dame zat aldawahi now this accursed old woman was a witch of the witches past mistress in sorcery and deception wanton and wily deboshed and deceptious with foul breath red eyelids yellow cheeks dull brown face eyes bleared mangy body hair grizzled back humped skin withered and wan and nostrils which ever ran but she had studied the scriptures of alislam and had made the pilgrimage to the holy house of meccah and all this that she might come to the knowledge of the mohammedan ordinances and the miraculous versets of the koran and she had professed judaism in the holy city of jerusalemfn409 for two years space that she might master the magic of men and demons so that she was a plague of plagues and a pest of pests wrong headed as to belief and to no religion fief now the chief reason of her sojourn with her son king hardub of greece was on account of the slave virgins at his court for she was given to tribadismfn410 and could not exist without sapphism or she went mad so if any damsel pleased her she was wont to teach her the art of rubbing clitoris against clitoris and would anoint her with saffronfn411 till she fainted away for excess of volupty whoso obeyed her she was wont to favour and make her son incline towards her but whoso repelled her she would contrive to destroy and so she abode for a length of time this was known to marjanah and rayhánah and utrijah the handmaids of abrizah and their princess loathed the old woman and abhorred to lie with her because of the rank smell from her armpits the stench of her fizzles more fetid than carrion and the roughness of her hide coarser than palm fibre she was wont to bribe those who rubbed parts with her by means of jewels and instructions but abrizah held aloof from her and sought refuge with the omnipotent the omniscient for by allah right well quoth the poet

ho thou who grovellest low before the great  nor over fording
             lesser men dost blench
who gildest dross by dirham gathering  no otter scent disguises
             carrion stench

and now to return to the story of her stratagem and the woes of her working presently she departed taking the chief nazarenes with their hosts and turned towards the army of the moslems whereupon king hardub went in to king afridun and said to him o king we have no need of the chief patriarch nor of his prayers but will consult my mothers counsel and observe what she will do with her craft unending against the moslem hosts for these are marching with all their power they will soon be upon us and they will encircle us on all sides when king afridun heard this terror took hold upon his heart and he wrote letters without stay or delay to all the nations of the nazarenes saying it behoveth none of the messiahites or cross knights to hold back especially the folk of the strongholds and forts but let them all come to us foot and horse women and children for the moslem hosts already tread our soil so haste haste ye ere what we fear to us here appear thus much concerning them but regarding the work of the old woman zat aldawahi when she went forth from the city with her suite she clad them in the clothing of moslem merchants having provided herself with an hundred mules carrying stuffs of antioch such as goldwoven satins and royal brocades and so forth and she had taken a letter from king afridun to the following effect these be merchantmen from the land of sham who have been with us so it besitteth none to do them harm or hindrance nor take tax and tithe of them till they reach their homes and safe places for by merchants a country flourisheth and these are no men of war nor of ill faith then quoth the accursed zat aldawahi to those with her verily i wish to work out a plot for the destruction of the moslem replied they o queen command us whatso thou wilt we are at thy disposal and may the messiah never disappoint thy dealings then she donned a gown of fine white wool and rubbed her forehead till she made a great mark as of a scar and anointed it with an ointment of her own fashion so that it shone with prodigious sheen now the old hag was lean bodied and hollow eyed and she bound her legs tightly round with cordsfn412 just above her feet till she drew near the moslem camp when she unwound them leaving their marks deeply embedded in her ankles then she anointed the wheels with dragons blood and bade her companions beat her with a severe beating and set her in a chest and quoth she cry abroad the refrain of unityfn413 nor fear from it aught of damage replied they how can we beat thee who be our sovereign lady zat aldawahi mother of the king we glory in then said she we blame not nor deal reproach to him who goeth to the jakes and in need evil becometh good deed when ye have set me in the chest take it and make it one of the bales and place it on mule back and fare forth with it and the other goods through the moslem camp and fear ye no blame and if any of the moslems hinder you give up the mules and their lading and be take yourselves to their king zau almakan and implore his protection saying we were in the land of the infidels and they took nothing from us but wrote us a passport that none shall do us hindrance or work our mischance if he ask you what profit had ye of your property in the land of roum answer him we profited in the deliverance of a pious man who had been bound down in an underground cell nigh fifteen years crying out for help yet none helped him nay the infidels tortured him night and day we knew not this but after we had tarried in constantinople for some time having sold our goods and bought others in their stead we determined on and made ready for a return to our native land we spent that night conversing about our journey and when day broke we saw figured upon the wall a human form and as we drew nigh it behold it moved and said o moslems is there amongst you one who is minded to woo the favour of the lord of the three worldsfn414 how so asked we and the figure answered know that allah hath made me speak to you to the intent that your faith be fortified and that your belief embolden you and that you may go forth of the country of the infidels and repair to the moslem host for with them wones the sword of the com passionate one of our age the champion king sharrkan by whom he shall conquer constantinople town and destroy the sect of the nazarene and when ye shall have journeyed three days you will find an hermitage known as the hermitage of the ascetic matruhinafn415 and containing a cell visit it with pure intent and contrive to arrive there by force of will for therein is a religious from the holy city jerusalem by name abdullah and he is one of the devoutest of mankind endowed with the power of working saintly miraclesfn416 such as dispel doubts and obscurity certain of the monks seized him by fraud and shut him up in a souterrain where he hath lain a long time by his deliverance you will please the lord of faithful men for such release is better than fighting for the faith now when the ancient dame and those with her had agreed upon such words she said as soon as that which i impart shall reach the ears of king sharrkan say him further hearing this from that image we knew that the holy man—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the ninetyfourth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the old woman zat aldawahi and those with her had agreed upon such words she said now as soon as that which i impart shall reach the ears of king sharrkan say him further hearing these words from that image we knew that the holy man was indeed of the chiefest devotees and allahs servants of purest qualities so we made three days march till we came in sight of that hermitage and then we went up to it and passed the day in buying and selling as is the wont of merchants as soon as day had departed our sight and night was come to darken light we repaired to the cell wherein was the dungeon and we heard the holy man after chanting some verses of the koran repeat the following couplets

my heart disheartened is my breast is strait  and sinks my
            soul in sea of bale and bate
unless escape be near i soon shall die  and death were better
             than this doleful strait
o lightning an thou light my home and folk  an their still
             brighter charms thy shine abate
say what my path to meet them being barred  by wars and
             barricadod succours gate

when once ye have brought me into the moslem camp and i mix with them you shall see the old woman continued how i will make shift to beguile them and slay them all even to the last man the nazarenes hearing whet she said kissed her hands and set her in the chest after they had beaten her with a grievous beating in obedience to her commands for they saw it was incumbent on them to do her bidding in this then they all made for the moslem host as hath erst been said such was the case with the damned hag zat aldawahi and her companions but as regards the mohammeden army they indeed after allah had given them victory over their enemies and they had plundered everything in the ships of money and hoards all sat down to converse with one another and zau almakan said to his brother sharrkan verily allah hath granted us to prevail because of our just dealing and discipline and concord amongst ourselves wherefore continue o sharrkan to obey my commandment in submission to allah be he exalted and extolled for i mean to slay ten kings in blood revenge for my sire to cut the throat of fifty thousand greeks and to enter constantinople replied sharrkan my life be thy ransom against death needs must i follow out the holy war though i wone many a year in their country but i have o my brother in damascus a daughter named kuzia fakan whom i love heartily for she is one of the marvels of the time and she will soon be of age said zau almakan and i also have left my wife with child and near her time nor do i know what allah will vouchsafe me by her but promise me o my brother that if allah bless me with a son thou wilt grant me thy daughter for wife to him and make covenant with me and pledge me thy faith thereon with love and good will replied sharrkan and stretching out his hand to his brother he said if she bring thee a son i will give him my daughter kuzia fakan to wife at this zau almakan rejoiced and they fell to congratulating each other on the victory over the enemy and the wazir dandan also congratulated the two brothers and said to them know o ye kings that allah hath given us the victory for that we have devoted our lives to him be he exalted and ex tolled and we have left our homes and households and it is my counsel that we follow up the foe and press upon him and harass him so haply allah shall enable us to win our wishes and we shall destroy our enemies branch and root if it please you do ye go down in these ships and sail over the sea whilst we fare forward by land and bear the brunt of battle and the thrust of fight and the minister dandan ceased not to urge them to combat and repeated his words who said

to slay my foes is chiefest bliss i wist  and on the coursers
            back be borne a list
comes promising tryst a messenger from friend  full oft when
            comes the friend withouten tryst
and these words of another

war for my mother an i live ill take  spear for my brother
           scymitar for sire
with every shag haired brave who meets his death  smiling till
           won from doom his dear desire

and when the wazir ended his verses he said praise be to him who aided us dear victory to uphold and who hath given us spoil of silver and fine gold then zau almakan commanded the army to depart and they fared on forcing their marches for constantinople till they came to a wide and spacious champaign full of all things fair and fain with wild cattle frisking and gazelles pacing to and fro across the plain now they had traversed great deserts and drink had been six days cut off from them when they drew near this meadow and saw therein waters founting and ripe fruits daunting and that land as it were paradise for it had donned its adornments and decked itselffn417 gently waved the branches of its trees drunken with the new wine of the dew and combined with the nectar of tasnim the soft breathings of the morning breeze mind and gazer were confounded by its beauty even as saith the poet

behold this lovely garden tis as though  spring oer its
           frame her greeny cloak had spread
looking with fleshly eyne thou shalt but sight  a lake whose
            waters balance in their bed
but look with spirit eyes and lo shalt see  glory in every
           leaf oerwaves thy head

and as another saith

the streams a cheek by sunlight rosy dyed  whose downfn418
          is creeping shade of tamarisk stems
round legs of tree trunks waveless roll in rings  silvern and
           blossoms are the diadems

when zau almakan saw this champaign with its trees bowing and its flowers blooming and its birds warbling he called to his brother sharrkan and said o my brother verily in damascus is naught the like of this place we will not march from it save after three days that we may take rest ourselves and that the army of alislam may regain strength and their souls be fortified to encounter the blamed infidels so they halted therein and while camping behold they heard a noise of voices from afar and zau almakan asked the cause thereof and was answered that a caravan of merchants from the land of syria had halted there to rest and that the moslem troops had come on them and had haply seized something of the goods which they had brought from the country of the infidels after a while up came the merchants crying out and appealing to the king for aidance when zau al makan saw this he bade them be brought before him and when in presence they said to him o king we have been in the country of the infidels and they plundered us of nothing why then do our brothers the moslems despoil our goods and we in their own land of a truth when we saw your troops we went up to them and they robbed us of what we had with us and we have now reported to thee all that hath befallen us thereupon they brought out to him the letter of the king of constantinople and sharrkan read it and said we will presently restore to you what hath been taken from you but yet it behoveth you not to carry merchandise to the country of the infidels replied they o our lord in very sooth allah despatched us thither that we might win what gházifn419 never won the like of not even thou in all thy razzias asked sharrkan what was it ye won o king answered they we will not tell thee save in private for if this matter be noised among the folk haply it may come to the ears of somefn420 and this will be the cause of our ruin and of the ruin of all moslems who resort to the land of the greeks now they had hidden the chest wherein was the damned zat al dawahi so zau almakan and his brother brought them to a private place where they laid bare to both of them the story of the devotee and wept till they made the two kings weep—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the ninetyfifth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the nazarenes who wore merchants weed when brought to a private place by zau almakan and his brother sharrkan laid bare to both of them the story of the devotee and wept till they made the two kings weep and repeated to them all which had been taught by the old witch zat aldawahi thereupon sharrkans heart yearned to the devotee and he was moved to ruth for him and was fired with zeal for the service of almighty allah so quoth he to them did ye rescue this holy man or is he still in the hermitage quoth they we delivered him and slew the hermit fearing for our lives after which we made haste to fly for dread of death but a trusty man told us that in this hermitage are quintals of gold and silver and stones of price then they fetched the chest and brought out the accursed old woman as she were a cassia podfn421 for excess of blackness and leanness and she was laden with the same fetters and shackles when zau almakan and the bystanders saw her they took her for a man of the best of allahs devotees and surpassing in pious qualities more especially because of the shining of her forehead for the ointment wherewith she had anointed her face so zau almakan and sharrkan wept sore then they rose up in honour and kissed her hands and feet sobbing aloud but she signed to them and said cease this weeping and hear my words hereat they dried their tears in obedience to her bidding and she said know ye both that i was content to accept what my lord did unto me for i kenned that the affliction which befel me was a trial from him be he exalted and extolled and whoso hath not patience under calamity and tribulation for him there is no coming to the delights of paradise i had indeed supplicated him that i might return to my native land not as a compensation for the sufferings decreed to me but that i might die under the horse hoofs of warriors fighting for the faith who being slain in fray live again without suffering deathfn422 then she repeated the following couplets

our fort is torfn423 and flames the fire of fight  moses
            art thou and this is time for aid
cast down thy rod twill swallow all they wrought  nor dread
            for men their ropes be vipers madefn424
for chapters read on fight day lines of foes  and on their
            necks grave versetsfn425 wi thy blade

when the old woman had ended her verse her eyes overflowed with tears and her forehead under the unguent shone like gleaming light and sharrkan rose and kissed her hand and caused food be brought before her but she refused it saying i have not broken my fast by day for fifteen years and how should i break it at such a time when my lord hath been bountiful to me in delivering me from the captivity of the infidels and removing from me that which was more grievous to me than torment of fire i will wait till sun down so when it was nightfall sharrkan and zau almakan came and served her with food and said eat o ascetic but she said this is no time for eating it is the time for worshipping the requiting king then she stood up in the prayer niche and remained praying till the night was spent and she ceased not to do after this fashion for three days and nights sitting not but at the time of the salám or salutationfn426 ending with several prayers when zau al makan saw her on this wise firm belief in her get hold of his heart and he said to sharrkan cause a tent of perfumed leather to be pitched for this religious and appoint a body servant to wait upon him on the fourth day she called for food so they brought her all kinds of meats that could seduce the sense or delight the sight but of all this she would eat only a scone with salt then she again turned to her fast and as the night came she rose anew to pray when sharrkan said to zau almakan verily this man carrieth renunciation of the world to the extreme of renouncing and were it not for this holy war i would join myself to him and worship allah in his service till i came before his presence and now i desire to enter his tent and talk with him for an hour quoth zau almakan and i also tomorrow we sally forth to fight against constantinople and we shall find no time like the present said the wazir dandan and i no less desire to see this ascetic haply he will pray for me that i find death in this holy war and come to the presence of my lord for i am aweary of the world so as soon as night had darkened they repaired to the tent of that witch zat aldawahi and seeing her standing to pray they drew near her and fell a weeping for pity of her but she paid no heed to them till midnight was past when she ended her orisons by pronouncing the salutation then she turned to them and after wishing them long life asked them wherefore come ye whereto they answered o thou holy man diddest thou not hear us weep around thee she rejoined to him who standeth in the presence of allah remaineth no existence in time either for hearing any or for seeing aught about him quoth they we would have thee recount to us the cause of thy captivity and pray for us this night for that will profit us more than the possession of constantinople now when she heard their words she said by allah were ye not the emirs of the moslems i would not relate to you aught of this at any time for i complain not but to allah alone however to you i will relate the circumstances of my captivity know then that i was in the saintly city of jerusalem with certain ecstatics and inspired men and did not magnify myself among them for that allah be he exalted and extolled had endowed me with humility and abnegation till i chanced to go down to the sea one night and walked upon the water then entered into me pride whence i know not and i said to myself who like me can walk the water and my heart from that time hardened and allah afflicted me with the love of travel so i journeyed to roum land and visited every part for a whole year and left no place but therein i worshiped allah when i came to this spotfn427 i clomb the mountain and saw there an hermitage inhabited by a monk called matrubina who when he sighted me came out and kissed my hands and feet and said verily i have seen thee since thou enteredst the land of the greeks and thou hast filled me with longing for the land of alislam then he took my hand and carried me into that hermitage and brought me to a dark room and when i entered it unawares he locked the door on me and left me there forty days without meat or drink for it was his intent to kill me by delay it chanced one day that a knight called dakianúsfn428 came to the hermitage accompanied by ten squires and his daughter tamásil a girl whose beauty was incom parable when they entered that hermitage the monk matruhina told them of me and the knight said bring him out for surely there is not on him a birds meal of meat so they opened the door of the dark room and found me standing in the niche praying and reciting the koran and glorifying allah and humbling myself before the almighty when they saw me in this state matrohina exclaimed this man is indeed a sorcerer of the sorcerers and hearing his words they all came in on me dakianus and his company withal and they beat me with a grievous beating till i desired death and reproached myself saying this is his reward who exalteth himself and who prideth himself on that which allah hath vouchsafed to him beyond his own competence and thou o my soul verily self esteem and arrogance have crept into thee dost thou not know that pride angereth the lord and hardeneth the heart and bringeth men to the fire then they laid me in fetters and returned me to my place which was the dungeon under ground every three days they threw me down a scone of barley bread and a draught of water and every month or two the knight came to the hermitage now his daughter tamasil had grown up for she was nine years old when i first saw her and fifteen years passed over me in captivity so that she had reached her four and twentieth year there is not in our land nor in the land of the greeks a fairer than she and her father feared lest the king take her from him for she had vowed herself to the messiah and rode with dakianus in the habit of a cavalier so that albeit none might compare with her in loveliness no one who saw her knew her for a woman and her father had laid up his monies in this hermitage every one who had aught of price or treasured hoard being wont to deposit it therein and i saw there all manner of gold and silver and jewels and precious vessels and rarities none may keep count of them save almighty allah now ye are worthier of these riches than those infidels so lay hands on that which is in the hermitage and divide it among the moslems and especially on fighters in the holy war when these merchants came to constantinople and sold their merchandise that image which is on the wall spoke to them by grace of a marvel which allah granted to me so they made for that hermitage and slew matruhina after torturing him with most grievous torments and dragging him by the beard till he showed them the place where i was when they took me and found no path but flight for dread of death now tomorrow night tamasil will visit that hermitage as is her habit and her father and his squires will come after her as he feareth for her so if ye would witness these things take me with you and i will deliver to you the monies and the riches of the knight dakianus which be in that mountain for i saw them bring out vessels of gold and silver to drink therefrom and i heard a damsel of their company sing to them in arabic and wellaway that so sweet a voice should not be busied in chaunting the koran if then ye will enter into that hermitage and hide there against the coming of dakianus and his daughter and take her for she is fit only for the king of the age sharrkan or king zau almakan thereat they all rejoiced with the exception of the wazir dandan who put scant faith in her story for her words took no hold on his reason and signs of doubt in her and disbelief showed in his facefn429 yet he was confounded at her discourse but he feared to speak with her for awe of the king then quoth the ancient dame zat aldawahi verily i fear lest the knight come and seeing these troops encamped in the meadow be afraid to enter the hermitage so zau almakan ordered the army to march upon constantinople and said i have resolved to take with me an hundred horse and many mules and make for that mountain where we will load the beasts with the monies which be in the hermitage then he sent at once for the chief chamberlain whom they brought into the presence and he summoned likewise the leaders of the turks and daylamites and said as soon as it is dawn do ye set forth for constantinople and thou o chamberlain shalt take my place in council and contrivance while thou o rustam shalt be my brothers deputy in battle but let none know that we are not with you and after three days we will rejoin you then he chose out an hundred of the doughtiest riders and he and sharrkan and the minister dandan set out for the hermitage and the hundred horsemen led the mules with chests for transporting the treasure—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the ninetysixth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that sharrkan and his brother zau almakan and the wazir dandan set off with an hundred horse for the hermitage described to them by that accursed zat aldawahi and they took with them mules and chests for transporting the treasure now as soon as dawned the morn the chamberlain signalled to the host an order for departure and they set out thinking that the two kings and the wazir were with them knowing not that the three had made for the monastery such was the case with the host but as regards the two kings and the minister they tarried in their place till the end of that day now the infidels who were with zat aldawahi took their departure privily after they had gone in to her and kissed her hands and feet and obtained her leave to march so she not only gave them permission but also taught them all she minded of wile and guile and when it was dark night she arose and went in to zau almakan and his companions and said to them come let us set out for the mountain and take with you a few men at arms they obeyed her and left five horsemen at the foot of the mountain whilst the rest rode on before zat aldawahi who gained new strength for excess of joy so that zau almakan said glory be to him who sustaineth this holy man whose like we never saw now the witch had written a letter to the king of constantinople and despatched it on the wings of a birdfn430 acquainting him with what had passed and ending i wish thee to send me ten thousand horsemen of the bravest of the greeks and let them steal along the foot of the mountains with caution lest the host of alislam get sight of them and when they reach the hermitage let them ambush themselves there till i come to them with the moslem king and his brother for i shall inveigle them and will bring them thither together with the wazir and an hundred horse and no more that i may presently deliver to them the crosses which be in the hermitage i am resolved to slay the monk matruhina since my scheme cannot be carried out but by taking his life if my plot work well not one of the moslems shall return to his own country no not a living wight nor one who blows the fire alight and matruhina shall be a sacrifice for the followers of the nazarene faith and the servants of the cross and praise be to the messiah first and last when this letter reached constantinople the keeper of the carrier pigeons carried it to king afridun who read it and forthwith inspected his host and equipped ten thousand cavaliers with horses and dromedaries and mules and provaunt and bade them repair to that hermitage and after reaching the tower to hide therein thus far concerning them but as regards king zau almakan and his brother sharrkan and the wazir dandan and the escort when they reached the hermitage they entered and met the monk matruhina who came out to see who and what they were whereupon quoth that pious man zat aldawahi slay this damned fellowfn431 so they smote him with their swords and made him drink the cup of death then the accursed old woman carried them to the place of offerings and ex votos and brought out to them treasures and precious things more than she had described to them and after gathering the whole together they set the booty in chests and loaded the mules therewith as for tamasil she came not she or her father for fear of the moslems so zau almakan tarried there awaiting her all that day and the next and a third till sharrkan said to him by allah i am troubled anent the army of alislam for i know not what is become of them his brother replied and i also am concerned for them we have come by this great treasure and i do not believe that tamasil or any one else will approach the hermitage after that befel which hath befallen the host of the christians it behoveth us then to content ourselves with what allah hath given us and depart so haply he will help us conquer constantinople accordingly they came down from the mountain while zat aldawahi was impotent to oppose their march for fear of betraying her deceit and they fared forwards till they reached the head of a defile where the old woman had laid an ambush for them with the ten thousand horse as soon as these saw the moslems they encircled them from all sides couching lance and baring the white sabre blade and the infidels shouted the watch word of their faithless faith and set the shafts of their mischief astring when zau almakan and his brother sharrkan and the minister dandan looked upon this host they saw that it was a numerous army and said who can have given these troops information of us replied sharrkan o my brother this be no time for talk this is the time for smiting with swords and shooting with shafts so gird up your courage and hearten your hearts for this strait is like a street with two gates though by the virtue of the lord of arabs and ajams were not the place so narrow i would bring them to naught even though they were an hundred thousand men said zau almakan had we wotted this we would have brought with us five thousand horse and the wazir dandan continued if we had ten thousand horse they had availed us naught in these narrows but allah will succour us against them i know this defile and its straitness and i know there be many places of refuge in it for i have been here on razzia with king omar bin alnuuman what while we besieged constantinople we abode in this place and here is water colder than snow so come let us push out of this defile ere the infidel host increase on us and get the start of us to the mountain top whence they will hurl down rocks upon us and we powerless to come at them so they began hurrying on to get out of those narrows but the pious man zat aldawahi looked at them and said what is it ye fear ye who have vowed yourselves to the lord and to working his will by allah i abode imprisoned underground for fifteen years yet never gainsaid the almighty in aught he did with me fight ye in allahs way so whoever of you is slain paradise shall be his abode and whoso slayeth his striving shall be to his honour when they heard from the ascetic these words their care and anxiety ceased from them and they stood firm till the infidels charged down from all sides whilst the swords played upon their necks and the cup of death went round amongst them the moslems fought for the service of allah a right good fight and wrought upon his foes with sway of sword and lunge of lance whilst zau almakan smote upon the men and garred the knights bite the dust and their heads from their bodies take flight five by five and ten by ten till he had done to death a number of them past numbering and an accompt beyond counting now while so doing he looked at the accursed old woman who was waving her sword and heartening them and all who feared fled to her for shelter but she was also signing the infidels to slay sharrkan so troop after troop rushed on him with design to do him die but each troop that charged he charged and drove back and when another troop attacked him he repelled the assault with the sword in their backs for he thought it was the devotees blessing that gave him the vic tory and he said in himself verily on this holy men allah looketh with eyes of his favour and strengtheneth my prowess against the infidels with the purity of his pious intent for i see that they fear me and cannot prevail against me but every one who assaileth me turneth tail and taketh flight so they battled the rest of the day and when night fell the moslems took refuge in a cave of that defile being weary with stress of war and cast of stone and that day were slain of them five and forty and when they were gathered together they sought the devotee but could find no trace of him and this was grievous to them and they said belike he hath died a martyr quoth sharrkan i saw him heartening the horsemen with divine instances and using as talisman verses of holy writ now while they were talking behold the accursed old woman zat aldawahi stood before them hending in hand the head of the chief captain of the ten thousand horse a noble knight a champion fierce in fight and a satan for blight one of the turks had slain him with an arrow and allah hurried his soul to the fire and when the infidels saw what that moslem had done with their leader they all fell on him and wrought his bane and hewed him in pieces with their swords and allah hurried his soul to heaven then the accursed old woman cut off that knights head and brought it and threw it at the feet of sharrkan and zau almakan and the wazir dandan now when sharrkan sew her he sprang up hastily before her and exclaimed praised be allah for thy safety and for our sighting thee o holy man and devout champion of the religion replied she o my son i have sought martyrdom this day and have thrown my life away amid the infidel array but they feared me with dismay when ye dispersed i waxed jealous for your honour so i rushed on the chief knight their leader albeit he was a match for a thousand horse and i smote him till i severed head from trunk not one of the infidels could near me so i brought his head to you—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the ninetyseventh night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the damned witch zat aldawahi took the head of the knight the leader of the twenty thousand infidels she brought it and threw it down before zau almakan and his brother sharrkan and the wazir dandan saying when i saw your condition i waxed jealous for your honour so i rushed on the chief knight and smote him with the sword till i severed head from trunk and none could near me so i brought his head to you that you may be strengthened in holy war and work out with your swords the will of the lord of the faithful and now i purpose leaving you to strive against the infidels whilst i go to your army though they be at the gates of constantinople and return with twenty thousand horse to destroy these unfaithfuls quoth sharrkan how wilt thou pass to them o thou holy man seeing that the valley is blocked up on all sides by the miscreants quoth the accursed hag allah will veil me from their eyes and they shall not sight mefn432 nor if any saw me would he dare to attack me at that time for i shall be as one non existing absorbed in allah and he will fend off from me his foes thou sayest sooth o holy man rejoined sharrkan for indeed i have been witness of that so if thou can pass out at the first of the night twill be best for us replied she i will set out at this very hour and if thou desire thou shalt go with me and none shall see thee furthermore if thy brother also have a mind to go with us we will take him but none else for the shadow of a saint can cover only twain sharrkan said as for me i will not leave my comrades but if my brother will there is no harm in his going with thee and setting us free of this strait for he is the stronghold of the moslems and the sword of the lord of the three worlds and if it be his pleasure let him take with him the wazir dandan or whom else he may elect and send us ten thousand horse to succour us against these caitiffs so after debate they agreed on this and the old woman said give me leisure to go before you and consider the condition of the infidels if they be asleep or awake quoth they we will not go forth save with thee and trust our affair to allah if i do your bidding replied she blame me not but blame yourselves for it is my rede that you await me till i bring you tidings of the case then said sharrkan go to them and delay not from us for we shall be awaiting thee thereupon she fared forth and sharrkan turned to his brother addressing him and said were not this holy man a miracle worker he had never slain yonder furious knight this is proof sufficient of the ascetics power and of a truth the pride of the infidels is laid low by the slaying of this cavalier for he was violent an evil devil and a stubborn now whilst they were thus devising of the mighty works of the devotee behold the accursed zat aldawahi came upon them and promised them victory over the unbelievers wherefor they thanked her not knowing that all this was wile and guile and the damned hag asked where be the king of the age zau almakan and the minister dandan answered he here am i take with thee thy wazir said she and follow after me that we may fare forth to constantinople now she had acquainted the infidels with the cheat she had put upon the moslems and they rejoiced with exceeding great joy and said our hearts will not be contented till we shall have slain their king in return for the knights death because we had no stouter rider than he and they added bespeaking the ill omened hag as she told them her plan of faring to the land of the moslems when thou bringest him to us we will bear him to king afridun then she went out and went out with her zau almakan and the minister dandan and she walked on before the two saying fare forth with the blessing of almighty allah so they did her bidding for the shaft of pate and fortune of mans lot had shot them and she ceased not leading them both through the midst of the grecian camp till they came to the defile the narrow pass aforesaid whilst the infidel enemy watched them but did them no hindrance for the infernal old woman had enjoined this now when zau almakan and the wazir dandan saw that the infidel host offered them no let and stay and yet had them in sight the wazir exclaimed by allah this is one of the holy mans saintly miracles and doubtless he be of the elect rejoined zau almakan by allah i think the infidels be naught but blind for we see them and they see us not and while they were thus praising the holy man and recounting his mighty works and his piety and his prayers behold the infidels charged down on them from all sides and surrounded them and seized them saying is there anyone else with you twain that we may seize upon him too and the wazir dandan replied see you not yon other man that is before us  replied the unbelievers by the truth of the messiah and the monks and the primate and the metropolitan we see none save you two then zau almakan said by allah this is a chastisement decreed to us by almighty allah—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the ninetyeighth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the unfaithful had seized upon king zau almakan and the wazir dandan they said to the two is there anyone else with you twain that we may seize upon him also and the wazir dandan replied see you not yon other man who be with us they rejoined by the truth of the messiah and the monks and the primate and the metropolitan we see none save you two then the infidels laid shackles on their feet and set men to guard them during the night whilst zat aldawahi fared on and disappeared from their sight so they fell to lamenting and saying to each other verily the opposing of pious men leadeth to greater distress than this and we are punished by the strait which hath befallen us so far concerning zau almakan and the wazir dandan but as regards king sharrkan he passed that night in the cavern with his comrades and when dawned the day and he had prayed the morn prayer he and his men made ready to do battle with the infidel and he heartened them and promised them all good then they sallied out till they were hard upon the unbelievers and when these saw them from afar they cried out to them saying o moslems we have taken captives your sultan and your wazir who hath the ordering of your affairs and except ye leave off fighting us we will slay you to the last man but an you yield yourselves we will take you to our king who will make peace with you on condition that you quit our country and return home and harm us in naught and we will do you no harm in aught if ye accept it will be well for you but if ye refuse there remaineth nothing for you but death so we have told you sooth and this is our last word to you now when sharrkan heard this and was certified of the captivity of his brother and the wazir dandan he was weighed down with woe and wept his force failed him and making sure of death he said to himself would i knew the cause of their capture did they fail of respect to the holy man or disobey him or what was the matter then they sprang up to battle with the unbelievers and slew great numbers of them the brave was known that day from craven men and sword and spear were dyed with bloody stain for the infidels flocked up on them as flies flock to drink from hill and from plain but sharrkan and his men ceased not to wage the fight of those who fear not to die nor let death hinder them from the pursuit of victory till the valley ran gore and earth was full of the slain she bore and when night fell the armies separated each making for his own place and the moslems returned to the cavern where gain and loss were manifest to them few remained of them and there was no dependence for them but on allah and the scymitar now there had been slain of them that day five and thirty men of the chiefest emirs and they had killed thousands of the infidels footmen and fighters on horse when sharrkan saw this the case was grievous to him and he asked his comrades what shall we do whereto all answered that which almighty allah willeth shall befal us on the morning of the second day sharrkan said to the remnant of his troop if ye go forth to fight not one of you will remain alive and we have but little left of food and water so i deem ye would do better to bare your brands and go forth and stand at the mouth of this cavern to hinder any from entering haply the holy man may have reached the moslem host and may return with ten thousand horses to succour us in fight with the infidels for belike the unfaithful may have failed to see him and those with him they said this were the better course to take and of its expediency no doubt we make so the troop went out and held the cavern mouth standing by its walls and every one of the infidels who sought to enter in they slew thus did they fend off the foe from the gape of the cave and they patiently supported all such assaults till day was done and night came on dusky and dun—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the ninetyninth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the army of the moslems held the cavern mouth and stood by its walls and they fended off the foe and every one of the infidels attempted to charge them him they slew and they patiently supported all such assaults till day was done and night came on dusky and dun by which time king sharrkan had only five and twenty men and no more left then quoth the infidels to one another when shall these battle days have an end we are weary of warring the moslems and quoth one of them up and at them for there remain of them but five and twenty men if we cannot prevail on them to fight let us light a fire upon themfn433 and if they submit themselves and yield to us we will take them prisoners but if they refuse we will leave them for fuel to the fire so shall they become to men of foreseeing mind a warning dire may the messiah on their fathers have no grace and may the sojourn of the nazarenes be for them no abiding place so they carried fuel to the jaws of the cavern and set fire to it thereupon sharrkan and his companions made sure of perdition and yielded themselves prisoners and while they were in this condition lo the knight their captain said to those who counselled their slaughter it is not for any save for king afridun to kill them that he may gratify his wrath therefore it behoveth us to keep them in durance by us till the morrow when we will journey with them to constantinople and deliver them to our king who shall deal with them as he please said they this is the right course and he commanded to pinion them and set guards over them then as soon as it was black night the infidels busied themselves with feasting and making festival and they called for wine and drank it till all fell upon their backs now sharrkan and his brother zau almakan were in confinement and so also were his companion knights whereupon the elder turned to the younger brother and said to him o my brother how win free by allah replied zau al makan i know not for here we be like birds in cage then sharrkan waxed wroth and sighed for excess of rage and stretched himself till his pinion bonds brass asunder whereupon being free he arose and went up to the captain of the guard and taking from his pocket the keys of the fetters freed zau almakan and the wazir dandan and the rest of his men then he turned to the two and said i desire to slay three of these infidels and take and don their dress we three so that we shall be guised as greeks and we will pass through them with out their knowing us and fare forth to our own force replied zau almakan this is no safe counsel for if we kill them i fear some of their comrades may hear their shrieks and the foe be aroused upon us and kill us twere the surer way to pass out of the defile so they agreed upon this and set out and when they had left the head of the strait a little distance behind they saw horses picketed and the riders sleeping and sharrkan said to his brother better we take each one of us a steed there were five and twenty horsemen so they took five and twenty horses whilst allah sent sleep upon the infidels for a purpose he knew and the faithful mounted and fared on till they were out of reach meanwhile sharrkan set to gathering from the infidels as many weapons swords and spears as were wanted and while they took saddle and struck forwards none of the infidels supposed that anyone could release zau almakan and his brother and their men or that their prisoners had power to escape now when all the captives were safe from the unfaithful sharrkan came up with his comrades and found them awaiting his arrival on coals of flame expecting him in anxious grame so he turned to them and said feel no fear since allah protecteth us i have that to propose which haply shall effect our purpose what is it asked they and he answered i desire that ye all climb to the mountain top and cry out with one voice allaho akbar and ye add the army of al islam is upon you allaho akbar this wise their company will surely be dissolved nor will they find out the trick for they are drunk but they will think that the moslem troops have encompassed them about on all sides and have mingled with them so they will fall on one another brand in hand during the confusion of drunkenness and sleep and we will cleave them asunder with their own swords and the scymitar will go round amongst them till dawn replied zau almakan this plan is not good we should do better to make our way to our army and speak not a word for if we cry out allaho akbar they will wake and fall on us and not one of us will escape rejoined sharrkan by allah though they should awake tis no matter and i long that ye fall in with my plan for naught save good can come of it so they agreed thereon and clomb the mountain and shouted allaho akbar and hills and trees and rocks reworded their allaho akbar for fear of the almighty but when the kafirs heard this slogan they cried out to one another—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the one hundredth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that sharrkan spake thus i long that ye fall in with this my plan for naught save good can come of it so they agreed thereon and clomb the mountain head and shouted allaho akbar and hills and trees and rocks re worded their allaho akbar for fear of the almighty the infidels heard it and cried out one to other and donned their armour and said the foe is upon us by the truth of the messiah then they fell on one another and slew of their own men more than any knoweth save almighty allah as soon as it was dawn they sought for the captives but found no trace of them and their captains said they who did this were the prisoners in our possession up then and after them in all haste till ye overtake them when we will make them quaff the cup of requital and let not fright nor the panic of sudden awaking possess you so they took horse and rode after the fugitives and it wanted but an eye twinkling before they overtook them and surrounded them now when zau almakan saw this he was seized with increase of terror and said to his brother what i feared would come is come upon us and now it remaineth only for us to fight for the faith but sharrkan preferred to hold his peace then zau al makan and his companions rushed down from the hill crest shouting allaho akbar and his men repeated the war cry and addressed themselves to fight and to sell their lives in the service of the lord of faithful men and while they were in this case behold they heard many voices voicing there is no god but the god god is most great salutation and salvation upon the apostle the bringer of glad tidings the bearer of bad tidingsfn434 so they turned towards the direction of the sound and saw a company of moslems who believed in one god pushing towards them whereat their hearts were heartened and sharrkan charged upon the infidels crying out there is no god but the god god is most great he and those with him so that earth quaked as with an earthquake and the unbeliever host brake asunder and fled into the mountains and the moslems followed them with lunge and blow and zau almakan and his comrades of the moslems ceased not to smite the hosts of the infidel foe and parted heads from bodies till day darkened and night coming on starkened sight thereupon the moslems drew together and passed the night in congratulations and when morning dawned and daybreak shone with its shine and sheen they saw bahram the captain of the daylamites and rustam the captain of the turks advancing to join them with twenty thousand cavaliers like lions grim as soon as they saw zau almakan the riders dismounted and saluted him and kissed ground between his hands when he said to them rejoice ye in the glad tidings of the victory of the moslem and the discomfiture of the tribe of unbelievers then they gave one another joy of their deliverance and of the greatness of their reward after resurrection day now the cause of the coming of the succours to that place was this when the emir bahram and the emir rustam and the chief chamberlain with the moslem host and flags flaunting high ahead came in sight of constantinople they saw that the nazarenes had mounted the walls and manned the towers and the forts and had set all their defenders in order of defence as soon as they learned of the approach of the host of alislam and the banners mohammedan and they heard the clash of arms and the noise of war voices and tramp of horse hoofs and from their look outs they beheld the moslems with their standards and ensigns of the faith of unity under the dust clouds and lo they were like a flight of locusts or rain clouds raining rain and the voices of the moslems chanting the koran and glorifying the compassionate one struck their ears now the infidels knew of the approach of this host through zat aldawahi with her craft and whoredomfn435 calumny and contrivance and the armies of alislam drew near as it were the swollen sea for the multitude of footmen and horsemen and women and children then quoth the general of the turks to the general of the daylamites o emir of a truth we are in jeopardy from the multitude of the foe who is on the walls look at yonder bulwarks and at this world of folk like the seas that clash with dashing billows indeed yon infidel outnumbereth us an hundredfold and we cannot be safe from spies who may inform them that we are without a sultan in very sooth we run danger from these enemies whose numbers may not be told and whose resources none can withhold especially in the absence of king zau almakan and his brother sharrkan and the illustrious wazir dandan if they know of this they will be emboldened to attack us in their absence and with the sword they will annihilate us to the last man not one of us safety shall see so it is my counsel that thou take ten thousand riders of the allies and the turks and march them to the hermitage of matruhina and the meadow of malúkhiná in quest of our brothers and comrades if thou act by my advice it may be we shall approve ourselves the cause of their deliverance in case they be hard pressed by the infidels and if thou act not blame will not attach to me but an ye go it behoveth that ye return quickly for ill suspicion is part of prudence the emir aforesaid fell in with his counsel so they chose twenty thousand horse and they set out covering the roads and making for the monastery above mentioned so much for the cause of their coming but as regards the ancient dame zat aldawahi as soon as she had delivered sultan zau almakan and his brother sharrkan and the wazir dandan into the hands of the infidels the foul whore mounted a swift steed saying to the faithless i design to rejoin the moslem army which is at constantinople and contrive for their destruction for i will inform them that their chiefs are dead and when they hear that from me their joining will be disjointed and the cord of their confederation cut and their host scattered then will i go to king afridun lord of constantinople and to my son hardub king of roum and relate to them their tidings and they will sally forth on the moslems with their troops and will destroy them and will not leave one of them alive so she mounted and struck across country on her good steed all the livelong night and when day dawned appeared the armies of bahram and rustam advancing towards her so she turned into a wayside brake and hid her horse among the trees and she walked a while saying to herself haply the moslem hosts be returning routed from the assault of constantinople however as she drew near them she looked narrowly and made sure that their standards were not reversedfn436 and she knew that they were coming not as conquered men but fearing for their king and comrades when she was assured of this she hastened towards them running at speed like a devil of ill rede till reaching them she cried out haste ye haste ye o soldiers of the compassionate one hasten to the holy war against the hosts of satan when bahram saw her he dismounted and kissed the ground before her and asked her o friend of allah what is behind thee answered she question not of sad case and sore condition for when our comrades had taken the treasure from the hermitage of matruhina and designed to win their way constantinople wards thereupon came out on them a driving host and a dreadful of the infidels and the damned witch repeated to them the story to fill them with trouble and terror adding the most of them are dead and there are but five and twenty men left said bahram o holy man when didst thou leave them but this nightfn437 replied she he cried glory be to allah to him who hath rolled up the far distance for thee like a rug so that thou hast sped thus walking upon thy feet and props upon a midrib of palmtree but thou art one of the saints which fly like birds when inspired and possessed by his directionsfn438 then he mounted his horse and he was perplexed and confounded by what he had heard from the beldam so strong in lies and ill calumnies and he said there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great verily our labour is lost and our hearts are heavy within us for our sultan is a prisoner and those who are with him then they cut across the country wide and side night and day and when morning dawned they reached the head of the defile and saw zau almakan and sharrkan shouting there is no god but the god allaho akbar and salutation and salvation upon the congratulator the comminatorfn439 whereupon he and his drove at the unbelievers and whelmed them as the rain torrent whelms the waste and cried out their war cries till fear get hold of the prowess knights and the mountains were cloven in affright and when shone the day and showed its shine and sheen the breeze of morning blew upon them sweet and fragrant and each recognised other as hath been said before then they kissed the ground before the king and before his brother sharrkan who told them all that had befallen the party in the cave now thereat they marvelled and said to one another hasten we back to constantinople for we left our companions there and our hearts are with them so they hurried departure commending themselves to the subtle the allwise and zau almakan exhorted the moslems to steadfast ness and versified in the following coupletsfn440

be praises mine to all praiseworthy thee  o lord who stinted
            not mine aid to be
though was i lost abroad thou west to me  strongest support
            which vouchsafed victory
thou gavst me wealth and reign and goodly gifts  and slungest
            con quering sword of valiancy
thou madst me blest beneath thy kingly shade  engraced with
            generous boons dealt fain and free
thou savedst from every fear i feared by aid  of my wazir the
            ages noblest he
garred us thy grace in fight to throw the greek  who yet came
             back dight in wars cramoisie
then made i feint to fly from out the fight  but like grim lion
           turning made them flee
and left on valley sole my foemen drunk  not with old
           winefn441 but deathcups revelry
then came the saintly hermit and he showed  his marvels wrought
            for town and wold to see
when slew they herowights who woke to dwell  in eden bowers
           wherein sweet rilllets well

but when zau almakan had made an end of versifying his brother sharrkan congratulated him on his safety and thanked him for the deeds he had done after which both set out forcing their marches to rejoin their army—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the one hundred and first night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that sharrkan congratulated his brother zau almakan on his safety and thanked him for the deeds he had done after which both set out forcing their marches to rejoin their army such was their case but as regards the old woman zat aldawahi after she had foregathered with the hosts of rustam and bahram she returned to the coppice where she took her steed and mounted and sped on at speed till she drew near the moslem army that beleaguered constantinople when she lighted down from her destrier and led it to the pavilion tent of the chief chamberlain and when he saw her he stood up to her in honour and signed to her with his right hand and said welcome o pious recluse then he questioned her of what had befallen and she repeated to him her disquieting lies and deluding calumnies saying in sooth i fear for the emir rustam and the emir bahram for that i met them and theirs on the way and sent them and their following to relieve the king and his companions now there are but twenty thousand horse and the unbelievers outnumber them so i would have thee at this moment send off the rest of thy troops at full speed to their suc cour lest they be slain to the last man and she cried to them haste haste when the chamberlain and the moslems heard these words their spirits fell and they wept but zat aldawahi said to them ask aidance of allah and bear patiently this triburation for ye have the example of those who have been before you of the people of mohammed and paradise with its palaces is laid out by allah for those who die martyrs and needs must all die but most praiseworthy is dying while fighting for the faith the chamberlain hearing this speech of the accursed old woman called for the emir bahrams brother a knight by name tarkash and choosing out for him ten thousand horse riders famed for force bade him set out at once so he fared forth and marched all that day and the whole of the next night till he neared the moslems when daylight dawned sharrkan saw the dust cloud about them and feared for the men of alislam and said if these troops which are coming upon us be moslem men our victory is assured by them but if these be nazarenes there is no gainsaying destinys decrees then he turned to his brother zau al makan and said never fear for with my life i will ransom thee from death if these be mohammedan troops then were it an increase of heavenly favours but if they be our foes there is no help save that we fight them yet do i long to meet the holy man ere i die so i may beg him to pray that i die not save by death of martyrdom whilst the twain were thus speaking behold there appeared the banners inscribed with the words there is no god but the god and mohammed is the apostle of god and sharrkan cried out how is it with the moslems all are sound and safe replied they and we came not but out of concern for you then the chief of the army dismounted and kissing ground before sharrkan asked o my lord how be the sultan and the wazir dandan and rustam and my brother bahram are they all in safety he answered all well but who brought thee tidings of us quoth tarkash it was the holy man who told us that he had met my brother bahram and rustam and had sent them both to you and he also assured us that the infidels had encompassed you and out numbered you but i see not the case save the contrary thereof and that you are victorious they questioned him and how did the holy man reach you and he replied walking on his feet and he had compassed in a day and a night ten days journey for a well girt horseman there is no doubt but that he is a saint of allah said sharrkan but where is he now they rejoined we left him with our troops the folk of the faith moving them to do battle with the rebels and the faithless thereat sharrkan rejoiced and all thanked allah for their own deliverance and the safety of the holy man and commended the dead to his mercy saying this was writ in the book then they set out making for constantinople by forced marches and whilst they were on this enterprise behold a dust cloud arose to such height that it walled the two horizons the eastern and the western from mans sight and the day was darkened by it to night but sharrkan looked at it and said verily i fear lest this be the infidels who have routed the army of alislam for that this dust walleth the world east and west and hideth the two horizons north and south presently appeared under the dust a pillar of darkness blacker than the blackness of dismal days nor ceased to come upon them that column more dreadful than the dread of the day of doom horse and foot hastened up to look at it and know the terrors of the case when behold they saw it to be the recluse aforesaid so they thronged round him to kiss his hands and he cried out o people of the best of mankindfn442 the lamp which shineth in darkness blind verily the infidels have outwitted the moslems by guile for they fell upon the host of the one god whilst they deemed themselves safe from the faithless and attacked them in their tents and made a sore slaughter of them what while they looked for no wile so hasten to the aid of the believers in the unity of god and deliver them from those who deny him now when sharrkan heard these words his heart flew from his breast with sore trouble and alighting from his steed in amazement he kissed the recluses hands and feet on like wise did his brother zau almakan and the rest of the foot and horse troops except the wazir dandan who dismounted not but said by allah my heart flieth from this devotee for i never knew show of devotion to religion that bred not bane so leave him and rejoin your comrades the moslems for this man is of the outcasts from the gate of the mercy of the lord of the three worlds how often have i here made razzias with king omar bin alnuuman and trodden the earth of these lands said sharrkan put away from thee such evil thought hast thou not seen this holy man exciting the faithful to fight and holding spears and swords light so slander him not for backbiting is blameable and poisoned is the flesh of the piousfn443 look how he inciteth us to fight the foe and did not almighty allah love him he had cast him aforetime into fearful torment then sharrkan bade bring a nubian mule for the ascetic to ride and said mount o pious man devout and virtuous but the devotee refused to ride and feigned self denial that he might attain his end and they knew not that this holy personage was like him of whom the poet saith

he prayeth and he fasteth for an end he doth espy  when once his end is safely won then fast and prayer good byefn444

so the devotee ceased not to walk among the horsemen and the footmen like a wily fox meditating guile and began to uplift her voice chanting the koran and praising the compassionate one and they continued pressing forward till they approached the camp of alislam where sharrkan found the moslem in conquered plight and the chamberlain upon the brink of falling back in flight whilst the sword of greece havoc dight among the faithful the righteous and those who work upright—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the one hundred and second night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when sharrkan saw the moslems in conquered plight and the chamberlain upon the brink of retreat and flight and the sword havoc dight among the righteous and the workers of upright the cause of this weakness among the moslems was that the accursed old woman zat al dawahi the foe of the faith after seeing that bahram and rustam had set forward with their troops to join sharrkan and his brother zau almakan repaired to the camp of the mahometans before constantinople and caused the mission of the emir tarkash as hath been before said in this her purpose was to divide the moslem forces the better to weaken them then she left them and entered constantinople and called with a loud voice on the knights of the greeks saying let me down a cord that i may tie thereto this letter and do ye bear it to your king afridun that he may read it and to my son king hardub that they both do what is written therein of bidding and forbidding so they let down for her a string and she tied thereto a letter whose purport was the following from the terriblest of tribulationsfn445 and the chiefest of all calamities zat aldawahi to king afridun greeting but afterwards of a truth i have contrived a device for destroying the moslems so bide ye quiet and content i have cozened and captured their sultan and the wazir dandan and then i returned to their camp and acquainted them therewith whereby their pride had a fall and their withers were wrung and i have so wrought upon the host leaguering constantinople that they have sent ten thousand men under the emir tarkash to succour the capitves of whom there be now left but few it is therefore my object that ye sally forth against them with all your power while this day endureth and that ye fall on them in their tents and that ye leave them not till ye shall have slain them to the last man for verily the messiah looketh down upon you and the blessed virgin favoureth you and i hope of the messiah that he forget not what deed i have done when her letter came to king afridun he rejoiced with great joyance and sending at once for king hardub of greece son of zat aldawahi read the letter to him as soon as he camewhereathe was exceeding glad and said see my mothers craft verily it dispenseth with swords and her aspect standeth in stead of the terrors of the day of dread rejoined afridun may the messiah not bereave us of thy venerable parent nor deprive her of her wile and guile then he bade the knights give orders for sallying outside the city and the news was noised abroad in constantinople so the nazarenes and the cohorts of the cross burst forth and unsheathed their keen sabres in their numbers shouting out their professions of impiety and heresies and blaspheming the lord of all creatures when the chamberlain saw the sally he said behold the greek is upon us and they surely have learned that our sultan is far away and haply they have attacked us for that the most part of our troops have marched to the succour of king zau almakan therewith he waxed wroth and cried out ho soldiers of alislam and favourers of the true faith an you flee you are lost but if ye stand fast ye win know ye that valiancy lieth in endurance of outrance and that no case is so strait but that the almighty is able to make it straight allah assain you and look upon you with eyes of compassion fain thereupon the moslems cried out allaho akbar and the believer in the one god shouted his slogan and whirled the mill wheels of fight with cutting and thrusting in main and might scymitars and spears played sore and the plains and valleys were swamped with gore the priests and monks priested it tight girding their girdles and uplifting the crucifixes while the moslem shouted out the professions of the requiting king and verses of the koran began to sing the hosts of the compassion are one fought against the legions of satan and head flew from body of man while the good angels hovered above the people of the chosen prophet nor did the sword cease to smite till the day darkened and night came on and starkened now the miscreants had encompassed the moslems and made sure of escaping the pains that awaited them and the faithless greeded for victory over the faithful until day dawned and dazzled there upon the chamberlain mounted he and his men trusting thee allah would help them to victory and host was mingled with host and battle rose a foot and took post and heads flew from trunks whilst the brave stood fast in stead the craven turned tail and fled and the judge of death judged and sentence sped so that the champions fell from their saddles slain and corpses cumbered meadow and plain then the moslem began to give ground and rearwards bent and the greek took possession of some of their tents whereupon the moslems were about to break and retreat and take flight when meanwhile behold up came sharrkan with the rest of the host of alislam and the standards of the believers in unity and having come up with them he charged the infidels and followed him zau almakan and the wazir dandan and the emirs bahram and rustam with his brother tarkash when the foe saw this they lost head and their reason fled and the dust clouds towered till they covered the country whilst the righteous believers joined their pious comrades then sharrkan accosted the chamberlain and praised him for his steadfastness and he in turn gave the prince joy of his timely succour and his gaining the day thereat the moslems were glad and their hearts were heartened so they rushed upon their enemies and devoted themselves to allah in their fight for the faith but when the idolaters beheld the standards mohammedan and there on the profession of faith islamitan proclaiming the unity they shrieked woe and ruin and besought succour of the patriarchs of the monasteries then fell they to calling upon john and mary and the cross abhorrent and stayed their hands from slaughter whilst king afridun went up to consult king hardub of greece for the two kings stood one at the head of each wing right and left now there was with them also a famous cavalier lawiya highs who commanded the centre and they drew out in battle array but indeed they were full of alarm and affray meanwhile the moslems aligned their forces and thereupon sharrkan came to his brother zau almakan and said o king of the age doubtless they mean to champion it and that is also the object of our desire but it is my wish to push forward the stoutest hearted of our fighters for by forethought is one half of life wrought replied the sultan as thou wilt o companion of good counsel it is my wish added sharrkan to stand in mid line opposite the infidel with the wazir dandan on my left and thee on my right whilst the emir bahram leads the dexter wing and the emir rustam leads the wing sinistral and thou o mighty king shalt be under the standards and the ensigns for that thou art the pillar of our defence upon thee after allah is our dependence and we will all be thy ransom from aught that can harm thee zau almakan thanked him therefor and the slogan arose and the sabre was drawn but as things stood thus behold there came forth a cavalier from the ranks of roum and as he drew near they saw that he was mounted on a slow paced she mule fleeing with her master from the shock of swords her housings were of white silk covered by a prayercarpet of cash mere stuff and on her back sat a shaykh an old man of comely presence and reverend aspect garbed in a gown of white wool he stinted not pushing her and hurrying her on till he came near the moslem and said i am an ambassador to you all and an ambassador hath naught to do save to deliver so give me safe conduct and permit of speech that i communicate to you my message replied sharrkan thou art in safety fear neither sway of sword nor lunge of lance thereupon the old man dismounted and taking the cross from his neck placed it before the sultan and humbled himself with much humility then quoth to him the moslems what is with thee of news and quoth he i am an ambassador from king afridun for i counselled him to avert the destruction of all these frames of men and temples of the compassionate one and to him it seemed righteous to stay the shedding of blood and limit it to the encounter of two knights in shock of fight singular so he agreed to that and he saith to you verily i will ransom my army with my life so let the moslem king do as i do and with his life ransom his host and if he kill me there will be no stay left in the army of roum and if i kill him there will be no stability with the moslems when sharrkan heard this he said o monk i agree to that for it is just nor may it be gainsaid and behold i will meet him in duello and do with him derring do for i am champion of the faithful even as he is champion of the faithless and if he slay me he will have won the day and naught will remain for the moslems forces save flight so return to him o thou monk and say that the single combat shall take place to morrow for this day we have come off our journey and are aweary but after rest neither reproach nor blame fear ye so the monk returned and he rejoicing to king afridun and king hardub and told them both what sharrkan had said whereat king afridun was glad with exceeding gladness and fell from him anxiety and sadness and he said to himself no doubt but this sharrkan is their doughtiest swayer of the sword and the dourest at lunge of lance and when i shall have slain him their hearts will be disheartened and their strength will be shattered now zat aldawahi had written to king afridun of that and had told him how sharrkan was a knight of the braves and the bravest of knights and had warned him against him but afridun was a stalwart cavalier who fought in many a fashion he could hurl rocks and throw spears and smite with the iron mace and he feared not the prowess of the prow so when he heard the report of the monk that sharrkan agreed to the duello he was like to fly for exceeding joy because he had self confidence and he knew that none could with stand him the infidels passed that night in joy and jubilee and wine bibbing and as soon as it was dawn the two armies drew out with the swart of spear and the blanch of blade and behold a cavalier rode single handed into the plain mounted on a steed of purest strain and for foray and fray full ready and fain and that knight had limbs of might and he was clad in an iron cuirass made for stress of fight on his breast he wore a jewelled mirror and in his hand he bore a keen scymitar and his lance of khalanj woodfn446 the curious work of the frank weighing a quintal then the rider uncovered his face and cried out saying whoso knoweth me verily hath enough of me and whoso knoweth me not right soonfn447 shall ken who i be i am afridun the overwhelmed by the well omened shawáhifn448 zat aldawahi but he had not ended speaking ere sharrkan the champion of the moslems fared forth to meet him mounted on a sorrel horse worth a thousand pieces of red gold with accoutrements purfled in pearls and precious stone and he bore in baldrick a blade of watered indian steel that through necks shore and made easy the hard and sore he crave his charger between the two hosts in line whilst the horsemen all fixed on him their eyne and he cried out to afridun woe to thee o accursed dost thou deem me one of the horsemen thou hast overtaen who cannot stand against thee on battle plain then each rushed upon other and they bashed together like two mountains crashing or two billows dash ing and clashing they advanced and retreated and drew together and withdrew and stinted not of fray and fight and weapon play and strife and stay with stroke of sword and lunge of lance of the two armies looking on some said sharrkan is victor and others afridun will conquer and the two riders stayed not their hands from the hustle until ceased the clamour and the bustle and the dust columns rose and the day waned and the sun waxed yellow and wan then cried out king afridun to sharrkan saying by the truth of the messiah and the faith which is no liar thou art nought save a doughty rider and a stalwart fighter but thou art fraudful and thy nature is not that of the noble i ken thy work is other than praiseworthy nor is thy prowess that of a prince for thy people behave to thee as though thou wert a slavefn449 and see they bring thee out a charger which is not thine that thou mayst mount and return to the fight but by the truth of my faith thy fighting irketh and fatigueth me and i am weary of cutting and thrusting with thee and if thou purpose to lay on load with me to night thou wouldst not change aught of thy harness nor thy horse till thou approve to the cavaliers thy generous blood and skill in brunt when sharrkan heard him say these words concerning his own folk behaving to him though he were a slave he waxt wroth and turned towards his men meaning to sign to them and bid them not prepare him change of harness or horse when lo afridun shook his throw spear high in air and cast it at sharrkan now when the moslem turned his back he found none of the men near him and he knew this to be a trick of the accursed infidel so he wheeled round in haste and behold the javelin came at him so he swerved from it till his head was bent low as his saddle bow the weapon grazed his breast and pierced the skin of his chest for sharrkan was high bosomed whereupon he gave one cry and swooned away thereat the accursed afridun was joyful thinking he had slain him and shouted to the infidels bidding them rejoice whereat the faithless were encouraged and the faithful wept when zau almakan saw his brother reeling in selle so that he well nigh fell he despatched cavaliers towards him and the braves hurried to his aid and came up with him thereupon the infidels drove at the moslems the two hosts joined battle and the two lines were mingled whilst the keen scymitar of alyaman did good work now the first to reach sharrkan was the wazir dandan—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the one hundred and third night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when king zau almakan saw that the accursed infidel had struck with javelin his brother sharrkan he deemed him dead and despatched cavaliers towards him and the first to reach him were the wazir dandan and the emir of the turks bahram and the emir of the daylamites rustam they found him falling from his horse so they stayed him in his saddle and returned with him to his brother zau almakan then they gave him in charge to his pages and went again to do the work of cut and thrust so the strife redoubled and the weapons together clashed and ceased not bate and debate and naught was to be seen but blood flowing and necks bowing nor did the swords cease on the napes of men to make play nor the strife to rage with more and more affray till the most part of the night was past away and the two hosts were aweary of the mellay so they called a truce and each army returned to its tents whilst all the infidels repaired to king afridun and kissed the ground before him and the priests and monks wished him joy of his victory over sharrkan then the king fared for constantinople and sat upon the throne of his realm when king hardub came to him and said may the messiah strengthen thy fore arm and never cease to be thy helper and hearken to what prayers my pious mother zat aldawahi shall pray for thee know that the moslems can make no stay without sharrkan replied afridun to morrow shall end the affair when to fight i fare i will seek zau almakan and slay him and their army shall turn tail and of flight shall avail such was the case with the kafirs but as regards the host of alislam when zau almakan returned to his tent he thought of naught but his brother and going into the pavilion found him in evil case and sore condition whereupon he summoned for counsel the wazir dandan and rustam and bahram when they entered they opined to assemble the physicians that they might medicine sharrkan and they wept and said the world will not readily afford his like and they watched by him all that night and about the later hours came to them the recluse in tears when zau almakan saw him he rose in honour and the religious stroked sharrkans wound with his hand chanting somewhat of the koran and repeating by way of talisman some of the verses of the compassionate one and the pretender ceased not to watch over him till dawn when he came to himself and opening his eyes moved his tongue in his mouth and spake at this zau almakan rejoiced saying of a truth the blessing of the holy man hath taken effect on him and sharrkan said praised be allah for recovery indeed i am well at this hour that accursed one played me false and but that i swerved aside lighter than lightening the throw spear had pierced through my breast so praised be allah for saving me and how is it with the moslems answered zau almakan all are weeping for thee quoth sharrkan i am well and in good case but where is the holy man now he was sitting by him and said at thy head so the prince turned to him and kissed his hand when he said o my son be of good patience and allah shall increase thy reward for the wage is measured by the work sharrkan rejoined pray for me and he prayed for him as soon as morning dawned and day brake in shine and sheen the moslems sallied out to the plain and the kafirs made ready to thrust and cut then the islamite host advanced and offered fight with weapons ready dight and king zau almakan and afridun made to charge one at other but when zau almakan fared forth into the field there came with him the wazir dandan and the chamberlain and bahram saying we will be thy sacrifice he replied by the holy house and zemzem and the placefn450 i will not be stayed from going forth against these wild asses and when he rode out into the field he played with sword and spear till riders marvelled and both armies wondered then he rushed upon the foes right wing and of it slew two knights and in like manner he dealt with the left wing presently he stayed his steed in the midst of the field and cried out where is afridun that i may make him taste the cup of disgrace but when king hardub saw the case he conjured afridun not to attack him saying o king yesterday it was thy turn to fight it is mine to day i care naught for his prowess so he rushed out towards zau almakan brand in hand and under him a stallion like abjar which was antars charger and its coat was jet black even as saith the poet

on the glancing racer outracing glance  he speeds as though he
            would collar doom
his steeds black coat is of darkest jet  and likest night in
            her nightliest gloom
whose neigh sounds glad to the hearers ears  like thunders
             rolling in thun drous boom
if he race the wind he will lead the way  and the lightning
             flash will behind him loomfn451

then each rushed upon the opponent parrying blows and proving the marvellous qualities were stored in him and they fell to drawing on and withdrawing till the breasts of the bystanders were straitened and they were weary of waiting for the event at last zau almakan cried out his war cry and rushed upon hardub king of cæsareafn452 and struck him a stroke that shore head from trunk and slew him on the spot when the infidels saw this they charged in a body compact and united upon zau almakan who met them amidfield and they engaged in hewing and foining till blood ran in rills then the moslems cried out allaho akbar god is most great and there is no god but the god and invoked salvation for the prophet the bringer of glad tidings the bearer of bad tidings and there befel a great fight but allah assigned victory to the faithful and defeat to the faithless the wazir dandan shouted take your blood revenge for king omar bin al nuuman and his son sharrkan and bared his head and cried out to the turks now there were by his side more than twenty thousand horse and all charged with him as men when the faithless found naught to save their lives but flight so they turned tail to fly while the biting sabre wrought its havoc and the moslems slew of them that day some fifty thousand horse and took more than that number much folk also were slain while going in at the gates for the flock was great then the greeks hove to the doors and swarmed up the walls to await the assault and in fine the moslem hosts returned to their tents aided to glory and victory and king zau almakan went in to his brother whom he found in most joyous case so he made a prostration of thanks to the bountiful and the exalted and then he came forward and gave sharrkan joy of his recovery answered he verily we are all under the benediction of this religious holy and righteous nor would you have been victorious but for his accepted orisons indeed all day he remained at prayer to invoke victory on the moslems—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the one hundred and fourth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when zau al makan went in to his brother sharrkan he found him sitting with the holy man by his side so he rejoiced and drew near him and gave him joy of his recovery answered he verily we are all under the benediction of this recluse nor would you have been victorious but for his prayers indeed he felt no fear this day and he ceased not supplication for the moslems i found strength return to me when i heard your allaho akbar for then i knew you to be victorious over your enemies but now recount to me o my brother what befel thee so he told him all that had passed between him and the accursed hardub and related how he had slain him and sent him to the malediction of allah and sharrkan praised him and thanked him for his prowess when zat aldawahi heard tell of her sons death and she still drest as a devotee her face waxed yellow and her eyes ran over with railing tears she kept her counsel however and feigned to the moslems that she was glad and wept for excess of joy but she said to herself by the truth of the messiah there remaineth no profit of my life if i burn not his heart for his brother sharrkan even as he hath burned my heart for king hardub the mainstay of christendom and the hosts of crossdom still she kept her secret and the wazir dandan and king zau almakan and the chamberlain remained sitting with sharrkan till they had dressed and salved his wound after which they gave him medicines and he began to recover strength whereat they joyed with exceeding joy and told the troops who congratulated themselves saying to morrow he will ride with us and do manly devoir in the siege then said sharrkan to them ye have fought through all this day and are aweary of fight so it behoveth that you return to your places and sleep and not sit up they accepted his counsel and then each went away to his own pavilion and none remained with sharrkan but a few servants and the old woman zat aldawahi he talked with her through part of the night then he stretched himself to rest and his servants did likewise and presently sleep overcame them all and they lay like the dead such was the case with sharrkan and his men but as regards the old woman she alone abode awake while they slumbered in the tent and looking at sharrkan she presently saw that he was drowned in sleep thereupon she sprang to her feet as she were a scald she bear or a speckled snake and drew from her waist cloth a dagger so poisoned that if laid thereon it would have melted a rock then she unsheathed the poniard and went up to sharrkans head and she drew the knife across his throat and severed his weasand and hewed off his head from his body and once more she sprang to her feet and going the round of the sleeping servants she cut off their heads also lest they should awake then she left the tent and made for the sultans pavilion but finding the guards on the alert turned to that of the wazir dandan now she found him reading the koran and when his sight fell upon her he said welcome to the holy man hearing this from the wazir her heart trembled and she said the reason of my coming hither at this time is that i heard the voice of a saint amongst allahs saints and am going to him then she turned her back but the wazir said to himself by allah i will follow our devotee this night so he rose and walked after her but when the accursed old woman sensed his footsteps she knew that he was following her wherefore she feared the disgrace of discovery and said in herself unless i serve some trick upon him he will disgrace me so she turned and said to him from afar ho thou wazir i am going in search of this saint that i may learn who he is and after learning this much i will ask his leave for thee to visit him then i will come back and tell thee for i fear thine accompanying me without having his permission lest he take umbrage at me seeing thee in my society now when the wazir heard these words he was ashamed to answer her so he left her and returned to his tent and would have slept but sleep was not favourable to him and the world seemed heaped upon him presently he rose and went forth from the tent saying in himself i will go to sharrkan and chat with him till morning but when he entered into sharrkans pavilion he found the blood running like an aqueduct and saw the servants lying with their throats cut like beasts for food at this he cried a cry which aroused all who were asleep the folk hastened to him and seeing the blood streaming set up a clamour of weeping and wailing then the noise awoke the sultan who enquired what was the matter and it was said to him sharrkan thy brother and his servants are murthered so he rose in haste and entered the tent and found the wazir dandan shrieking aloud and he saw his brothers body without a head thereat he swooned away and all the troops crowded around him weeping and crying out and so remained for a while till he came to himself when he looked at sharrkan and wept with sore weeping while the wazir and rustam and bahram did the like but the chamberlain cried and lamented more than the rest and asked leave to absent himself such was his alarm then said zau almakan know ye who did this deed and how is it i see not the devotee him who the things of this world hath put away quoth the wazir and who should have been the cause of this affliction save that devotee that satan by allah my heart abhorred him from the first because i know that all who pretend to be absorbed in practices religious are vile and treacherous and he repeated to the king the tale of how he would have followed the religious but he forbade him whereupon the folk broke out into a tumult of weeping and lamentation and humbled themselves before him who is ever near him who ever answereth prayer supplicating that he would cause the false devotee who denied allahs testimony to fall into their hands then they laid sharrken out and buried him in the mountain aforesaid and mourned over his farfamed virtues—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the one hundred and fifth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that they laid sharrkan out and buried him in the mountain aforesaid and mourned over his farfamed virtues then they looked for the opening of the city gate but it opened not and no sign of men appeared to them on the walls whereat they wondered with exceeding wonder but king zau almakan said by allah i will not turn back from them though i sit here for years and years till i take blood revenge for my brother sharrkan and waste constantinople and kill the king of the nazarenes even if death overcome me and i be at rest from this woeful world then he bade be brought out the treasure taken from the monastery of matruhina and mustered the troops and divided the monies among them and he left not one of them but he gave him gifts which contented him moreover he assembled in the presence three hundred horse of every division and said to them do ye send supplies to your households for i am resolved to abide by this city year after year till i have taken man bote for my brother sharrkan even if i die in this stead and when the army heard these words and had received his gifts of money they replied to hear is to obey thereupon he summoned couriers and gave them letters and charged them to deliver the same together with the monies to the soldiers families and inform them that all were safe and satisfied and acquaint them saying we are encamped before constantinople and we will either destroy it or die and albeit we be obliged to abide here months and years we will not depart hence till we take it moreover he bade the wazir dandan write to his sister nuzhat alzaman and said to him acquaint her with what hath befallen us and what be our situation and commend my child to her care since that when i went out to war my wife was near her delivery and by this time she must needs have been brought to bed and if she hath given birth to a boy as i have heard say hasten your return and bring me the acceptable news then he gave them somewhat of money which they pouched and set out at once and all the people flocked forth to take leave of them and entrust them with the monies and the messages after they had departed zau almakan turned to the wazir dandan and commanded him to advance with the army against the city walls so the troops pushed forward but found none on the ramparts whereat they marvelled while zau almakan was troubled at the case for he deeply mourned the severance from his brother sharrkan and he was sore perturbed about that traitor the ascetic in this condition they abode three days without seeing anyone so far concerning the moslems but as regards the greeks and the cause of their refusing to fight during these three days the case was this as soon as zat aldawahi had slain sharrkan she hastened her march and reached the walls of constantinople where she called out in the greek tongue to the guards to throw her down a rope quoth they who art thou and quoth she i am zat al dawahi they knew her and let down a cord to which she tied herself and they drew her up and when inside the city she went in to the king afridun and said to him what is this i hear from the moslems they say that my son king hardub is slain he answered yes and she shrieked out and wept right grievously and ceased not weeping thus till she made afridun and all who were present weep with her then she told the king how she had slain sharrkan and thirty of his servants whereat he rejoiced and thanked her and kissing her hands exhorted her to resignation for the loss of her son said she by the truth of the messiah i will not rest content with killing that dog of the moslem dogs in blood revenge for my son a king of the kings of the age now there is no help for it but that i work some guile and i contrive a wile whereby to slay the sultan zau almakan and the wazir dandan and the chamberlain and rustam and bahram and ten thousand cavaliers of the army of alislam for it shall never be said that my sons head be paid with the bloodwit of sharrkans head no never then said she to king afridun know o king of the age that it is my wish to set forth mourning for my son and to cut my girdle and to break the crosses replied afridun do what thou desire i will not gainsay thee in aught and if thou prolong thy mourning for many days it were a little thing for though the moslems resolve to beleaguer us years and years they will never win their will of us nor gain aught of us save trouble and weariness then the accursed one when she had ended with the calamity she had wrought and the ignominies which in herself she had thought took ink case and paper and wrote thereon from shawahi zat al dawahi to the host of the moslems know ye that i entered your country and duped by my cunning your nobles and at first hand i slew your king omar bin alnuuman in the midst of his palace moreover i slew in the affair of the mountain pass and of the cave many of your men and the last i killed were sharrkan and his servants and if fortune do not stay me and satan obey me i needs must slay me your sultan and the wazir dandan for i am she who came to you in disguise of a recluse and who heaped upon you my devices and deceits wherefore an you would be in safety after this fare ye forth at once and if you seek your own destruction cease not abiding for the nonce and though ye tarry here years and years ye shall not do your desire on us and so peace be yours after writing her writ she devoted three days to mourning for king hardub arid on the fourth she called a knight and bade him take the letter and make it fast to a shaft and shoot it into the moslem camp when this was done she entered the church and gave herself up to weeping and wailing for the loss of her son saying to him who took the kingship after him nothing will serve me but i must kill zau almakan and all the nobles of alislam such was the case with her but as regards what occurred to the moslems all passed three days in trouble and anxiety and on the fourth when gazing at the walls behold they saw a knight holding a bow and about to shoot an arrow along whose side a letter was bound so they waited till he had shot it among them and the sultan bade the wazir dandan take the missive and read it he perused it accordingly and when zau almakan heard it to end and understood its purport his eyes filled with tears and he shrieked for agony at her perfidy and the minister dandan said by allah my heart shrank from her quoth the sultan how could this whore play her tricks upon us twice but by the almighty i will not depart hence till i fill her cleft with molten lead and jail her with the jailing of a bird encaged then bind her with her own hair and crucify her over the gate of constantinople and he called to mind his brother and wept with excessive weeping but when zat aldawahi arrived amongst the infidels and related to them her adventures at length they rejoiced at her safety and at the slaying of sharrkan there upon the moslems addressed themselves again to the siege of the city and the sultan promised his men that if it should be taken he would divide its treasures among them in equal parts but he dried not his tears grieving for his brother till his body was wasted and sick growing thin as a tooth pick presently the wazir dandan came in to him and said be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear in very sooth thy brother died not but because his hour was come and there is no profit in this mourning how well saith the poet

whatso is not to be no sleight shall bring to pass  what is to
             be without a failure shall become
soon the becoming fortune shall be found to be  and follys
             brotherfn453 shall abide forlorn and glum

wherefore do thou leave this weeping and wailing and hearten thy heart to bear arms he replied o wazir my heart is heavy for the death of my father and my brother and for our absence from hearth and home and my mind is concerned for my subjects thereupon the wazir and the bystanders wept but they ceased not from pushing forward the siege of constantinople for a length of days and they being thus behold news arrived from baghdad by one of the emirs to the effect that the kings wife had been blessed with a boy and that his sister nuzhat alzaman had named him kánmákánfn454 moreover that the boy bid fair to be famous already showing wondrous signs and marvellous tokens and that she had commanded the olema and the preachers to pray for mother and child from the pulpits and bless them in all wise furthermore that the twain were well that the land had enjoyed abundant rains and that his comrade the fireman was established in all prosperity with eunuchs and slaves to wait upon him but that he was still ignorant of what had befallen him and she ended with the greeting of peace then quoth zau al makan to the wazir dandan now is my back strengthened for that i have been blest with a son whose name is kanmakan—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the one hundred and sixth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when they brought him the news of his wife having borne him a boy child zau al makan rejoiced with great joy and cried now is my back strengthened for that i have been blessed with a sonfn455 whose name is kanmakan and he spake to the wazir dandan saying i am minded to leave this mourning and order perfections of the koran for my brother and command almsdeeds on his account quoth the wazir thy design is good thereupon he caused tents to be pitched over his brothers tomb so they raised them and gathered together such of the men at arms as could repeat the koran and some began reciting the holy volume whilst others chanted litanies containing the names of allah and thus they did till the morning then zau almakan went up to the grave of his brother sharrkan and poured forth copious tears and improvised these couplets

they bore him bierd and all who followed wept  with moses
         shrieks what day oerhead shook torfn456
till reached the grave which pate had made his home  dug in
           mens souls who one sole god adore
neer had i thought before to see my joy  borne on the bier
           which heads of bearers bore
ah no nor ere they homed thee in the dust  that stars of
           heaven earth ever covered oer
is the tomb dweller hostage of a stead  where light and
            splendour oer thy face shall pour

           confined he shall dispread the more

when zau almakan had made an end of his versifying he wept and wept with him all the troops then he came to the grave and threw himself upon it wild with woe and the wazir repeated the words of the poet

pain leaving life that fleets thou hast th eternal won  thou
            didst as whilom many a doer like thee hath done
leftest this worldly house without reproach or blame  ah may
            th ex change secure thee every benison
thou west from hostile onset shield and firm defence  for us to
            baffle shafts and whistling spears to shun
i see this world is only cheat and vanity  where man naught
           else must seek but please the truthful one
th empyreans lord allow thee bower of heavenly bliss  and wi
            thy faithful friends the guide show goodly wone
i bid thee last good een with sigh of bitter grief  seeing the
             west in woe for lack of easting sun


when the wazir dandan had finished his reciting he wept with sore weeping and the tears rained from his eyes like cushioned pearls then came forward one who had been of sharrkans boon companions in his cups and he wept till ran in rills the drops and he enumerated the dead mans generous qualities reciting the following pentastichs


where gone is bounty since thy hand is turned to clay  and i
             in misery lie since thou west taen away
seest not o litter guidefn457 heaven keep thee glad and
             gay  how tears adorn my cheeks these furrowed wrinkles

             dared my sight to see thy brilliancy
save that my tear drops sorest wound have garred me dree  yea
             and if eer on other rest these eyne of me
                        may yearning draw their reins nor suffer sleep to see


and when the man stinted reciting zau almakan and the minister dandan wept and the whole army was moved to tears after which all retired to their tents and the king turning to the wazir took counsel with him concerning the conduct of the campaign on this wise the two passed days and nights while zau almakan was weighed down with grief and mourning till at last he said i long to hear stories and adventures of kings and tales of lover folk enslaved by love haply allah may make this to solace that which is on my heart of heavy anxiety and stint and stay my weeping and wailing quoth the wazir if naught can dispel thy trouble but hearing curious tales of kings and people long gone before and stories of folk enslaved by love of yore and so forth this thing were easy for i had no other business in the lifetime of thy father who hath found mercy than to relate stories and to repeat verses to him this very night i will tell thee a tale of a lover and his beloved so shall thy breast be broadened when zau almakan heard these words from the minister his heart was set upon that which had been promised to him and he did nothing but watch for the coming of the night that he might hear what the wazir dandan had to tell of the kings of yore and distracted lovers long gone before and hardly would he believe that night had fallen ere he bade light the wax candles and the lamps and bring all that was needful of meat and drink and perfume gear and what not and when all was in presence he summoned the wazir dandan and the emirs rustam and bahram and tarkash and the grand chamberlain then waited till the whole party was seated before him whereupon he turned to the minister and said know o wazir that night is come and hath let down over us its veil of gloom and we desire that thou tell us those tales which thou promisedst us replied the wazir with joy and good will—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the one hundred and seventh night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when king zau almakan summoned the wazir and the chamberlain and rustam and bahram he turned towards the minister dandan and said know o wazir that night is come and hath let down over us its veil of gloom and we desire that thou tell us those tales which thou promisedst us replied the wazir with love and gladness know o auspicious king that there reached my ears a relation of a lover and a loved one and of the discourse between them and what befel them of things rare and fair a story such as repelleth care from the heart and dispelleth sorrow like unto that of the patriarch jacobfn459 and it is as follows
