when he was seeing her you could see he had his doubts
and now hes missing her because he knows hes missing out
and now its haunting him her memorys like a ghost
and hes so terrified cause no one else even comes close

chorus
hes the guy that you should feel sorry for
he had the world but he thought that he wanted more
i owe it all to the mistake he made back then
i owe it all to my girls exboyfriend

verse 2
so then along comes me this undeserving mess undeserving mess
who would believe my life would be so blessed life would be so blessed
two years ago when he left all that debris left all that debris
who would have known he would leave everything i need

chorus
hes the guy that you should feel sorry for
he had the world but he thought that he wanted more
i owe it all to the mistake he made back then
i owe it all to my girls exboyfriend

postchorus
if it wasnt for him i would still be searching
if it wasnt for him i wouldnt know my best friend
if it wasnt for him he would be able to see that
if it wasnt for him hed be as happy as me

when she and i settle down you can bet
that he is gonna have to settle for less
hes someone i would hate to be
i got the girl and hes left with just a memory

chorus
hes the guy that you should feel sorry for
he had the world but he thought that he wanted more
i owe it all to the mistake he made back then
i owe it all to my girls exboyfriend

postchorus
if it wasnt for him i would still be searching
if it wasnt for him i wouldnt know my best friend
if it wasnt for him he would be able to see that
if it wasnt for him hed be as happy as meembed"
