verse 1
gave you chances on top of chances
opportunities taken for granted watch out

cause insanity why you askin me
took my kindness for sign of weakness watch out
my own blindness cause my sadness
no longer am i a slave over your madness watch out
i am glad its finally over watch out

verse 2
see im tired of all the games
that you seem to like to play
see what you can do for me
is forget you knew my name watch out
see your qualities are less than pleasing uh

see new beginnings is what im after
get your skeletons up out my closet
