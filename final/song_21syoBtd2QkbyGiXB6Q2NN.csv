from 8 mile to battle me or bow in agony

i mob with a crew of mufasas so why would i worry

i got enough knowledge to tutor a scholar
momma always told me do what you gotta
my crew gettin hotter and hotter right now we like june in nevada
but we soon to be hotter we aint on the cover of xxl
we from the underworld no beckinsale
look half of me say fuck record sales
im tryna reconcile with my reckless self
every question i direct to self are they fuckin with me
nah they aint fuckin with me
youd rather subject yourself to restin on a bed of nails
meet death get your flesh impaled
if you dont fall from grace ill pull you down n shit
yall all are gay look how you sound n shit
ima tie you motherfuckers up in the closet
know you got closet space cause you came out that bitch
all that shit you sellin i cant buy it
said that your clique is better but they lyin
my team like cavemen with these flames
i mean we stick together to make fire

verse 3 andrew “dice” deniro
dice is raisin the heat i dont mean the k is drawn
my flow is hot flamin yall i be eatin mcs like filet mignon ah

these wack niggas is gettin away with murder
but thats old news like the oj case yo
nigga me vs you like mj in his hay vs oj mayo
im a boss she go when i say so
armsll start swingin like jose canseco
everything you rep is fake thats why me and you cant relate
we dont like your records cause your records gay
we here to set the record straight
hold up hold up motherfuckers wanna back out when i black out
i get sicker than a mad cow
we can beef for free or we can beef for cash now
beef or cash – cash cow
you never heard of me im the petty king
im married to crime i snatched your bitch wedding ring
dice  directly in charge of everything
and my pockets stay evergreen

verse 4 kenny siegel
first off the earth is flat
motherfuckers shoulda knew i start my verse with that yah
if its a ball then show me where its curvin at
the un logo is a flat earther map
i be on them bitches like i am there
im high point to the sky i am there
was never off completely im aware
still a nigga back on it like a reclinin chair
to open my mind im turnin to the reefer
i put on my hood and turn into the reaper
i merk and do what the verses do
hot enough to burn into your speakers
alerting you ima murder you im eager yah
hate dudes that rap and say thats not what you about
i find it ironic like gettin pregnant on a couch that pulls out
kedoubleny mister every day hes stumblin high
mister every day he fumblin high
mister ima make every rapper who mumblin die yah
pay em back like i owe em a favor im raw no rollin of papers yah

verse 5 kxng crooked
i was in my sarcophagus sleepin i was in a diamond mine chillin on my king solomon shit solomon shit
and maybe whoop me ima sleep to remind me of droppin this bitch droppin this bitch
probably was better to leave me off the record man
cause you resurrected kane now a menace to society collides with a zombie apocalypse twist
im livin like i cant be killed im livin like i ate dead rappers for my last three meals
ya momma shoulda swallowed you in your fathers apollo when she was a thotthot gettin back seat thrills haha
we on the backstreet still where we pack heat still and the clapclap got em runnin like a athlete at a track meet still
nobody sellin crack we trap these pills
this is amityville this is how we feel we strugglin
life is like jugglin butcher knives niggas get cut and get blood in their eye
just keep on hustlin numbers are doublin
you dont wanna hear the horror story we survived purgatory
you just wanna hear the war story glory way before all these hoes was hanging out with the crew
talkin everything they did to get the house next to you
bank account full of loot it was wild as a zoo
we was down for a while now the album is through
better see five stars by the album review
or you and your people sleepin underground in the zoo
cause you dont know how hot it is
im listenin to the current competition got a whole lotta confidence
somebody go and tell the archaeologists to close my sarcophagus
im goin back to sleep on you niggas
goodnight haha
