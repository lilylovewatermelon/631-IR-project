verse 2 drake
still in miami most of these girls are too messy
i gotta do some reflecting
i gotta find me one out here thats good at taking direction
i am convinced that my calls are being recorded
so hit my assistant to get me the message
and make the connection like brrp
im on that wave tonight i hope you not the crazy type yeah
im in your state tonight i might just break the bank tonight yeah
pnd aint with the raytay you know jay wray
got girls here going way way way way way way—
saugacity trip the payday
glod up off a gateway man you cant afford me
doing is one thing doing it right is a whole different story
niggas is all in they feelings these days all in they feelings these days
but hearing a scripture with that many 6s you should be afraid
