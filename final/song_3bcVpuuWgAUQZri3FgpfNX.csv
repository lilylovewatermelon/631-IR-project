they got a lotta girls who know they got it goin on
but nothings ever a comparison to you
now cant you see that youre the only one i really want
and everything i need is everything you do

prechorus
any girl walk by dont matter
cause youre looking so much better
dont ever need to get caught up in jealousy
she could be a supermodel
every magazine the cover
shell never ever mean a thing to me

chorus
shes no you oh no
you give me more than i could ever want
shes no you oh no
im satisfied with the one i got
cause youre all the girl that i ever dreamed
shes only a picture on a magazine
shes no you
shes no you

verse 2
they got a lotta girls who dance in all the videos
but i prefer the way you do the way you move
youre more than beautiful and i just wanna let you know
that all i ever need is what i got with you
