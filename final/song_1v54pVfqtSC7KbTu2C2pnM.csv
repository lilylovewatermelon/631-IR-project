the days are cold livin without you
the nights are long im growin older
i miss the days of old thinkin about you
you may be gone but youre never over

verse 1
if proof could see me now i know hed be proud
somewhere in me deep down theres something in me he found
that made him believe in me now no one can beat me now
you try itll be them doors on dres phantom believe me clowns
that means suicide homie youll never throw me
off of this course blow me bitch i do this all for the sport only
but i want it all im not just talkin awards homie
and the balls in my court and its lonely
on top of the world when youre the only one
with the balls in your shorts
to leave their jaws on the floors with no remorse
member that when they get to doggin you boy homie
so yall can just get to bloggin about bologna
im not gonna stop the saga continues no stoppin the force obi
im moppin the floors with em i keep tryna pass it but they keep on
droppin the torch and it wont be long til this sport is ov
er just blaze and me we are knockin on doors and no we
aint pumpkins on halloween but well show up on your porch so be
careful what you say there aint no punks over here so follow me
through the fog like im sndoubleop let me guide you through the smoke g
if only i wasnt travelin down this road by my lonely
no one who knew me like you will ever know me
i dont think you understand how much you meant to me

verse 2
for you i wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life
so sick itll blow up the mic itll put the dyna in mite
yeah itll make the dopest mc wanna jump off a bridge and shit himself
tap dancin all over the beat itll jump off the page and spit itself
guess that the best thing i can do right now doody for you is to rep
so im gonna fuck til i die yeah ima do it to death
and instead of mournin your death id rather celebrate your life
elevate to new heights step on the gas and accelerate ima need two mics
cause the way that im feelin tonight everything i can just do right
theres nothin that i can do wrong im too strong and im just too hype
just finish the rhyme and i bust it excuse the corny metaphor
but theyll never catch up to all this energy that ive mustered
so god just help me out while i fight through this grievin process
tryna process this loss is makin me nauseous
but this depression aint takin me hostage ive been patiently watchin
this game pacin these hallways you had faith in me always
proof you knew id come out of this slump rise from these ashes
come right back on their asses and go mike tyson on these bastards
and ima show em blow em out the water slaughter em homes
ima own so many belts only place they can hit me is below em
homie i know im never gonna be the same without you
i never woulda came in this game im goin insane without you
matter fact it was just the other night had another dream about you
you told me to get up i got up i spread my wings and i flew
you gave me a reason to fight i was on my way to see you
you told me naw doody youre not layin on that table i knew
i was gonna make it soon as you said think of hailie i knew
there wasnt no way that i was ever gonna leave them babies and proof
not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you
lord im so thankful please dont think that i dont feel grateful i do
just grant me the strength that i need for one more day to get through
so homie this is your song i dedicate this to you
i love you doody
