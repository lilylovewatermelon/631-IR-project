money got happy but we got sad
but in the midst we had a daughter
evern though we floatin clear like ocean water
came home two bags of fendi

child support hit that really offend me
puffy was right its all about the benjies
bitter now cuz the loves still in me
in my boxers on couch sippin remy
thinkin that she need to be killed like kennedy
then i listen to i got the remedy
after all i still give you what you need cuz we got a daughter to feed
though you supposed to be here at least you sold me that
why the fuck did i listen when you told me that stupid
