that you know
that you told her that you loved her but you dont
you touch her skin
and then you think
that she is beautiful
but she dont mean a thing to me
yeah she is beautiful
but she dont mean a thing to me

i spent two weeks
in silver lake
the california sun cascading down my face
there was a girl
with light brown streaks
and she was beautiful
but she didnt mean a thing to me
no she didnt mean a thing to me

i wanted to believe in all the words that i was speaking
as we moved together in the dark
and all the friends that i was telling all the playful misspellings
and every bite i made that left a mark
when tiny vessels oozed into your neck and formed the bruises
that you said you didnt want to fade
but they did and so did i that day
see death cab for cutie liveget tickets as low as 147you might also likebreak

and all i see
are dark gray clouds
in the distance moving closer with every hour
so when youd ask
is something wrong
id think youre damn right there is
but we cant talk about it now
no we cant talk about it now

so one last touch
and then youll go
and well pretend that it meant something so much more
but it was vile
and it was cheap
and you are beautiful
but you dont mean a thing to me
yeah you are beautiful
but you dont mean a thing to me
yeah you are beautiful
but you dont mean a thing to me
yeah you are beautiful
but you dont mean a thing to me
yeah you are beautiful
but you dont mean a thing to meembed"
