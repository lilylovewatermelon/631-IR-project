her eyes and words are so icy
oh but she burns
like rum on a fire
hot and fast and angry as she can be
i walk my days on a wire

prechorus
it looks ugly but its clean
oh mama dont fuss over me

chorus
the way she tells me im hers and she is mine
open hand or closed fist oh would be fine
the blood is rare and as sweet as cherry wine

verse 2
calls of guilty thrown at me all while she stains
the sheets of some other
thrown at me so powerfully just like she throws
with the arm of her brother

prechorus
but i want it its a crime
that shes not around most of the time
see hozier liveget tickets as low as 35you might also likechorus
the way she shows me im hers and she is mine
open hand or closed fist oh would be fine
the blood is rare and as sweet as cherry wine

guitar solo

verse 3
her fight and furys fiery
oh but she loves
like sleep to the freezing
sweet and right and merciful im all but washed
in the tide of her breathing

prechorus
and its worth it its divine
i have this some of the time

chorus
the way she shows me im hers and she is mine
open hand or closed fist oh would be fine
the blood is rare and as sweet as cherry wine99embed"
