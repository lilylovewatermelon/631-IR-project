now and then
i think about you now and then
when i see that chevrolet
that certain shade of blue
i hear that song the one we sang all summer long
and even though its been so long it brings me back
right back to you

chorus
i hope you find the storm that you were chasing
hope your eyes are still as full of dreams
as they were that night when you slipped off those cut off jeans
when i hear the sound of high tide thunder
i can see your hair blowing in the breeze
i think about how you and that 21 summer made a man of me
yeah you made a man of me

verse 2
how you been

youre the only broken heart ive ever had
and love to have again

chorus
i hope you find the storm that you were chasing
hope your eyes are still as full of dreams
as they were that night when you slipped off those cut off jeans
when i hear the sound of high tide thunder
i can see your hair blowing in the breeze
i think about how you and that 21 summer made a man of me
yeah you made a man of me
yeah you made a man of mesee brothers osborne liveget tickets as low as 55you might also like1embed"
