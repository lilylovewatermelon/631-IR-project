verse 1
i never never had a dream come true
in my every dream im loved by you
and were free as the wind
and true love is no sin
therefore men are men not machines

verse 2
i never never had a dream come true
without you the world out there is painted shades of blue
since our roads never cross
i work just to please the boss
think i might as well get lost in my dreams

i never never had a dream come true

seems my folks are ashamed
said i aint worth a thing
but im glad im chained to my dreams
