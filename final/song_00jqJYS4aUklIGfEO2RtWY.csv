add nice sugar and spice
ill take you on a cruise to somewhere nice
you havent been before
love was meant for more
you moved up close i could feel your sweat
i kissed you on the neck and you got wet
its a shallow treat for a guy like me

chorus
everybodys looking at you like they want to
like they want to go home with you
everybodys looking at you like they want to
everybodys looking at you like they want to
everybodys looking at you like they want to
like they want to go home with you

verse 2
ive got nothin keeping me here
ive wasted all the love that i hold dear
ill throw a dart laÂ 
the wolf has run away
the guy you know thinks hes so slick
hell kiss you on the lips but hell get sick
lothario
hes a creep you know
you might also likechorus
everybodys looking at you like they want to
like they want to go home with you
everybodys looking at you like they want to
everybodys looking at you like they want to
everybodys looking at you like they want to
like they want to go home with you

verse 3
im on your trail i can smell your blood
ive had enough of unrequited love
its the coast i crave
leads me to my grave
fillin my head was the sick of my spine
give it up and i will make you mine
i will buy you things
like diamond rings

chorus
everybodys looking at you like they want to
like they want to go home with you
everybodys looking at you like they want to
everybodys looking at you like they want to
everybodys looking at you like they want to
like they want to go home with you1embed"
