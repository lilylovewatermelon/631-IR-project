welcome to the farm
where you can roll your windows down
baby take my arm
ain’t hearin nothing such a beautiful sound

chorus
we can take the tractor down the road
go walkin round the bend
lay by the river climb up in the barn
welcome to the farm yeah yeah

verse 2
there ain’t no card in yo pocket
if were gonna to turn that old gas pump on
its cash for everything around here
thats just the way its been for so long
how you like our coke from a green glass bottle
its colder than that plastic stuff
watch how miss annie at the counter
