like the poison running through your veins
youre addicted to the pain and the shame
chasing the same game every day
hooked on all your bullshit and your vanity

prechorus
blind decisions no regrets
a bitter sweet of toxic sweat

chorus
take my pride taken chances
all my life never answers
but in time you just wait
youre gonna say my name
break this bind cut my losses
no more carrying all your crosses
cause in time you just wait
youre gonna say my name
oh youre gonna say my name

verse 2
a normal situation in disguise
dragging me through your selfinflicted lies
too bad youre never gonna win this game
your miserys your only friend and youre to blame

bridge
bringing everybody down down down
and turn it around into the same game
twisting it upside down another goaround
