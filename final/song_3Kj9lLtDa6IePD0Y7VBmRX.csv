thrid districts who i represent
one of the watches look like a peppermint
shake your frame is what saltnpepa meant
cops cant spray the dudes face wit peppermint hey it wasnt me
man cause i put the iron on em
heavy starch put da hol 9 on em
heavy spark now the dirt lyin on him
oops my bad found out they was lyin on him oh well
got a flat need a car jack
better yet need a strap cause the car jacked let me catch him
trackboyz where the stars at
have you got to the track like tall cat keep it movin
but ill never leave my hood derty
if i fell and got my hood dirty got my hood dirty
even when i get this good thirty
imma be in the hood wit a good birdy a good birdy

got a pocket full of crack welcome to the hood
lost your money shootin craps welcome to the hood
have you ever been car jacked welcome to the hoodembed"
