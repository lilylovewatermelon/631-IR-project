i look at her in that paper dress
i wonder why she wont burn
shes just a paper doll thats all
just a paper doll

they try her on for size she fits nice
one size fits all
they try her on for size she fits nice
one size fits all

now her soul is dead
now her bodys raw
you can numb her pain

watch the blood run down her face
but dont take notice
and watch the blood run down her arms

now her bodys raw
