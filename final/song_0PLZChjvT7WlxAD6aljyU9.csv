hey maverick um thanks again for letting me be the feature on my song
yeah yeah as long as i get my drip by the end of the week i need to make a big edge shaker disposit long mcquade on me

verse 1
one thing that i’ve learned is i’m only cool in my circle
outside of that i’m a no one that nobody’s heard of
im not even worth it so why am i working so hard to be better
when i’m just a regular person
i’m nothing to you so then i go and sit in my room and i do what i gotta do whoo whoo whoo
what did i walk into
zip it cause imma get mad if you call me a local rapper
i’m tryna get out of here not even proud of it
why are you are you pulling me back into the city that said i was trash i’m done with it

maverick
look all im saying is ive never witnessed an intelligent person listening to mumble rap

tyse nett
i don’t need a feature to be hear
i look in the mirror when i’m feeling comedic
don’t call me a joker i laugh at myself cause i’m keeping a secret
i’m bringing the heat like im walking to phoenix
i’m feeding you something that you don’t believe in
you’re calling me weak well then why are you eating and wanting to hear about all my achievements
i guess you could say that i’m running an errand to get me a beat
imma give a salute to the guy that produced it
if it wasn’t for you i wouldnt be writing this music and
yeah ima christian 100 i’m a rapper
but i think that you got it backward
if you think i only write music for pastors
you might also likemaverick
you know greta thunberg what does she actually do

chorus
i think that we gotta a problem gotta problem
maybe i’m not what you wanted what you wanted
try to run but i keep falling i keep falling
i’m a no one i just hate that you keep talking you keep talkin
i just hate that you keep talking you keep talking
i think that we gotta a problem gotta problem
maybe i’m not what you wanted what you wanted
try to run but i keep falling i keep falling
i’m a no one i just hate that you keep talking you keep talkin
i just hate that you keep talking you keep talking

verse 2
i’ll give you five seconds cause i know that you need to breath
im feeling bad for your ego it’s tired of waking up
let me go put it to sleep permanently
oh something accrued ta me while i was watching my sunday cartoons tt was bothering me
just because you have a following doesn’t mean anyone has to go kiss up and earn your humility
sing me a lullaby i got a problem with artists who get some publicity
thinking because of it they can be publicly ignorant
oh you gotta be kidding me
who do you think that youre better then
i like to level with people you step on
but i gotta stop getting aggressive
i’m gonna drop every weapon
i don’t think i’d ever fall
i wish that they never talked
make forever stay it sounds incredible like kevin pauls
hit em all with this but i seem pretty off because they pick apart the little flaws and tell every single song is written wrong
cutting you out if you’re arrogant
you think i care about you cause you’re ego is very big
honestly i think it’s kind you’re embarrassing
nothing is special about me
yeah but i’ll tell you one thing i’m proud of
i got a call from a person who doubted me when i was younger he told me i wouldn’t amount to a thing and now whoo whoo whoo
chorus
i think that we gotta a problem gotta problem
maybe i’m not what you wanted what you wanted
try to run but i keep falling i keep falling
i’m a no one i just hate that you keep talking you keep talkin
i just hate that you keep talking you keep talking
i think that we gotta a problem gotta problem
maybe i’m not what you wanted what you wanted
try to run but i keep falling i keep falling
i’m a no one i just hate that you keep talking you keep talkin
i just hate that you keep talking you keep talking

verse 3
maybe i’ll become a little more drip if i sit in my living room
set up a video hit up a lip sink to one of the hit songs
i bet they call me the bomb when i blow up on tiktok tiktok tiktok
i don’t got time i’m not the best but i know that i have to be better
i gotta goal
i wanna talk to a label like capitol records
but i don’t think i could get half their attention
even if i wrote a message with capital letters
maverick gaudete is the head of the song
i don’t see where the humor is
we can aluminate make you hallucinate
hate what is beautiful i don’t want you to be losing the views again
put us in unison music is ludicrous wooo drip
outro tyse nett  maverick
yo i didnt know you could rap like that
well uh maybe one day youll be as good me tyseembed"
