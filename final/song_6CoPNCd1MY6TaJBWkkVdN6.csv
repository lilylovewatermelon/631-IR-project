like a desert calls the rain on the hottest driest day
and when those storm clouds hit it comes alive
like a guitar calls for strings without em it cant sing
about that girl shes my world the one thing on my mind

chorus
is that riding down the road her shotgun with me
those cometobed eyes when shes had too many
the way she dont have to say a thing
shes callin my name
that wink when her dress starts falling
the way shes gotten my heart wrapped up all in one look
she dont even say a thing
and shes callin my name

bridge
like a jukebox calls for change so it can pick a love song to play
just like last call calls for one more drink

chorus
is that riding down the road her shotgun with me
those cometobed eyes when shes had too many
the way she dont have to say a thing
shes callin my name
that wink when her dress starts falling
the way shes gotten my heart wrapped up all in one look
she dont even say a thing
and shes callin my name

her kiss her touch says please stay longer
every day her love gets stronger
shes callin my name
with every glance it just gets louder
i cant help but think about her
shes callin my name

chorus
is that riding down the road her shotgun with me
those cometobed eyes when shes had too many
the way she dont have to say a thing
shes callin my name
that wink when her dress starts falling
the way shes gotten my heart wrapped up all in one look
she dont even say a thing
and shes callin my name

outro
that girl is callin my nameembed"
