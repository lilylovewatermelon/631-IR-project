show us off to all your friends
were the trophy boys from here to if and when
we break and break your dreams of
keeping us a secret
were the backpocket believers
were the locals who went postal
call it treason while you can

prechorus
im just a face for every picture
a smile for your scrapbooks
and a story to be told to be told but im
but im loving every second
so commemorate this hour
as the last i spend regretting what i have

chorus
boys raise your glasses
girls shake those—
get up get up get up
were the party youre the people
lets make this night a classic
we play you move
come on let me hear you
were the party youre the people
and this is how we this is how we do
see all time low liveget tickets as low as 114you might also likeverse 2
the curtains rising im forgetting where ive been
i watch the lights go up on a star without his screen
set it off and say it back
directions keeping me on track
but ill admit i do it all for the attention

prechorus
im just a face for every picture
a smile for your scrapbooks
and a story to be told to be told but im
but im loving every second
so commemorate this hour
as the last i spend regretting what i have

chorus
boys raise your glasses
girls shake those—
get up get up get up
were the party youre the people
lets make this night a classic
we play you move
come on let me hear you
were the party youre the people
and this is how we this is how we doembed"
