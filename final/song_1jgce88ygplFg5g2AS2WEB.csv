girl you are rich even with nothing
and you know tenderness comes from pain
its amazing how you love
and love is kind and love can give and get no gain

chorus
its down a rugged road youve come
though you had every reason
you didnt come undone
somehow you made it to the other side
you didnt suffer in vain

verse 2
you forgive those who have trespassed against you
and you know tenderness comes from pain
its amazing how you love
and love is kind and love can give and love needs no gain

chorus
its down a rugged road youve come
though you had every reason
you didnt come undone
somehow you made it to the other side
you didnt suffer in vain
