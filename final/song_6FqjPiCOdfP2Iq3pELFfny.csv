all those wasted hours we used to know
spent the summer staring out the window
the wind it takes you where it wants to go
first they built the road then they built the town
lalalala lalalalaah
that’s why we’re still driving around and around
and all we see are kids in buses longing to be free

chorus
wasted hours before we knew
where to go and what to do
wasted hours that you make new
and turn into a life that we can live

verse 2
some cities make you lose your head
lalalala lalalalaah
endless suburbs stretched out thin and dead
what was that line you said
something about how time runs down
wishing you were anywhere but here
lalalala lalalalaah
you watch the life you’re living disappear
and now i see we’re still kids in buses longing to be free
see arcade fire liveget tickets as low as 81you might also likechorus
wasted hours before we knew
where to go and what to do
wasted hours that you make new
and turn into a life that we can live

outro
a life that we can live
a life that we can live
don’t hold me down don’t hold me down
don’t hold me down don’t hold me
a life that we can live
a life that we can live
don’t hold me down don’t hold me down
don’t hold me down don’t hold me
don’t hold me down don’t hold me down
don’t hold me down don’t hold me down
don’t hold meembed"
