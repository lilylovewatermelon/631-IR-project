something thats been on my mind
its really very simple
but the words arent easy to find
you know you can depend on me
ill be anything you want me to be
anything you choose
you know i couldnt refuse

i never felt so much loving
didnt know that i could feel this way
im not a yes kind of woman
but i d do anything you say
we dont have to scream and shout it
we dont have to tell the world about it
its easy when you feel the way i do

oh i do it for you and only you
you know i do it for you and only you
i do it for you oh yeah
i do it for you only you

if you lose your direction
and you cant seem to find your way
you wont have to worry
cause ill be right with you anyway
to guide you through the darkest nights
i was there holding you tight
im the lover who can always pull you through

if you wanted me to
noones gonna stop me
