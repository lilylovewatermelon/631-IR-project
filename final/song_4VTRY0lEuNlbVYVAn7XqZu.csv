somewhere between my tongue and cheek
i can feel the hands on me
pulls me in so we are facetoface
i dont wanna see it i dont wanna see

prechorus
hold my head up cant avert my eyes
spots and rats on me i dont wanna see
claw the ground up get me out of this
never wanted this never needed this

chorus
and you left me and i left you
and you left me and i left you too

verse 2
chair is stained and i cant stay awake
bring forth evidence to keep me sane
i cant keep this riddle locked inside
seven ways to keep my secrets tied

prechorus
cant believe this i belong in chains
separated it was me and something else
now im numbing get me out of this
never wanted this never needed this

and you left me and i left you

and you left me and i left you
and you left me and i left you too

verse 3
arms stretched out giving thanks to pain
spotlight looking down im ashamed
kneeling with my forehead to the ground
i cant help but flinch before im found

prechorus
i dont need you cant you see behind
doesnt matter now doesnt matter anymore
maybe made me get me out of this
never wanted this never needed this

chorus
and you left me and i left you
and you left me
and motherfucker then i left you and
and you left me and i left you
and you left me and i left you too
