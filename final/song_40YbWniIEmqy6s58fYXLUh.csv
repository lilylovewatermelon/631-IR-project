i could be with anybody i choose you
still its no excuse to abuse you
but no one knows what im goin through so id use you
to be truthful i wouldnt know what to do if i lose you
so i refuse to might have a screw loose and a fuse blew
but i think i might be buildin up a tolerance to you
cause one minute im hollerin screw you
next i take it back guess you can say im tryna unscrew you
but the shits about to pop off yeah i feel you up
then i got you totally open as soon as i take your top off
youre so hard to resist you knock my socks off
my friends say youre bad for me hogwash

chorus
ill never love again
the way i loved you
did you find someone new
are you doin this with them
cause i remember when
still remember when you was mine yeah
we were inseparable at one time yeah
you know my love for you was undying yeah
used to always have my back

verse 2
some days it feels like youre all that i have
thats why im tryna hold onto you for as long as i can
and you just want me for my money so i got you wrapped all in saran
damn talk about eatin out the palm of my hand
but if not for my financials
i wouldnt have you anyways there have been ample
plenty days where im just in a daze and i cant pull
myself up out this rut and youre so much of a handful
i can only take so much of you all at one time
because too much of yous just too much to swallow sometimes
gotta take you in doses but when youre not at my side
i shake in convulsions separation anxiety cause we may be the closest
yeah baby we hopeless dont we make an atrocious
combination we know its like playin with explosives
quite dangerous though but my brains in hypnosis
such a wide range of emotions
migraines but why the fuck am i takin these motrins
ibuprofens like a drop of rain in the ocean
and youre my fix on the days when im broken
but the shits about to go sideways i just know it

ill never love again
the way i loved you
did you find someone new
are you doin this with them
cause i remember when
still remember when you was mine yeah
we were inseparable at one time yeah
you know my love for you was undying yeah
used to always have my back

verse 3
so i spiral downwardly cause im too cowardly to leave you
head is clouded in a fallacy but in reality
somehow it seems like when i lay me down to sleep im counting sheep
youre bound to creep
cause every time i turn around you keep runnin out on me
youre my xanax and my valium im an addict youre a downer
youre my habit its like i found you in the cabinet
but its like i cant uncap it cause its childproof
a scoundrel and fiends how i feel around you
awful every time i lost you felt like i had you in my pocket
now im flippin over the furniture punchin holes in the walls through
everything that weve gone through
how many times youve fucked me
but the way it felt for me to be on top when i was on you
swore my fealty but word to god
i thought you loved me bitch you tried to kill me im getting off you
quit callin for me hard proofs how i respond to
the ambien and tylenols too
fuck all you
outro
fuckin bitch
