its a mistake
but go ahead and take a side
but watch how you choose
or be headed for a ride
cause i i just dont know if i could

chorus
i cant stop what you began
i cant fight for what you began

verse 2
youve opened the gates
now face the other side
just go on its cool
now head into the fire
well i i just dont know if i could

chorus
i cant stop what you began
cant fight for what you began
i know whats in sight
for you again

verse 3
switch on your game
stop wasting all your time
cause surprise its you
wholl face what you decide
well i i think id have known about you
you might also likechorus
i cant stop what you began
cant fight for what you began
i know whats in sight
i know your fate
i know i cant stop what you began
