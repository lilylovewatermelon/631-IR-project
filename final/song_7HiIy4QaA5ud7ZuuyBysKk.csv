woke up in a bad place
should probably get up so im not late
stared at my phone for the past eight
minutes at nothin my head aches
bottles empty by the lampshade
im out of excedrin again great
too early to tell but at this rate
im thinkin this might be a bad day
i walk out the bedroom my roommates
asleep on the couch with her twofaced
boyfriend who lives here but dont pay
a penny for rent but he still stays
she says hes broke im like no way
probably sells drugs but she wont say
told me he dabbles in real estate
i mean i dont believe it but okay
okay pull out the driveway
notice my gas tanks on e again well of course it is
guess i probably should stop at the gas station
so i take a right pull up to the pump
while its pumpin i look at my ashtray
then remember i need to get cigarettes cigarettes
anything to help my mind state
so i park and walk inside—wait
i should probably get somethin to drink and eat i guess
so i find and grab a couple bags of chips
wheres the candy aisle oh yeah here it is
which one should i get should i grab the starburst or
change it up and maybe grab the twix
mm grab the starburst then i started walkin
as i pass the garbage and i reach the fridge
i hear someone yellin at the front of the store
probably just a homeless guy getting bored
probably just a customer whose card
didnt work and now he wants to start a war
man i cant afford to
keep buyin energy drinks everyday i shut the door then
turn around and as im headin towards the counter
with my drink i hear hey open up the drawer
crouching on the floor
peek around the aisle gun is on the fore
head of the man thats behind the counter
now my heart is poundin and im prayin to the lord
i dont die today i cant die today
i got things to do tryin not to shake
plotting my escape wheres my cellphone at
left it in my car icing on the cake
i start crawling i can hear em yellin
i want every penny i want every dime yeah
once you finish with the cash
open up the bag throw some cigarettes inside yeah
which ones do you want which ones do you want
im not picky give me any kind
give me all of em yeah just toss em in
keep it movin though im runnin low on time and
id advise ya to move a little quicker
trust me i dont wanna have to pull the trigger
ive done it before its not a pretty picture
what you dont believe me im just playin with ya
well no im not no im not
just do what i say cause if you even think of tryna pull a fast one on me
promise youll be sorry
oh my drivers calling i cant miss my pickup
thats when i did somethin stupid
and my jacket knocked over a can of soup and then
it got quiet did he hear me movin shh
hold my breath he mustve heard me do it huh
im assumin the
noise mustve made him turn his head enough
to let the guy that was at gunpoint grab his own gun
now they both got weapons
maybe i should help him
sneak up slow and deck him
time to go time to go time to go
its gon be a bloody miracle
now or never god if i had any blessings
comin in my future could you send em to my present
peek around the edge and i start runnin at him
he dont see me comin does he steppin closer
grab his neck and hold him squeezin on his throat
im tryna choke him then his elbow hits my nose and
think he broke it i think he broke it my
blood is leakin all over my clothes i try
not to let go but my hands begin to slip and bullets start to fly
gunshots cant see out my eyes
gunshot cashier still alive
i cant tell im tryna crawl away here comes another guy
he runs inside like wheres the money
did you get the money wheres the bag you brought ayy
i dont know i think its still behind the counter
prolly by the cashier i just shot ayy
whos this on the floor whos this on the floor
i dont know well did they call the cops
he runs up to me then he grabs my shoulder
as he flips me over then my jaw drops cause
i thought his voice sounded real familiar hes
got a mask on but the shirt hes wearing
is the same one he had on this morning
staring in my eyes i know he knows i know
embarrassed he stands above me and says sorry erin but
i dont have a choice he holds the barrel up
to my head i scream you cant be serious
he shakes his head and says im sorry then the gun— gunshot
see nf liveget tickets as low as 64you might also likeinterlude

outro
cashier yells to ask if im okay hes dialing 911
i run over to him grab his phone and try to help him up
911 whats your emergency
theres been a robbery the cashier was shot he needs an ambulance
he looks kinda pale i think he mightve lost a lot of blood
okay help is on the way has anybody else been injured
