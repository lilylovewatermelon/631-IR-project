bad luck to talk on these rides
mind on the road your dilated eyes watch the clouds float
white ferrari had a good time
sweet sixteen how was i supposed to know anything
i let you out at central
i didnt care to state the plain
kept my mouth closed
were both so familiar
white ferrari good times

verse 2
stick by me close by me
you were fine you were fine here
thats just a slow body
you left when i forgot to speak
so i text the speech lesser speeds texas speed yes
basic takes its toll on me ventually ventually yes
ahh on me ventually ventually yes

verse 3
i care for you still and i will forever
that was my part of the deal honest
we got so familiar
spending each day of the year
white ferrari good times
in this life life in this life life
one too many years
some tattooed eyelids on a facelift
thought you might want to know now
mind over matter is magic i do magic
if you think about it itll be over in no time
and thats life
love

im sure were taller in another dimension
you say were small and not worth the mention
you’re tired of movin your bodys achin
we could vacay theres places to go
clearly this isnt all that there is
cant take whats been given no way
but were so okay here were doing fine
primal and naked
you dream of walls that hold us in prison
its just a skull least thats what they call it
and were free to roam191embed"
