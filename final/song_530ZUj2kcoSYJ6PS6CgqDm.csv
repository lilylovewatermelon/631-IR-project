one million beats but theyre not the same
morning light streaming through my window pane
being true just hold me close like it was just like it was
three minutes since ive been at your door
all the dust has settled so has the score
still long for your touch
the feelings are my fault and not enough believe me now
girl dont you pretend girl can make amens
the desire give a sign that you are still mine
