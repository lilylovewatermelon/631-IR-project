the day that i met you i started dreaming
now i write em down if i remember in the mornin time
i dont know that much about kingston
but i like the sound it makes when it starts pouring rain
i think that tonight ill leave my light on
cause i get lonely when its out and i miss you right about now

chorus
baby tell me where you want to go
baby tell me what you want to know
give you everything i have and more

verse 2
he said baby—thats what he called me—i love you
every single word you say makes me feel some type of way
its the thought of you that slightly scares me
but it takes my breath away forget what i was gonna say
the day that i met you i started dreaming
now i write em down if i remember in the mornin time

chorus
baby tell me where you want to go
baby tell me what you want to know
give you everything i have and more
baby tell me where you want to go
baby tell me what you want to know
give you everything i have and more
baby tell me where you want to go
baby tell me what you want to know
give you everything i have and moresee faye webster liveget tickets as low as 47you might also like11embed"
