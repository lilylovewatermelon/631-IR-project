verse 3  trick daddy
some of the dudes we thought was real ogs was obs
cause they talked pleas and included gs like you and me
the first step was going to set a trap
so in a short period they convinced the grand jury to allow a phone tap
and if they listenin
not once did they hear us mentioning
murder and a cocaine distributing
through all that was dividends comin in
im strict legit and better yet we too smart for ya bullshit
callin all cars callin all cars
hit your burglar alarm
and tell em hurry up and come them niggas got gunz
man down shots fired only fuck niggas and cops died
first stage of a riot
and them fucks couldnt sneak by
oh you want to witness some shit
fine bitch be quiet
because they only got what you tell em
and only witness that they had the bitch was layin there dead
shot in the street all red with two shots to his head
cause he was workin for the feds
and the last informant informed us
they had it out for us
for a bird that he got popped for
so ride or die for him ride or die for him
better yet you better kill em
cause i think hes gonna be the bitch to tell em
and he probably done already told em
but then again with out a witness them bitches aint got shit
hook  ill will
if ya real like me like me
throw ya hoods in the air so the whole wide world can see ay
last of a dying breed last of a dying breed last of a dying breed
and if ya real like me like me
keep that thang on ya hip thats just the way that its gotta be
last of a dying breed last of a dying breed last of a dying breed3embed"
