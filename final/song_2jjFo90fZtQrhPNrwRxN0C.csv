i want to be grateful for the experiences that ive had
i want to be grateful for the experiences that ive had
i want to be grateful for the experiences that ive had

verse 1
thought i wanted to forget my past
tried to leave the pieces of a broken man
what it cost i aint ever getting back
breaking the lines cause i wanna remember

prechorus 1
i was feeling like i never was young
followed a dream and a strange desire
you picked me up in the dead of the night
and gave me a chance to move on inside of your mystery

chorus
maybe i dont need to understand
why your love love love is such a mystery
maybe i dont need to understand
why your love love love your love is such a mystery

verse 2
want to give you something better than ive been
i wanna write your name up on my wall
wake you up in the dead of the night
breaking the lines just trying to get better
see bleachers liveget tickets as low as 52you might also likeprechorus 2
man i was feeling like i never was young
no nothing simple bout the simple days i mourn
if what i lost aint ever coming back
then i can find a way to move inside of your mystery

chorus
maybe i dont need to understand
why your love love love is such a mystery
maybe i dont need to understand
why your love love love is such a mystery

bridge
no god holding on tightly
your love holy inside of me
no god holding on tightly
your love holy inside of me
no god holding on tightly
your love holy inside of me
no god holding on tightly
your love holy inside of me

someday im gonna make this right
someday when the lights are low
someday im gonna get on my knees
someday baby im gonna beg you
someday im gonna get this right
someday when the lights are low
someday im gonna get on my knees
someday baby im gonna beg for your mystery
chorus
maybe i dont need to understand
why your love love love is such a mystery

why your love love love is such a mystery
