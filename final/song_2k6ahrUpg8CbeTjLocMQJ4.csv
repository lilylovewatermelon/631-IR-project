i had a hundred dollar ring in my hand
so weak and tired i could barely stand
from being up all night praying shed say yes
so with a hopeful heart i hit one knee
with a tear in her eye she looked at me
it was the moment of truth i was scared to death
my life hung on what that tear meant
then she smiled at me
and i lost it

chorus
no one can make me cry make me laugh
make me smile or drive me mad like she does
its like the curse that is the cure
better or worse one things for sure
its real love
and i dont know what id do
if i lost it

verse 2
well the honeymoon ended and life began
jobs and bills losing touch with friends
and that apartment it got smaller everyday
then one night the walls finally closed in
i came home late she said whereve you been
you used to call and tell me you were on your way
she said if this is how its gonna be then i quit
then she walked out the door
i lost it

no one can make me cry make me laugh
make me smile or drive me mad like she does
its like the curse that is the cure
better or worse one things for sure
its real love
and i dont know what id do
if i lost it

bridge
i picked myself up off the floor
she walked back through the door
we made love like it was the first time

chorus
no one can make me cry make me laugh
make me smile or drive me mad like she does
its like the curse that is the cure
better or worse one things for sure
its real love
and i dont know what id do
if i lost it
oh if i lost it if i lost it
i dont wanna lose itembed"
