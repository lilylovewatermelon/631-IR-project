i have a dream a song to sing
to help me cope with anything
if you see the wonder of a fairy tale
you can take the future even if you fail

i believe in angels
something good in everything i see
i believe in angels
when i know the time is right for me
ill cross the stream
i have a dream

verse 2
i have a dream a fantasy
to help me through reality
and my destination makes it worth the while
pushing through the darkness still another mile

chorus
i believe in angels
something good in everything i see
i believe in angels
when i know the time is right for me
ill cross the stream
i have a dream
ill cross the stream
