being faced with what im faced with i feel like i cant rock
like a rock hit my heart
started to chain the day and exploded into pieces

chorus
marry me stay the same
lie to me and try to say you never will
marry me stay the same
lie to me and try to tell me

verse 2
ive got a feeling in my gut now fills me with so much hope
said fuck it im fine dine and dashed
the pianist peddled into morning morning

chorus
marry me stay the same
lie to me and try to say you never will
marry me stay the same
lie to me and try to say you never

bridge
morning morning
