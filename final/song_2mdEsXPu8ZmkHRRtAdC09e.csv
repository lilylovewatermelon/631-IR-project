cinnamon in my teeth
from your kiss youre touching me
all the pills that you take
violet blue green red to keep me at arms length dont work
you try to push me out but i just find my way back in
violet blue green red to keep me out i win

theres things i wanna say to you
but ill just let you live
like if you hold me without hurting me
youll be the first who ever did
theres things i wanna talk about
but better not to give
but if you hold me without hurting me
youll be the first who ever did
