yeah most of my lifes full of sad days
started at a young age
yeah bought a house but ive been livin on stage
tryna find the real me i aint found it yet
wake up every morning feelin like im guilty
talk to god can you hear me
lately im a mess
i dont want no one to help me
yeah i dont want no one to help me and

prechorus 1
if you think that i make decisions based off of what you think then youre wrong
cant nobody think for me i got my own thoughts
sometimes you dont know what you had until its all gone till its all gone
if i took the hand that was dealt me then i would be nowhere in life
yeah i had to think smart
threw away the deck and got my own cards
long before i had the money to afford a car

prechorus 2
if you think that im bout to change who i am just for you then youre so wrong
as a kid i built a house around my broke heart
sometimes you dont know what you had until it falls apart till it falls apart

verse 3
yeah im reminiscin back to both of us laughin
playin old records thinkin every one of ems classic
windows down we on the street up in michigan rappin
we talked about it but never really knew it could happen
my confidence about as low as the gas is
we didnt have the money for it so wed turn the key backwards and sit in parking lots for hours till the battery crashes
i think that we related cause both of us were lookin for answers
a couple months ago i drove into gladwin got me all in my feelings
its somethin bout bein somewhere thats familiar
pull in the gas station open up the tank then i fill it then laugh
would i move back mm not in a million but i appreciate the memories we had
i know youve been callin sorry i never call back
i know ive been distant you know i never meant that
you can tell the family how im doing if they ask
im just doin me70embed"
