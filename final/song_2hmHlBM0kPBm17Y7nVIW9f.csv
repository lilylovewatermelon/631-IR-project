if you can summon the strength tow me
i cant hold down the urgency
youve got to make your descent slowly
and oil up those sticky keys

chorus
coax me out my low
and have a spin of my propeller

verse 2
its a necessary evil
no cause for emergency
borrowed the beak off a bald eagle
oh momentary synergy

chorus
coax me out my low
sink into tomorrow
coax me out my low
and have a spin of my propeller

outro
my propeller wont spin
and i cant get it started on my own
when are you arriving
oh my propeller wont spin
and i cant get it started on my own
when are you arriving
oh my propeller wont spin
and i cant get it started on my own
when are you arriving
oh my propelleryou might also like25embed"
