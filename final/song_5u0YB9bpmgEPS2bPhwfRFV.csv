i never thought that you would be the one to hold my heart
but you came around and you knocked me off the ground from the start

bridge
you put your arms around me
and i believe that its easier for you to let me go
you put your arms around me and im home

verse 2
how many times will you let me change my mind and turn around
i cant decide if ill let you save my life or if ill drown

hook
i hope that you see right through my walls
i hope that you catch me cause im already falling
ill never let our love get so close
you put your arms around me and im home

verse 3
the world is coming down on me and i cant find a reason to be loved
i never wanna leave you but i cant make you bleed if im alone

bridge
you put your arms around me
and i believe that its easier for you to let me go
