i think about you know life and what it really means
i drink about it i think im busting at the seams
dont over think it i think somebody told me that before
yea whatever thats my attitude what can i say evidently
i was raised to be this way but incidentally
theres days i really want to change if heaven sent me
then why do i feel this crazy
got a man down mayday mayday

hook
bottles and cans seeds and stems
down to my last roach here i am again
caught between tomorrow and yesterday
telling myself itll be okay
bottles and cans seeds and stems
will i ever change guess it all depends
feels like nothin ever went my way
telling myself itll be okay

verse 2
brokenhearted ive been listenin to my head scream
got it spark it you hear that or is it just me
whats the matter are you feeling just like me
has anybody seen my mind i cant find it life is flyin
somebody rewind it were all dying and just runnin around blinded
i think weve gotten a little too open minded
got a man down mayday mayday

bottles and cans seeds and stems
down to my last roach here i am again
caught between tomorrow and yesterday
telling myself itll be okay
bottles and cans seeds and stems
will i ever change guess it all depends
feels like nothin ever went my way
telling myself itll be okay

verse 3
broke and lonely
choking on dro can i borrow another tommorow dear lord
im scopin hopin some door can open
and my folks dont even know me no more
my kids are growin and my age is showin
are the seeds i sowing gonna sprout im not sure
the doubt and the lure and a couch of velour
with a mirror and a blade and a pile of the pure

hook
bottles and cans seeds and stems
down to my last roach here i am again
caught between tomorrow and yesterday
telling myself itll be okay
bottles and cans seeds and stems
will i ever change guess it all depends
feels like nothin ever went my way
telling myself itll be okay
bottles and cans seeds and stems
down to my last roach here i am again
caught between tomorrow and yesterday
telling myself itll be okay
bottles and cans seeds and stems
will i ever change guess it all depends
feels like nothin ever went my way
telling myself itll be okay
