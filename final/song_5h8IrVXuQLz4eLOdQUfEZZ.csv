woke up this morning i had mondo on my mind
he came to me in a dream he said roll im doing fine
it’s been a while since he died but i talk to him all the time
but to see him in the flesh there aint a cliff i wouldnt dive
i wish i could have a drink with 
tell him how his brother  doing
tell him how  kushy and  doing
it breaks my heart to see what happened to chop
man i just seen him at the video for tears could talk

chorus jelly roll
i wish i had one more ride through the hood blowing good with you
i wish i could hide from the truth but the truth is i fucking miss you
i would give all of this money away
trade it all for just one more day
if i had one more ride we could roll one last time

verse 2 jelly roll
damn it feels like a piece of me’s missing
it dont help when im riding and i start reminiscing
when we pulled up just you and me to meet the three that money mike had
wed leave there hit a side street get a ninepiece and wed split halves
these memories hit ya
in love with the passion no matter what happened i swear that id never forget you
i promised the fam id do all i can and try to look out for your children
youre more than a friend to me sipping this hennessy thinkin’ ’bout how much i miss you
cause i’m flipping through pictures damn
its still me and jerry g i keep up with marcus for ya
lil billy kept that 41 colt you got em
see jelly roll liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likechorus jelly roll
i wish i had one more ride through the hood blowing good with you
i wish i could hide from the truth but the truth is i fucking miss you
i would give all of this money away
trade it all for just one more day
if i had one more ride we could roll one last time

verse 3 mynamekushy
one last one one last one
ice in the kitchen we back in the bowls
 wasn’t working jelly wanna know
we turned the back roads
one last one one last one
i need to do with my bros we live for each other
until one passed two passed three passed four

 i cant lose no more
i miss my lil bro
remember we would laugh when times were so bad
ducking cops with crack rocks 
i just need one last one
conversation on the phone when they revoked my bond
if i left this earth first you would take care my son
but  so i take care of mom

chorus jelly roll
i wish i had one more ride through the hood blowing good with you
i wish i could hide from the truth but the truth is i fucking miss you
i would give all of this money away
trade it all for just one more day
if i had one more ride we could roll one last timeembed"
