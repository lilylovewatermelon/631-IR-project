verse 1
i been out on that open road
but you can be my fulltime daddy white and gold
singing blues has been gettin old
but you can be my fulltime baby hot or cold

prechorus 1
dont break me down dont break me down
i been traveling too long i been traveling too long
i been tryin too hard i been tryin too hard
with one pretty song with one pretty song

chorus
i hear the birds on the summer breeze i drive fast
i am alone at midnight
been trying hard not to get into trouble but i
ive got a war in my mind

postchorus

ive got a war in my mind
