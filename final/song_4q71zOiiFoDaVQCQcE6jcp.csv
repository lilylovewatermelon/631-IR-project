friends

verse
as you call em they call you when they need something
trees for the bluntin to gs for the frontin
i found a way to get peace of mind for years and left the hell alone
turn a deaf ear to the cellular phone
send me a letter or better we could see each other in real life
just so you could feel me like a steel knife
at least so you could see the white of they eyes
bright with surprise once they finish spitting lies
associates is your boys your girls bitches niggas homies
close or really dont know me
mom dad comrade peeps brothers sisters duns dunnies
some come around when they need some money
others make us laugh like the sunday funnies
fam be around whether you paid or bummy
you could either ignore this advice or take it from me
be too nice and people take you for a dummy
so nowadays he aint so friendly
actually they wouldn’t even made a worthy enemy
read the signs no feeding the baboons
seein as how they got ya back bleeding from the stab wounds
yall know the dance they smile in ya face yall know the glance
try to put em on they blow the chance
never let your socalled mans know your plans
how many of us have them a show of hands
friends is a term some people use loosely
im real choosy on what i choose to let crew see
you telling me i try to act broke
jealousy the number one killer among black folk
fellas be under some type of spell like crack smoke
ghetto cinderellas lead em right to your stack loc
just another way a chickll lead to your end
i checked the dictionary for the meaning of friend
it said person one likes to socialize with
sympathizer helper and thats about the size of it
most of the time these attributes is onesided
to bolster the crime theyre apt to shoot you through your eyelid
and they cant hide it going wild like a white bitch
sometimes ya need to cut niggas off like a light switch
flick and when things get quiet
catch em like a thief in the night what a riot
i first met mr fantastik at a arms deal
dont let it get drastic think of how your momsll feel
when it get for real steel get to sparkin
everything darken it aint no talkin
for somethin so cheap it sure buys a lot of trouble
ya better off focusing than tryin to plot to bubble
or else itd be a sad note to end on the guns we got is
ones we can depend on friends
some come in the form of codependents
a lot of times only end up being codefendants
ten bucks say they tell for a lower sentence
and leave you up under the jail begging for repentance
it dont make no sense what happened to the loyalty
honor amongst crooks trust among royalty
id rather go out in a blaze than give em the glory
how many of us have— a similar story
friends before lovers we used to have some type of overstanding
just so when i let her get the man thing
she know its no strings we could do the damn thing
but ho its no rings just how the tramp swings
will she see him again that depends on
how good was the skins and could she memorize the lessons
it aint no need to pretend
even though she let him stab it she know theyre just friends

skit
fellas dont be silly i know who my friends are
and the next nice neighborhood i move into you guysll get crack
negro humor always escaped me

outro skit character 1 mr fantastic invisible woman
dr doom character 2
the most powerful the most mysterious monarch in all the world
guided by a fighting force that never sleeps
that never relaxes its vigilance
for none is as feared none has as many foes
as doom the awesome armorclad lord of
i know who doom is then tell us
he happens to be the most dangerous man in the world
i’d hope we’d never hear from him
i’d hope we’d never have to battle him
but now the worst has happened and i must tell you what we’re up against
i first met doom years ago
when he wanted to be alone alone to pursue his forbidden experiments
one day while conducting a secret experiment
explosion sounds later when he recovered from his injuries
instead of having learned his lesson doom was bitter angry vengeful
woman screams what have i done to myself
my face it is hideous
he traveled the world seeking a cure for his disfigured face
i’m sorry sir there is nothing we can do for you
he traveled through remote villages where strangers are seldom seen
he continued his search never showing his face
unless threatened by bandits who prey on travelers
who foolishly wander alone through their domain32embed"
