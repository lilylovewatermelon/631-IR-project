                  the verdurins quarrel with m de charlus

   after dinner i told albertine that since i was out of bed i might as well take the opportunity to go and see some of my friends mme de villeparisis mme de guermantes the cambremers anyone in short whom i might find at home i omitted to mention only the people whom i did intend to see the verdurins i asked her if she would not come with me she pleaded that she had no suitable clothes “besides my hair is so awful do you really wish me to go on doing it like this” and by way of farewell she held out her hand to me in that abrupt fashion the arm outstretched the shoulders thrust back which she used to adopt on the beach at balbec and had since then entirely abandoned this forgotten gesture retransformed the body which it animated into that of the albertine who as yet scarcely knew me it restored to albertine ceremonious beneath an air of rudeness her first novelty her strangeness even her setting i saw the sea behind this girl whom i had never seen shake hands with me in this fashion since i was at the seaside “my aunt thinks it makes me older” she added with a sullen air “oh that her aunt may be right” thought i “that albertine by looking like a child should make mme bontemps appear younger than she is is all that her aunt would ask and also that albertine shall cost her nothing between now and the day when by marrying me she will repay what has been spent on her” but that albertine should appear less young less pretty should turn fewer heads in the street that is what i on the contrary hoped for the age of a duenna is less reassuring to a jealous lover than the age of the woman’s face whom he loves i regretted only that the style in which i had asked her to do her hair should appear to albertine an additional bolt on the door of her prison and it was henceforward this new domestic sentiment that never ceased even when i was parted from albertine to form a bond attaching me to her

   i said to albertine who was not dressed or so she told me to accompany me to the guermantes’ or the cambremers’ that i could not be certain where i should go and set off for the verdurins’ at the moment when the thought of the concert that i was going to hear brought back to my mind the scene that afternoon “grand pied de grue grand pied de grue”— a scene of disappointed love of jealous love perhaps but if so as bestial as the scene to which a woman might be subjected by so to speak an orangoutang that was if one may use the expression in love with her — at the moment when having reached the street i was just going to hail a cab i heard the sound of sobs which a man who was sitting upon a curbstone was endeavouring to stifle i came nearer the man who had buried his face in his hands appeared to be quite young and i was surprised to see from the gleam of white in the opening of his cloak that he was wearing evening clothes and a white tie as he heard my step he uncovered a face bathed in tears but at once having recognised me turned away it was morel he guessed that i had recognised him and checking his tears with an effort told me that he had stopped to rest for a moment he was in such pain “i have grossly insulted only today” he said “a person for whom i had the very highest regard it was a cowardly thing to do for she loves me” “she will forget perhaps as time goes on” i replied without realising that by speaking thus i made it apparent that i had overheard the scene that afternoon but he was so much absorbed in his own grief that it never even occurred to him that i might know something about the affair “she may forget perhaps” he said “but i myself can never forget i am too conscious of my degradation i am disgusted with myself however what i have said i have said and nothing can unsay it when people make me lose my temper i don’t know what i am doing and it is so bad for me my nerves are all on edge” for like all neurasthenics he was keenly interested in his own health if during the afternoon i had witnessed the amorous rage of an infuriated animal this evening within a few hours centuries had elapsed and a fresh sentiment a sentiment of shame regret grief shewed that a great stage had been passed in the evolution of the beast destined to be transformed into a human being nevertheless i still heard ringing in my ears his ‘grand pied de grue‘ and dreaded an imminent return to the savage state i had only a very vague impression however of what had been happening and this was but natural for m de charlus himself was totally unaware that for some days past and especially that day even before the shameful episode which was not a direct consequence of the violinist’s condition morel had been suffering from a recurrence of his neurasthenia as a matter of fact he had in the previous month proceeded as rapidly as he had been able a great deal less rapidly than he would have liked towards the seduction of jupien’s niece with whom he was at liberty now that they were engaged to go out whenever he chose but whenever he had gone a trifle far in his attempts at violation and especially when he suggested to his betrothed that she might make friends with other girls whom she would then procure for himself he had met with a resistance that made him furious all at once whether she would have proved too chaste or on the contrary would have surrendered herself his desire had subsided he had decided to break with her but feeling that the baron vicious as he might be was far more moral than himself he was afraid lest in the event of a rupture m de charlus might turn him out of the house and so he had decided a fortnight ago that he would not see the girl again would leave m de charlus and jupien to clean up the mess he employed a more realistic term by themselves and before announcing the rupture to ‘b ——off’ to an unknown destination

   for all that his conduct towards jupien’s niece coincided exactly in its minutest details with the plan of conduct which he had outlined to the baron as they were dining together at saintmars le vêtu it is probable that his intention was entirely different and that sentiments of a less atrocious nature which he had not foreseen in his theory of conduct had improved had tinged it with sentiment in practice the sole point in which on the contrary the practice was worse than the theory is this that in theory it had not appeared to him possible that he could remain in paris after such an act of betrayal now on the contrary actually to ‘b ——— off’ for so small a matter seemed to him quite unnecessary it meant leaving the baron who would probably be furious and forfeiting his own position he would lose all the money that the baron was now giving him the thought that this was inevitable made his nerves give away altogether he cried for hours on end and in order not to think about it any more dosed himself cautiously with morphine then suddenly he hit upon an idea which no doubt had gradually been taking shape in his mind and gaining strength there for some time and this was that a rupture with the girl would not inevitably mean a complete break with m de charlus to lose all the baron’s money was a serious thing in itself morel in his uncertainty remained for some days a prey to dark thoughts such as came to him at the sight of bloch then he decided that jupien and his niece had been trying to set a trap for him that they might consider themselves lucky to be rid of him so cheaply he found in short that the girl had been in the wrong in being so clumsy in not having managed to keep him attached to her by a sensual attraction not only did the sacrifice of his position with m de charlus seem to him absurd he even regretted the expensive dinners he had given the girl since they became engaged the exact cost of which he knew by heart being a true son of the valet who used to bring his ‘book’ every month for my uncle’s inspection for the word book in the singular which means a printed volume to humanity in general loses that meaning among royal princes and servants to the latter it means their housekeeping book to the former the register in which we inscribe our names at balbec one day when the princesse de luxembourg told me that she had not brought a book with her i was about to offer her le pêcheur d’islande and tartarîn de tarascon when i realised that she had meant not that she would pass the time less agreeably but that i should find it more difficult to pay a call upon her

   notwithstanding the change in morel’s point of view with regard to the consequences of his behaviour albeit that behaviour would have seemed to him abominable two months earlier when he was passionately in love with jupien’s niece whereas during the last fortnight he had never ceased to assure himself that the same behaviour was natural praiseworthy it continued to intensify the state of nervous unrest in which finally he had announced the rupture that afternoon and he was quite prepared to vent his anger if not save in a momentary outburst upon the girl for whom he still felt that lingering fear the last trace of love at any rate upon the baron he took care however not to say anything to him before dinner for valuing his own professional skill above everything whenever he had any difficult music to play as this evening at the verdurins’ he avoided as far as possible and the scene that afternoon was already more than ample anything that might impair the flexibility of his wrists similarly a surgeon who is an enthusiastic motorist does not drive when he has an operation to perform this accounts to me for the fact that while he was speaking to me he kept bending his fingers gently one after another to see whether they had regained their suppleness a slight frown seemed to indicate that there was still a trace of nervous stiffness but so as not to increase it he relaxed his features as we forbid ourself to grow irritated at not being able to sleep or to prevail upon a woman for fear lest our rage itself may retard the moment of sleep or of satisfaction and so anxious to regain his serenity so that he might as was his habit absorb himself entirely in what he was going to play at the verdurins’ and anxious so long as i was watching him to let me see how unhappy he was he decided that the simplest course was to beg me to leave him immediately his request was superfluous and it was a relief to me to get away from him i had trembled lest as we were due at the same house within a few minutes he might ask me to take him with me my memory of the scene that afternoon being too vivid not to give me a certain distaste for the idea of having morel by my side during the drive it is quite possible that the love and afterwards the indifference or hatred felt by morel for jupien’s niece had been sincere unfortunately it was not the first time that he had behaved thus that he had suddenly ‘dropped’ a girl to whom he had sworn undying love going so far as to produce a loaded revolver telling her that he would blow out his brains if ever he was mean enough to desert her he did nevertheless desert her in time and felt instead of remorse a sort of rancour against her it was not the first time that he had behaved thus it was not to be the last with the result that the heads of many girls — girls less forgetful of him than he was of them — suffered — as jupien’s niece’s head continued long afterwards to suffer still in love with morel although she despised him — suffered ready to burst with the shooting of an internal pain because in each of them — like a fragment of a greek carving — an aspect of morel’s face hard as marble and beautiful as an antique sculpture was embedded in her brain with his blossoming hair his fine eyes his straight nose forming a protuberance in a cranium not shaped to receive it upon which no operation was possible but in the fulness of time these stony fragments end by slipping into a place where they cause no undue discomfort from which they never stir again we are no longer conscious of their presence i mean forgetfulness or an indifferent memory

   meanwhile i had gained two things in the course of the day on the one hand thanks to the calm that was produced in me by albertine’s docility i found it possible and therefore made up my mind to break with her there was on the other hand the fruit of my reflexions during the interval that i had spent waiting for her at the piano the idea that art to which i would try to devote my reconquered liberty was not a thing that justified one in making a sacrifice a thing above and beyond life that did not share in its fatuity and futility the appearance of real individuality obtained in works of art being due merely to the illusion created by the artist’s technical skill if my afternoon had left behind it other deposits possibly more profound they were not to come to my knowledge until much later as for the two which i was able thus to weigh they were not to be permanent for from this very evening my ideas about art were to rise above the depression to which they had been subjected in the afternoon while on the other hand my calm and consequently the freedom that would enable me to devote myself to it was once again to be withdrawn from me

   as my cab following the line of the embankment was coming near the verdurins’ house i made the driver pull up i had just seen brichot alighting from the tram at the foot of the rue bonaparte after which he dusted his shoes with an old newspaper and put on a pair of pearl grey gloves i went up to him on foot for some time past his sight having grown steadily weaker he had been endowed — as richly as an observatory — with new spectacles of a powerful and complicated kind which like astronomical instruments seemed to be screwed into his eyes he focussed their exaggerated blaze upon myself and recognised me they — the spectacles — were in marvellous condition but behind them i could see minute pallid convulsive expiring a remote gaze placed under this powerful apparatus as in a laboratory equipped out of all proportion to the work that is done in it you may watch the last throes of some insignificant animalcule through the latest and most perfect type of microscope i offered him my arm to guide him on his way “this time it is not by great cherbourg that we meet” he said to me “but by little dunkerque” a remark which i found extremely tiresome as i failed to understand what he meant and yet i dared not ask brichot dreading not so much his scorn as his explanations i replied that i was longing to see the room in which swann used to meet odette every evening “what so you know that old story do you” he said “and yet from those days to the death of swann is what the poet rightly calls ‘grande spatium mortalis aevi’”

   the death of swann had been a crushing blow to me at the time the death of swann swann in this phrase is something more than a noun in the possessive case i mean by it his own particular death the death allotted by destiny to the service of swann for we talk of ‘death’ for convenience but there are almost as many different deaths as there are people we are not equipped with a sense that would enable us to see moving at every speed in every direction these deaths the active deaths aimed by destiny at this person or that often there are deaths that will not be entirely relieved of their duties until two or even three years later they come in haste to plant a tumour in the side of a swann then depart to attend to their other duties returning only when the surgeons having performed their operation it is necessary to plant the tumour there afresh then comes the moment when we read in the gaulois that swann’s health has been causing anxiety but that he is now making an excellent recovery then a few minutes before the breath leaves our body death like a sister of charity who has come to nurse rather than to destroy us enters to preside over our last moments crowns with a supreme halo the cold and stiffening creature whose heart has ceased to beat and it is this diversity among deaths the mystery of their circuits the colour of their fatal badge that makes so impressive a paragraph in the newspapers such as this

    “we regret to learn that m charles swann passed away yesterday at his residence in paris after a long and painful illness a parisian whose intellectual gifts were widely appreciated a discriminating but steadfastly loyal friend he will be universally regretted in those literary and artistic circles where the soundness and refinement of his taste made him a willing and a welcome guest as well as at the jockey club of which he was one of the oldest and most respected members he belonged also to the union and agricole he had recently resigned his membership of the rue royale his personal appearance and eminently distinguished bearing never failed to arouse public interest at all the great events of the musical and artistic seasons especially at private views at which he was a regular attendant until during the last years of his life he became almost entirely confined to the house the funeral will take place etc”

   from this point of view if one is not ‘somebody’ the absence of a well known title makes the process of decomposition even more rapid no doubt it is more or less anonymously without any personal identity that a man still remains duc d’uzès but the ducal coronet does for some time hold the elements together as their moulds keep together those artistically designed ices which albertine admired whereas the names of ultrafashionable commoners as soon as they are dead dissolve and lose their shape we have seen m de bréauté speak of cartier as the most intimate friend of the duc de la trémoïlle as a man greatly in demand in aristocratic circles to a later generation cartier has become something so formless that it would almost be adding to his importance to make him out as related to the jeweller cartier with whom he would have smiled to think that anybody could be so ignorant as to confuse him swann on the contrary was a remarkable personality in both the intellectual and the artistic worlds and even although he had ‘produced’ nothing still he had a chance of surviving a little longer and yet my dear charles —— whom i used to know when i was still so young and you were nearing your grave it is because he whom you must have regarded as a little fool has made you the hero of one of his volumes that people are beginning to speak of you again and that your name will perhaps live if in tissot’s picture representing the balcony of the rue royale club where you figure with galliffet edmond polignac and saintmaurice people are always drawing attention to yourself it is because they know that there are some traces of you in the character of swann

   to return to more general realities it was of this foretold and yet unforeseen death of swann that i had heard him speak himself to the duchesse de guermantes on the evening of her cousin’s party it was the same death whose striking and specific strangeness had recurred to me one evening when as i ran my eye over the newspaper my attention was suddenly arrested by the announcement of it as though traced in mysterious lines interpolated there out of place they had sufficed to make of a living man some one who can never again respond to what you say to him to reduce him to a mere name a written name that has passed in a moment from the real world to the realm of silence it was they that even now made me anxious to make myself familiar with the house in which the verdurins had lived and where swann who at that time was not merely a row of five letters printed in a newspaper had dined so often with odette i must add also and this is what for a long time made swann’s death more painful than any other albeit these reasons bore no relation to the individual strangeness of his death that i had never gone to see gilberte as i promised him at the princesse de guermantes’s that he had never told me what the ‘other reason’ was to which he alluded that evening for his selecting me as the recipient of his conversation with the prince that a thousand questions occurred to me as bubbles rise from the bottom of a pond which i longed to ask him about the most different subjects vermeer m de mouchy swann himself a boucher tapestry combray questions that doubtless were not very vital since i had put off asking them from day to day but which seemed to me of capital importance now that his lips being sealed no answer would ever come

    “no” brichot went on “it was not here that swann met his future wife or rather it was here only in the very latest period after the disaster that partially destroyed mme verdurin’s former home”
you might also like   unfortunately in my fear of displaying before the eyes of brichot an extravagance which seemed to me out of place since the professor had no share in its enjoyment i had alighted too hastily from the carriage and the driver had not understood the words i had flung at him over my shoulder in order that i might be well clear of the carriage before brichot caught sight of me the consequence was that the driver followed us and asked me whether he was to call for me later i answered hurriedly in the affirmative and was regarded with a vastly increased respect by the professor who had come by omnibus

    “ah so you were in a carriage” he said in solemn tones “only by the purest accident i never take one as a rule i always travel by omnibus or on foot however it may perhaps entitle me to the great honour of taking you home tonight if you will oblige me by consenting to enter that rattletrap we shall be packed rather tight but you are always so considerate to me” alas in making him this offer i am depriving myself of nothing i reflected since in any case i shall be obliged to go home for albertine’s sake her presence in my house at an hour when nobody could possibly call to see her allowed me to dispose as freely of my time as i had that afternoon when seated at the piano i knew that she was on her way back from the trocadéro and that i was in no hurry to see her again but furthermore as also in the afternoon i felt that i had a woman in the house and that on returning home i should not taste the fortifying thrill of solitude “i accept with great good will” replied brichot “at the period to which you allude our friends occupied in the rue montalivet a magnificent ground floor apartment with an upper landing and a garden behind less sumptuous of course and yet to my mind preferable to the old venetian embassy” brichot informed me that this evening there was to be at ‘quai conti’ thus it was that the faithful spoke of the verdurin drawingroom since it had been transferred to that address a great musical ‘towrowrow’ got up by m de charlus he went on to say that in the old days to which i had referred the little nucleus had been different and its tone not at all the same not only because the faithful had then been younger he told me of elaborate jokes played by elstir what he called ‘pure buffooneries’ as for instance one day when the painter having pretended to fail at the last moment had come disguised as an extra waiter and as he handed round the dishes whispered gallant speeches in the ear of the extremely proper baroness putbus crimson with anger and alarm then disappearing before the end of dinner he had had a hipbath carried into the drawingroom out of which when the party left the table he had emerged stark naked uttering fearful oaths and also of supper parties to which the guests came in paper costumes designed cut out and coloured by elstir which were masterpieces in themselves brichot having worn on one occasion that of a great nobleman of the court of charles vii with long turnedup points to his shoes and another time that of napoleon i for which elstir had fashioned a grand cordon of the legion of honour out of sealingwax in short brichot seeing again with the eyes of memory the drawingroom of those days with its high windows its low sofas devoured by the midday sun which had had to be replaced declared that he preferred it to the drawingroom of today of course i quite understood that by ‘drawingroom’ brichot meant — as the word church implies not merely the religious edifice but the congregation of worshippers — not merely the apartment but the people who visited it the special pleasures that they came to enjoy there to which in his memory those sofas had imparted their form upon which when you called to see mme verdurin in the afternoon you waited until she was ready while the blossom on the horse chestnuts outside and on the mantelpiece carnations in vases seemed with a charming and kindly thought for the visitor expressed in the smiling welcome of their rosy hues to be watching anxiously for the tardy appearance of the lady of the house but if the drawingroom seemed to him superior to what it was now it was perhaps because our mind is the old proteus who cannot remain the slave of any one shape and even in the social world suddenly abandons a house which has slowly and with difficulty risen to the pitch of perfection to prefer another which is less brilliant just as the ‘touchedup’ photographs which odette had had taken at otto’s in which she queened it in a ‘princess’ gown her hair waved by lenthéric did not appeal to swann so much as a little ‘cabinet picture’ taken at nice in which in a cloth cape her loosely dressed hair protruding beneath a straw hat trimmed with pansies and a bow of black ribbon instead of being twenty years younger for women as a rule look all the older in a photograph the earlier it is she looked like a little servant girl twenty years older than she now was perhaps too he derived some pleasure from praising to me what i myself had never known from shewing me that he had tasted delights that i could never enjoy if so he was successful for merely by mentioning the names of two or three people who were no longer alive and to each of whom he imparted something mysterious by his way of referring to them to that delicious intimacy he made me ask myself what it could have been like i felt that everything that had been told me about the verdurins was far too coarse and indeed in the case of swann whom i had known i reproached myself with not having paid him sufficient attention with not having paid attention to him in a sufficiently disinterested spirit with not having listened to him properly when he used to entertain me while we waited for his wife to come home for luncheon and he shewed me his treasures now that i knew that he was to be classed with the most brilliant talkers of the past just as we were coming to mme verdurin’s doorstep i caught sight of m de charlus steering towards us the bulk of his huge body drawing unwillingly in his wake one of those blackmailers or mendicants who nowadays whenever he appeared sprang up without fail even in what were to all appearance the most deserted corners by whom this powerful monster was evidently against his will invariably escorted although at a certain distance as is the shark by its pilot in short contrasting so markedly with the haughty stranger of my first visit to balbec with his stern aspect his affectation of virility that i seemed to be discovering accompanied by its satellite a planet at a wholly different period of its revolution when one begins to see it full or a sick man now devoured by the malady which a few years ago was but a tiny spot which was easily concealed and the gravity of which was never suspected although the operation that brichot had undergone had restored a tiny portion of the sight which he had thought to be lost for ever i do not think he had observed the ruffian following in the baron’s steps not that this mattered for ever since la raspelière and notwithstanding the professor’s friendly regard for m de charlus the sight of the latter always made him feel ill at ease no doubt to every man the life of every other extends along shadowy paths which he does not suspect falsehood however so often treacherous upon which all conversation is based conceals less perfectly a feeling of hostility or of sordid interest or a visit which we wish to look as though we had not paid or an escapade with the mistress of a day which we are anxious to keep from our wife than a good reputation covers up — so as not to let their existence be guessed — evil habits they may remain unknown to us for a lifetime an accidental encounter upon a pier at night will disclose them even then this accidental discovery is frequently misunderstood and we require a third person who is in the secret to supply the unimaginable clue of which everyone is unaware but once we know about them they alarm us because we feel that that way madness lies far more than by their immorality mme de surgis did not possess the slightest trace of any moral feeling and would have admitted anything of her sons that could be degraded and explained by material interest which is comprehensible to all mankind but she forbade them to go on visiting m de charlus when she learned that by a sort of internal clockwork he was inevitably drawn upon each of their visits to pinch their chins and to make each of them pinch his brother’s she felt that uneasy sense of a physical mystery which makes us ask ourself whether the neighbour with whom we have been on friendly terms is not tainted with cannibalism and to the baron’s repeated inquiry “when am i going to see your sons again” she would reply conscious of the thunderbolts that she was attracting to her defenceless head that they were very busy working for examinations preparing to go abroad and so forth irresponsibility aggravates faults and even crimes whatever anyone may say landru assuming that he really did kill his wives if he did so from a financial motive which it is possible to resist may be pardoned but not if his crime was due to an irresistible sadism

   brichot’s coarse pleasantries in the early days of his friendship with the baron had given place as soon as it was a question not of uttering commonplaces but of understanding to an awkward feeling which concealed a certain merriment he reassured himself by recalling pages of plato lines of virgil because being mentally as well as physically blind he did not understand that in those days to fall in love with a young man was like in our day socrates’s jokes reveal this more clearly than plato’s theories keeping a dancing girl before one marries and settles down m de charlus himself would not have understood he who confused his mania with friendship which does not resemble it in the least and the athletes of praxiteles with obliging boxers he refused to see that for the last nineteen hundred years “a pious courtier under a pious prince would have been an atheist under an atheist prince” as labruyère reminds us all conventional homosexuality — that of plato’s young friends as well as that of virgil’s shepherds — has disappeared that what survives and increases is only the involuntary the neurotic kind which we conceal from other people and disguise to ourselves and m de charlus would have been wrong in not denying frankly the pagan genealogy in exchange for a little plastic beauty how vast the moral superiority the shepherd in theocritus who sighs for love of a boy later on will have no reason to be less hard of heart less dull of wit than the other shepherd whose flute sounds for amaryllis for the former is not suffering from a malady he is conforming to the customs of his time it is the homosexuality that survives in spite of obstacles a thing of scorn and loathing that is the only true form the only form that can be found conjoined in a person with an enhancement of his moral qualities we are appalled at the apparently close relation between these and our bodily attributes when we think of the slight dislocation of a purely physical taste the slight blemish in one of the senses which explain why the world of poets and musicians so firmly barred against the duc de guermantes opens its portals to m de charlus that the latter should shew taste in the furnishing of his home which is that of an eclectic housewife need not surprise us but the narrow loophole that opens upon beethoven and veronese this does not exempt the sane from a feeling of alarm when a madman who has composed a sublime poem after explaining to them in the most logical fashion that he has been shut up by mistake through his wife’s machinations imploring them to intercede for him with the governor of the asylum complaining of the promiscuous company that is forced upon him concludes as follows “you see that man who is waiting to speak to me on the lawn whom i am obliged to put up with he thinks that he is jesus christ that alone will shew you the sort of lunatics that i have to live among he cannot be christ for i am christ myself” a moment earlier you were on the point of going to assure the governor that a mistake had been made at this final speech even if you bear in mind the admirable poem at which this same man is working every day you shrink from him as mme de surgis’s sons shrank from m de charlus not that he would have done them any harm but because of his ceaseless invitations the ultimate purpose of which was to pinch their chins the poet is to be pitied who must with no virgil to guide him pass through the circles of an inferno of sulphur and brimstone to cast himself into the fire that falls from heaven in order to rescue a few of the inhabitants of sodom no charm in his work the same severity in his life as in those of the unfrocked priests who follow the strictest rule of celibacy so that no one may be able to ascribe to anything but loss of faith their discarding of the cassock

   making a pretence of not seeing the seedy individual who was following in his wake whenever the baron ventured into the boulevards or crossed the waitingroom in saintlazarre station these followers might be counted by the dozen who in the hope of ‘touching him for a dollar’ never let him out of their sight and afraid at the same time that the other might have the audacity to accost him the baron had devoutly lowered his darkened eyelids which in contrast to his ricepowdered cheeks gave him the appearance of a grand inquisitor painted by el greco but this priestly expression caused alarm and he looked like an unfrocked priest various compromises to which he had been driven by the need to apologise for his taste and to keep it secret having had the effect of bringing to the surface of his face precisely what the baron sought to conceal a debauched life indicated by moral decay this last indeed whatever be its cause is easily detected for it is never slow in taking bodily form and proliferates upon a face especially on the cheeks and round the eyes as physically as the ochreous yellows accumulate there in a case of jaundice or repulsive reds in a case of skin disease nor was it merely in the cheeks or rather the chaps of this painted face in the mammiferous chest the aggressive rump of this body allowed to deteriorate and invaded by obesity upon which there now floated iridescent as a film of oil the vice at one time so jealously confined by m de charlus in the most secret chamber of his heart now it overflowed in all his speech

    “so this is how you prowl the streets at night brichot with a goodlooking young man” he said as he joined us while the disappointed ruffian made off “a fine example we must tell your young pupils at the sorbonne that this is how you behave but i must say the society of youth seems to be good for you monsieur le professeur you are as fresh as a rosebud i have interrupted you you looked as though you were enjoying yourselves like a pair of giddy girls and had no need of an old granny killjoy like myself i shan’t take it to the confessional since you are almost at your destination” the baron’s mood was all the more blithe since he knew nothing whatever about the scene that afternoon jupien having decided that it was better to protect his niece against a repetition of the onslaught than to inform m de charlus and so the baron was still looking forward to the marriage and delighting in the thought of it one would suppose that it is a consolation to these great solitaries to give their tragic celibacy the relief of a fictitious fatherhood “but upon my word brichot” he went on turning with a laugh to gaze at us “i feel quite awkward when i see you in such gallant company you were like a pair of lovers going along arm in arm i say brichot you do go the pace” ought one to ascribe this speech to the senility of a particular state of mind less capable than in the past of controlling its reflexes which in moments of automatism lets out a secret that has been so carefully hidden for forty years or rather to that contempt for plebeian opinion which all the guermantes felt in their hearts and of which m de charlus’s brother the duke was displaying a variant form when regardless of the fact that my mother could see him he used to shave standing by his bedroom window in his unbuttoned nightshirt had m de charlus contracted during the roasting journeys between doncières and douville the dangerous habit of making himself at ease and just as he would push back his straw hat in order to cool his huge forehead of unfastening — at first for a few moments only — the mask that for too long had been rigorously imposed upon his true face his conjugal attitude towards morel might well have astonished anyone who had observed it in its full extent but m de charlus had reached the stage when the monotony of the pleasures that his vice has to offer became wearying he had sought instinctively for novel displays and growing tired of the strangers whom he picked up had passed to the opposite pole to what he used to imagine that he would always loathe the imitation of family life or of fatherhood sometimes even this did not suffice him he required novelty and would go and spend the night with a woman just as a normal man may once in his life have wished to go to bed with a boy from a curiosity similar though inverse and in either case equally unhealthy the baron’s existence as one of the ‘faithful’ living for charlie’s sake entirely among the little clan had had in stultifying the efforts that he had been making for years to keep up lying appearances the same influence that a voyage of exploration or residence in the colonies has upon certain europeans who discard the ruling principles by which they were guided at home and yet the internal revolution of a mind ignorant at first of the anomaly contained in its body then appalled at it after the discovery and finally growing so used to it as to fail to perceive that it is not safe to confess to other people what the sinner has come in time to confess without shame to himself had been even more effective in liberating m de charlus from the last vestiges of social constraint than the time that he spent at the verdurins’ no banishment indeed to the south pole or to the summit of mont blanc can separate us so entirely from our fellow creatures as a prolonged residence in the seclusion of a secret vice that is to say of a state of mind that is different from theirs a vice so m de charlus used at one time to style it to which the baron now gave the genial aspect of a mere failing extremely common attractive on the whole and almost amusing like laziness absentmindedness or greed conscious of the curiosity that his own striking personality aroused m de charlus derived a certain pleasure from satisfying whetting sustaining it just as a jewish journalist will come forward day after day as the champion of catholicism not probably with any hope of being taken seriously but simply in order not to disappoint the goodnatured amusement of his readers m de charlus would genially denounce evil habits among the little clan as he would have mimicked a person speaking english or imitated mounetsully without waiting to be asked so as to pay his scot with a good grace by displaying an amateur talent in society so that m de charlus now threatened brichot that he would report to the sorbonne that he was in the habit of walking about with young men exactly as the circumcised scribe keeps referring in and out of season to the ‘eldest daughter of the church’ and the ‘sacred heart of jesus’ that is to say without the least trace of hypocrisy but with a distinctly histrionic effect it was not only the change in the words themselves so different from those that he allowed himself to use in the past that seemed to require some explanation there was also the change that had occurred in his intonations his gestures all of which now singularly resembled the type m de charlus used most fiercely to castigate he would now utter unconsciously almost the same little cries unconscious in him and all the more deeprooted as are uttered consciously by the inverts who refer to one another as ‘she’ as though this deliberate ‘camping’ against which m de charlus had for so long set his face were after all merely a brilliant and faithful imitation of the manner that men of the charlus type whatever they may say are compelled to adopt when they have reached a certain stage in their malady just as sufferers from general paralysis or locomotor ataxia inevitably end by displaying certain symptoms as a matter of fact — and this is what this purely unconscious ‘camping’ revealed — the difference between the stern charlus dressed all in black with his stiffly brushed hair whom i had known and the painted young men loaded with rings was no more than the purely imaginary difference that exists between an excited person who talks fast keeps moving all the time and a neurotic who talks slowly preserves a perpetual phlegm but is tainted with the same neurasthenia in the eyes of the physician who knows that each of the two is devoured by the same anguish and marred by the same defects at the same time one could tell that m de charlus had aged from wholly different signs such as the extraordinary frequency in his conversation of certain expressions that had taken root in it and used now to crop up at every moment for instance ‘the chain of circumstances’ upon which the baron’s speech leaned in sentence after sentence as upon a necessary prop “is charlie here yet” brichot asked m de charlus as we came in sight of the door “oh i don’t know” said the baron raising his arms and halfshutting his eyes with the air of a person who does not wish anyone to accuse him of being indiscreet all the more so as he had probably been reproached by morel for things which he had said and which the other as timorous as he was vain and as ready to deny m de charlus as he was to boast of his friendship had considered serious albeit they were quite unimportant “you know he never tells me what he’s going to do” if the conversations of two people bound by a tie of intimacy are full of falsehood this occurs no less spontaneously in the conversations that a third person holds with a lover on the subject of the person with whom the latter is in love whatever be the sex of that person

    “have you seen him lately” i asked m de charlus with the object of seeming at once not to be afraid of mentioning morel to him and not to believe that they were actually living together “he came in as it happened for five minutes this morning while i was still half asleep and sat down on the side of my bed as though he wanted to ravish me” i guessed at once that m de charlus had seen charlie within the last hour for if we ask a woman when she last saw the man whom we know to be — and whom she may perhaps suppose that we suspect of being — her lover if she has just taken tea with him she replies “i saw him for an instant before luncheon” between these two incidents the only difference is that one is false and the other true but both are equally innocent or if you prefer it equally culpable and so we should be unable to understand why the mistress in this case m de charlus always chooses the false version did we not know that such replies are determined unknown to the person who utters them by a number of factors which appear so out of proportion to the triviality of the incident that we do not take the trouble to consider them but to a physicist the space occupied by the tiniest ball of pith is explained by the harmony of action the conflict or equilibrium of laws of attraction or repulsion which govern far greater worlds just as many different laws acting in opposite directions dictate the more general responses with regard to the innocence the ‘platonism’ or on the contrary the carnal reality of the relations that one has with the person whom one says one saw in the morning when one has seen him or her in the evening here we need merely record without pausing to consider them the desire to appear natural and fearless the instinctive impulse to conceal a secret assignation a blend of modesty and ostentation the need to confess what one finds so delightful and to shew that one is loved a divination of what the other person knows or guesses — but does not say — a divination which exceeding or falling short of the other person’s makes one now exaggerate now underestimate it the spontaneous longing to play with fire and the determination to rescue something from the blaze at the same time speaking generally let us say that m de charlus notwithstanding the aggravation of his malady which perpetually urged him to reveal to insinuate sometimes boldly to invent compromising details did intend during this period in his life to make it known that charlie was not a man of the same sort as himself and that they were friends and nothing more this did not prevent him even though it may quite possibly have been true from contradicting himself at times as with regard to the hour at which they had last met whether he forgot himself at such moments and told the truth or invented a lie boastingly or from a sentimental affectation or because he thought it amusing to baffle his questioner “you know that he is to me” the baron went on “the best of comrades for whom i have the greatest affection as i am certain” was he uncertain of it then that he felt the need to say that he was certain “he has for me but there is nothing at all between us nothing of that sort you understand nothing of that sort” said the baron as naturally as though he had been speaking of a woman “yes he came in this morning to pull me out of bed though he knows that i hate anybody to see me in bed you don’t mind oh it’s horrible it’s so disturbing one looks so perfectly hideous of course i’m no longer fiveandtwenty they won’t choose me to be queen of the may still one does like to feel that one is looking one’s best”

   it is possible that the baron was in earnest when he spoke of morel as a good comrade and that he was being even more truthful than he supposed when he said “i never know what he’s doing he tells me nothing about his life”

   indeed we may mention interrupting for a few moments our narrative which shall be resumed immediately after the closure of this parenthesis which opens at the moment when m de charlus brichot and myself are arriving at mme verdurin’s front door we may mention that shortly before this evening the baron had been plunged in grief and stupefaction by a letter which he had opened by mistake and which was addressed to morel this letter which by a repercussion was to cause intense misery to myself also was written by the actress léa notorious for her exclusive interest in women and yet her letter to morel whom m de charlus had never suspected of knowing her even was written in the most impassioned tone its indelicacy prevents us from reproducing it here but we may mention that léa addressed him throughout in the feminine gender with such expressions as “go on you bad woman” or “of course you are so my pretty you know you are” and in this letter reference was made to various other women who seemed to be no less morel’s friends than léa’s on the other hand morel’s sarcasm at the baron’s expense and léa’s at that of an officer who was keeping her and of whom she said “he keeps writing me letters begging me to be careful what do you say to that my little white puss” revealed to m de charlus a state of things no less unsuspected by him than were morel’s peculiar and intimate relations with léa what most disturbed the baron was the word ‘so’ ignorant at first of its application he had eventually at a time already remote in the past learned that he himself was ‘so’ and now the notion that he had acquired of this word was again put to the challenge when he had discovered that he was ‘so’ he had supposed this to mean that his tastes as saintsimon says did not lie in the direction of women and here was this word ‘so’ applied to morel with an extension of meaning of which m de charlus was unaware so much so that morel gave proof according to this letter of his being ‘so’ by having the same taste as certain women for other women from that moment the baron’s jealousy had no longer any reason to confine itself to the men of morel’s acquaintance but began to extend to the women also so that the people who were ‘so’ were not merely those that he had supposed to be ‘so’ but a whole and vast section of the inhabitants of the planet consisting of women as well as of men loving not merely men but women also and the baron in the face of this novel meaning of a word that was so familiar to him felt himself tormented by an anxiety of the mind as well as of the heart born of this twofold mystery which combined an extension of the field of his jealousy with the sudden inadequacy of a definition

   m de charlus had never in his life been anything but an amateur that is to say incidents of this sort could never be of any use to him he worked off the painful impression that they might make upon him in violent scenes in which he was a pastmaster of eloquence or in crafty intrigues but to a person endowed with the qualities of a bergotte for instance they might have been of inestimable value this may indeed explain to a certain extent since we have to grope blindfold but choose like the lower animals the herb that is good for us why men like bergotte have generally lived in the company of persons who were ordinary false and malicious their beauty is sufficient for the writer’s imagination enhances his generosity but does not in any way alter the nature of his companion whose life situated thousands of feet below the level of his own her incredible stories her lies carried farther and what is more in another direction than what might have been expected appear in occasional flashes the lie the perfect lie about people whom we know about the relations that we have had with them about our motive for some action a motive which we express in totally different terms the lie as to what we are whom we love what we feel with regard to the person who loves us and believes that she has fashioned us in her own image because she keeps on kissing us morning noon and night that lie is one of the only things in the world that can open a window for us upon what is novel unknown that can awaken in us sleeping senses to the contemplation of universes that otherwise we should never have known we are bound to say in so far as m de charlus is concerned that if he was stupefied to learn with regard to morel a certain number of things which the latter had carefully concealed from him he was not justified in concluding from this that it was a mistake to associate too closely with the lower orders we shall indeed see in the concluding section of this work m de charlus himself engaged in doing things which would have stupefied the members of his family and his friends far more than he could possibly have been stupefied by the revelations of léa the revelation that he had found most painful had been that of a tour which morel had made with léa whereas at the time he had assured m de charlus that he was studying music in germany he had found support for this falsehood in obliging friends in germany to whom he had sent his letters to be forwarded from there to m de charlus who as it happened was so positive that morel was there that he had not even looked at the postmark but it is time to rejoin the baron as he advances with brichot and myself towards the verdurins’ door

    “and what” he went on turning to myself “has become of your young hebrew friend whom we met at douville it occurred to me that if you liked one might perhaps invite him to the house one evening” for m de charlus who did not shrink from employing a private detective to spy upon every word and action of morel for all the world like a husband or a lover had not ceased to pay attention to other young men the vigilance which he made one of his old servants maintain through an agency upon morel was so indiscreet that his footmen thought they were being watched and one of the housemaids could not endure the suspense never ventured into the street always expecting to find a policeman at her heels “she can do whatever she likes it would be a waste of time and money to follow her as if her goings on mattered to us” the old servant ironically exclaimed for he was so passionately devoted to his master that albeit he in no way shared the baron’s tastes he had come in time with such ardour did he employ himself in their service to speak of them as though they were his own “he is the very best of good fellows” m de charlus would say of this old servant for we never appreciate anyone so much as those who combine with other great virtues that of placing themselves unconditionally at the disposal of our vices it was moreover of men alone that m de charlus was capable of feeling any jealousy so far as morel was concerned women inspired in him no jealousy whatever this is indeed an almost universal rule with the charlus type the love of the man with whom they are in love for women is something different which occurs in another animal species a lion does not interfere with tigers does not distress them if anything reassures them sometimes it is true in the case of those who exalt their inversion to the level of a priesthood this love creates disgust these men resent their friends’ having succumbed to it not as a betrayal but as a lapse from virtue a charlus of a different variety from the baron would have been as indignant at the discovery of morel’s relations with a woman as upon reading in a newspaper that he the interpreter of bach and handel was going to play puccini it is by the way for this reason that the young men who with an eye to their own personal advantage condescend to the love of men like charlus assure them that women inspire them only with disgust just as they would tell a doctor that they never touch alcohol and care only for spring water but m de charlus in this respect departed to some extent from the general rule since he admired everything about morel the latter’s successes with women caused him no annoyance gave him the same joy as his successes on the platform or at écarté “but do you know my dear fellow he has women” he would say with an air of disclosure of scandal possibly of envy above all of admiration “he is extraordinary” he would continue “everywhere the most famous whores can look at nobody but him they stare at him everywhere whether it’s on the underground or in the theatre it’s becoming a nuisance i can’t go out with him to a restaurant without the waiter bringing him notes from at least three women and always pretty women too not that there’s anything surprising in that i was watching him yesterday i can quite understand it he has become so beautiful he looks just like a bronzino he is really marvellous” but m de charlus liked to shew that he was in love with morel to persuade other people possibly to persuade himself that morel was in love with him he applied to the purpose of having morel always with him notwithstanding the harm that the young fellow might do to the baron’s social position a sort of selfesteem for and this is frequent among men of good position who are snobs and in their vanity sever all their social ties in order to be seen everywhere with a mistress a person of doubtful or a lady of tarnished reputation whom nobody will invite and with whom nevertheless it seems to them flattering to be associated he had arrived at that stage at which selfesteem devotes all its energy to destroying the goals to which it has attained whether because under the influence of love a man finds a prestige which he is alone in perceiving in ostentatious relations with the beloved object or because by the waning of social ambitions that have been gratified and the rising of a tide of subsidiary curiosities all the more absorbing the more platonic they are the latter have not only reached but have passed the level at which the former found it difficult to remain

   as for young men in general m de charlus found that to his fondness for them morel’s existence was not an obstacle and that indeed his brilliant reputation as a violinist or his growing fame as a composer and journalist might in certain instances prove an attraction did anyone introduce to the baron a young composer of an agreeable type it was in morel’s talents that he sought an opportunity of doing the stranger a favour “you must” he would tell him “bring me some of your work so that morel can play it at a concert or on tour there is hardly any decent music written now for the violin it is a godsend to find anything new and abroad they appreciate that sort of thing enormously even in the provinces there are little musical societies where they love music with a fervour and intelligence that are quite admirable” without any greater sincerity for all this could serve only as a bait and it was seldom that morel condescended to fulfil these promises bloch having confessed that he was something of a poet when he was ‘in the mood’ he had added with the sarcastic laugh with which he would accompany a platitude when he could think of nothing original m de charlus said to me “you must tell your young israelite since he writes verses that he must really bring me some for morel for a composer that is always the stumbling block to find something decent to set to music one might even consider a libretto it would not be without interest and would acquire a certain value from the distinction of the poet from my patronage from a whole chain of auxiliary circumstances among which morel’s talent would take the chief place for he is composing a lot just now and writing too and very pleasantly i must talk to you about it as for his talent as a performer there as you know he is already a pastmaster you shall see this evening how well the lad plays vinteuil’s music he overwhelms me at his age to have such an understanding while he is still such a boy such a kid oh this evening is only to be a little rehearsal the big affair is to come off in two or three days but it will be much more distinguished this evening and so we are delighted that you have come” he went on employing the plural pronoun doubtless because a king says “it is our wish” “the programme is so magnificent that i have advised mme verdurin to give two parties one in a few days’ time at which she will have all her own friends the other tonight at which the hostess is to use a legal expression ‘disseized’ it is i who have issued the invitations and i have collected a few people from another sphere who may be useful to charlie and whom it will be nice for the verdurins to meet don’t you agree it is all very well to have the finest music played by the greatest artists the effect of the performance remains muffled in cottonwool if the audience is composed of the milliner from across the way and the grocer from round the corner you know what i think of the intellectual level of people in society still they can play certain quite important parts among others that which in public events devolves upon the press and which is that of being an organ of publicity you know what i mean i have for instance invited my sisterinlaw oriane it is not certain that she will come but it is on the other hand certain that if she does come she will understand absolutely nothing but one does not ask her to understand which is beyond her capacity but to talk a task which is admirably suited to her and which she never fails to perform what is the result tomorrow as ever is instead of the silence of the milliner and the grocer an animated conversation at the mortemarts’ with oriane telling everyone that she has heard the most marvellous music that a certain morel and so forth unspeakable rage of the people not invited who will say ‘palamède thought no doubt that we were unworthy anyhow who are these people who were giving the party’ a counterblast quite as useful as oriane’s praises because morel’s name keeps cropping up all the time and is finally engraved in the memory like a lesson that one has read over a dozen times all this forms a chain of circumstances which may be of value to the artist to the hostess may serve as a sort of megaphone for a performance which will thus be made audible to a remote public really it is worth the trouble you shall see what progress charlie has made and what is more we have discovered a new talent in him my dear fellow he writes like an angel like an angel i tell you” m de charlus omitted to say that for some time past he had been employing morel like those great noblemen of the seventeenth century who scorned to sign and even to write their own slanderous attacks to compose certain vilely calumnious little paragraphs at the expense of comtesse mole their insolence apparent even to those who merely glanced at them how much more cruel were they to the young woman herself who found in them so skilfully introduced that nobody but herself saw the point certain passages from her own correspondence textually quoted but interpreted in a sense which made them as deadly as the cruellest revenge they killed the lady but there is edited every day in paris balzac would tell us a sort of spoken newspaper more terrible than its printed rivals we shall see later on that this verbal press reduced to nothing the power of a charlus who had fallen out of fashion and exalted far above him a morel who was not worth the millionth part of his former patron is this intellectual fashion really so simple and does it sincerely believe in the nullity of a charlus of genius in the incontestable authority of a crass morel the baron was not so innocent in his implacable vengeance whence no doubt that bitter venom on his tongue the spreading of which seemed to dye his cheeks with jaundice when he was in a rage “you who knew bergotte” m de charlus went on “i thought at one time that you might perhaps by refreshing his memory with regard to the youngster’s writings collaborate in short with myself help me to assist a twofold talent that of a musician and a writer which may one day acquire the prestige of that of berlioz as you know the illustrious have often other things to think about they are smothered in flattery they take little interest except in themselves but bergotte who was genuinely unpretentious and obliging promised me that he would get into the gaulois or some such paper those little articles a blend of the humourist and the musician which he really does quite charmingly now and i am really very glad that charlie should combine with his violin this little stroke of ingres’s pen i know that i am prone to exaggeration when he is concerned like all the old fairy godmothers of the conservatoire what my dear fellow didn’t you know that you have never observed my little weakness i pace up and down for hours on end outside the examination hall i’m as happy as a queen as for charlie’s prose bergotte assured me that it was really very good indeed”

   m de charlus who had long been acquainted with bergotte through swann had indeed gone to see him a few days before his death to ask him to find an opening for morel in some newspaper for a sort of commentary half humorous upon the music of the day in doing so m de charlus had felt some remorse for himself a great admirer of bergotte he was conscious that he never went to see him for his own sake but in order thanks to the respect partly intellectual partly social that bergotte felt for him to be able to do a great service to morel or to some other of his friends that he no longer made use of people in society for any other purpose did not shock m de charlus but to treat bergotte thus had appeared to him more offensive for he felt that bergotte had not the calculating nature of people in society and deserved better treatment only his was a busy life and he could never find time for anything except when he was greatly interested in something when for instance it affected morel what was more as he was himself extremely intelligent the conversation of an intelligent man left him comparatively cold especially that of bergotte who was too much the man of letters for his liking and belonged to another clan did not share his point of view as for bergotte he had observed the calculated motive of m de charlus’s visits but had felt no resentment for he had been incapable throughout his life of any consecutive generosity but anxious to give pleasure broadminded insensitive to the pleasure of administering a rebuke as for m de charlus’s vice he had never partaken of it to the smallest extent but had found in it rather an element of colour in the person affected fas et nefas for an artist consisting not in moral examples but in memories of plato or of sodom “but you fair youth we never see you at quai conti you don’t abuse their hospitality” i explained that i went out as a rule with my cousin “do you hear that he goes out with his cousin what a most particularly pure young man” said m de charlus to brichot then turning again to myself “but we are not asking you to give an account of your life my boy you are free to do anything that amuses you we merely regret that we have no share in it besides you shew very good taste your cousin is charming ask brichot she quite turned his head at douville we shall regret her absence this evening but you did just as well perhaps not to bring her with you vinteuil’s music is delightful but i have heard that we are to meet the composer’s daughter and her friend who have a terrible reputation that sort of thing is always awkward for a girl they are sure to be there unless the ladies have been detained in the country for they were to have been present without fail all afternoon at a rehearsal which mme verdurin was giving today to which she had invited only the bores her family the people whom she could not very well have this evening but a moment ago before dinner charlie told us that the sisters vinteuil as we call them for whom they were all waiting never came” notwithstanding the intense pain that i had felt at the sudden association with its effect of which alone i had been aware of the cause at length discovered of albertine’s anxiety to be there that afternoon the presence publicly announced but of which i had been ignorant of mlle vinteuil and her friend my mind was still sufficiently detached to remark that m de charlus who had told us a few minutes earlier that he had not seen charlie since the morning was now brazenly admitting that he had seen him before dinner my pain became visible “why what is the matter with you” said the baron “you are quite green come let us go in you will catch cold you don’t look at all well” it was not any doubt as to albertine’s virtue that m de charlus’s words had awakened in me many other doubts had penetrated my mind already at each fresh doubt we feel that the measure is heaped full that we cannot cope with it then we manage to find room for it all the same and once it is introduced into our vital essence it enters into competition there with so many longings to believe so many reasons to forget that we speedily become accustomed to it and end by ceasing to pay it any attention there remains only like a partly healed pain the menace of possible suffering which the counterpart of desire a feeling of the same order and like it become the centre of our thoughts radiates through them to an infinite circumference a wistful melancholy as desire radiates pleasures whose origin we fail to perceive wherever anything may suggest the idea of the person with whom we are in love but pain revives as soon as a fresh doubt enters our mind complete even if we assure ourself almost immediately “i shall deal with this there must be some method by which i need not suffer it cannot be true” nevertheless there has been a first moment in which we suffered as though we believed it if we had merely members such as legs and arms life would be endurable unfortunately we carry inside us that little organ which we call the heart which is subject to certain maladies in the course of which it is infinitely impressionable by everything that concerns the life of a certain person so that a lie — that most harmless of things in the midst of which we live so unconcernedly if the lie be told by ourselves or by strangers — coming from that person causes the little heart which surgeons ought really to be able to excise from us intolerable anguish let us not speak of the brain for our mind may go on reasoning interminably in the course of this ansuish it does no more to mitigate it than by taking thought can we soothe an aching tooth it is true that this person is to blame for having lied to us for she had sworn to us that she would always tell us the truth but we know from our own shortcomings towards other people how little an oath is worth and we have deliberately believed them when they came from her the very person to whose interest it has always been to lie to us and whom moreover we did not select for her virtues it is true that later on she would almost cease to have any need to lie to us — at the moment when our heart will have grown indifferent to her falsehood — because then we shall not feel any interest in her life we know this and notwithstanding we deliberately sacrifice our own lives either by killing ourselves for her sake or by letting ourselves be sentenced to death for having murdered her or simply by spending in the course of a few evenings our whole fortune upon her which will oblige us presently to commit suicide because we have not a penny in the world besides however calm we may imagine ourselves when we are in love we always have love in our heart in a state of unstable equilibrium a trifle is sufficient to exalt it to the position of happiness we radiate happiness we smother in our affection not her whom we love but those who have given us merit in her eyes who have protected her from every evil temptation we think that our mind is at ease and a word is sufficient ‘gilberte is not coming’ ‘mademoiselle vinteuil is expected’ to make all the preconceived happiness towards which we were rising collapse to make the sun hide his face to open the bag of the winds and let loose the internal tempest which one day we shall be incapable of resisting that day the day upon which the heart has become so frail our friends who respect us are pained that such trifles that certain persons can so affect us can bring us to death’s door but what are they to do if a poet is dying of septic pneumonia can one imagine his friends explaining to the pneumococcus that the poet is a man of talent and that it ought to let him recover my doubt in so far as it referred to mlle vinteuil was not entirely novel but to a certain extent my jealousy of the afternoon inspired by léa and her friends had abolished it once that peril of the trocadéro was removed i had felt that i had recaptured for all time complete peace of mind but what was entirely novel to me was a certain excursion as to which andrée had told me “we went to this place and that we didn’t meet anyone” and during which on the contrary mlle vinteuil had evidently arranged to meet albertine at mme verdurin’s at this moment i would gladly have allowed albertine to go out by herself to go wherever she might choose provided that i might lock up mlle vinteuil and her friend somewhere and be certain that albertine would not meet them the fact is that jealousy is as a rule partial of intermittent application whether because it is the painful extension of an anxiety which is provoked now by one person now by another with whom our mistress may be in love or because of the exiguity of our thought which is able to realise only what it can represent to itself and leaves everything else in an obscurity which can cause us only a proportionately modified anguish

   just as we were about to ring the bell we were overtaken by saniette who informed us that princess sherbatoff had died at six o’clock and added that he had not at first recognised us “i envisaged you however for some time” he told us in a breathless voice “is it aught but curious that i should have hesitated” to say “is it not curious” would have seemed to him wrong and he had acquired a familiarity with obsolete forms of speech that was becoming exasperating “not but what you are people whom one may acknowledge as friends” his grey complexion seemed to be illuminated by the livid glow of a storm his breathlessness which had been noticeable as recently as last summer only when m verdurin ‘jumped down his throat’ was now continuous “i understand that an unknown work of vinteuil is to be performed by excellent artists and singularly by morel” “why singularly” inquired the baron who detected a criticism in the adverb “our friend saniette” brichot made haste to exclaim acting as interpreter “is prone to speak like the excellent scholar that he is the language of an age in which ‘singularly’ was equivalent to our ‘especially’”
   as we entered the verdurins’ hall m de charlus asked me whether i was engaged upon any work and as i told him that i was not but that i was greatly interested at the moment in old dinnerservices of plate and porcelain he assured me that i could not see any finer than those that the verdurins had that moreover i might have seen them at la raspelière since on the pretext that one’s possessions are also one’s friends they were so silly as to cart everything down there with them it would be less convenient to bring everything out for my benefit on the evening of a party still he would tell them to shew me anything that i wished to see i begged him not to do anything of the sort m de charlus unbuttoned his greatcoat took off his hat and i saw that the top of his head had now turned silver in patches but like a precious shrub which is not only coloured with autumn tints but certain leaves of which are protected by bandages of wadding or incrustations of plaster m de charlus received from these few white hairs at his crest only a further variegation added to those of his face and yet even beneath the layers of different expressions paint and hypocrisy which formed such a bad ‘makeup’ his face continued to hide from almost everyone the secret that it seemed to me to be crying aloud i was almost put to shame by his eyes in which i was afraid of his surprising me in the act of reading it as from an open book by his voice which seemed to me to be repeating it in every tone with an untiring indecency but secrets are well kept by such people for everyone who comes in contact with them is deaf and blind the people who learned the truth from some one else from the verdurins for instance believed it but only for so long as they had not met m de charlus his face so far from spreading dissipated every scandalous rumour for we form so extravagant an idea of certain characters that we would be incapable of identifying one of them with the familiar features of a person of our acquaintance and we find it difficult to believe in such a person’s vices just as we can never believe in the genius of a person with whom we went to the opera last night

   m de charlus was engaged in handing over his greatcoat with the instructions of a familiar guest but the footman to whom he was handing it was a newcomer and quite young now m de charlus had by this time begun as people say to ‘lose his bearings’ and did not always remember what might and what might not be done the praiseworthy desire that he had felt at balbec to shew that certain topics did not alarm him that he was not afraid to declare with regard to some one or other “he is a nicelooking boy” to utter in short the same words as might have been uttered by somebody who was not like himself this desire he had now begun to express by saying on the contrary things which nobody could ever have said who was not like him things upon which his mind was so constantly fixed that he forgot that they do not form part of the habitual preoccupation of people in general and so as he gazed at the new footman he raised his forefinger in the air in a menacing fashion and thinking that he was making an excellent joke “you are not to make eyes at me like that do you hear” said the baron and turning to brichot “he has a quaint little face that boy his nose is rather fun” and completing his joke or yielding to a desire he lowered his forefinger horizontally hesitated for an instant then unable to control himself any longer thrust it irresistibly forwards at the footman and touched the tip of his nose saying “pif” “that’s a rum card” the footman said to himself and inquired of his companions whether it was a joke or what it was “it is just a way he has” said the butler who regarded the baron as slightly ‘touched’ ‘a bit balmy’ “but he is one of madame’s friends for whom i have always had the greatest respect he has a good heart”

    “are you coming back this year to incarville” brichot asked me “i believe that our hostess has taken la raspelière again for all that she has had a crow to pick with her landlords but that is nothing it is a cloud that passes” he added in the optimistic tone of the newspapers that say “mistakes have been made it is true but who does not make mistakes at times” but i remembered the state of anguish in which i had left balbec and felt no desire to return there i kept putting off to the morrow my plans for albertine “why of course he is coming back we need him he is indispensable to us” declared m de charlus with the authoritative and uncomprehending egoism of friendliness

   at this moment m verdurin appeared to welcome us when we expressed our sympathy over princess sherbatoff he said “yes i believe she is rather ill” “no no she died at six o’clock” exclaimed saniette “oh you exaggerate everything” was m verdurin’s brutal retort for since he had not cancelled his party he preferred the hypothesis of illness imitating unconsciously the duc de guermantes saniette not without fear of catching cold for the outer door was continually being opened stood waiting resignedly for some one to take his hat and coat “what are you hanging about there for like a whipped dog” m verdurin asked him “i am waiting until one of the persons who are charged with the cloakroom can take my coat and give me a number” “what is that you say” demanded m verdurin with a stern expression “‘charged with the cloakroom’ are you going off your head ‘in charge of the cloakroom’ is what we say if we’ve got to teach you to speak your own language like a man who has had a stroke” “charged with a thing is the correct form” murmured saniette in a stifled tone “the abbé le batteux    ” “you make me tired you do” cried m verdurin in a voice of thunder “how you do wheezel have you been running upstairs to an attic” the effect of m verdurin’s rudeness was that the servants in the cloakroom allowed other guests to take precedence of saniette and when he tried to hand over his things replied “wait for your turn sir don’t be in such a hurry” “there’s system for you competent fellows that’s right my lads” said m verdurin with an approving smile in order to encourage them in their tendency to keep saniette waiting till the end “come along” he said to us “the creature wants us all to catch our death hanging about in his beloved draught come and get warm in the drawingroom ‘charged with the cloakroom’ indeed what an idiot” “he is inclined to be a little precious but he’s not a bad fellow” said brichot “i never said that he was a bad fellow i said that he was an idiot” was m verdurin’s harsh retort

   meanwhile mme verdurin was busily engaged with cottard and ski morel had just declined because m de charlus could not be present an invitation from some friends of hers to whom she had promised the services of the violinist the reason for morel’s refusal to perform at the party which the verdurins’ friends were giving a reason which we shall presently see reinforced by others of a far more serious kind might have found its justification in a habit common to the leisured classes in general but specially distinctive of the little nucleus to be sure if mme verdurin intercepted between a newcomer and one of the faithful a whispered speech which might let it be supposed that they were already acquainted or wished to become more intimate “on friday then at soandso’s” or “come to the studio any day you like i am always there until five o’clock i shall look forward to seeing you” agitated supposing the newcomer to occupy a ‘position’ which would make him a brilliant recruit to the little clan the mistress while pretending not to have heard anything and preserving in her fine eyes shadowed by the habit of listening to debussy more than they would have been by that of sniffing cocaine the extenuated expression that they derived from musical intoxication alone revolved nevertheless behind her splendid brow inflated by all those quartets and the headaches that were their consequence thoughts which were not exclusively polyphonic and unable to contain herself any longer unable to postpone the injection for another instant flung herself upon the speakers drew them apart and said to the newcomer pointing to the ‘faithful’ one “you wouldn’t care to come and dine to meet him next saturday shall we say or any day you like with some really nice people don’t speak too loud as i don’t want to invite all this mob” a word used to denote for five minutes the little nucleus disdained for the moment in favour of the newcomer in whom so many hqpes were placed

   but this infatuated impulse this need to make friendly overtures had its counterpart assiduous attendance at their wednesdays aroused in the verdurins an opposite tendency this was the desire to quarrel to hold aloof it had been strengthened had almost been wrought to a frenzy during the months spent at la raspelière where they were all together morning noon and night m verdurin went out of his way to prove one of his guests in the wrong to spin webs in which he might hand over to his comrade spider some innocent fly failing a grievance he would invent some absurdity as soon as one of the faithful had been out of the house for half an hour they would make fun of him in front of the others would feign surprise that their guests had not noticed how his teeth were never clean or how on the contrary he had a mania for brushing them twenty times a day if any one took the liberty of opening a window this want of breeding would cause a glance of disgust to pass between host and hostess a moment later mme verdurin would ask for a shawl which gave m verdurin an excuse for saying in a tone of fury “no i shall close the window i wonder who had the impertinence to open it” in the hearing of the guilty wretch who blushed to the roots of his hair you were rebuked indirectly for the quantity of wine that you had drunk “it won’t do you any harm navvies thrive on it” if two of the faithful went out together without first obtaining permission from the mistress their excursions led to endless comments however innocent they might be those of m de charlus with morel were not innocent it was only the fact that m de charlus was not staying at la raspelière because morel was obliged to live near his barracks that retarded the hour of satiety disgust retching that hour was however about to strike

   mme verdurin was furious and determined to ‘enlighten’ morel as to the ridiculous and detestable part that m de charlus was making him play “i must add” she went on mme verdurin when she felt that she owed anyone a debt of gratitude which would be a burden to him and was unable to rid herself of it by killing him would discover a serious defect in him which would honourably dispense her from shewing her gratitude “i must add that he gives himself airs in my house which i do not at all like” the truth was that mme verdurin had another more serious reason than morel’s refusal to play at her friends’ party for picking a quarrel with m de charlus the latter overcome by the honour he was doing the mistress in bringing to quai conti people who after all would never have come there for her sake had on hearing the first names that mme verdurin had suggested as those of people who ought to be invited pronounced the most categorical ban upon them in a peremptory tone which blended the rancorous pride of a crotchety nobleman with the dogmatism of the expert artist in questions of entertainment who would cancel his programme and withhold his collaboration sooner than agree to concessions which in his opinion would endanger the success of the whole m de charlus had given his approval hedging it round with reservations to saintine alone with whom in order not to be bothered with his wife mme de guermantes had passed from a daily intimacy to a complete severance of relations but whom m de charlus finding him intelligent continued to see true it was among a middleclass set with a crossbreeding of the minor nobility where people are merely very rich and connected with an aristocracy whom the true aristocracy does not know that saintine at one time the flower of the guermantes set had gone to seek his fortune and he imagined a social foothold but mme verdurin knowing the blueblooded pretensions of the wife’s circle and failing to take into account the husband’s position for it is what is immediately over our head that gives us the impression of altitude and not what is almost invisible to us so far is it lost in the clouds felt that she ought to justify an invitation of saintine by pointing out that he knew a great many people “having married mlle ——” the ignorance which this assertion the direct opposite of the truth revealed in mme verdurin caused the baron’s painted lips to part in a smile of indulgent scorn and wide comprehension he disdained a direct answer but as he was always ready to express in social examples theories which shewed the fertility of his mind and the arrogance of his pride with the inherited frivolity of his occupations “saintine ought to have come to me before marrying” he said “there is such a thing as social as well as physiological eugenics and i am perhaps the only specialist in existence saintine’s case aroused no discussion it was clear that in making the marriage that he made he was tying a stone to his neck and hiding his light under a bushel his social career was at an end i should have explained this to him and he would have understood me for he is quite intelligent on the other hand there was a person who had everything that he required to make his position exalted predominant worldwide only a terrible cable bound him to the earth i helped him partly by pressure partly by force to break his bonds and now he has won with a triumphant joy the freedom the omnipotence that he owes to me it required perhaps a little determination on his part but what a reward thus a man can himself when he has the sense to listen to me become the midwife of his destiny” it was only too clear that m de charlus had not been able to influence his own action is a different thing from speech even eloquent speech and from thought even the thoughts of genius “but so far as i am concerned i live the life of a philosopher who looks on with interest at the social reactions which i have foretold but who does not assist them and so i have continued to visit saintine who has always received me with the wholehearted deference which is my due i have even dined with him in his new abode where one is heavily bored in the midst of the most sumptuous splendour as one used to be amused in the old days when living from hand to mouth he used to assemble the best society in a wretched attic him then you may invite i give you leave but i rule out with my veto all the other names that you have mentioned and you will thank me for it for if i am an expert in arranging marriages i am no less an expert in arranging parties i know the rising people who give tone to a gathering make it go and i know also the names that will bring it down to the ground make it fall flat” these exclusions were not always founded upon the baron’s personal resentments nor upon his artistic refinements but upon his skill as an actor when he had perfected at the expense of somebody or something an entirely successful epigram he was anxious to let it be heard by the largest possible audience but took care not to admit to the second performance the audience of the first who could have borne witness that the novelty was not novel he would then rearrange his drawingroom simply because he did not alter his programme and when he had scored a success in conversation would if need be have organised a tour and given exhibitions in the provinces whatever may have been the various motives for these exclusions they did not merely annoy mme verdurin who felt her authority as a hostess impaired they also did her great damage socially and for two reasons the first was that m de charlus even more susceptible than jupien used to quarrel without anyone’s ever knowing why with the people who were most suited to be his friends naturally one of the first punishments that he could inflict upon them was that of not allowing them to be invited to a party which he was giving at the verdurins’ now these pariahs were often people who are in the habit of ruling the roost as the saying is but who in m de charlus’s eyes had ceased to rule it from the day on which he had quarrelled with them for his imagination in addition to finding people in the wrong in order to quarrel with them was no less ingenious in stripping them of all importance as soon as they ceased to be his friends if for instance the guilty person came of an extremely old family whose dukedom however dates only from the nineteenth century such a family as the montesquieu from that moment all that counted for m de charlus was the precedence of the dukedom the family becoming nothing “they are not even dukes” he would exclaim “it is the title of the abbé de montesquieu which passed most irregularly to a collateral less than eighty years ago the present duke if duke he can be called is the third you may talk to me if you like of people like the uzès the la trémoïlîe the luynes who are tenth or fourteenth dukes or my brother who is twelfth duc de guermantes and seventeenth prince of cordova the montesquieu are descended from an old family what would that prove supposing that it were proved they have descended so far that they have reached the fourteenth storey below stairs” had he on the contrary quarrelled with a gentleman who possessed an ancient dukedom who boasted the most magnificent connexions was related to ruling princes but to whose line this distinction had come quite suddenly without any length of pedigree a luynes for instance the case was altered pedigree alone counted “i ask you — m alberti who does not emerge from the mire until louis xiii what can it matter to us that favouritism at court allowed them to pick up dukedoms to which they have no right” what was more with m de charlus the fall came immediately after the exaltation because of that tendency peculiar to the guermantes to expect from conversation from friendship something that these are incapable of giving as well as the symptomatic fear of becoming the objects of slander and the fall was all the greater the higher the exaltation had been now nobody had ever found such favour with the baron as he had markedly shewn for comtesse mole by what sign of indifference did she reveal one fine day that she had been unworthy of it the comtesse always maintained that she had never been able to solve the problem the fact remains that the mere sound of her name aroused in the baron the most violent rage provoked the most eloquent but the most terrible philippics mme verdurin to whom mme molé had been very kind and who was founding as we shall see great hopes upon her and had rejoiced in anticipation at the thought that the comtesse would meet in her house all the noblest names as the mistress said “of france and navarre” at once proposed to invite “madame de molé” “oh my god everyone has his own taste” m de charlus had replied “and if you madame feel a desire to converse with mme pipelet mme gibout and mme joseph prudhomme i ask nothing better but let it be on an evening when i am not present i could see as soon as you opened your mouth that we do not speak the same language since i was mentioning the names of the nobility and you retort with the most obscure names of professional and tradespeople dirty scandalmongering little bounders little women who imagine themselves patronesses of the arts because they repeat an octave lower the manners of my guermantes sisterinlaw like a jay that thinks it is imitating a peacock i must add that it would be positively indecent to admit to a party which i am pleased to give at mme verdurin’s a person whom i have with good reason excluded from my society a sheep devoid of birth loyalty intelligence who is so idiotic as to suppose that she is capable of playing the duchesse de guermantes and the princesse de guermantes a combination which is in itself idiotic since the duchesse de guermantes and the princesse de guermantes are poles apart it is as though a person should pretend to be at once reichenberg and sarah bernhardt in any case even if it were not impossible it would be extremely ridiculous even though i may myself smile at times at the exaggeration of one and regret the limitations of the other that is my right but that upstart little frog trying to blow herself out to the magnitude of two great ladies who at all events always reveal the incomparable distinction of blood it is enough as the saying is to make a cat laugh the molé that is a name which must not be uttered in my hearing or else i must simply withdraw” he concluded with a smile in the tone of a doctor who thinking of his patient’s interests in spite of that same patient’s opposition lets it be understood that he will not tolerate the collaboration of a homoeopath on the other hand certain persons whom m de charlus regarded as negligible might indeed be so for him but not for mme verdurin m de charlus with his exalted birth could afford to dispense with people in the height of fashion the assemblage of whom would have made mme verdurin’s drawingroom one of the first in paris she at the same time was beginning to feel that she had already on more than one occasion missed the coach not to mention the enormous retardation that the social error of the dreyfus case had inflicted upon her not without doing her a service all the same i forget whether i have mentioned the disapproval with which the duchesse de guermantes had observed certain persons of her world who subordinating everything else to the case excluded fashionable women from their drawingrooms and admitted others who were not fashionable because they were for or against the fresh trial and had then been criticised in her turn by those same ladies as lukewarm unsound in her views and guilty of placing social distinctions above the national interests may i appeal to the reader as to a friend with regard to whom one completely forgets at the end of a conversation whether one has remembered or had an opportunity to tell him something important whether i have done so or not the attitude of the duchesse de guermantes can easily be imagined and indeed if we look at it in the light of subsequent history may appear from the social point of view perfectly correct m de cambremer regarded the dreyfus case as a foreign machination intended to destroy the intelligence service to undermine discipline to weaken the army to divide the french people to pave the way for invasion literature being apart from a few of la fontaine’s fables a sealed book to the marquis he left it to his wife to prove that the cruelly introspective writers of the day had by creating a spirit of irreverence arrived by a parallel course at a similar result “m reinach and m hervieu are in the plot” she would say nobody will accuse the dreyfus case of having premeditated such dark designs upon society but there it certainly has broken down the hedges the social leaders who refuse to allow politics into society are as foreseeing as the soldiers who refuse to allow politics to permeate the army society is like the sexual appetite one does not know at what forms of perversion it may not arrive once we have allowed our choice to be dictated by aesthetic considerations the reason that they were nationalists gave the faubourg saintgermain the habit of entertaining ladies from another class of society the reason vanished with nationalism the habit remained mme verdurin by the bond of dreyfusism had attracted to her house certain writers of distinction who for the moment were of no advantage to her socially because they were dreyfusards but political passions are like all the rest they do not last fresh generations arise which are incapable of understanding them even the generation that felt them changes feels political passions which not being modelled exactly upon their predecessors make it rehabilitate some of the excluded the reason for exclusion having altered monarchists no longer cared at the time of the dreyfus case whether a man had been a republican that is to say a radical that is to say anticlerical provided that he was an antisemite and a nationalist should a war ever come patriotism would assume another form and if a writer was chauvinistic nobody would stop to think whether he had or had not been a dreyfusard it was thus that at each political crisis at each artistic revival mme verdurin had collected one by one like a bird building its nest the several items useless for the moment of what would one day be her salon the dreyfus case had passed anatole france remained mme verdurin’s strength lay in her genuine love of art the trouble that she used to take for her faithful the marvellous dinners that she gave for them alone without inviting anyone from the world of fashion each of the faithful was treated at her table as bergotte had been treated at mme swann’s when a boon companion of this sort had turned into an illustrious man whom everybody was longing to meet his presence at mme verdurin’s had none of the artificial composite effect of a dish at an official or farewell banquet cooked by potel or chabot but was merely a delicious ‘ordinary’ which you would have found there in the same perfection on a day when there was no party at all at mme verdurin’s the cast was trained to perfection the repertory most select all that was lacking was an audience and now that the public taste had begun to turn from the rational and french art of a bergotte and to go in above all things for exotic forms of music mme verdurin a sort of official representative in paris of all foreign artists was not long in making her appearance by the side of the exquisite princess yourbeletief an aged fairy godmother grim but allpowerful to the russian dancers this charming invasion against whose seductions only the stupidest of critics protested infected paris as we know with a fever of curiosity less burning more purely aesthetic but quite as intense perhaps as that aroused by the dreyfus case there again mme verdurin but with a very different result socially was to take her place in the front row just as she had been seen by the side of mme zola immediately under the bench during the trial in the assize court so when the new generation of humanity in their enthusiasm for the russian ballet thronged to the opera crowned with the latest novelty in aigrettes they invariably saw in a stage box mme verdurin by the side of princess yourbeletief and just as after the emotions of the law courts people used to go in the evening to mme verdurin’s to meet picquart or labori in the flesh and what was more to hear the latest news of the case to learn what hopes might be placed in zurlinden loubet colonel jouaust the regulations so now little inclined for sleep after the enthusiasm aroused by the scheherazade or prince igor they repaired to mme verdurin’s where under the auspices of princess yourbeletief and their hostess an exquisite supper brought together every night the dancers themselves who had abstained from dinner so as to be more resilient their director their designers the great composers igor stravinski and richard strauss a permanent little nucleus around which as round the suppertable of m and mme helvétius the greatest ladies in paris and foreign royalties were not too proud to gather even those people in society who professed to be endowed with taste and drew unnecessary distinctions between the various russian ballets regarding the setting of the sylphides as somehow ‘purer’ than that of scheherazade which they were almost prepared to attribute to negro inspiration were enchanted to meet face to face the great revivers of theatrical taste who in an art that is perhaps a little more artificial than that of the easel had created a revolution as profound as impressionism itself

   to revert to m de charlus mme verdurin would not have minded so much if he had placed on his index only comtesse molé and mme bontemps whom she had picked out at odette’s on the strength of her love of the fine arts and who during the dreyfus case had come to dinner occasionally bringing her husband whom mme verdurin called ‘lukewarm’ because he was not making any move for a fresh trial but who being extremely intelligent and glad to form relations in every camp was delighted to shew his independence by dining at the same table as labori to whom he listened without uttering a word that might compromise himself but managed to slip in at the right moment a tribute to the loyalty recognised by all parties of jaurès but the baron had similarly proscribed several ladies of the aristocracy whose acquaintance mme verdurin on the occasion of some musical festivity or a collection for charity had recently formed and who whatever m de charlus might think of them would have been far more than himself essential to the formation of a fresh nucleus at mme verdurin’s this time aristocratic mme verdurin had indeed been reckoning upon this party to which m de charlus would be bringing her women of the same set to mix her new friends with them and had been relishing in anticipation the surprise that the latter would feel upon meeting at quai conti their own friends or relatives invited there by the baron she was disappointed and furious at his veto it remained to be seen whether the evening in these conditions would result in profit or loss to herself the loss would not be too serious if only m de charlus’s guests came with so friendly a feeling for mme verdurin that they would become her friends in the future in this case the mischief would be only half done these two sections of the fashionable world which the baron had insisted upon keeping apart would be united later on he himself being excluded of course when the time came and so mme verdurin was awaiting the baron’s guests with a certain emotion she would not be slow in discovering the state of mind in which they came and the degree of intimacy to which she might hope to attain while she waited mme verdurin took counsel with the faithful but upon seeing m de charlus enter the room with brichot and myself stopped short greatly to our astonishment when brichot told her how sorry he was to learn that her dear friend was so seriously ill mme verdurin replied “listen i am obliged to confess that i am not at all sorry it is useless to pretend to feel what one does not feel” no doubt she spoke thus from want of energy because she shrank from the idea of wearing a long face throughout her party from pride in order not to appear to be seeking excuses for not having cancelled her invitations from selfrespect also and social aptitude because the absence of grief which she displayed was more honourable if it could be attributed to a peculiar antipathy suddenly revealed to the princess rather than to a universal insensibility and because her hearers could not fail to be disarmed by a sincerity as to which there could be no doubt if mme verdurin had not been genuinely unaffected by the death of the princess would she have gone on to excuse herself for giving the party by accusing herself of a far more serious fault besides one was apt to forget that mme verdurin would thus have admitted while confessing her grief that she had not had the strength of mind to forego a pleasure whereas the indifference of the friend was something more shocking more immoral but less humiliating and consequently easier to confess than the frivolity of the hostess in matters of crime where the culprit is in danger it is his material interest that prompts the confession where the fault incurs no penalty it is selfesteem whether it was that doubtless feeling the pretext to be too hackneyed of the people who so as not to allow a bereavement to interrupt their life of pleasure go about saying that it seems to them useless to display the outward signs of a grief which they feel in their hearts mme verdurin preferred to imitate those intelligent culprits who are revolted by the commonplaces of innocence and whose defence — a partial admission though they do not know it — consists in saying that they would see no harm in doing what they are accused of doing although as it happens they have had no occasion to do it or that having adopted to explain her conduct the theory of indifference she found once she had started upon the downward slope of her unnatural feeling that it was distinctly original to have felt it that she displayed a rare perspicacity in having managed to diagnose her own symptoms and a certain ‘nerve’ in proclaiming them anyhow mme verdurin kept dwelling upon her want of grief not without a certain proud satisfaction as of a paradoxical psychologist and daring dramatist “yes it is very funny” she said “i hardly felt it of course i don’t mean to say that i wouldn’t rather she were still alive she was not a bad person” “yes she was” put in m verdurin “ah he doesn’t approve of her because he thought that i was doing myself harm by having her here but he is quite pigheaded about that” “do me the justice to admit” said m verdurin “that i never approved of your having her i always told you that she had a bad reputation” “but i have never heard a thing against her” protested saniette “what” exclaimed mme verdurin “everybody knew bad isn’t the word it was scandalous appalling no it has nothing to do with that i couldn’t explain myself what i felt i didn’t dislike her but i took so little interest in her that when we heard that she was seriously ill my husband himself was quite surprised and said ‘anyone would think that you didn’t mind’ why this evening he offered to put off the party and i insisted upon having it because i should have thought it a farce to shew a grief which i do not feel” she said this because she felt that it had a curious smack of the ‘independent theatre’ and was at the same time singularly convenient for an admitted insensibility or immorality simplifies life as much as does easy virtue it converts reproachable actions for which one no longer need seek any excuse into a duty imposed by sincerity and the faithful listened to mme verdurin’s speech with the blend of admiration and misgiving which certain cruelly realistic plays that shewed a profound observation used at one time to cause and while they marvelled to see their beloved mistress display a novel aspect of her rectitude and independence more than one of them albeit he assured himself that after all it would not be the same thing thought of his own death and asked himself whether on the day when death came to him they would draw the blinds or give a party at quai conti “i am very glad that the party has not been put off for my guests’ sake” said m de charlus not realising that in expressing himself thus he was offending mme verdurin meanwhile i was struck as was everybody who approached mme verdurin that evening by a far from pleasant odour of rhinogomenol the reason was as follows we know that mme verdurin never expressed her artistic feelings in a moral but always in a physical fashion so that they might appear more inevitable and more profound so if one spoke to her of vinteuil’s music her favourite she remained unmoved as though she expected to derive no emotion from it but after a few minutes of a fixed almost abstracted gaze in a sharp matter of fact scarcely civil tone as though she had said to you “i don’t in the least mind your smoking it’s because of the carpet it’s a very fine one not that that matters either but it’s highly inflammable i’m dreadfully afraid of fire and i shouldn’t like to see you all roasted because some one had carelessly dropped a cigarette end on it” she replied “i have no fault to find with vinteuil to my mind he is the greatest composer of the age only i can never listen to that sort of stuff without weeping all the time” she did not apply any pathos to the word ‘weeping’ she would have used precisely the same tone for ‘sleeping’ certain slandermongers used indeed to insist that the latter verb would have been more applicable though no one could ever be certain for she listened to the music with her face buried in her hands and certain snoring sounds might after all have been sobs “i don’t mind weeping not in the least only i get the most appalling colds afterwards it stuffs up my mucous membrane and the day after i look like nothing on earth i have to inhale for days on end before i can utter however one of cottard’s pupils a charming person has been treating me for it he goes by quite an original rule ‘prevention is better than cure’ and he greases my nose before the music begins it is radical i can weep like all the mothers who ever lost a child not a trace of a cold sometimes a little conjunctivitis that’s all it is absolutely efficacious otherwise i could never have gone on listening to vinteuil i was just going from one bronchitis to another” i could not refrain from alluding to mlle vinteuil “isn’t the composer’s daughter to be here” i asked mme verdurin “with one of her friends” “no i have just had a telegram” mme verdurin said evasively “they have been obliged to remain in the country” i felt a momentary hope that there might never have been any question of their leaving it and that mme verdurin had announced the presence of these representatives of the composer only in order to make a favourable impression upon the performers and their audience “what didn’t they come then to the rehearsal this afternoon” came with a feigned curiosity from the baron who was anxious to let it appear that he had not seen charlie the latter came up to greet me i whispered a question in his ear about mlle vinteuil he seemed to me to know little or nothing about her i signalled to him not to let himself be heard and told him that we should discuss the question later on he bowed and assured me that he would be delighted to place himself entirely at my disposal i observed that he was far more polite more respectful than he had been in the past i spoke warmly of him — who might perhaps be able to help me to clear up my suspicions — to m de charlus who replied “he only does what is natural there would be no point in his living among respectable people if he didn’t learn good manners” these according to m de charlus were the old manners of france untainted by any british bluntness thus when charlie returning from a tour in the provinces or abroad arrived in his travelling suit at the baron’s the latter if there were not too many people present would kiss him without ceremony upon both cheeks perhaps a little in order to banish by so ostentatious a display of his affection any idea of its being criminal perhaps because he could not deny himself a pleasure but still more doubtless from a literary sense as upholding and illustrating the traditional manners of france and just as he would have countered the munich or modern style of furniture by keeping in his rooms old armchairs that had come to him from a greatgrandmother countering the british phlegm with the affection of a warmhearted father of the eighteenth century unable to conceal his joy at beholding his son once more was there indeed a trace of incest in this paternal affection it is more probable that the way in which m de charlus habitually appeased his vicious cravings as to which we shall learn something in due course was not sufficient for the need of affection which had remained unsatisfied since the death of his wife the fact remains that after having thought more than once of a second marriage he was now devoured by a maniacal desire to adopt an heir people said that he was going to adopt morel and there was nothing extraordinary in that the invert who has been unable to feed his passion save on a literature written for womenloving men who used to think of men when he read mussel’snuits feels the need to partake nevertheless in all the social activities of the man who is not an invert to keep a lover as the old frequenter of the opera keeps balletgirls to settle down to marry or form a permanent tie to become a father

   m de charlus took morel aside on the pretext of making him tell him what was going to be played but above all finding a great consolation while charlie shewed him his music in displaying thus publicly their secret intimacy in the meantime i myself felt a certain charm for albeit the little clan included few girls on the other hand girls were abundantly invited on the big evenings there were a number present and very pretty girls too whom i knew they wafted smiles of greeting to me across the room the air was thus decorated at every moment with the charming smile of some girl that is the manifold occasional ornament of evening parties as it is of days we remember an atmosphere because girls were smiling in it

   many people might have been greatly surprised had they overheard the furtive remarks which m de charlus exchanged with a number of important gentlemen at this party these were two dukes a distinguished general a great writer a great physician a great barrister and the remarks in question were “by the way did you notice the footman i mean the little fellow they take on the carriage at our cousin guermantes’ you don’t know of anyone” “at the moment no” “i say though outside the door where the carriages stop there used to be a fair little person in breeches who seemed to me most attractive she called my carriage most charmingly i would gladly have prolonged the conversation” “yes but i believe she’s altogether against it besides she puts on airs you like to get to business at once you would loathe her anyhow i know there’s nothing doing a friend of mine tried” “that is a pity i thought the profile very fine and the hair superb” “really as much as that i think if you had seen a little more of her you would have been disillusioned no in the supperroom only two months ago you would have seen a real marvel a great fellow six foot six a perfect skin and loves it too but he’s gone off to poland” “ah that is rather a long way” “you never know he may come back perhaps one always meets again somewhere” there is no great social function that does not if in taking a section of it we contrive to cut sufficiently deep resemble those parties to which doctors invite their patients who utter the most intelligent remarks have perfect manners and would never shew that they were mad did they not whisper in our ear pointing to some old gentleman who goes past “that’s joan of arc”

    “i feel that it is our duty to enlighten him” mme verdurin said to brichot “not that i have anything against charlus far from it he is a pleasant fellow and as for his reputation i don’t mind saying that it is not of a sort that can do me any harm as far as i’m concerned in our little clan in our tabletalk as i detest flirts the men who talk nonsense to a woman in a corner instead of discussing interesting topics i’ve never had any fear with charlus of what happened to me with swann and elstir and lots of them with him i was quite safe he would come to my dinners all the women in the world might be there you could be certain that the general conversation would not be disturbed by flirtations and whisperings charlus is in a class of his own one doesn’t worry he might be a priest only he must not be allowed to take it upon himself to order about the young men who come to the house and make a nuisance of himself in our little nucleus or he’ll be worse than a man who runs after women” and mme verdurin was sincere in thus proclaiming her indulgence towards charlism like every ecclesiastical power she regarded human frailties as less dangerous than anything that might undermine the principle of authority impair the orthodoxy modify the ancient creed of her little church “if he does then i shall bare my teeth what do you say to a gentleman who tried to prevent charlie from coming to a rehearsal because he himself was not invited so he’s going to be taught a lesson i hope he’ll profit by it otherwise he can simply take his hat and go he keeps the boy under lock and key upon my word he does” and using exactly the same expressions that almost anyone else might have used for there are certain not in common currency which some particular subject some given circumstance recalls almost inevitably to the mind of the speaker who imagines that he is giving free expression to his thought when he is merely repeating mechanically the universal lesson she went on “it’s impossible to see morel nowadays without that great lout hanging round him like an armed escort” m verdurin offered to take charlie out of the room for a minute to explain things to him on the pretext of asking him a question mme verdurin was afraid that this might upset him and that he would play badly in consequence it would be better to postpone this performance until after the other perhaps even until a later occasion for however mme verdurin might look forward to the delicious emotion that she would feel when she knew that her husband was engaged in enlightening charlie in the next room she was afraid if the shot missed fire that he would lose his temper and would fail to reappear on the sixteenth

   what ruined m de charlus that evening was the illbreeding — so common in their class — of the people whom he had invited and who were now beginning to arrive having come there partly out of friendship for m de charlus and also out of curiosity to explore these novel surroundings each duchess made straight for the baron as though it were he who was giving the party and said within a yard of the verdurins who could hear every word “shew me which is mother verdurin do you think i really need speak to her i do hope at least that she won’t put my name in the paper tomorrow nobody would ever speak to me again what that woman with the white hair but she looks quite presentable” hearing some mention of mlle vinteuil who however was not in the room more than one of them said “ah the sonataman’s daughter shew me her” and each finding a number of her friends they formed a group by themselves watched sparkling with ironical curiosity the arrival of the faithful able at the most to point a finger at the odd way in which a person had done her hair who a few years later was to make this the fashion in the very best society and in short regretted that they did not find this house as different from the houses that they knew as they had hoped to find it feeling the disappointment of people in society who having gone to the boîte à bruant in the hope that the singer would make a butt of them find themselves greeted on their arrival with a polite bow instead of the expected

m de charlus had at balbec given me a perspicacious criticism of mme de vaugoubert who notwithstanding her keen intellect had brought about after his unexpected prosperity the irremediable disgrace of her husband the rulers to whose court m de vaugoubert was accredited king theodosius and queen eudoxia having returned to paris but this time for a prolonged visit daily festivities had been held in their honour in the course of which the queen on the friendliest terms with mme de vaugoubert whom she had seen for the last ten years in her own capital and knowing neither the wife of the president of the republic nor those of his ministers had neglected these ladies and kept entirely aloof with the ambassadress this lady believing her own position to be unassailable — m de vaugoubert having been responsible for the alliance between king theodosius and france — had derived from the preference that the queen shewed for her society a proud satisfaction but no anxiety at the peril that threatened her which took shape a few months later in the fact wrongly considered impossible by the too confident couple of the brutal dismissal from the service of m de vaugoubert m de charlus remarking in the ‘crawler’ upon the downfall of his lifelong friend expressed his astonishment that an intelligent woman had not in such circumstances brought all her influence with the king and queen to bear so as to secure that she might not seem to possess any influence and to make them transfer to the wives of the president and his ministers a civility by which those ladies would have been all the more flattered that is to say which would have made them more inclined in their satisfaction to be grateful to the vaugouberts inasmuch as they would have supposed that civility to be spontaneous and not dictated by them but the man who can see the mistakes of others need only be exhilarated by circumstances in order to succumb to them himself and m de charlus while his guests fought their way towards him to come and congratulate him thank him as though he were the master of the house never thought of asking them to say a few words to mme verdurin only the queen of naples in whom survived the same noble blood that had flowed in the veins of her sisters the empress elisabeth and the duchesse d’alençon made a point of talking to mme verdurin as though she had come for the pleasure of meeting her rather than for the music and for m de charlus made endless pretty speeches to her hostess could not cease from telling her for how long she had been wishing to make her acquaintance expressed her admiration for the house and spoke to her of all manner of subjects as though she were paying a call she would so much have liked to bring her niece elisabeth she said the niece who shortly afterwards was to marry prince albert of belgium who would be so sorry she stopped talking when she saw the musicians mount the platform asking which of them was morel she can scarcely have been under any illusion as to the motives that led m de charlus to desire that the young virtuoso should be surrounded with so much glory but the venerable wisdom of a sovereign in whose veins flowed the blood of one of the noblest races in history one of the richest in experience scepticism and pride made her merely regard the inevitable defects of the people whom she loved best such as her cousin charlus whose mother had been like herself a ‘duchess in bavaria’ as misfortunes that rendered more precious to them the support that they might find in herself and consequently made it even more pleasant to her to provide that support she knew that m de charlus would be doubly touched by her having taken the trouble to come in the circumstances only being as good as she had long ago shewn herself brave this heroic woman who a soldierqueen had herself fired her musket from the ramparts of gaeta always ready to take her place chivalrously by the weaker side seeing mme verdurin alone and abandoned and unaware for that matter that she ought not to leave the queen had sought to pretend that for her the queen of naples the centre of this party the lodestone that had made her come was mme verdurin she expressed her regret that she would not be able to remain until the end as she had although she never went anywhere to go on to another party and begged that on no account when she had to go should any fuss be made for her thus discharging mme verdurin of the honours which the latter did not even know that she ought to render

   one must however do m de charlus the justice of saying that if he entirely forgot mme verdurin and allowed her to be ignored to a scandalous extent by the people ‘of his own world’ whom he had invited he did on the other hand realise that he must not allow these people to display during the ‘symphonic recital’ itself the bad manners which they were exhibiting towards the mistress morel had already mounted the platform the musicians were assembling and one could still hear conversations not to say laughter speeches such as “it appears one has to be initiated to understand it” immediately m de charlus drawing himself erect as though he had entered a different body from that which i had seen not an hour ago crawling towards mme verdurin’s door assumed a prophetic expression and regarded the assembly with an earnestness which indicated that this was not the moment for laughter whereupon one saw a rapid blush tinge the cheeks of more than one lady thus publicly rebuked like a schoolgirl scolded by her teacher in front of the whole class to my mind m de charlus’s attitude noble as it was was somehow slightly comic for at one moment he pulverised his guests with a flaming glare at another in order to indicate to them as with a vade mecum the religious silence that ought to be observed the detachment from every worldly consideration he furnished in himself as he raised to his fine brow his whitegloved hands a model to which they must conform of gravity already almost of ecstasy without acknowledging the greetings of latecomers so indelicate as not to understand that it was now the time for high art they were all hypnotised no one dared utter a sound move a chair respect for music — by virtue of palamède’s prestige — had been instantaneously inculcated in a crowd as illbred as it was exclusive

   when i saw appear on the little platform not only morel and a pianist but performers upon other instruments as well i supposed that the programme was to begin with works of composers other than vinteuil for i imagined that the only work of his in existence was his sonata for piano and violin

   mme verdurin sat in a place apart the twin hemispheres of her pale slightly roseate brow magnificently curved her hair drawn back partly in imitation of an eighteenth century portrait partly from the desire for coolness of a feverstricken patient whom modesty forbids to reveal her condition aloof a deity presiding over musical rites patron saint of wagnerism and sickheadaches a sort of almost tragic norn evoked by the spell of genius in the midst of all these bores in whose presence she would more than ordinarily scorn to express her feelings upon hearing a piece of music which she knew better than they the concert began i did not know what they were playing i found myself in a strange land where was i to locate it into what composer’s country had i come i should have been glad to know and seeing nobody near me whom i might question i should have liked to be a character in those arabian nights which i never tired of reading and in which in moments of uncertainty there arose a genie or a maiden of ravishing beauty invisible to everyone else but not to the embarrassed hero to whom she reveals exactly what he wishes to learn well at this very moment i was favoured with precisely such a magical apparition as in a stretch of country which we suppose to be strange to us and which as a matter of fact we have approached from a new angle when after turning out of one road we find ourself emerging suddenly upon another every inch of which is familiar only we have not been in the habit of entering it from that end we say to ourself immediately “why this is the lane that leads to the garden gate of my friends the x—— i shall be there in a minute” and there indeed is their daughter at the gate come out to greet us as we pass so all of a sudden i found myself in the midst of this music that was novel to me right in the heart of vinteuil’s sonata and more marvellous than any maiden the little phrase enveloped harnessed in silver glittering with brilliant effects of sound as light and soft as silken scarves came towards me recognisable in this new guise my joy at having found it again was enhanced by the accent so friendlily familiar which it adopted in addressing me so persuasive so simple albeit without dimming the shimmering beauty with which it was resplendent its intention however was this time merely to shew me the way which was not the way of the sonata for this was an unpublished work of vinteuil in which he had merely amused himself by an allusion which was explained at this point by a sentence in the programme which one ought to have been reading simultaneously in making the little phrase reappear for a moment no sooner was it thus recalled than it vanished and i found myself once more in an unknown world but i knew now and everything that followed only confirmed my knowledge that this world was one of those which i had never even been capable of imagining that vinteuil could have created for when weary of the sonata which was to me a universe thoroughly explored i tried to imagine others equally beautiful but different i was merely doing what those poets do who fill their artificial paradise with meadows flowers and streams which duplicate those existing already upon earth what was now before me made me feel as keen a joy as the sonata would have given me if i had not already known it and consequently while no less beautiful was different whereas the sonata opened upon a dawn of lilied meadows parting its slender whiteness to suspend itself over the frail and yet consistent mingling of a rustic bower of honeysuckle with white geraniums it was upon continuous level surfaces like those of the sea that in the midst of a stormy morning beneath an already lurid sky there began in an eery silence in an infinite void this hew masterpiece and it was into a roseate dawn that in order to construct itself progressively before me this unknown universe was drawn from silence and from night this so novel redness so absent from the tender rustic pale sonata tinged all the sky as dawn does with a mysterious hope and a song already thrilled the air a song on seven notes but the strangest the most different from any that i had ever imagined from any that i could ever have been able to imagine at once ineffable and piercing no longer the cooing of a dove as in the sonata but rending the air as vivid as the scarlet tinge in which the opening bars had been bathed something like the mystical crow of a cock an ineffable but overshrill appeal of the eternal morning the cold atmosphere soaked in rain electric — of a quality so different feeling wholly other pressures in a world so remote from that virginal and endowed only with vegetable life of the sonata — changed at every moment obliterating the empurpled promise of the dawn at noon however beneath a scorching though transitory sun it seemed to fulfil itself in a dull almost rustic bliss in which the peal of clanging racing bells like those which kindled the blaze of the square outside the church of combray which vinteuil who must often have heard them had perhaps discovered at that moment in his memory like a colour which the painter’s hand has conveyed to his palette seemed to materialise the coarsest joy to be honest from the aesthetic point of view this joyous motive did not appeal to me i found it almost ugly its rhythm dragged so laboriously along the ground that one might have succeeded in imitating almost everything that was essential to it by merely making a noise sounds by the tapping of drumsticks upon a table it seemed to me that vinteuil had been lacking here in inspiration and consequently i was a little lacking also in the power of attention

   i looked at the mistress whose sullen immobility seemed to be protesting against the noddings — in time with the music — of the empty heads of the ladies of the faubourg she did not say “you understand that i know something about this music and more than a little if i had to express all that i feel you would never hear the end of it” she did not say this but her upright motionless body her expressionless eyes her straying locks said it for her they spoke also of her courage said that the musicians might go on need not spare her nerves that she would not flinch at the andante would not cry out at the allegro i looked at the musicians the violoncellist dominated the instrument which he clutched between his knees bowing his head to which its coarse features gave in moments of mannerism an involuntary expression of disgust he leaned over it fingered it with the same domestic patience with which he might have plucked a cabbage while by his side the harpist a mere girl in a short skirt bounded on either side by the lines of her golden quadrilateral like those which in the magic chamber of a sibyl would arbitrarily denote the ether according to the consecrated rules seemed to be going in quest here and there at the point required of an exquisite sound just as though a little allegorical deity placed in front of the golden trellis of the heavenly vault she were gathering one by one its stars as for morel a lock hitherto invisible and lost in the rest of his hair had fallen loose and formed a curl upon his brow i turned my head slightly towards the audience to discover what m de charlus might be feeling at the sight of this curl but my eyes encountered only the face or rather the hands of mme verdurin for the former was entirely buried in the latter

   but very soon the triumphant motive of the bells having been banished dispersed by others i succumbed once again to the music and i began to realise that if in the body of this septet different elements presented themselves in turn to combine at the close so also vinteuil’s sonata and as i was to find later on his other works as well had been no more than timid essays exquisite but very slight towards the triumphant and complete masterpiece which was revealed to me at this moment and so too i could not help recalling how i had thought of the other worlds which vinteuil might have created as of so many universes as hermetically sealed as each of my own loveaffairs whereas in reality i was obliged to admit that in the volume of my latest love — that is to say my love for albertine — my first inklings of love for her at balbec at the very beginning then after the game of ferret then on the night when she slept at the hotel then in paris on the foggy afternoon then on the night of the guermantes’ party then at balbec again and finally in paris where my life was now closely linked to her own had been nothing more than experiments indeed if i were to consider not my love for albertine but my life as a whole my earlier loveaffairs had themselves been but slight and timid essays experiments which paved the way to this vaster love my love for albertine and i ceased to follow the music in order to ask myself once again whether albertine had or had not seen mlle vinteuil during the last few days as we interrogate afresh an internal pain from which we have been distracted for a moment for it was in myself that albertine’s possible actions were performed of each of the people whom we know we possess a double but it is generally situated on the horizon of our imagination of our memory it remains more or less external to ourselves and what it has done or may have done has no greater capacity to cause us pain than an object situated at a certain distance which provides us with only the painless sensations of vision the things that affect these people we perceive in a contemplative fashion we are able to deplore them in appropriate language which gives other people a sense of our kindness of heart we do not feel them but since the wound inflicted on me at balbec it was in my heart at a great depth difficult to extract that albertine’s double was lodged what i saw of her hurt me as a sick man would be hurt whose senses were so seriously deranged that the sight of a colour would be felt by him internally like a knifethrust in his living flesh it was fortunate that i had not already yielded to the temptation to break with albertine the boring thought that i should have to see her again presently when i went home was a trifling matter compared with the anxiety that i should have felt if the separation had been permanent at this moment when i felt a doubt about her before she had had time to become immaterial to me at the moment when i pictured her thus to myself waiting for me at home like a beloved wife who found the time of waiting long and had perhaps fallen asleep for a moment in her room i was caressed by the passage of a tender phrase homely and domestic of the septet perhaps — everything is so interwoven and superimposed in our inward life — it had been inspired in vinteuil by his daughter’s sleep — his daughter the cause today of all my troubles — when it enveloped in its quiet on peaceful evenings the work of the composer this phrase which calmed me so by the same soft background of silence which pacifies certain of schumann’s reveries during which even when ‘the poet is speaking’ one can tell that ‘the child is asleep’ asleep awake i should find her again this evening when i chose to return home albertine my little child and yet i said to myself something more mysterious than albertine’s love seemed to be promised at the outset of this work in those first cries of dawn i endeavoured to banish the thought of my mistress so as to think only of the composer indeed he seemed to be present one would have said that reincarnate the composer lived for all time in his music one could feel the joy with which he was choosing the colour of some sound harmonising it with the rest for with other and more profound gifts vinteuil combined that which few composers and indeed few painters have possessed of using colours not merely so lasting but so personal that just as time has been powerless to fade them so the disciples who imitate him who discovered them and even the masters who surpass him do not pale their originality the revolution that their apparition has effected does not live to see its results merge unacknowledged in the work of subsequent generations it is liberated it breaks out again and alone whenever the innovator’s works are performed in all time to come each note underlined itself in a colour which all the rules in the world could not have taught the most learned composers to imitate with the result that vinteuil albeit he had appeared at his hour and was fixed in his place in the evolution of music would always leave that place to stand in the forefront whenever any of his compositions was performed which would owe its appearance of having blossomed after the works of other more recent composers to this quality apparently paradoxical and actually deceiving of permanent novelty a page of symphonic music by vinteuil familiar already on the piano when one heard it rendered by an orchestra like a ray of summer sunlight which the prism of the window disintegrates before it enters a dark diningroom revealed like an unsuspected myriadhued treasure all the jewels of the arabian nights but how can one compare to that motionless brilliance of light what was life perpetual and blissful motion this vinteuil whom i had known so timid and sad had been capable — when he had to select a tone to blend another with it — of audacities had enjoyed a good fortune in the full sense of the word as to which the hearing of any of his works left one in no doubt the joy that such chords had aroused in him the increase of strength that it had given him wherewith to discover others led the listener on also from one discovery to another or rather it was the composer himself who guided him deriving from the colours that he had invented a wild joy which gave him the strength to discover to fling himself upon the others which they seemed to evoke enraptured quivering as though from the shock of an electric spark when the sublime came spontaneously to life at the clang of the brass panting drunken maddened dizzy while he painted his great musical fresco like michelangelo strapped to his scaffold and dashing from his supine position tumultuous brushstrokes upon the ceiling of the sistine chapel vinteuil had been dead for many years but in the sound of these instruments which he had animated it had been given him to prolong for an unlimited time a part at least of his life of his life as a man merely if art was indeed but a prolongation of life was it worth while to sacrifice anything to it was it not as unreal as life itself if i was to listen properly to this septet i could not pause to consider the question no doubt the glowing septet differed singularly from the candid sonata the timid question to which the little phrase replied from the breathless supplication to find the fulfilment of the strange promise that had resounded so harsh so supernatural so brief setting athrob the still inert crimson of the morning sky above the sea and yet these so widely different phrases were composed of the same elements for just as there was a certain universe perceptible by us in those fragments scattered here and there in private houses in public galleries which were elstir’s universe the universe which he saw in which he lived so to the music of vinteuil extended note by note key by key the unknown colourings of an inestimable unsuspected universe made fragmentary by the gaps that occurred between the different occasions of hearing his work performed those two so dissimilar questions which commanded the so different movements of the sonata and the septet the former breaking into short appeals a line continuous and pure the latter welding together into an indivisible structure a medley of scattered fragments were nevertheless one so calm and timid almost detached and as though philosophic the other so anxious pressing imploring were nevertheless the same prayer poured forth before different risings of the inward sun and merely refracted through the different mediums of other thoughts of artistic researches carried on through the years in which he had tried to create something new a prayer a hope which was at heart the same distinguishable beneath these disguises in the various works of vinteuil and on the other hand not to be found elsewhere than in his works for these phrases historians of music might indeed find affinities a pedigree in the works of other great composers but merely for subordinate reasons from external resemblances from analogies which were ingeniously discovered by reasoning rather than felt by a direct impression the impression that these phrases of vinteuil imparted was different from any other as though notwithstanding the conclusions to which science seems to point the individual did really exist and it was precisely when he was seeking vigorously to be something new that one recognised beneath the apparent differences the profound similarities and the deliberate resemblances that existed in the body of a work when vinteuil repeated once and again a single phrase diversified it amused himself by altering its rhythm by making it reappear in its original form these deliberate resemblances the work of the intellect inevitably superficial never succeeded in being as striking as those resemblances concealed involuntary which broke out in different colours between the two separate masterpieces for then vinteuil seeking to do something new questioned himself with all the force of his creative effort reached his own essential nature at those depths where whatever be the question asked it is in the same accent that is to say its own that it replies such an accent the accent of vinteuil is separated from the accents of other composers by a difference far greater than that which we perceive between the voices of two people even between the cries of two species of animal by the difference that exists between the thoughts of those other composers and the eternal investigations of vinteuil the question that he put to himself in so many forms his habitual speculation but as free from analytical formulas of reasoning as if it were being carried out in the world of the angels so that we can measure its depth but without being any more able to translate it into human speech than are disincarnate spirits when evoked by a medium he questions them as to the mysteries of death and even when i bore in mind the acquired originality which had struck me that afternoon that kinship which musical critics might discover among them it is indeed a unique accent to which rise and return in spite of themselves those great singers that original composers are which is a proof of the irreducibly individual existence of the soul though vinteuil might try to make more solemn more grand or to make more sprightly and gay what he saw reflected in the mind of his audience yet in spite of himself he submerged it all beneath an undercurrent which makes his song eternal and at once recognisable this song different from those of other singers similar to all his own where had vinteuil learned where had he heard it each artist seems thus to be the native of an unknown country which he himself has forgotten different from that from which will emerge making for the earth another great artist when all is said vinteuil in his latest works seemed to have drawn nearer to that unknown country the atmosphere was no longer the same as in the sonata the questioning phrases became more pressing more uneasy the answers more mysterious the cleanwashed air of morning and evening seemed to influence even the instruments morel might be playing marvellously the sounds that came from his violin seemed to me singularly piercing almost blatant this harshness was pleasing and as in certain voices one felt in it a sort of moral virtue and intellectual superiority but this might give offence when his vision of the universe is modified purified becomes more adapted to his memory of the country of his heart it is only natural that this should be expressed by a general alteration of sounds in the musician as of colours in the painter anyhow the more intelligent section of the public is not misled since people declared later on that vinteuil’s last compositions were the most profound now no programme no subject supplied any intellectual basis for judgment one guessed therefore that it was a question of transposition an increasing profundity of sound

   this lost country composers do not actually remember but each of them remains all his life somehow attuned to it he is wild with joy when he is singing the airs of his native land betrays it at times in his thirst for fame but then in seeking fame turns his back upon it and it is only when he despises it that he finds it when he utters whatever the subject with which he is dealing that peculiar strain the monotony of which — for whatever its subject it remains identical in itself — proves the permanence of the elements that compose his soul but is it not the fact then that from those elements all the real residuum which we are obliged to keep to ourselves which cannot be transmitted in talk even by friend to friend by master to disciple by lover to mistress that ineffable something which makes a difference in quality between what each of us has felt and what he is obliged to leave behind at the threshold of the phrases in which he can communicate with his fellows only by limiting himself to external points common to us all and of no interest art the art of a vinteuil like that of an elstir makes the man himself apparent rendering externally visible in the colours of the spectrum that intimate composition of those worlds which we call individual persons and which without the aid of art we should never know a pair of wings a different mode of breathing which would enable us to traverse infinite space would in no way help us for if we visited mars or venus keeping the same senses they would clothe in the same aspect as the things of the earth everything that we should be capable of seeing the only true voyage of discovery the only fountain of eternal youth would be not to visit strange lands but to possess other eyes to behold the universe through the eyes of another of a hundred others to behold the hundred universes that each of them beholds that each of them is and this we can contrive with an elstir with a vinteuil with men like these we do really fly from star to star the andante had just ended upon a phrase filled with a tenderness to which i had entirely abandoned myself there followed before the next movement a short interval during which the performers laid down their instruments and the audience exchanged impressions a duke in order to shew that he knew what he was talking about declared “it is a difficult thing to play well” other more entertaining people conversed for a moment with myself but what were their words which like every human and external word left me so indifferent compared with the heavenly phrase of music with which i had just been engaged i was indeed like an angel who fallen from the inebriating bliss of paradise subsides into the most humdrum reality and just as certain creatures are the last surviving testimony to a form of life which nature has discarded i asked myself if music were not the unique example of what might have been — if there had not come the invention of language the formation of words the analysis of ideas — the means of communication between one spirit and another it is like a possibility which has ended in nothing humanity has developed along other lines those of spoken and written language but this return to the unanalysed was so inebriating that on emerging from that paradise contact with people who were more or less intelligent seemed to me of an extraordinary insignificance people — i had been able during the music to remember them to blend them with it or rather i had blended with the music little more than the memory of one person only which was albertine and the phrase that ended the andante seemed to me so sublime that i said to myself that it was a pity that albertine did not know it and had she known it would not have understood what an honour it was to be blended with anything so great as this phrase which brought us together and the pathetic voice of which she seemed to have borrowed but once the music was interrupted the people who were present seemed utterly lifeless refreshments were handed round m de charlus accosted a footman now and then with “how are you did you get my note can you come” no doubt there was in these remarks the freedom of the great nobleman who thinks he is flattering his hearer and is himself more one of the people than a man of the middle classes there was also the cunning of the criminal who imagines that anything which he volunteers is on that account regarded as innocent and he added in the guermantes tone of mme de villeparisis “he’s a good young fellow such a good sort i often employ him at home” but his adroitness turned against the baron for people thought his intimate conversation and correspondence with footmen extraordinary the footmen themselves were not so much flattered as embarrassed in the presence of their comrades meanwhile the septet had begun again and was moving towards its close again and again one phrase or another from the sonata recurred but always changed its rhythm and harmony different the same and yet something else as things recur in life and they were phrases of the sort which without our being able to understand what affinity assigns to them as their sole and necessary home the past life of a certain composer are to be found only in his work and appear constantly in it where they are the fairies the dryads the household gods i had at the start distinguished in the septet two or three which reminded me of the sonata presently — bathed in the violet mist which rose particularly in vinteuil’s later work so much so that even when he introduced a dance measure it remained captive in the heart of an opal — i caught the sound of another phrase from the sonata still hovering so remote that i barely recognised it hesitating it approached vanished as though in alarm then returned joined hands with others come as i learned later on from other works summoned yet others which became in their turn attractive and persuasive as soon as they were tamed and took their places in the ring a ring divine but permanently invisible to the bulk of the audience who having before their eyes only a thick veil through which they saw nothing punctuated arbitrarily with admiring exclamations a continuous boredom which was becoming deadly then they withdrew save one which i saw reappear five times or six without being able to distinguish its features but so caressing so different — as was no doubt the little phrase in swann’s sonata — from anything that any woman had ever made me desire that this phrase which offered me in so sweet a voice a happiness which would really have been worth the struggle to obtain it is perhaps — this invisible creature whose language i did not know and whom i understood so well — the only stranger that it has ever been my good fortune to meet then this phrase broke up was transformed like the little phrase in the sonata and became the mysterious appeal of the start a phrase of a plaintive kind rose in opposition to it but so profound so vague so internal almost so organic and visceral that one could not tell at each of its repetitions whether they were those of a theme or of an attack of neuralgia presently these two motives were wrestling together in a close fight in which now one disappeared entirely and now the listener could catch only a fragment of the other a wrestling match of energies only to tell the truth for if these creatures attacked one another it was rid of their physical bodies of their appearance of their names and finding in me an inward spectator himself indifferent also to their names and to all details interested only in their immaterial and dynamic combat and following with passion its sonorous changes in the end the joyous motive was left triumphant it was no longer an almost anxious appeal addressed to an empty sky it was an ineffable joy which seemed to come from paradise a joy as different from that of the sonata as from a grave and gentle angel by bellini playing the theorbo would be some archangel by mantegna sounding a trump i might be sure that this new tone of joy this appeal to a superterrestrial joy was a thing that i would never forget but should i be able ever to realise it this question seemed to me all the more important inasmuch as this phrase was what might have seemed most definitely to characterise — from its sharp contrast with all the rest of my life with the visible world — those impressions which at remote intervals i recaptured in my life as startingpoints foundationstones for the construction of a true life the impression that i had felt at the sight of the steeples of martinville or of a line of trees near balbec in any case to return to the particular accent of this phrase how strange it was that the presentiment most different from what life assigns to us on earth the boldest approximation to the bliss of the world beyond should have been materialised precisely in the melancholy respectable little old man whom we used to meet in the month of mary at combray but stranger still how did it come about that this revelation the strangest that i had yet received of an unknown type of joy should have come to me from him since it was understood when he died he left nothing behind him but his sonata all the rest being nonexistent in indecipherable scribbljngs indecipherable they may have been but they had nevertheless been in the end deciphered by dint of patience intelligence and respect by the only person who had lived sufficiently in vinteuil’s company to understand his method of working to interpret his orchestral indications mlle vinteuil’s friend even in the lifetime of the great composer she had acquired from his daughter the reverence that the latter felt for her father it was because of this reverence that in those moments in which people run counter to their natural inclinations the two girls had been able to find an insane pleasure in the profanations which have already been narrated her adoration of her father was the primary condition of his daughter’s sacrilege and no doubt they ought to have foregone the delight of that sacrilege but it did not express the whole of their natures and what is more the profanations had become rarefied until they disappeared altogether in proportion as their morbid carnal relations that troubled smouldering fire had given place to the flame of a pure and lofty friendship mlle vinteuil’s friend was sometimes worried by the importunate thought that she had perhaps hastened the death of vinteuil at any rate by spending years in poring over the cryptic scroll left by him in establishing the correct reading of those illegible hieroglyphs mlle vinteuil’s friend had the consolation of assuring the composer whose grey hairs she had sent in sorrow to the grave an immortal and compensating glory relations which are not consecrated by the laws establish bonds of kinship as manifold as complex even more solid than those which spring from marriage indeed without pausing to consider relations of so special a nature do we not find every day that adultery when it is based upon genuine love does not upset the family sentiment the duties of kinship but rather revivifies them adultery brings the spirit into what marriage would often have left a dead letter a goodnatured girl who merely from convention will wear mourning for her mother’s second husband has not tears enough to shed for the man whom her mother has chosen out of all the world as her lover anyhow mlle vinteuil had acted only in a spirit of sadism which did not excuse her but it gave me a certain consolation to think so later on she must indeed have realised i told myself at the moment when she and her friend profaned her father’s photograph that what they were doing was merely morbidity silliness and not the true and joyous wickedness which she would have liked to feel this idea that it was merely a pretence of wickedness spoiled her pleasure but if this idea recurred to her mind later on as it had spoiled her pleasure so it must then have diminished her grief “it was not i” she must have told herself “i was out of my mind i myself mean still to pray for my father’s soul not to despair of his forgiveness” only it is possible that this idea which had certainly presented itself to her in her pleasure may not have presented itself in her grief i would have liked to be able to put it into her mind i am sure that i should have done her good and that i should have been able to reestablish between her and the memory of her father a pleasant channel of communication

   as in the illegible notebooks in which a chemist of genius who does not know that death is at hand jots down discoveries which will perhaps remain forever unknown mlle vinteuil’s friend had disentangled from papers more illegible than strips of papyrus dotted with a cuneiform script the formula eternally true forever fertile of this unknown joy the mystic hope of the crimson angel of the dawn and i to whom albeit not so much perhaps as to vinteuil she had been also she had been once more this very evening by reviving afresh my jealousy of albertine she was above all in the future to be the cause of so many sufferings it was thanks to her in compensation that there had been able to come to my ears the strange appeal which i should never for a moment cease to hear as the promise and proof that there existed something other realisable no doubt by art than the nullity that i had found in all my pleasures and in love itself and that if my life seemed to me so empty at least there were still regions unexplored

   what she had enabled us thanks to her labour to know of vinteuil was to tell the truth the whole of vinteuil’s work compared with this septet certain phrases from the sonata which alone the public knew appeared so commonplace that one failed to understand how they could have aroused so much admiration similarly we are surprised that for years past pieces as trivial as the evening star or elisabeth’s prayer can have aroused in the concerthall fanatical worshippers who wore themselves out in applause and in crying encore at the end of what after all is poor and trite to us who know tristan the rheingold and themeistersinger we are left to suppose that those featureless melodies contained already nevertheless in infinitesimal and for that reason perhaps more easily assimilable quantities something of the originality of the masterpieces which in retrospect are alone of importance to us but which their very perfection may perhaps have prevented from being understood they have been able to prepare the way for them in our hearts anyhow it is true that if they gave a confused presentiment of the beauties to come they left these in a state of complete obscurity it was the same with vinteuil if at his death he had left behind him — excepting certain parts of the sonata — only what he had been able to complete what we should have known of him would have been in relation to his true greatness as little as in the case of say victor hugo if he had died after the pas d’armes du roi jean the fiancée du timbalier and sarah la baigneuse without having written a line of the légende des siècles or the contemplations what is to us his real work would have remained purely potential as unknown as those universes to which our perception does not attain of which we shall never form any idea

   anyhow the apparent contrast that profound union between genius talent too and even virtue and the sheath of vices in which as had happened in the case of vinteuil it is so frequently contained preserved was legible as in a popular allegory in the mere assembly of the guests among whom i found myself once again when the music had come to an end this assembly albeit limited this time to mme verdurin’s drawingroom resembled many others the ingredients of which are unknown to the general public and which philosophical journalists if they are at all wellinformed call parisian or panamist or dreyfusard never suspecting that they may equally well be found in petersburg berlin madrid and at every epoch if as a matter of fact the under secretary of state for fine arts an artist to his fingertips wellbred and smart several duchesses and three ambassadors with their wives were present this evening at mme verdurin’s the proximate immediate cause of their presence lay in the relations that existed between m de charlus and morel relations which made the baron anxious to give as wide a celebrity as possible to the artistic triumphs of his young idol and to obtain for him the cross of the legion of honour the remoter cause which had made this assembly possible was that a girl living with mlle vinteuil in the same way as the baron was living with charlie had brought to light a whole series of works of genius which had been such a revelation that before long a subscription was to be opened under the patronage of the minister of education with the object of erecting a statue of vinteuil moreover these works had been assisted no less than by mlle vinteuil’s relations with her friend by the baron’s relations with charlie a sort of crossroad a short cut thanks to which the world was enabled to overtake these works without the preliminary circuit if not of a want of comprehension which would long persist at least of a complete ignorance which might have lasted for years whenever an event occurs which is within the range of the vulgar mind of the moralising journalist a political event as a rule the moralising journalists are convinced that there has been some great change in france that we shall never see such evenings again that no one will ever again admire ibsen renan dostoïevski d’annunzio tolstoi wagner strauss for moralising journalists take their text from the equivocal undercurrents of these official manifestations in order to find something decadent in the art which is there celebrated and which as often as not is more austere than any other but there is no name among those most revered by these moralising journalists which has not quite naturally given rise to some such strange gathering although its strangeness may have been less flagrant and better concealed in the case of this gathering the impure elements that associated themselves with it struck me from another aspect to be sure i was as well able as anyone to dissociate them having learned to know them separately but anyhow it came to pass that some of them those which concerned mlle vinteuil and her friend speaking to me of combray spoke to me also of albertine that is to say of balbec since it was because i had long ago seen mlle vinteuil at montjouvain and had learned of her friend’s intimacy with albertine that i was presently when i returned home to find instead of solitude albertine awaiting me and that the others those which concerned morel and m de charlus speaking to me of balbec where i had seen on the platform at doncières their intimacy begin spoke to me of combray and of its two ‘ways’ for m de charlus was one of those guermantes counts of combray inhabiting combray without having any dwelling there between earth and heaven like gilbert the bad in his window while after all morel was the son of that old valet who had enabled me to know the lady in pink and had permitted me years after to identify her with mme swann

   m de charlus repeated when the music at an end his guests came to say goodbye to him the same error that he had made when they arrived he did not ask them to shake hands with their hostess to include her and her husband in the gratitude that was being showered on himself there was a long queue waiting but a queue that led to the baron alone a fact of which he must have been conscious for as he said to me a little later “the form of the artistic celebration ended in a ‘fewwordsinthevestry’ touch that was quite amusing” the guests even prolonged their expressions of gratitude with indiscriminate remarks which enabled them to remain for a moment longer in the baron’s presence while those who had not yet congratulated him on the success of his party hung wearily in the rear a stray husband or two may have announced his intention of going but his wife a snob as well as a duchess protested “no no even if we are kept waiting an hour we cannot go away without thanking palamède who has taken so much trouble there is nobody else left now who can give entertainments like this” nobody would have thought of asking to be introduced to mme verdurin any more than to the attendant in a theatre to which some great lady has for one evening brought the whole aristocracy “were you at eliane de montmorency’s yesterday cousin” asked mme de mortemart seeking an excuse to prolong their conversation “good gracious no i like eliane but i never can understand her invitations i must be very stupid i’m afraid” he went on parting his lips in a broad smile while mme de mortemart realised that she was to be made the first recipient of ‘one of palamède’s’ as she had often been of ‘one of oriane’s’“i did indeed receive a card a fortnight ago from the charming eliane above the questionably authentic name of ‘montmorency’ was the following kind invitation ‘my dear cousin will you please remember me next friday at halfpast nine’ beneath were written two less gratifying words ‘czech quartet’ these seemed to me incomprehensible and in any case to have no more connexion with the sentence above than the words ‘my dear ——’ which you find on the back of a letter with nothing else after them when the writer has already begun again on the other side and has not taken a fresh sheet either from carelessness or in order to save paper i am fond of eliane and so i felt no annoyance i merely ignored the strange and inappropriate allusion to a czech quartet and as i am a methodical man i placed on my chimneypiece the invitation to remember madame de montmorency on friday at halfpast nine although renowned for my obedient punctual and meek nature as buffon says of the camel”— at this laughter seemed to radiate from m de charlus who knew that on the contrary he was regarded as the most impossible person to live with —“i was a few minutes late it took me a few minutes to change my clothes and without any undue remorse thinking that halfpast nine meant ten at the stroke of ten in a comfortable dressinggown with warm slippers on my feet i sat down in my chimney corner to remember eliane as she had asked me and with a concentration which began to relax only at halfpast ten tell her please that i complied strictly with her audacious request i am sure she will be gratified” mme de mortemart was helpless with laughter in which m de charlus joined “and tomorrow” she went on forgetting that she had already long exceeded the time that might be allotted to her “are you going to our la rochefoucauld cousins” “oh that now is quite impossible they have invited me and you too i see to a thing it is utterly impossible to imagine which is called if i am to believe their card of invitation a ‘dancing tea’ i used to be considered pretty nimble when i was young but i doubt whether i could ever decently have drunk a cup of tea while i was dancing no i have never cared for eating or drinking in unnatural positions you will remind me that my dancing days are done but even sitting down comfortably to drink my tea — of the quality of which i am suspicious since it is called ‘dancing’— i should be afraid lest other guests younger than myself and less nimble possibly than i was at their age might spill their cups over my clothes which would interfere with my pleasure in draining my own” nor indeed was m de charlus content with leaving mme verdurin out of the conversation while he spoke of all manner of subjects which he seemed to be taking pleasure in developing and varying that cruel pleasure which he had always enjoyed of keeping indefinitely on their feet the friends who were waiting with an excruciating patience for their turn to come he even criticised all that part of the entertainment for which mme verdurin was responsible “but talking about cups what in the world are those strange little bowls which remind me of the vessels in which when i was a young man people used to get sorbets from poiréblanche somebody said to me just now that they were for ‘iced coffee’ but if it comes to that i have seen neither coffee nor ice what curious little objects — so very ambiguous” in saying this m de charlus had placed his whitegloved hands vertically over his lips and had modestly circumscribed his indicative stare as though he were afraid of being heard or even seen by his host and hostess but this was a mere feint for in a few minutes he would be offering the same criticisms to the mistress herself and a little later would be insolently enjoining “no more icedcoffee cups remember give them to one of your friends whose house you wish to disfigure but warn her not to have them in the drawingroom or people might think that they had come into the wrong room the things are so exactly like chamberpots” “but cousin” said the guest lowering her own voice also and casting a questioning glance at m de charlus for she was afraid of offending not mme verdurin but him “perhaps she doesn’t quite know yet    ” “she shall be taught” “oh” laughed the guest “she couldn’t have a better teacher she is lucky if you are in charge one can be sure there won’t be a false note” “there wasn’t one if it comes to that in the music” “oh it was sublime one of those pleasures which can never be forgotten talking of that marvellous violinist” she went on imagining in her innocence that m de charlus was interested in the violin ‘pure and simple’“do you happen to know one whom i heard the other day playing too wonderfully a sonata by fauré his name is frank    ” “oh he’s a horror” replied m de charlus overlooking the rudeness of a contradiction which implied that his cousin was lacking in taste “as far as violinists are concerned i advise you to confine yourself to mine” this paved the way to a fresh exchange of glances at once furtive and scrutinous between m de charlus and his cousin for blushing and seeking by her zeal to atone for her blunder mme de mortemart went on to suggest to m de charlus that she might give a party to hear morel play now so far as she was concerned this party had not the object of bringing an unknown talent into prominence an object which she would however pretend to have in mind and which was indeed that of m de charlus she regarded it only as an opportunity for giving a particularly smart party and was calculating already whom she would invite and whom she would reject this business of selection the chief preoccupation of people who give parties even the people whom ‘society’ journalists are so impudent or so foolish as to call ‘the élite’ alters at once the expression — and the handwriting — of a hostess more profoundly than any hypnotic suggestion before she had even thought of what morel was to play which she regarded and rightly as a secondary consideration for even if everybody this evening from fear of m de charlus had observed a polite silence during the music it would never have occurred to anyone to listen to it mme de mortemart having decided that mme de valcourt was not to be one of the elect had automatically assumed that air of conspiracy of a secret plotting which so degrades even those women in society who can most easily afford to ignore what ‘people will say’“wouldn’t it be possible for me to give a party for people to hear your friend play” murmured mme de mortemart who while addressing herself exclusively to m de charlus could not refrain as though under a fascination from casting a glance at mme de valcourt the rejected in order to make certain that the other was too far away to hear her “no she cannot possibly hear what i am saying” mme de mortemart concluded inwardly reassured by her own glance which as a matter of fact had had a totally different effect upon mme de valcourt from that intended “why” mme de valcourt had said to herself when she caught this glance “mariethérèse is planning something with palamède which i am not to be told” “you mean my protégé” m de charlus corrected as merciless to his cousin’s choice of words as he was to her musical endowments then without paying the slightest attention to her silent prayers as she made a smiling apology “why yes    ” he said in a loud tone audible throughout the room “although there is always a risk in that sort of exportation of a fascinating personality into surroundings that must inevitably diminish his transcendent gifts and would in any case have to be adapted to them” madame de mortemart told herself that the aside the pianissimo of her question had been a waste of trouble after the megaphone through which the answer had issued she was mistaken mme de valcourt heard nothing for the simple reason that she did not understand a single word her anxiety diminished and would rapidly have been extinguished had not mme de mortemart afraid that she might have been given away and afraid of having to invite mme de valcourt with whom she was on too intimate terms to be able to leave her out if the other knew about her party beforehand raised her eyelids once again in edith’s direction as though not to lose sight of a threatening peril lowering them again briskly so as not to commit herself she intended on the morning after the party to write her one of those letters the complement of the revealing glance letters which people suppose to be subtle and which are tantamount to a full and signed confession for instance “dear edith i am so sorry about you i did not really expect you last night” “how could she have expected me” edith would ask herself “since she never invited me” “as i know that you are not very fond of parties of that sort which rather bore you we should have been greatly honoured all the same by your company” never did mme de mortemart employ the word ‘honoured’ except in the letters in which she attempted to cloak a lie in the semblance of truth “you know that you are always at home in our house however you were quite right as it was a complete failure like everything that is got up at a moment’s notice” but already the second furtive glance darted at her had enabled edith to grasp everything that was concealed by the complicated language of m de charlus this glance was indeed so violent that after it had struck mme de valcourt the obvious secrecy and mischievous intention that it embodied rebounded upon a young peruvian whom mme de mortemart intended on the contrary to invite but being of a suspicious nature seeing all too plainly the mystery that was being made without realising that it was not intended to mystify him he at once conceived a violent hatred of mme de mortemart and determined to play all sorts of tricks upon her such as ordering fifty iced coffees to be sent to her house on a day when she was not giving a party or when she was inserting a paragraph in the newspapers announcing that the party was postponed and publishing false reports of her other parties in which would figure the notorious names of all the people whom for various reasons a hostess does not invite or even allow to be introduced to her mme de mortemart need not have bothered herself about mme de valcourt m de charlus was about to spoil far more effectively than the other’s presence could spoil it the projected party “but my dear cousin” she said in response to the expression ‘adapting the surroundings’ the meaning of which her momentary state of hyperaesthesia had enabled her to discern “we shall save you all the trouble i undertake to ask gilbert to arrange everything” “not on any account all the more as he must not be invited to it nothing can be arranged except by myself the first thing is to exclude all the people who have ears and hear not” m de charlus’s cousin who had been reckoning upon morel as an attraction in order to give a party at which she could say that unlike so many of her kinswomen she had ‘had palamède’ carried her thoughts abruptly from this prestige of m de charlus to all sorts of people with whom he would get her into trouble if he began interfering with the list of her guests the thought that the prince de guermantes on whose account partly she was anxious to exclude mme de valcourt whom he declined to meet was not to be invited alarmed her her eyes assumed an uneasy expression “is the light which is rather too strong hurting you” inquired m de charlus with an apparent seriousness the underlying irony of which she failed to perceive “no not at all i was thinking of the difficulty not for myself of course but for my family if gilbert were to hear that i had given a party without inviting him when he never has a cat on his housetop without    ” “why of course we must begin by eliminating the cat on the housetop which could only miaow i suppose that the din of talk has prevented you from realising that it was a question not of doing the civilities of a hostess but of proceeding to the rites customary at every true celebration” then deciding not that the next person had been kept waiting too long but that it did not do to exaggerate the favours shewn to one who had in mind not so much morel as her own visitinglist m de charlus like a physician who cuts short a consultation when he considers that it has lasted long enough gave his cousin a signal to withdraw not by bidding her good night but by turning to the person immediately behind her “good evening madame de montesquieu marvellous wasn’t it i have not seen hélène tell her that every general abstention even the most noble that is to say her own must include exceptions if they are brilliant as has been the case tonight to shew that one is rare is all very well but to subordinate one’s rarity which is only negative to what is precious is better still in your sister’s case and i value more than anyone her systematic absence from places where what is in store for her is not worthy of her here tonight on the contrary her presence at so memorable an exhibition as this would have been aprésidence and would have given your sister already so distinguished an additional distinction” then he turned to a third person m d’argencourt i was greatly astonished to see in this room as friendly and flattering towards m de charlus as he was severe with him elsewhere insisting upon morel’s being introduced to him and telling him that he hoped he would come and see him m d’argencourt that terrible scourge of men such as m de charlus at the moment he was living in the thick of them it was certainly not because he had in any sense become one of them himself but for some time past he had practically deserted his wife for a young woman in society whom he adored being intelligent herself she made him share her taste for intelligent people and was most anxious to have m de charlus in her house but above all m d’argencourt extremely jealous and not unduly potent feeling that he was failing to satisfy his captive and anxious at once to introduce her to people and to keep her amused could do so without risk to himself only by surrounding her with innocuous men whom he thus cast for the part of guardians of his seraglio these men found that he had become quite pleasant and declared that he was a great deal more intelligent than they had supposed a discovery that delighted him and his mistress

   the remainder of m de charlus’s guests drifted away fairly rapidly several of them said “i don’t want to call at the vestry” the little room in which the baron with charlie by his side was receiving congratulations and to which he himself had given the name “but i must let palamède see me so that he shall know that i stayed to the end” nobody paid the slightest attention to mme verdurin some pretended not to know which was she and said good night by mistake to mme cottard appealing to me for confirmation with a “that is mme verdurin ain’t it” mme d’arpajon asked me in the hearing of our hostess “tell me has there ever been a monsieur verdurin” the duchesses finding none of the oddities that they expected in this place which they had hoped to find more different from anything that they already knew made the best of a bad job by going into fits of laughter in front of elstir’s paintings for all the rest of the entertainment which they found more in keeping than they had expected with the style with which they were familiar they gave the credit to m de charlus saying “how clever palamède is at arranging things if he were to stage an opera in a stable or a bathroom it would still be perfectly charming” the most noble ladies were those who shewed most fervour in congratulating m de charlus upon the success of a party of the secret motive of which some of them were by no means unaware without however being embarrassed by the knowledge this class of society — remembering perhaps certain epochs in history when their own family had already arrived at an identical stage of brazenly conscious effrontery — carrying their contempt for scruples almost as far as their respect for etiquette several of them engaged charlie on the spot for different evenings on which he was to come and play them vinteuil’s septet but it never occurred to any of them to invite mme verdurin this last was already blind with fury when m de charlus who his head in the clouds was incapable of perceiving her condition decided that it would be only decent to invite the mistress to share his joy and it was perhaps yielding to his literary preciosity rather than to an overflow of pride that this specialist in artistic entertainments said to mme verdurin “well are you satisfied i think you have reason to be you see that when i set to work to give a party there are no halfmeasures i do not know whether your heraldic knowledge enables you to gauge the precise importance of the display the weight that i have lifted the volume of air that i have displaced for you you have had the queen of naples the brother of the king of bavaria the three premier peers if vinteuil is mahomet we may say that we have brought to him some of the least movable of mountains bear in mind that to attend your party the queen of naples has come up from neuilly which is a great deal more difficult for her than evacuating the two sicilies” he went on with a deliberate sneer notwithstanding his admiration for the queen “it is an historic event just think that it is perhaps the first time she has gone anywhere since the fall of gaeta it is probable that the dictionaries of dates will record as culminating points the day of the fall of gaeta and that of the verdurins’ party the fan that she laid down the better to applaud vinteuil deserves to become more famous than the fan that mme de metternich broke because the audience hissed wagner” “why she has left it here” said mme verdurin momentarily appeased by the memory of the queen’s kindness to herself and she shewed m de charlus the fan which was lying upon a chair “oh what a touching spectacle” exclaimed m de charlus approaching the relic with veneration “it is all the more touching it is so hideous poor little violette is incredible” and spasms of emotion and irony coursed through him alternately “oh dear i don’t know whether you feel this sort of thing as i do swann would positively have died of convulsions if he had seen it i am sure whatever price it fetches i shall buy the fan at the queen’s sale for she is bound to be sold up she hasn’t a penny” he went on for he never ceased to intersperse the cruellest slanders with the most sincere veneration albeit these sprang from two opposing natures which however were combined in himself they might even be brought to bear alternately upon the same incident for m de charlus who in his comfortable state as a wealthy man ridiculed the poverty of the queen was himself often to be heard extolling that poverty and when anyone spoke of princesse murât queen of the two sicilies would reply “i do not know to whom you are alluding there is only one queen of naples who is a sublime person and does not keep a carriage but from her omnibus she annihilates every vehicle on the street and one could kneel down in the dust on seeing her drive past” “i shall bequeath it to a museum in the meantime it must be sent back to her so that she need not hire a cab to come and fetch it the wisest thing in view of the historical interest of such an object would be to steal the fan but that would be awkward for her — since it is probable that she does not possess another” he added with a shout of laughter “anyhow you see that for my sake she came and that is not the only miracle that i have performed i do not believe that anyone at the present day has the power to move the people whom i have brought here however everyone must be given his due charlie and the rest of the musicians played divinely and my dear mistress” he added condescendingly “you yourself have played your part on this occasion your name will not be unrecorded history has preserved that of the page who armed joan of arc when she set out for battle indeed you have served as a connecting link you have made possible the fusion between vinteuil’s music and its inspired interpreter you have had the intelligence to appreciate the capital importance of the whole chain of circumstances which would enable the interpreter to benefit by the whole weight of a considerable — if i were not referring to myself i would say providential — personage whom you were clever enough to ask to ensure the success of the gathering to bring before morel’s violin the ears directly attached to the tongues that have the widest hearing no no it is not a small matter there can be no small matter in so complete a realisation everything has its part the duras was marvellous in fact everything that is why” he concluded for he loved to administer a rebuke “i set my face against your inviting those persons — divisors who among the overwhelming people whom i brought you would have played the part of the decimal points in a sum reducing the others to a merely fractional value i have a very exact appreciation of that sort of thing you understand we must avoid blunders when we are giving a party which ought to be worthy of vinteuil of his inspired interpreter of yourself and i venture to say of me you were prepared to invite the molé and everything would have been spoiled it would have been the little contrary neutralising drop which deprives a potion of its virtue the electric lights would have fused the pastry would not have come in time the orangeade would have given everybody a stomachache she was the one person not to invite at the mere sound of her name as in a fairytale not a note would have issued from the brass the flute and the hautboy would have been stricken with a sudden silence morel himself even if he had succeeded in playing a few bars would not have been in tune and instead of vinteuil’s septet you would have had a parody of it by beckmesser ending amid catcalls i who believe strongly in personal influence could feel quite plainly in the expansion of a certain largo which opened itself right out like a flower in the supreme satisfaction of the finale which was not merely allegro but incomparably allegro that the absence of the molé was inspiring the musicians and was diffusing joy among the very instruments themselves in any case when one is at home to queens one does not invite one’s hallportress” in calling her ‘the molé’ as for that matter he said quite affectionately ‘the duras’ m de charlus was doing the lady justice for all these women were the actresses of society and it is true also that even regarding her from this point of view comtesse molé did not justify the extraordinary reputation for intelligence that she had acquired which made one think of those mediocre actors or novelists who at certain periods are hailed as men of genius either because of the mediocrity of their competitors among whom there is no artist capable of revealing what is meant by true talent or because of the mediocrity of the public which did there exist an extraordinary individuality would be incapable of understanding it in mme molé‘s case it is preferable if not absolutely fair to stop at the former explanation the social world being the realm of nullity there exist between the merits of women in society only insignificant degrees which are at best capable of rousing to madness the rancours or the imagination of m de charlus and certainly if he spoke as he had just been speaking in this language which was a precious alloy of artistic and social elements it was because his oldwomanly anger and his culture as a man of the world furnished the genuine eloquence that he possessed with none but insignificant themes since the world of differences does not exist on the surface of the earth among all the countries which our perception renders uniform all the more reason why it should not exist in the social ‘world’ does it exist anywhere else vinteuil’s septet had seemed to tell me that it did but where as m de charlus also enjoyed repeating what one person had said of another seeking to stir up quarrels to divide and reign he added “you have by not inviting her deprived mme molé of the opportunity of saying ‘i can’t think why this mme verdurin should invite me i can’t imagine who these people are i don’t know them’ she was saying a year ago that you were boring her with your advances she’s a fool never invite her again after all she’s nothing so very wonderful she can come to your house without making a fuss about it seeing that i come here in short” he concluded “it seems to me that you have every reason to thank me for so far as it went everything has been perfect the duchesse de guermantes did not come but one can’t tell it was better perhaps that she didn’t we shan’t bear her any grudge and we shall remember her all the same another time not that one can help remembering her her very eyes say to us ‘forget me not’ for they are a pair of myosotes” here i thought to myself how strong the guermantes spirit — the decision to go to one house and not to another — must be to have outweighed in the duchess’s mind her fear of palamède “in the face of so complete a success one is tempted like bernardin de saintpierre to see everywhere the hand of providence the duchesse de duras was enchanted she even asked me to tell you so” added m de charlus dwelling upon the words as though mme verdurin must regard this as a sufficient honour sufficient and indeed barely credible for he found it necessary if he was to be believed to add completely carried away by the madness of those whom jupiter has decided to ruin “she has engaged morel to come to her house where the same programme will be repeated and i even think of asking her for an invitation for m verdurin” this civility to the husband alone was although no such idea even occurred to m de charlus the most wounding outrage to the wife who believing herself to possess with regard to the violinist by virtue of a sort of ukase which prevailed in the little clan the right to forbid him to perform elsewhere without her express authorisation was fully determined to forbid his appearance at mme de duras’s party

   the baron’s volubility was in itself an irritation to mme verdurin who did not like people to form independent groups within their little clan how often even at la raspelière hearing m de charlus talking incessantly to charlie instead of being content with taking his part in the so harmonious chorus of the clan she had pointed to him and exclaimed “what a rattle mme verdurin uses here the word tapette being probably unaware of its popular meaning c k s m he is what a rattle oh if it comes to rattles he’s a famous rattle” but this time it was far worse inebriated with the sound of his own voice m de charlus failed to realise that by cutting down the part assigned to mme verdurin and confining it within narrow limits he was calling forth that feeling of hatred which was in her only a special social form of jealousy mme verdurin was genuinely fond of her regular visitors the faithful of the little clan but wished them to be entirely devoted to their mistress willing to make some sacrifice like those jealous lovers who will tolerate a betrayal but only under their own roof and even before their eyes that is to say when there is no betrayal she would allow the men to have mistresses lovers on condition that the affair had no social consequence outside her own house that the tie was formed and perpetuated in the shelter of her wednesdays in the old days every furtive peal of laughter that came from odette when she conversed with swann had gnawed her heartstrings and so of late had every aside exchanged by morel and the baron she found one consolation alone for her griefs which was to destroy the happiness of other people she had not been able to endure for long that of the baron and here was this rash person precipitating the catastrophe by appearing to be restricting the mistress’s place in her little clan already she could see morel going into society without her under the baron’s aegis there was but a single remedy to make morel choose between the baron and herself and relying upon the ascendancy that she had acquired over morel by the display that she made of an extraordinary perspicacity thanks to reports which she collected to falsehoods which she invented all of which served to corroborate what he himself was led to believe and what would in time be made plain to him thanks to the pitfalls which she was preparing into which her unsuspecting victims would fall relying upon this ascendancy to make him choose herself in preference to the baron as for the society ladies who had been present and had not even asked to be introduced to her as soon as she grasped their hesitations or indifference she had said “ah i see what they are the sort of old goodfornothings that are not our style it’s the last time they shall set foot in this house” for she would have died rather than admit that anyone had been less friendly to her than she had hoped “ah my dear general” m de charlus suddenly exclaimed abandoning mme verdurin as he caught sight of general deltour secretary to the president of the republic who might be of great value in securing charlie his cross and who after asking some question of cottard was rapidly withdrawing “good evening my dear delightful friend so this is how you slip away without saying goodbye to me” said the baron with a genial selfsatisfied smile for he knew quite well that people were always glad to stay behind for a moment to talk to himself and as in his present state of excitement he would answer his own questions in a shrill tone “well did you enjoy it wasn’t it really fine the andante what it’s the most touching thing that was ever written i defy anyone to listen to the end without tears in his eyes charming of you to have come listen i had the most perfect telegram this morning from froberville who tells me that as far as the grand chancery goes the difficulties have been smoothed away as the saying is” m de charlus’s voice continued to soar at this piercing pitch as different from his normal voice as is that of a barrister making an emphatic plea from his ordinary utterance a phenomenon of vocal amplification by overexcitement and nervous tension analogous to that which at her own dinnerparties raised to so high a diapason the voice and gaze alike of mme de guermantes “i intended to send you a note tomorrow by a messenger to tell you of my enthusiasm until i could find an opportunity of speaking to you but you have been so surrounded froberville’s support is not to be despised but for my own part i have the minister’s promise” said the general “ah excellent besides you have seen for yourself that it is only what such talent deserves hoyos was delighted i didn’t manage to see the ambassadress was she pleased who would not have been except those that have ears and hear not which does not matter so long as they have tongues and can speak” taking advantage of the baron’s having withdrawn to speak to the general mme verdurin made a signal to brichot he not knowing what mme verdurin was going to say sought to amuse her and never suspecting the anguish that he was causing me said to the mistress “the baron is delighted that mlle vinteuil and her friend did not come they shock him terribly he declares that their morals are appalling you can’t imagine how prudish and severe the baron is on moral questions” contrary to brichot’s expectation mme verdurin was not amused “he is obscene” was her answer “take him out of the room to smoke a cigarette with you so that my husband can get hold of his dulcinea without his noticing it and warn him of the abyss that is yawning at his feet” brichot seemed to hesitate “i don’t mind telling you” mme verdurin went on to remove his final scruples “that i do not feel at all safe with a man like that in the house i know there are all sorts of horrible stories about him and the police have him under supervision” and as she possessed a certain talent of improvisation when inspired by malice mme verdurin did not stop at this “it seems he has been in prison yes yes i have been told by people who knew all about it i know too from a person who lives in his street that you can’t imagine the ruffians that go to his house” and as brichot who often went to the baron’s began to protest mme verdurin growing animated exclaimed “but i can assure you it is i who am telling you” an expression with which she habitually sought to give weight to an assertion flung out more or less at random “he will be found murdered in his bed one of these days as those people always are he may not go quite as far as that perhaps because he is in the clutches of that jupien whom he had the impudence to send to me and who is an exconvict i know it you yourself know it yes for certain he has a hold on him because of some letters which are perfectly appalling it seems i know it from somebody who has seen them and told me ‘you would be sick on the spot if you saw them’ that is how jupien makes him toe the line and gets all the money he wants out of him i would sooner die a thousand times over than live in a state of terror like charlus in any case if morel’s family decides to bring an action against him i have no desire to be dragged in as an accomplice if he goes on it will be at his own risk but i shall have done my duty what is one to do it’s no joke i can tell you” and agreeably warmed already by the thought of her husband’s impending conversation with the violinist mme verdurin said to me “ask brichot whether i am not a courageous friend and whether i am not capable of sacrificing myself to save my comrades” she was alluding to the circumstances in which she had just in time made him quarrel first of all with his laundress and then with mme de cambremer quarrels as a result of which brichot had become almost completely blind and people said had taken to morphia “an incomparable friend farsighted and valiant” replied the professor with an innocent emotion “mme verdurin prevented me from doing something extremely foolish” brichot told me when she had left us “she never hesitates to operate without anaesthetics she is an interventionist as our friend cottard says i admit however that the thought that the poor baron is still unconscious of the blow that is going to fall upon him distresses me deeply he is quite mad about that boy if mme verdurin should prove successful there is a man who is going to be very miserable however it is not certain that she will not fail i am afraid that she may only succeed in creating a misunderstanding between them which in the end without parting them will only make them quarrel with her” it was often thus with mme verdurin and her faithful but it was evident that in her the need to preserve their friendship was more and more dominated by the requirement that this friendship should never be challenged by that which they might feel for one another homosexuality did not disgust her so long as it did not tamper with orthodoxy but like the church she preferred any sacrifice rather than a concession of orthodoxy i was beginning to be afraid lest her irritation with myself might be due to her having heard that i had prevented albertine from going to her that afternoon and that she might presently set to work if she had not already begun upon the same task of separating her from me which her husband in the case of charlus was now going to attempt with the musician “come along get hold of charlus find some excuse there’s no time to lose” said mme verdurin “and whatever you do don’t let him come back here until i send for you oh what an evening” mme verdurin went on revealing thus the true cause of her anger “performing a masterpiece in front of those wooden images i don’t include the queen of naples she is intelligent she is a nice woman” which meant “she has been kind to me” “but the others oh it’s enough to drive anyone mad what can you expect i’m no longer a girl when i was young people told me that one must put up with boredom i made an effort but now oh no it’s too much for me i am old enough to please myself life is too short bore myself listen to idiots smile pretend to think them intelligent no i can’t do it get along brichot there’s no time to lose” “i am going madame i am going” said brichot as general deltour moved away but first of all the professor took me aside for a moment “moral duty” he said “is less clearly imperative than our ethics teach us whatever the theosophical cafés and the kantian beerhouses may say we are deplorably ignorant of the nature of good i myself who without wishing to boast have lectured to my pupils in all innocence upon the philosophy of the said immanuel kant i can see no precise ruling for the case of social casuistry with which i am now confronted in that critique of practical reason in which the great renegade of protestantism platonised in the german manner for a germany prehistorically sentimental and aulic ringing all the changes of a pomeranian mysticism it is still the symposium but held this time at kônigsberg in the local style indigestible and reeking of sauerkraut and without any goodlooking boys it is obvious on the one hand that i cannot refuse our excellent hostess the small service that she asks of me in a fully orthodox conformity with traditional morals one ought to avoid above all things for there are few that involve one in more foolish speeches letting oneself be lured by words but after all let us not hesitate to admit that if the mothers of families were entitled to vote the baron would run the risk of being lamentably blackballed for the chair of virtue it is unfortunately with the temperament of a rake that he pursues the vocation of a pedagogue observe that i am not speaking evil of the baron that good man who can carve a joint like nobody in the world combines with a genius for anathema treasures of goodness he can be most amusing as a superior sort of wag whereas with a certain one of my colleagues an academician if you please i am bored as xenophon would say at a hundred drachmae to the hour but i am afraid that he is expending upon morel rather more than a wholesome morality enjoins and without knowing to what extent the young penitent shews himself docile or rebellious to the special exercises which his catechist imposes upon him by way of mortification one need not be a learned clerk to be aware that we should be erring as the other says on the side of clemency with regard to this rosicrucian who seems to have come down to us from petronius by way of saintsimon if we granted him with our eyes shut duly signed and sealed permission to satanise and yet in keeping the man occupied while mme verdurin for the sinner’s good and indeed rightly tempted by such a cure of souls proceeds — by speaking to the young fool without any concealment — to remove from him all that he loves to deal him perhaps a fatal blow it seems to me that i am leading him into what one might call a mantrap and i recoil as though from a base action” this said he did not hesitate to commit it but taking him by the arm began “come baron let us go and smoke a cigarette this young man has not yet seen all the marvels of the house” i made the excuse that i was obliged to go home “just wait a moment” said brichot “you remember you are giving me a lift and i have not forgotten your promise” “wouldn’t you like me really to make them bring out their plate nothing could be simpler” said m de charlus “you promised me remember not a word about morel’s decoration i mean to give him the surprise of announcing it presently when people have begun to leave although he says that it is of no importance to an artist but that his uncle would like him to have it” i blushed for i thought to myself the verdurins would know through my grandfather what morel’s uncle was “then you wouldn’t like me to make them bring out the best pieces” said m de charlus “of course you know them already you have seen them a dozen times at la raspelière” i dared not tell him that what might have interested me was not the mediocrity of even the most splendid plate in a middleclass household but some specimen were it only reproduced in a fine engraving of mme du barry’s i was far too gravely preoccupied — even if i had not been by this revelation as to mlle vinteuil’s expected presence — always in society far too much distracted and agitated to fasten my attention upon objects that were more or less beautiful it could have been arrested only by the appeal of some reality that addressed itself to my imagination as might have been this evening a picture of that venice of which i had thought so much during the afternoon or some general element common to several forms and more genuine than they which of its own accord never failed to arouse in me an inward appreciation normally lulled in slumber the rising of which to the surface of my consciousness filled me with great joy well as i emerged from the room known as the concertroom and crossed the other drawingrooms with brichot and m de charlus on discovering transposed among others certain pieces of furniture which i had seen at la raspelière and to which i had paid no attention i perceived between the arrangement of the town house and that of the country house a certain common air of family life a permanent identity and i understood what brichot meant when he said to me with a smile “there look at this room it may perhaps give you an idea of what things were like in rue montalivet twentyfive years ago” from his smile a tribute to the defunct drawingroom which he saw with his mind’s eye i understood that what brichot perhaps without realising it preferred in the old room more than the large windows more than the gay youth of his hosts and their faithful was that unreal part which i myself could discern from some similarities between la raspelière and quai conti of which in a drawingroom as in everything else the external actual part liable to everyone’s control is but the prolongation was that part become purely imaginary of a colour which no longer existed save for my elderly guide which he was incapable of making me see that part which has detached itself from the outer world to take refuge in our soul to which it gives a surplus value in which it is assimilated to its normal substance transforming itself — houses that have been pulled down people long dead bowls of fruit at the suppers which we recall — into that translucent alabaster of our memories the colour of which we are incapable of displaying since we alone see it which enables us to say truthfully to other people speaking of things past that they cannot form any idea of them that they do not resemble anything that they have seen while we are unable to think of them ourselves without a certain emotion remembering that it is upon the existence of our thoughts that there depends for a little time still their survival the brilliance of the lamps that have been extinguished and the fragrance of the arbours that will never bloom again and possibly for this reason the drawingroom in rue montalivet disparaged for brichot the verdurins’ present home but on the other hand it added to this home in the professor’s eyes a beauty which it could not have in those of a stranger those pieces of the original furniture that had been transported here and sometimes arranged in the same groups and which i myself remembered from la raspelière introduced into the new drawingroom fragments of the old which at certain moments recalled it so vividly as to create a hallucination and then seemed themselves scarcely real from having evoked in the midst of the surrounding reality fragments of a vanished world which seemed to extend round about them a sofa that had risen up from dreamland between a pair of new and thoroughly substantial armchairs smaller chairs upholstered in pink silk the cloth surface of a cardtable raised to the dignity of a person since like a person it had a past a memory retaining in the chill and gloom of quai conti the tan of its roasting by the sun through the windows of rue montalivet where it could tell the time of day as accurately as mme verdurin herself and through the glass doors at la raspelière where they had taken it and where it used to gaze out all day long over the flowerbeds of the garden at the valley far below until it was time for cottard and the musician to sit down to their game a posy of violets and pansies in pastel the gift of a painter friend now dead the sole fragment that survived of a life that had vanished without leaving any trace summarising a great talent and a long friendship recalling his keen gentle eyes his shapely hand plump and melancholy while he was at work on it the incoherent charming disorder of the offerings of the faithful which have followed the lady of the house on all her travels and have come in time to assume the fixity of a trait of character of a line of destiny a profusion of cut flowers of chocolateboxes which here as in the country systematised their growth in an identical mode of blossoming the curious interpolation of those singular and superfluous objects which still appear to have been just taken from the box in which they were offered and remain for ever what they were at first new year’s day presents all those things in short which one could not have isolated from the rest but which for brichot an old frequenter of the verdurin parties had that patina that velvety bloom of things to which giving them a sort of profundity an astral body has been added all these things scattered before him sounded in his ear like so many resonant keys which awakened cherished likenesses in his heart confused reminiscences which here in this drawingroom of the present day that was littered with them cut out defined as on a fine day a shaft of sunlight cuts a section in the atmosphere the furniture and carpets and pursuing it from a cushion to a flowerstand from a footstool to a lingering scent from the lighting arrangements to the colour scheme carved evoked spiritualised called to life a form which might be called the ideal aspect immanent in each of their successive homes of the verdurin drawingroom “we must try” brichot whispered in my ear “to get the baron upon his favourite topic he is astounding” now on the one hand i was glad of an opportunity to try to obtain from m de charlus information as to the coming of mlle vinteuil and her friend on the other hand i did not wish to leave albertine too long by herself not that she could being uncertain of the moment of my return not to mention that at so late an hour she could not have received a visitor or left the house herself without arousing comment make any evil use of my absence but simply so that she might not find it too long and so i told brichot and m de charlus that i must shortly leave them “come with us all the same” said the baron whose social excitement was beginning to flag but feeling that need to prolong to spin out a conversation which i had already observed in the duchesse de guermantes as well as in himself and which while distinctive of their family extends in a more general fashion to all those people who offering their minds no other realisation than talk that is to say an imperfect realisation remain unassuaged even after hours spent in one’s company and attach themselves more and more hungrily to their exhausted companion from whom they mistakenly expect a satiety which social pleasures are incapable of giving “come won’t you” he repeated “this is the pleasant moment at a party the moment when all the guests have gone the hour of dona sol let us hope that it will end less tragically unfortunately you are in a hurry in a hurry probably to go and do things which you would much better leave undone people are always in a hurry and leave at the time when they ought to be arriving we are here like couture’s philosophers this is the moment in which to go over the events of the evening to make what is called in military language a criticism of the operations we might ask mme verdurin to send us in a little supper to which we should take care not to invite her and we might request charlie — still hernani — to play for ourselves alone the sublime adagio isn’t it fine that adagio but where is the young violinist i would like to congratulate him this is the moment for tender words and embraces admit brichot that they played like gods morel especially did you notice the moment when that lock of hair came loose ah then my dear fellow you saw nothing at all there was an f sharp at which enesco capet and thibaut might have died of jealousy i may have appeared calm enough i can tell you that at such a sound my heart was so wrung that i could barely control my tears the whole room sat breathless brichot my dear fellow” cried the baron gripping the other’s arm which he shook violently “it was sublime only young charlie preserved a stony immobility you could not even see him breathe he looked like one of those objects of the inanimate world of which théodore rousseau speaks which make us think but do not think themselves and then all of a sudden” cried m de charlus with enthusiasm making a pantomime gesture “then    the lock and all the time the charming little countrydance of the allegro vivace you know that lock was the symbol of the revelation even to the most obtuse the princess of taormina deaf until then for there are none so deaf as those that have ears and hear not the princess of taormina confronted by the message of the miraculous lock realised that it was music that they were playing and not poker oh that was indeed a solemn moment” “excuse me sir for interrupting you” i said to m de charlus hoping to bring him to the subject in which i was interested “you told me that the composer’s daughter was to be present i should have been most interested to meet her are you certain that she was expected” “oh that i can’t say” m de charlus thus complied perhaps unconsciously with that universal rule by which people withhold information from a jealous lover whether in order to shew an absurd ‘comradeship’ as a point of honour and even if they detest her with the woman who has excited his jealousy or out of malice towards her because they guess that jealousy can only intensify love or from that need to be disagreeable to other people which consists in revealing the truth to the rest of the world but concealing it from the jealous ignorance increasing their torment or so at least the tormentors suppose who in their desire to hurt other people are guided by what they themselves believe wrongly perhaps to be most painful “you know” he went on “in this house they are a trifle prone to exaggerate they are charming people still they do like to catch celebrities of one sort or another but you are not looking well and you will catch cold in this damp room” he said pushing a chair towards me “since you have not been well you must take care of yourself let me go and find you your coat no don’t go for it yourself you will lose your way and catch cold how careless people are you might be an infant in arms you want an old nurse like me to look after you” “don’t trouble baron let me go” said brichot and left us immediately not being precisely aware perhaps of the very warm affection that m de charlus felt for me and of the charming lapses into simplicity and devotion that alternated with his delirious crises of grandeur and persecution he was afraid that m de charlus whom mme verdurin had entrusted like a prisoner to his vigilance might simply be seeking under the pretext of asking for my greatcoat to return to morel and might thus upset the mistress’s plan

   meanwhile ski had sat down uninvited at the piano and assuming — with a playful knitting of his brows a remote gaze and a slight twist of his lips — what he imagined to be an artistic air was insisting that morel should play something by bizet “what you don’t like it that boyish music of bizet why my dear fellow” he said with that rolling of the letter r which was one of his peculiarities “it’s rravishing” morel who did not like bizet said so in exaggerated terms and as he had the reputation in the little clan of being though it seems incredible a wit ski pretending to take the violinist’s diatribes as paradoxes burst out laughing his laugh was not like m verdurin’s the stifled gasp of a smoker ski first of all assumed a subtle air then allowed to escape as though against his will a single note of laughter like the first clang from a belfry followed by a silence in which the subtle gaze seemed to be making a competent examination of the absurdity of what had been said then a second peal of laughter shook the air followed presently by a merry angelus

   i expressed to m de charlus my regret that m brichot should be taking so much trouble “not at all he is delighted he is very fond of you everyone is fond of you somebody was saying only the other day ‘we never see him now he is isolating himself’ besides he is such a good fellow is brichot” m de charlus went on never suspecting probably in view of the affectionate frank manner in which the professor of moral philosophy conversed with him that he had no hesitation is slandering him behind his back “he is a man of great merit immensely learned and not a bit spoiled his learning hasn’t turned him into a bookworm like so many of them who smell of ink he has retained a breadth of outlook a tolerance rare in his kind sometimes when one sees how well he understands life with what a natural grace he renders everyone his due one asks oneself where a humble little sorbonne professor an exschoolmaster can have picked up such breeding i am astonished at it myself” i was even more astonished when i saw the conversation of this brichot which the least refined of mme de guermantes’s friends would have found so dull so heavy please the most critical of them all m de charlus but to achieve this result there had collaborated among other influences themselves distinct also those by virtue of which swann on the one hand had so long found favour with the little clan when he was in love with odette and on the other hand after he married found an attraction in mme bontemps who pretending to adore the swann couple came incessantly to call upon the wife and revelled in all the stories about the husband just as a writer gives the palm for intelligence not to the most intelligent man but to the worldling who utters a bold and tolerant comment upon the passion of a man for a woman a comment which makes the writer’s bluestocking mistress agree with him in deciding that of all the people who come to her house the least stupid is after all this old beau who shews experience in the things of love so m de charlus found more intelligent than the rest of his friends brichot who was not merely kind to morel but would cull from the greek philosophers the latin poets the authors of oriental tales appropriate texts which decorated the baron’s propensity with a strange and charming anthology m de charlus had reached the age at which a victor hugo chooses to surround himself above all with vacqueries and meurices he preferred to all others those men who tolerated his outlook upon life “i see a great deal of him” he went on in a balanced singsong tone allowing no movement of his lips to stir his grave powdered mask over which were purposely lowered his prelatical eyelids “i attend his lectures that atmosphere of the latin quarter refreshes me there is a studious thoughtful adolescence of young bourgeois more intelligent better read than were in a different sphere my own contemporaries it is a different world which you know probably better than i they are youngbourgeois” he said detaching the last word to which he prefixed a string of bs and emphasising it from a sort of habit of elocution corresponding itself to a taste for fine distinctions in past history which was peculiar to him but perhaps also from inability to resist the pleasure of giving me a flick of his insolence this did not in any way diminish the great and affectionate pity that was inspired in me by m de charlus after mme verdurin had revealed her plan in my hearing it merely amused me and indeed on any other occasion when i should not have felt so kindly disposed towards him would not have offended me i derived from my grandmother such an absence of any selfimportance that i might easily be found wanting in dignity doubtless i was scarcely aware of this and by dint of having seen and heard from my schooldays onwards my most esteemed companions take offence if anyone failed to keep an appointment refuse to overlook any disloyal behaviour i had come in time to exhibit in my speech and actions a second nature which was stamped with pride i was indeed considered extremely proud because as i had never been timid i had been easily led into duels the moral prestige of which however i diminished by making little of them which easily persuaded other people that they were absurd but the true nature which we trample underfoot continues nevertheless to abide within us thus it is that at times if we read the latest masterpiece of a man of genius we are delighted to find in it all those of our own reflexions which we have always despised joys and sorrows which we have repressed a whole world of feelings scorned by us the value of which the book in which we discover them afresh at once teaches us i had come in time to learn from my experience of life that it was a mistake to smile a friendly smile when somebody made a fool of me instead of feeling annoyed but this want of selfimportance and resentment if i had so far ceased to express it as to have become almost entirely unaware that it existed in me was nevertheless the primitive vital element in which i was steeped anger and spite came to me only in a wholly different manner in furious crises what was more the sense of justice was so far lacking in me as to amount to an entire want of moral sense i was in my heart of hearts entirely won over to the side of the weaker party and of anyone who was in trouble i had no opinion as to the proportion in which good and evil might be blended in the relations between morel and m de charlus but the thought of the sufferings that were being prepared for m de charlus was intolerable to me i would have liked to warn him but did not know how to do it “the spectacle of all that laborious little world is very pleasant to an old stick like myself i do not know them” he went on raising his hand with an air of reserve — so as not to appear to be boasting of his own conquests to testify to his own purity and not to allow any suspicion to rest upon that of the students —“but they are most civil they often go so far as to keep a place for me since i am a very old gentleman yes indeed my dear boy do not protest i am past forty” said the baron who was past sixty “it is a trifle stuffy in the hall in which brichot lectures but it is always interesting” albeit the baron preferred to mingle with the youth of the schools in other words to be jostled by them sometimes to save him a long wait in the lectureroom brichot took him in by his own door brichot might well be at home in the sorbonne at the moment when the janitor loaded with chains of office stepped out before him and the master admired by his young pupils followed he could not repress a certain timidity and much as he desired to profit by that moment in which he felt himself so important to shew consideration for charlus he was nevertheless slightly embarrassed so that the janitor should allow him to pass he said to him in an artificial tone and with a preoccupied air “follow me baron they’ll find a place for you” then without paying any more attention to him to make his own entry he advanced by himself briskly along the corridor on either side a double hedge of young lecturers greeted him brichot anxious not to appear to be posing in the eyes of these young men to whom he knew that he was a great pontiff bestowed on them a thousand glances a thousand little nods of connivance to which his desire to remain martial thoroughly french gave the effect of a sort of cordial encouragement by an old soldier saying “damn it all we can face the foe” then the applause of his pupils broke out brichot sometimes extracted from this attendance by m de charlus at his lectures an opportunity for giving pleasure almost for returning hospitality he would say to some parent or to one of his middleclass friends “if it would interest your wife or daughter i may tell you that the baron de charlus prince de carency a scion of the house of condé attends my lectures it is something to remember having seen one of the last descendants of our aristocracy who preserves the type if they care to come they will know him because he will be sitting next to my chair besides he will be alone there a stout man with white hair and black moustaches wearing the military medal” “oh thank you” said the father and albeit his wife had other engagements so as not to disoblige brichot he made her attend the lecture while the daughter troubled by the heat and the crowd nevertheless devoured eagerly with her eyes the descendant of condé marvelling all the same that he was not crowned with strawberryleaves and looked just like anybody else of the present day he meanwhile had no eyes for her but more than one student who did not know who he was was amazed at his friendly glances became selfconscious and stiff and the baron left the room full of dreams and melancholy “forgive me if i return to the subject” i said quickly to m de charlus for i could hear brichot returning “but could you let me know by wire if you should hear that mlle vinteuil or her friend is expected in paris letting me know exactly how long they will be staying and without telling anybody that i asked you” i had almost ceased to believe that she had been expected but i wished to guard myself thus for the future “yes i will do that for you first of all because i owe you a great debt of gratitude by not accepting what long ago i had offered you you rendered me to your own loss an immense service you left me my liberty it is true that i have abdicated it in another fashion” he added in a melancholy tone beneath which was visible a desire to take me into his confidence “that is what i continue to regard as the important fact a whole combination of circumstances which you failed to turn to your own account possibly because fate warned you at that precise minute not to cross my path for always man proposes and god disposes who knows whether if on the day when we came away together from mme de villeparisis’s you had accepted perhaps many things that have since happened would never have occurred” in some embarrassment i turned the conversation seizing hold of the name of mme de villeparisis and sought to find out from him so admirably qualified in every respect for what reasons mme de villeparisis seemed to be held aloof by the aristocratic world not only did he not give me the solution of this little social problem he did not even appear to me to be aware of its existence i then realised that the position of mme de villeparisis if it was in later years to appear great to posterity and even in the marquise’s lifetime to the ignorant rich had appeared no less great at the opposite extremity of society that which touched mme de villeparisis that of the guermantes she was their aunt they saw first and foremost birth connexions by marriage the opportunity of impressing some sisterinlaw with the importance of their own family they regarded this less from the social than from the family point of view now this was more brilliant in the case of mme de villeparisis than i had supposed i had been impressed when i heard that the title villeparisis was falsely assumed but there are other examples of great ladies who have made degrading marriages and preserved a predominant position m de charlus began by informing me that mme de villeparisis was a niece of the famous duchesse de —— the most celebrated member of the great aristocracy during the july monarchy albeit she had refused to associate with the citizen king and his family i had so longed to hear stories about this duchess and mme de villeparisis the kind mme de villeparisis with those cheeks that to me had been the cheeks of an ordinary woman mme de villeparisis who sent me so many presents and whom i could so easily have seen every day mme de villeparisis was her niece brought up by her in her home at the hôtel de —— “she asked the duc de doudeauville” m de charlus told me “speaking of the three sisters ‘which of the sisters do you prefer’ and when doudeauville said ‘madame de villeparisis’ the duchesse de ——— replied ‘pig’ for the duchess was extremely witty” said m de charlus giving the word the importance and the special pronunciation in use among the guermantes that he should have thought the expression so ‘witty’ did not however surprise me for i had on many other occasions remarked the centrifugal objective tendency which leads men to abdicate when they are relishing the wit of others the severity with which they would criticise their own and to observe to record faithfully what they would have scorned to create “but what on earth is he doing that is my greatcoat he is bringing” he said on seeing that brichot had made so long a search to no better result “i would have done better to go for it myself however you can put it on now are you aware that it is highly compromising my dear boy it is like drinking out of the same glass i shall be able to read your thoughts no not like that come let me do it” and as he put me into his greatcoat he pressed it down on my shoulders fastened it round my throat and brushed my chin with his hand making the apology “at his age he doesn’t know how to put on a coat one has to titivate him i have missed my vocation brichot i was born to be a nurserymaid” i wanted to go home but as m de charlus had expressed his intention of going in search of morel brichot detained us both moreover the certainty that when i went home i should find albertine there a certainty as absolute as that which i had felt in the afternoon that albertine would return home from the trocadéro made me at this moment as little impatient to see her as i had been then when i was sitting at the piano after françoise had sent me her telephone message and it was this calm that enabled me whenever in the course of this conversation i attempted to rise to obey brichot’s injunctions who was afraid that my departure might prevent charlus from remaining with him until the moment when mme verdurin was to come and fetch us “come” he said to the baron “stay a little here with us you shall give him the accolade presently” brichot added fastening upon myself his almost sightless eyes to which the many operations that he had undergone had restored some degree of life but which had not all the same the mobility necessary to the sidelong expression of malice “the accolade how absurd” cried the baron in a shrill and rapturous tone “my boy i tell you he imagines he is at a prizegiving he is dreaming of his young pupils i ask myself whether he don’t sleep with them” “you wish to meet mlle vinteuil” said brichot who had overheard the last words of our conversation “i promise to let you know if she comes i shall hear of it from mme verdurin” for he doubtless foresaw that the baron was in peril of an immediate exclusion from the little clan “i see so you think that i have less claim than yourself upon mme verdurin” said m de charlus “to be informed of the coming of these terribly disreputable persons you know that they are quite notorious mme verdurin is wrong to allow them to come here they are all very well for the fast set they are friends with a terrible band of women they meet in the most appalling places” at each of these words my suffering was increased by the addition of a fresh suffering changing in form “certainly not i don’t suppose that i have any better claim than yourself upon mme verdurin” brichot protested punctuating his words for he was afraid that he might have aroused the baron’s suspicions and as he saw that i was determined to go seeking to detain me with the bait of the promised entertainment “there is one thing which the baron seems to me not to have taken into account when he speaks of the reputation of these two ladies namely that a person’s reputation may be at the same time appalling and undeserved thus for instance in the more notorious group which i shall call parallel it is certain that the errors of justice are many and that history has registered convictions for sodomy against illustrious men who were wholly innocent of the charge the recent discovery of michelangelo’s passionate love for a woman is a fresh fact which should entitle the friend of leo x to the benefit of a posthumous retrial the michelangelo case seems to me clearly indicated to excite the snobs and mobilise the villette when another case in which anarchism reared its head and became the fashionable sin of our worthy dilettantes but which must not even be mentioned now for fear of stirring up quarrels shall have run its course” from the moment when brichot began to speak of masculine reputations m de charlus betrayed on every one of his features that special sort of impatience which one sees on the face of a medical or military expert when society people who know nothing about the subject begin to talk nonsense about points of therapeutics or strategy “you know absolutely nothing about the matter” he said at length to brichot “quote me a single reputation that is undeserved mention names oh yes i know the whole story” was his brutal retort to a timid interruption by brichot “the people who tried it once long ago out of curiosity or out of affection for a dead friend and the man who afraid he has gone too far if you speak to him of the beauty of a man replies that that is chinese to him that he can no more distinguish between a beautiful man and an ugly one than between the engines of two motorcars mechanics not being in his line that’s all stuff and nonsense mind you i don’t mean to say that a bad or what is conventionally so called and yet undeserved reputation is absolutely impossible it is so exceptional so rare that for practical purposes it does not exist at the same time i who have a certain curiosity in ferreting things out have known cases which were not mythical yes in the course of my life i have established scientifically speaking of course you mustn’t take me too literally two unjustified reputations they generally arise from a similarity of names or from certain outward signs a profusion of rings for instance which persons who are not qualified to judge imagine to be characteristic of what you were mentioning just as they think that a peasant never utters a sentence without adding ‘jarnignié’ or an englishman ‘goddam’ dialogue for the boulevard theatres what will surprise you is that the unjustified are those most firmly established in the eyes of the public you yourself brichot who would thrust your hand in the flames to answer for the virtue of some man or other who comes to this house and whom the enlightened know to be a wolf in sheep’s clothing you feel obliged to believe like every tom dick and harry in what is said about some man in the public eye who is the incarnation of those propensities to the common herd when as a matter of fact he doesn’t care twopence for that sort of thing i say twopence because if we were to offer fiveandtwenty louis we should see the number of plaster saints dwindle down to nothing as things are the average rate of sanctity if you see any sanctity in that sort of thing is somewhere between thirty and forty per cent” if brichot had transferred to the male sex the question of evil reputations with me it was inversely to the female sex that thinking of albertine i applied the baron’s words i was appalled at his statistics even when i bore in mind that he was probably enlarging his figures to reach the total that he would like to believe true and had based them moreover upon the reports of persons who were scandalmongers and possibly liars and had in any case been led astray by their own desire which coming in addition to that of m de charlus doubtless falsified the baron’s calculations “thirty per cent” exclaimed brichot “why even if the proportions were reversed i should still have to multiply the guilty a hundredfold if it is as you say baron and you are not mistaken then we must confess that you are one of those rare visionaries who discern a truth which nobody round them has ever suspected just as barrés made discoveries as to parliamentary corruption the truth of which was afterwards established like the existence of leverrier’s planet mme verdurin would prefer to cite men whom i would rather not name who detected in the intelligence bureau in the general staff activities inspired i am sure by patriotic zeal which i had never imagined upon freemasonry german espionage morphinomania léon daudet builds up day by day a fantastic fairytale which turns out to be the barest truth thirty per cent” brichot repeated in stupefaction it is only fair to say that m de charlus taxed the great majority of his contemporaries with inversion always excepting those men with whom he himself had had relations their case provided that they had introduced the least trace of romance into those relations appearing to him more complex so it is that we see men of the world who refuse to believe in women’s honour allow some remnants of honour only to the woman who has been their mistress as to whom they protest sincerely and with an air of mystery “no you are mistaken she is not that sort of girl” this unlookedfor tribute is dictated partly by their own selfrespect which is flattered by the supposition that such favours have been reserved for them alone partly by their simplicity which has easily swallowed everything that their mistress has given them to believe partly from that sense of the complexity of life which brings it about that as soon as we approach other people other lives readymade labels and classifications appear unduly crude “thirty per cent but have a care less fortunate than the historians whose conclusions the future will justify baron if you were to present to posterity the statistics that you offer us it might find them erroneous posterity judges only from documentary evidence and will insist on being assured of your facts but as no document would be forthcoming to authenticate this sort of collective phenomena which the few persons who are enlightened are only too ready to leave in obscurity the best minds would be moved to indignation and you would be regarded as nothing more than a slanderer or a lunatic after having in the social examination obtained top marks and the primacy upon this earth you would taste the sorrows of a blackball beyond the grave that is not worth powder and shot to quote — may god forgive me — our friend bossuet” “i am not interested in history” replied m de charlus “this life is sufficient for me it is quite interesting enough as poor swann used to say” “what you knew swann baron i was not aware of that tell me was he that way inclined” brichot inquired with an air of misgiving“what a mind the man has so you suppose that i only know men like that no i don’t think so” said charlus looking to the ground and trying to weigh the pros and cons and deciding that since he was dealing with swann whose hostility to that sort of thing had always been notorious a halfadmission could only be harmless to him who was its object and flattering to him who allowed it to escape in an insinuation “i don’t deny that long ago in our schooldays once by accident” said the baron as though unwillingly and as though he were thinking aloud then recovering himself “but that was centuries ago how do you expect me to remember you are making a fool of me” he concluded with a laugh “in any case he was never what you’d call a beauty” said brichot who himself hideous thought himself goodlooking and was always ready to believe that other men were ugly “hold your tongue” said the baron “you don’t know what you’re talking about in those days he had a peachlike complexion and” he added finding a fresh note for each syllable “he was as beautiful as cupid himself besides he was always charming the women were madly in love with him” “but did you ever know his wife” “why it was through me that he came to know her i thought her charming in her disguise one evening when she played miss sacripant i was with some fellows from the club each of us took a woman home with him and although all that i wanted was to go to sleep slanderous tongues alleged for it is terrible how malicious people are that i went to bed with odette only she took advantage of the slanders to come and worry me and i thought i might get rid of her by introducing her to swann from that moment she never let me go she couldn’t spell the simplest word it was i who wrote all her letters for her and it was i who afterwards had to take her out that my boy is what comes of having a good reputation you see though i only half deserved it she forced me to help her to betray him with five with six other men” and the lovers whom odette had had in succession she had been with this man then with that those men not one of whose names had ever been guessed by poor swann blinded in turn by jealousy and by love reckoning the chances and believing in oaths more affirmative than a contradiction which escapes from the culprit a contradiction far more unseizable and at the same time far more significant of which the jealous lover might take advantage more logically than of the information which he falsely pretends to have received in the hope of confusing his mistress these lovers m de charlus began to enumerate with as absolute a certainty as if he had been repeating the list of the kings of france and indeed the jealous lover is like the contemporaries of an historical event too close he knows nothing and it is in the eyes of strangers that the comic aspect of adultery assumes the precision of history and prolongs itself in lists of names which are for that matter unimportant and become painful only to another jealous lover such as myself who cannot help comparing his own case with that which he hears mentioned and asks himself whether the woman of whom he is suspicious cannot boast an equally illustrious list but he can never know anything more it is a sort of universal conspiracy a ‘blindman’s buff’ in which everyone cruelly participates and which consists while his mistress flits from one to another in holding over his eyes a bandage which he is perpetually attempting to tear off without success for everyone keeps him blindfold poor wretch the kind out of kindness the wicked out of malice the coarseminded out of their love of coarse jokes the wellbred out of politeness and goodbreeding and all alike respecting one of those conventions which are called principles “but did swann never know that you had enjoyed her favours” “what an idea if you had suggested such a thing to charles it’s enough to make one’s hair stand up on end why my dear fellow he would have killed me on the spot he was as jealous as a tiger any more than i ever confessed to odette not that she would have minded in the least that    but you must not make my tongue run away with me and the joke of it is that it was she who fired a revolver at him and nearly hit me oh i used to have a fine time with that couple and naturally it was i who was obliged to act as his second against d’osmond who never forgave me d’osmond had carried off odette and swann to console himself had taken as his mistress or makebelieve mistress odette’s sister but really you must not begin to make me tell you swann’s story we should be here for ten years don’t you know nobody knows more about him than i do it was i who used to take odette out when she did not wish to see charles it was all the more awkward for me as i have a quite near relative who bears the name crécy without of course having any manner of right to it but still he was none too well pleased for she went by the name of odette de crécy as she very well might being merely separated from a crécy whose wife she still was and quite an authentic person a highly respectable gentleman out of whom she had drained his last farthing but why should i have to tell you about this crécy i have seen you with him on the crawler you used to have him to dinner at balbec he must have needed those dinners poor fellow he lived upon a tiny allowance that swann made him i am greatly afraid that since my friend’s death that income must have stopped altogether what i do not understand” m de charlus said to me “is that since you used often to go to charles’s you did not ask me this evening to present you to the queen of naples in fact i can see that you are less interested in people than in curiosities and that continues to surprise me in a person who knew swann in whom that sort of interest was so far developed that it is impossible to say whether it was i who initiated him in these matters or he myself it surprises me as much as if i met a person who had known whistler and remained ignorant of what is meant by taste by jove it is morel that ought really to have been presented to her he was passionately keen on it too for he is the most intelligent fellow you could imagine it is a nuisance that she has left however i shall effect the conjunction one of these days it is indispensable that he should know her the only possible obstacle would be if she were to die in the night well we may hope that it will not happen” all of a sudden brichot who was still suffering from the shock of the proportion ‘thirty per cent’ which m de charlus had revealed to him brichot who had continued all this time in the pursuit of his idea with an abruptness which suggested that of an examining magistrate seeking to make a prisoner confess but which was in reality the result of the professor’s desire to appear perspicacious and of the misgivings that he felt about launching so grave an accusation spoke “isn’t ski like that” he inquired of m de charlus with a sombre air to make us admire his alleged power of intuition he had chosen ski telling himself that since there were only three innocent men in every ten he ran little risk of being mistaken if he named ski who seemed to him a trifle odd suffered from insomnia scented himself in short was not entirely normal “nothing of the sort” exclaimed the baron with a bitter dogmatic exasperated irony “what you say is utterly false absurd fantastic ski is like that precisely to the people who know nothing about it if he was he would not look so like it be it said without any intention to criticise for he has a certain charm indeed i find something very attractive about him” “but give us a few names then” brichot pursued with insistence m de charlus drew himself up with a forbidding air “ah my dear sir i as you know live in a world of abstraction all that sort of thing interests me only from a transcendental point of view” he replied with the touchy susceptibility peculiar to men of his kind and the affectation of grandiloquence that characterised his conversation “to me you understand it is only general principles that are of any interest i speak to you of this as i might of the law of gravitation” but these moments of irritable reaction in which the baron sought to conceal his true life lasted but a short time compared with the hours of continual progression in which he allowed it to be guessed displayed it with an irritating complacency the need to confide being stronger in him than the fear of divulging his secret “what i was trying to say” he went on “is that for one evil reputation that is unjustified there are hundreds of good ones which are no less so obviously the number of those who do not merit their reputations varies according to whether you rely upon what is said by men of their sort or by the others and it is true that if the malevolence of the latter is limited by the extreme difficulty which they would find in believing that a vice as horrible to them as robbery or murder is being practised by men whom they know to be sensitive and sincere the malevolence of the former is stimulated to excess by the desire to regard as — what shall i say — accessible men who appeal to them upon the strength of information given them by people who have been led astray by a similar desire in fact by the very aloofness with which they are generally regarded i have heard a man viewed with considerable disfavour on account of these tastes say that he supposed that a certain man in society shared them and his sole reason for believing it was that this other man had been polite to him so many reasons for optimism” said the baron artlessly “in the computation of the number but the true reason of the enormous difference that exists between the number calculated by the profane and that calculated by the initiated arises from the mystery with which the latter surround their actions in order to conceal them from the rest who lacking any source of information would be literally stupefied if they were to learn merely a quarter of the truth” “then in our days things are as they were among the greeks” said brichot “what do you mean among the greeks do you suppose that it has not been going on ever since take the reign of louis xiv you have young vermandois molière prince louis of baden brunswick charolais boufflers the great condé the duc de brissac” “stop a moment i knew about monsieur i knew about brissac from saintsimon vendôme of course and many others as well but that old pest saintsimon often refers to the great condé and prince louis of baden and never mentions it” “it seems a pity i must say that it should fall to me to teach a professor of the sorbonne his history but my dear master you are as ignorant as a carp” “you are harsh baron but just and wait a moment now this will please you i remember now a song of the period composed in macaronic verse about a certain storm which surprised the great condé as he was going down the rhône in the company of his friend the marquis de la moussaye condé says

                            carus amicus mussaeus
                            ah quod tempus bonus deus
                            landerirette
                            imbre sumus perituri

and la moussaye reassures him with

                            securae sunt nostrae vitae
                            sumus enim sodomitae
                            igne tantum perituri
                            landeriri”

“i take back what i said” said charlus in a shrill and mannered tone “you are a well of learning you will write it down for me won’t you i must preserve it in my family archives since my greatgreatgreatgrandmother was a sister of m le prince” “yes but baron with regard to prince louis of baden i can think of nothing however at that period i suppose that generally speaking the art of war    ” “what nonsense vendôme villars prince eugène the prince de conti and if i were to tell you of all the heroes of tonkin morocco and i am thinking of men who are truly sublime and pious and ‘new generation’ i should astonish you greatly ah i should have something to teach the people who are making inquiries about the new generation which has rejected the futile complications of its elders m bourget tells us i have a young friend out there who is highly spoken of who has done great things however i am not going to tell tales out of school let us return to the seventeenth century you know that saintsimon says of the maréchal d’huxelles — one among many ‘voluptuous in grecian debaucheries which he made no attempt to conceal he used to get hold of young officers whom he trained to his purpose not to mention stalwart young valets and this openly in the army and at strasbourg’ you have probably read madame’s letters all his men called him ‘putain’ she is quite outspoken about it” “and she was in a good position to know with her husband” “such an interesting character madame” said m de charlus “one might base upon her the lyrical synthesis of ‘wives of aunties’ first of all the masculine type generally the wife of an auntie is a man that is what makes it so easy for her to bear him children then madame does not mention monsieur’s vices but she does mention incessantly the same vice in other men writing as a wellinformed woman from that tendency which makes us enjoy finding in other people’s families the same defects as afflict us in our own in order to prove to ourselves that there is nothing exceptional or degrading in them i was saying that things have been much the same in every age nevertheless our own is quite remarkable in that respect and notwithstanding the instances that i have borrowed from the seventeenth century if my great ancestor françois c de la rochefoucauld were alive in these days he might say of them with even more justification than of his own — come brichot help me out ‘vices are common to every age but if certain persons whom everyone knows had appeared in the first centuries of our era would anyone speak today of the prostitutions of heliogabalus’ ‘whom everyone knows’ appeals to me immensely i see that my sagacious kinsman understood the tricks of his most illustrious contemporaries as i understand those of my own but men of that sort are not only far more frequent today they have also special characteristics” i could see that m de charlus was about to tell us in what fashion these habits had evolved the insistence with which m de charlus kept on reverting to this topic — into which moreover his intellect constantly trained in the same direction had acquired a certain penetration — was in a complicated way distinctly trying he was as boring as a specialist who can see nothing outside his own subject as irritating as a wellinformed man whose vanity is flattered by the secrets which he possesses and is burning to divulge as repellent as those people who whenever their own defects are mentioned spread themselves without noticing that they are giving offence as obsessed as a maniac and as uncontrollably imprudent as a criminal these characteristics which at certain moments became as obvious as those that stamp a madman or a criminal brought me as it happened a certain consolation for making them undergo the necessary transposition in order to be able to draw from them deductions with regard to albertine and remembering her attitude towards saintloup and towards myself i said to myself painful as one of these memories and melancholy as the other was to me i said to myself that they seemed to exclude the kind of deformity so plainly denounced the kind of specialisation inevitably exclusive it appeared which was so vehemently apparent in the conversation as in the person of m de charlus but he as ill luck would have it made haste to destroy these grounds for hope in the same way as he had furnished me with them that is to say unconsciously “yes” he said “i am no longer in my teens and i have already seen many things change round about me i no longer recognise either society in which the barriers are broken down in which a mob devoid of elegance and decency dance the tango even in my own family or fashions or politics or the arts or religion or anything but i must admit that the thing which has changed most of all is what the germans call homosexuality good god in my day apart from the men who loathed women and those who caring only for women did the other thing merely with an eye to profit the homosexuals were sound family men and never kept mistresses except to screen themselves if i had had a daughter to give away it is among them that i should have looked for my soninlaw if i had wished to be certain that she would not be unhappy alas things have changed entirely nowadays they are recruited also from the men who are the most insatiable with women i thought i possessed a certain instinct and that when i said to myself ‘certainly not’ i could not have been mistaken well i give it up one of my friends who is wellknown for that sort of thing bad a coachman whom my sisterinlaw oriane found for him a lad from combray who was something of a jack of all trades but particularly in trading with women and who i would have sworn was as hostile as possible to anything of that sort he broke his mistress’s heart by betraying her with two women whom he adored not to mention the others an actress and a girl from a bar my cousin the prince de guermantes who has that irritating intelligence of people who are too ready to believe anything said to me one day ‘but why in the world does not x——have his coachman it might be a pleasure to théodore’ which is the coachman’s name ‘and he may be annoyed at finding that his master does not make advances to him’ i could not help telling gilbert to hold his tongue i was overwrought both by that boasted perspicacity which when it is exercised indiscriminately is a want of perspicacity and also by the sîlverlined malice of my cousin who would have liked x——to risk taking the first steps so that if the going was good he might follow” “then the prince de guermantes is like that too” asked brichot with a blend of astonishment and dismay “good god” replied m de charlus highly delighted “it is so notorious that i don’t think i am guilty of an indiscretion if i tell you that he is very well the year after this i went to balbec where i heard from a sailor who used to take me out fishing occasionally that my théodore whose sister i may mention is the maid of a friend of mme verdurin baroness putbus used to come down to the harbour to pick up now one sailor now another with the most infernal cheek to go for a trip on the sea ‘with extras’” it was now my turn to inquire whether his employer whom i had identified as the gentleman who at balbec used to play cards all day long with his mistress and who was the leader of the little group of four boon companions was like the prince of guermantes “why of course everyone knows about him he makes no attempt to conceal it” “but he had his mistress there with him” “well and what difference does that make how innocent these children are” he said to me in a fatherly tone little suspecting the grief that i extracted from his words when i thought of albertine “she is charming his mistress” “but then his three friends are like himself” “not at all” he cried stopping his ears as though in playing some instrument i had struck a wrong note “now he has gone to the other extreme so a man has no longer the right to have friends ah youth youth it gets everything wrong we shall have to begin your education over again my boy well” he went on “i admit that this case and i know of many others however open a mind i may try to keep for every form of audacity does embarrass me i may be very oldfashioned but i fail to understand” he said in the tone of an old gallican speaking of some development of ultramontanism of a liberal royalist speaking of the action française or of a disciple of claude monet speaking of the cubists “i do not reproach these innovators i envy them if anything i try to understand them but i do not succeed if they are so passionately fond of woman why and especially in this workaday world where that sort of thing is so frowned upon where they conceal themselves from a sense of shame have they any need of what they call ‘a bit of brown’ it is because it represents to them something else what” “what else can a woman represent to albertine” i thought and there indeed lay the cause of my anguish “decidedly baron” said brichot “should the board of studies ever think of founding a chair of homosexuality i shall see that your name is the first to be submitted or rather no an institute of psychophysiology would suit you better and i can see you best of all provided with a chair in the collège de france which would enable you to devote yourself to personal researches the results of which you would deliver like the professor of tamil or sanskrit to the handful of people who are interested in them you would have an audience of two with your assistant not that i mean to cast the slightest suspicion upon our corps of janitors whom i believe to be above suspicion” “you know nothing about them” the baron retorted in a harsh and cutting tone “besides you are wrong in thinking that so few people are interested in the subject it is just the opposite” and without stopping to consider the incompatibility between the invariable trend of his own conversation and the reproach which he was about to heap upon other people “it is on the contrary most alarming” said the baron with a scandalised and contrite air “people are talking about nothing else it is a scandal but i am not exaggerating my dear fellow it appears that the day before yesterday at the duchesse d’agen’s they talked about nothing else for two hours on end you can imagine if women have taken to discussing that sort of thing it is a positive scandal what is vilest of all is that they get their information” he went on with an extraordinary fire and emphasis “from pests regular harlots like young châtellerault who has the worst reputation in the world who tell them stories about other men i have been told that he said more than enough to hang me but i don’t care i am convinced that the mud and filth flung by an individual who barely escaped being turned out of the jockey for cheating at cards can only fall back upon himself i am sure that if i were jane d’agen i should have sufficient respect for my drawingroom not to allow such subjects to be discussed in it nor to allow my own flesh and blood to be dragged through the mire in my house but there is no longer any society any rules any conventions in conversation any more than in dress ah my dear fellow it is the end of the world everyone has become so malicious the prize goes to the man who can speak most evil of his fellows it is appalling”

   as cowardly still as i had been long ago in my boyhood at combray when i used to run away in order not to see my grandfather tempted with brandy and the vain efforts of my grandmother imploring him not to drink it i had but one thought in my mind which was to leave the verdurins’ house before the execution of m de charlus occurred “i simply must go” i said to brichot “i am coming with you” he replied “but we cannot slip away english fashion come and say goodbye to mme verdurin” the professor concluded as he made his way to the drawingroom with the air of a man who in a guessing game goes to find out whether he may ‘come back’

   while we conversed m verdurin at a signal from his wife had taken morel aside indeed had mme verdurin decided after considering the matter in all its aspects that it was wiser to postpone morel’s enlightenment she was powerless now to prevent it there are certain desires some of them confined to the mouth which as soon as we have allowed them to grow insist upon being gratified whatever the consequences may be we are unable to resist the temptation to kiss a bare shoulder at which we have been gazing for too long and at which our lips strike like a serpent at a bird to bury our sweet tooth in a cake that has fascinated and famished it nor can we forego the delight of the amazement anxiety grief or mirth to which we can move another person by some unexpected communication so in a frenzy of melodrama mme verdurin had ordered her husband to take morel out of the room and at all costs to explain matters to him the violinist had begun by deploring the departure of the queen of naples before he had had a chance of being presented to her m de charlus had told him so often that she was the sister of the empress elisabeth and of the duchesse d’alençon that her majesty had assumed an extraordinary importance in his eyes but the master explained to him that it was not to talk about the queen of naples that they had withdrawn from the rest and then went straight to the root of the matter “listen” he had concluded after a long explanation “listen if you like we can go and ask my wife what she thinks i give you my word of honour i’ve said nothing to her about it we shall see how she looks at it my advice is perhaps not the best but you know how sound her judgment is besides she is extremely attached to yourself let us go and submit the case to her” and while mme verdurin awaiting with impatience the emotions that she would presently be relishing as she talked to the musician and again after he had gone when she made her husband give her a full report of their conversation continued to repeat “but what in the world can they be doing i do hope that my husband in keeping him all this time has managed to give him his cue” m verdurin reappeared with morel who seemed greatly moved “he would like to ask your advice” m verdurin said to his wife in the tone of a man who does not know whether his prayer will be heard instead of replying to m verdurin it was to morel that in the heat of her passion mme verdurin addressed herself “i agree entirely with my husband i consider that you cannot tolerate this sort of thing for another instant” she exclaimed with violence discarding as a useless fiction her agreement with her husband that she was supposed to know nothing of what he had been saying to the violinist “how do you mean tolerate what” stammered m verdurin endeavouring to feign astonishment and seeking with an awkwardness that was explained by his dismay to defend his falsehood “i guessed what you were saying to him” replied mme verdurin undisturbed by the improbability of this explanation and caring little what when he recalled this scene the violinist might think of the mistress’s veracity “no” mme verdurin continued “i feel that you ought not to endure any longer this degrading promiscuity with a tainted person whom nobody will have in her house” she went on regardless of the fact that this was untrue and forgetting that she herself entertained him almost daily “you are the talk of the conservatoire” she added feeling that this was the argument that carried most weight “another month of this life and your artistic future is shattered whereas without charlus you ought to be making at least a hundred thousand francs a year” “but i have never heard anyone utter a word i am astounded i am very grateful to you” morel murmured the tears starting to his eyes but being obliged at once to feign astonishment and to conceal his shame he had turned redder and was perspiring more abundantly than if he had played all beethoven’s sonatas in succession and tears welled from his eyes which the bonn master would certainly not have drawn from him “if you have never heard anything you are unique in that respect he is a gentleman with a vile reputation and the most shocking stories are told about him i know that the police are watching him and that is perhaps the best thing for him if he is not to end like all those men murdered by hooligans” she went on for as she thought of charlus the memory of mme de duras recurred to her and in her frenzy of rage she sought to aggravate still further the wounds that she was inflicting on the unfortunate charlie and to avenge herself for those that she had received in the course of the evening “anyhow even financially he can be of no use to you he is completely ruined since he has become the prey of people who are blackmailing him and who can’t even make him fork out the price of the tune they call still less can he pay you for your playing for it is all heavily mortgaged town house country house everything” morel was all the more ready to believe this lie since m de charlus liked to confide in him his relations with hooligans a race for which the son of a valet however debauched he may be professes a feeling of horror as strong as his attachment to bonapartist principles

   already in the cunning mind of morel a plan was beginning to take shape similar to what was called in the eighteenth century the reversal of alliances determined never to speak to m de charlus again he would return on the following evening to jupien’s niece and see that everything was made straight with her unfortunately for him this plan was doomed to failure m de charlus having made an appointment for that very evening with jupien which the extailor dared not fail to keep in spite of recent events other events as we shall see having followed upon morel’s action when jupien in tears told his tale of woe to the baron the latter no less wretched assured him that he would adopt the forsaken girl that she should assume one of the titles that were at his disposal probably that of mlle d’oloron that he would see that she received a thorough education and furnish her with a rich husband promises which filled jupien with joy and left his niece unmoved for she was still in love with morel who from stupidity or cynicism used to come into the shop and tease her in jupien’s absence “what is the matter with you” he would say with a laugh “with those black marks under your eyes a broken heart gad the years pass and people change after all a man is free to try on a shoe all the more a woman and if she doesn’t fit him    ” he lost his temper once only because she cried which he considered cowardly unworthy of her people are not always very tolerant of the tears which they themselves have provoked

   but we have looked too far ahead for all this did not happen until after the verdurins’ party which we have interrupted and we must go back to the point at which we left off “i should never have suspected it” morel groaned in answer to mme verdurin “naturally people do not say it to your face that does not prevent your being the talk of the conservatoire” mme verdurin went on wickedly seeking to make it plain to morel that it was not only m de charlus that was being criticised but himself also “i can well believe that you know nothing about it all the same people are quite outspoken ask ski what they were saying the other day at chevillard’s within a foot of us when you came into my box i mean to say people point you out as far as i’m concerned i don’t pay the slightest attention but what i do feel is that it makes a man supremely ridiculous and that he becomes a public laughingstock for the rest of his life” “i don’t know how to thank you” said charlie in the tone we use to a dentist who has just caused us terrible pain while we tried not to let him see it or to a too bloodthirsty second who has forced us into a duel on account of some casual remark of which he has said “you can’t swallow that” “i believe that you have plenty of character that you are a man” replied mme verdurin “and that you will be capable of speaking out boldly although he tells everybody that you would never dare that he holds you fast” charlie seeking a borrowed dignity in which to cloak the tatters of his own found in his memory something that he had read or more probably heard quoted and at once proclaimed “i was not brought up to eat that sort of bread this very evening i will break with m de charlus the queen of naples has gone hasn’t she otherwise before breaking with him i should like to ask him    ” “it is not necessary to break with him altogether” said mme verdurin anxious to avoid a disruption of the little nucleus “there is no harm in your seeing him here among our little group where you are appreciated where no one speaks any evil of you but insist upon your freedom and do not let him drag you about among all those sheep who are friendly to your face i wish you could have heard what they were saying behind your back anyhow you need feel no regret not only are you wiping off a stain which would have marked you for the rest of your life from the artistic point of view even if there had not been this scandalous presentation by charlus i don’t mind telling you that wasting yourself like this in this sham society will make people suppose that you aren’t serious give you an amateur reputation as a little drawingroom performer which is a terrible thing at your age i can understand that to all those fine ladies it is highly convenient to be able to return their friends’ hospitality by making you come and play for nothing but it is your future as an artist that would foot the bill i don’t say that you shouldn’t go to one or two of them you were speaking of the queen of naples — who has left for she had to go on to another party — now she is a splendid woman and i don’t mind saying that i think she has a poor opinion of charlus and came here chiefly to please me yes yes i know she was longing to meet us m verdurin and myself that is a house in which you might play and then i may tell you that if i take you — because the artists all know me you understand they have always been most obliging to me and regard me almost as one of themselves as their mistress — that is a very different matter but whatever you do you must never go near mme de duras don’t go and make a stupid blunder like that i know several artists who have come here and told me all about her they know they can trust me” she said in the sweet and simple tone which she knew how to adopt in an instant imparting an appropriate air of modesty to her features an appropriate charm to her eyes “they come here just like that to tell me all their little troubles the ones who are said to be most silent go on chatting to me sometimes for hours on end and i can’t tell you how interesting they are poor chabrier used always to say ‘there’s nobody like mme verdurin for getting them to talk’ very well don’t you know all of them without one exception i have seen them in tears because they had gone to play for mme de duras it is not only the way she enjoys making her servants humiliate them they could never get an engagement anywhere else again the agents would say ‘oh yes the fellow who plays at mme de duras’s’ that settled it there is nothing like that for ruining a man’s future you know what society people are like it’s not taken seriously you may have all the talent in the world it’s a dreadful thing to have to say but one mme de duras is enough to give you the reputation of an amateur and among artists don’t you know well i you can ask yourself whether i know them when i have been moving among them for forty years launching them taking an interest in them very well when they say that somebody is an amateur that finishes it and people were beginning to say it of you indeed at times i have been obliged to take up the cudgels to assure them that you would not play in some absurd drawingroom do you know what the answer was ‘but he will be forced to go charlus won’t even consult him he never asks him for his opinion’ somebody thought he would pay him a compliment and said ‘we greatly admire your friend morel’ can you guess what answer he made with that insolent air which you know ‘but what do you mean by calling him my friend we are not of the same class say rather that he is my creature my protégé’” at this moment there stirred beneath the convex brows of the musical deity the one thing that certain people cannot keep to themselves a saying which it is not merely abject but imprudent to repeat but the need to repeat it is stronger than honour than prudence it was to this need that after a few convulsive movements of her spherical and sorrowful brows the mistress succumbed “some one actually told my husband that he had said ‘my servant’ but for that i cannot vouch” she added it was a similar need that had compelled m de charlus shortly after he had sworn to morel that nobody should ever know the story of his birth to say to mme verdurin “his father was a flunkey” a similar need again now that the story had been started would make it circulate from one person to another each of whom would confide it under the seal of a secrecy which would be promised and not kept by the hearer as by the informant himself these stories would end as in the game called huntthethimble by being traced back to mme verdurin bringing down upon her the wrath of the person concerned who would at last have learned the truth she knew this but could not repress the words that were burning her tongue anyhow the word ‘servant’ was bound to annoy morel she said ‘servant’ nevertheless and if she added that she could not vouch for the word this was so as at once to appear certain of the rest thanks to this hint of uncertainty and to shew her impartiality this impartiality that she shewed she herself found so touching that she began to speak affectionately to charlie “for don’t you see” she went on “i am not blaming him he is dragging you down into his abyss it is true but it is not his fault since he wallows in it himself since he wallows in it” she repeated in a louder tone having been struck by the aptness of the image which had taken shape so quickly that her attention only now overtook it and was trying to give it prominence “no the fault that i do find with him” she said in a melting tone — like a woman drunken with her own success —“is a want of delicacy towards yourself there are certain things which one does not say in public well this evening he was betting that he would make you blush with joy by telling you stuff and nonsense of course for his recommendation would be enough to prevent your getting it that you were to have the cross of the legion of honour even that i could overlook although i have never quite liked” she went on with a delicate dignified air “hearing a person make a fool of his friends but don’t you know there are certain little things that one does resent such as when he told us with screams of laughter that if you want the cross it’s to please your uncle and that your uncle was a footman” “he told you that” cried charlie believing on the strength of this adroitly interpolated quotation in the truth of everything that mme verdurin had said mme verdurin was overwhelmed with the joy of an old mistress who just as her young lover was on the point of deserting her has succeeded in breaking off his marriage and it is possible that she had not calculated her lie that she was not even consciously lying a sort of sentimental logic something perhaps more elementary still a sort of nervous reflex urging her in order to brighten her life and preserve her happiness to stir up trouble in the little clan may have brought impulsively to her lips without giving her time to check their veracity these assertions diabolically effective if not rigorously exact “if he had only repeated it to us it wouldn’t matter” the mistress went on “we know better than to listen to what he says besides what does a man’s origin matter you have your own value you are what you make yourself but that he should use it to make mme de portefin laugh” mme verdurin named this lady on purpose because she knew that charlie admired her “that is what vexes us my husband said to me when he heard him ‘i would sooner he had struck me in the face’ for he is as fond of you as i am don’t you know is gustave” from this we learn that m verdurin’s name was gustave “he is really very sensitive” “but i never told you i was fond of him” muttered m verdurin acting the kindhearted curmudgeon “it is charlus that is fond of him” “oh no now i realise the difference i was betrayed by a scoundrel and you you are good” charlie exclaimed in all sincerity “no no” murmured mme verdurin seeking to retain her victory for she felt that her wednesdays were safe but not to abuse it “scoundrel is too strong he does harm a great deal of harm unconsciously you know that tale about the legion of honour was the affair of a moment and it would be painful to me to repeat all that he said about your family” said mme verdurin who would have been greatly embarrassed had she been asked to do so “oh even if it only took a moment it proves that he is a traitor” cried morel it was at this moment that we returned to the drawingroom “ah” exclaimed m de charlus when he saw that morel was in the room advancing upon him with the alacrity of the man who has skillfully organised a whole evening’s entertainment with a view to an assignation with a woman and in his excitement never imagines that he has with his own hands set the snare in which he will presently be caught and publicly thrashed by bravoes stationed in readiness by her husband “well after all it is none too soon are you satisfied young glory and presently young knight of the legion of honour for very soon you will be able to sport your cross” m de charlus said to morel with a tender and triumphant air but by the very mention of the decoration endorsed mme verdurin’s lies which appeared to morel to be indisputable truth “leave me alone i forbid you to come near me” morel shouted at the baron “you know what i mean all right i’m not the first young man you’ve tried to corrupt” my sole consolation lay in the thought that i was about to see morel and the verdurins pulverised by m de charlus for a thousand times less an offence i had been visited with his furious rage no one was safe from it a king would not have intimidated him instead of which an extraordinary thing happened one saw m de charlus dumb stupefied measuring the depths of his misery without understanding its cause finding not a word to utter raising his eyes to stare at each of the company in turn with a questioning outraged suppliant air which seemed to be asking them not so much what had happened as what answer he ought to make and yet m de charlus possessed all the resources not merely of eloquence but of audacity when seized by a rage which had long been simmering against some one he reduced him to desperation with the most outrageous speeches in front of a scandalised society which had never imagined that anyone could go so far m de charlus on these occasions burned convulsed with a sort of epilepsy which left everyone trembling but in these instances he had the initiative he launched the attack he said whatever came into his mind just as bloch was able to make fun of jews and blushed if the word jew was uttered in his hearing perhaps what struck him speechless was — when he saw that m and mme verdurin turned their eyes from him and that no one was coming to his rescue — his anguish at the moment and still more his dread of greater anguish to come or else that not having lost his temper in advance in imagination and forged his thunderbolt not having his rage ready as a weapon in his hand he had been seized and dealt a mortal blow at the moment when he was unarmed for sensitive neurotic hysterical his impulses were genuine but his courage was a sham indeed as i had always thought and this was what made me like him his malice was a sham also the people whom he hated he hated because he thought that they looked down upon him had they been civil to him instead of flying into a furious rage with them he would have taken them to his bosom and he did not shew the normal reactions of a man of honour who has been insulted or else that in a sphere which was not his own he felt himself less at his ease and less courageous than he would have been in the faubourg the fact remains that in this drawingroom which he despised this great nobleman in whom his sense of superiority to the middle classes was no less essentially inherent than it had been in any of his ancestors who had stood in the dock before the revolutionary tribunal could do nothing in a paralysis of all his members including his tongue but cast in every direction glances of terror outraged by the violence that had been done to him no less suppliant than questioning in a situation so cruelly unforeseen this great talker could do no more than stammer “what does it all mean what has happened” his question was not even heard and the eternal pantomime of panic terror has so little altered that this elderly gentleman to whom a disagreeable incident had just occurred in a parisian drawingroom unconsciously repeated the various formal attitudes in which the greek sculptors of the earliest times symbolised the terror of nymphs pursued by the great pan

   the ambassador who has been recalled the undersecretary placed suddenly on the retired list the man about town whom people began to cut the lover who has been shewn the door examine sometimes for months on end the event that has shattered their hopes they turn it over and over like a projectile fired at them they know not whence or by whom almost as though it were a meteorite they would fain know the elements that compose this strange engine which has burst upon them learn what hostilities may be detected in them chemists have at least the power of analysis sick men suffering from a malady the origin of which they do not know can send for the doctor criminal mysteries are more or less solved by the examining magistrate but when it comes to the disconcerting actions of our fellowmen we rarely discover their motives thus m de charlus to anticipate the days that followed this party to which we shall presently return could see in charlie’s attitude one thing alone that was selfevident charlie who had often threatened the baron that he would tell people of the passion that he inspired in him must have seized the opportunity to do so when he considered that he had now sufficiently ‘arrived’ to be able to fly unaided and he must out of sheer ingratitude have told mme verdurin everything but how had she allowed herself to be taken in for the baron having made up his mind to deny the story had already persuaded himself that the sentiments for which he was blamed were imaginary some friends of mme verdurin who themselves perhaps felt a passion for charlie must have prepared the ground accordingly m de charlus during the next few days wrote terrible letters to a number of the faithful who were entirely innocent and concluded that he must be mad then he went to mme verdurin with a long and moving tale which had not at all the effect that he desired for in the first place mme verdurin repeated to the baron “all you need do is not to bother about him treat him with scorn he is a mere boy” now the baron longed only for a reconciliation in the second place to bring this about by depriving charlie of everything of which he had felt himself assured he asked mme verdurin not to invite him again a request which she met with a refusal that brought upon her angry and sarcastic letters from m de charlus flitting from one supposition to another the baron never arrived at the truth which was that the blow had not come from morel it is true that he might have learned this by asking him for a few minutes’ conversation but he felt that this would injure his dignity and would be against the interests of his love he had been insulted he awaited an explanation there is for that matter almost invariably attached to the idea of a conversation which might clear up a misunderstanding another idea which whatever the reason prevents us from agreeing to that conversation the man who is abased and has shewn his weakness on a score of occasions will furnish proofs of pride on the twentyfirst the only occasion on which it would serve him not to adopt a headstrong and arrogant attitude but to dispel an error which will take root in his adversary failing a contradiction as for the social side of the incident the rumour spread abroad that m de charlus had been turned out of the verdurins’ house at the moment when he was attempting to rape a young musician the effect of this rumour was that nobody was surprised when m de charlus did not appear again at the verdurins’ and whenever he happened by chance to meet anywhere else one of the faithful whom he had suspected and insulted as this person had a grudge against the baron who himself abstained from greeting him people were not surprised realising that no member of the little clan would ever wish to speak to the baron again

   while m de charlus rendered speechless by morel’s words and by the attitude of the mistress stood there in the pose of the nymph a prey to panic terror m and mme verdurin had retired to the outer drawingroom as a sign of diplomatic rupture leaving m de charlus by himself while on the platform morel was putting his violin in its case “now you must tell us exactly what happened” mme verdurin appealed avidly to her husband “i don’t know what you can have said to him he looked quite upset” said ski “there are tears in his eyes” pretending not to have understood “i’m sure nothing that i said could make any difference to him” said mme verdurin employing one of those stratagems which do not deceive everybody so as to force the sculptor to repeat that charlie was in tears tears which filled the mistress with too much pride for her to be willing to run the risk that one or other of the faithful who might not have heard what was said remained in ignorance of them “no it has made a difference for i saw big tears glistening in his eyes” said the sculptor in a low tone with a smile of malicious connivance and a sidelong glance to make sure that morel was still on the platform and could not overhear the conversation but there was somebody who did overhear and whose presence as soon as it was observed was to restore to morel one of the hopes that he had forfeited this was the queen of naples who having left her fan behind had thought it more polite on coming away from another party to which she had gone on to call for it in person she had entered the room quite quietly as though she were ashamed of herself prepared to make apologies for her presence and to pay a little call upon her hostess now that all the other guests had gone but no one had heard her come in in the heat of the incident the meaning of which she had at once gathered and which set her ablaze with indignation “ski says that he had tears in his eyes did you notice that i did not see any tears ah yes i remember now” she corrected herself in the fear that her denial might not be believed “as for charlus he’s not far off them he ought to take a chair he’s tottering on his feet he’ll be on the floor in another minute” she said with a pitiless laugh at that moment morel hastened towards her “isn’t that lady the queen of naples” he asked albeit he knew quite well that she was pointing to her majesty who was making her way towards charlus “after what has just happened i can no longer i’m afraid ask the baron to present me” “wait i shall take you to her myself” said mme verdurin and followed by a few of the faithful but not by myself and brichot who made haste to go and call for our hats and coats she advanced upon the queen who was talking to m de charlus he had imagined that the realisation of his great desire that morel should be presented to the queen of naples could be prevented only by the improbable demise of that lady but we picture the future as a reflexion of the present projected into empty space whereas it is the result often almost immediate of causes which for the most part escape our notice not an hour had passed and now m de charlus would have given everything he possessed in order that morel should not be presented to the queen mme verdurin made the queen a curtsey seeing that the other appeared not to recognise her “i am mme verdurin your majesty does not remember me” “quite well” said the queen as she continued so naturally to converse with m de charlus and with an air of such complete indifference that mme verdurin doubted whether it was to herself that this ‘quite well’ had been addressed uttered with a marvellously detached intonation which wrung from m de charlus despite his broken heart a smile of expert and delighted appreciation of the art of impertinence morel who had watched from the distance the preparations for his presentation now approached the queen offered her arm to m de charlus with him too she was vexed but only because he did not make a more energetic stand against vile detractors she was crimson with shame for him whom the verdurins dared to treat in this fashion the entirely simple civility which she had shewn them a few hours earlier and the arrogant pride with which she now stood up to face them had their source in the same region of her heart the queen as a woman full of good nature regarded good nature first and foremost in the form of an unshakable attachment to the people whom she liked to her own family to all the princes of her race among whom was m de charlus and after them to all the people of the middle classes or of the humblest populace who knew how to respect those whom she liked and felt welldisposed towards them it was as to a woman endowed with these sound instincts that she had shewn kindness to mme verdurin and no doubt this is a narrow conception somewhat tory and increasingly obsolete of good nature but this does not mean that her good nature was any less genuine or ardent the ancients were no less strongly attached to the group of humanity to which they devoted themselves because it did not exceed the limits of their city nor are the men of today to their country than will be those who in the future love the united states of the world in my own immediate surroundings i have had an example of this in my mother whom mme de cambremer and mme de guermantes could never persuade to take part in any philanthropic undertaking to join any patriotic workroom to sell or to be a patroness at any bazaar i do not go so far as to say that she was right in doing good only when her heart had first spoken and in reserving for her own family for her servants for the unfortunate whom chance brought in her way her treasures of love and generosity but i do know that these like those of my grandmother were unbounded and exceeded by far anything that mme de guermantes or mme de cambremer ever could have done or did the case of the queen of naples was altogether different but even here it must be admitted that her conception of deserving people was not at all that set forth in those novels of dostoievski which albertine had taken from my shelves and devoured that is to say in the guise of wheedling parasites thieves drunkards at one moment stupid at another insolent debauchees at a pinch murderers extremes however meet since the noble man the brother the outraged kinsman whom the queen sought to defend was m de charlus that is to say notwithstanding his birth and all the family ties that bound him to the queen a man whose virtue was hedged round by many vices “you do not look at all well my dear cousin” she said to m de charlus “léan upon my arm be sure that it will still support you it is firm enough for that” then raising her eyes proudly to face her adversaries at that moment ski told me there were in front of her mme verdurin and morel “you know that in the past at gaeta it held the mob in defiance it will be able to serve you as a rampart” and it was thus taking the baron on her arm and without having allowed morel to be presented to her that the splendid sister of the empress elisabeth left the house it might be supposed in view of m de charlus’s terrible nature the persecutions with which he terrorised even his own family that he would after the events of this evening let loose his fury and practise reprisals upon the verdurins we have seen why nothing of this sort occurred at first then the baron having caught cold shortly afterwards and contracted the septic pneumonia which was very rife that winter was for long regarded by his doctors and regarded himself as being at the point of death and lay for many months suspended between it and life was there simply a physical change and the substitution of a different malady for the neurosis that had previously made him lose all control of himself in his outbursts of rage for it is too obvious to suppose that having never taken the verdurins seriously from the social point of view but having come at last to understand the part that they had played he was unable to feel the resentment that he would have felt for any of his equals too obvious also to remember that neurotics irritated on the slightest provocation by imaginary and inoffensive enemies become on the contrary inoffensive as soon as anyone takes the offensive against them and that we can calm them more easily by flinging cold water in their faces than by attempting to prove to them the inanity of their grievances it is probably not in a physical change that we ought to seek the explanation of this absence of rancour but far more in the malady itself it exhausted the baron so completely that he had little leisure left in which to think about the verdurins he was almost dead we mentioned offensives even those which have only a posthumous effect require if we are to ‘stage’ them properly the sacrifice of a part of our strength m de charlus had too little strength left for the activity of a preparation we hear often of mortal enemies who open their eyes to gaze upon one another in the hour of death and close them again made happy this must be a rare occurrence except when death surprises us in the midst of life it is on the contrary at the moment when we have nothing left to lose that we are not bothered by the risks which when full of life we would lightly have undertaken the spirit of vengeance forms part of life it abandons us as a rule — notwithstanding certain exceptions which occurring in the heart of the same person are as we shall see human contradictions — on the threshold of death after having thought for a moment about the verdurins m de charlus felt that he was too weak turned his face to the wall and ceased to think about anything if he often lay silent like this it was not that he had lost his eloquence it still flowed from its source but it had changed detached from the violence which it had so often adorned it was no more now than an almost mystic eloquence decorated with words of meekness words from the gospel an apparent resignation to death he talked especially on the days when he thought that he would live a relapse made him silent this christian meekness into which his splendid violence was transposed as is in esther the so different genius of andromaque provoked the admiration of those who came to his bedside it would have provoked that of the verdurins themselves who could not have helped adoring a man whom his weakness had made them hate it is true that thoughts which were christian only in appearance rose to the surface he implored the archangel gabriel to appear and announce to him as to the prophet at what time the messiah would come to him and breaking off with a sweet and sorrowful smile he would add “but the archangel must not ask me as he asked daniel to have patience for ‘seven weeks and threescore and two weeks’ for i should be dead before then” the person whom he awaited thus was morel and so he asked the archangel raphael to bring him to him as he had brought the young tobias and introducing more human methods like sick popes who while ordering masses to be said do not neglect to send for their doctors he insinuated to his visitors that if brichot were to bring him without delay his young tobias perhaps the archangel raphael would consent to restore brichot’s sight as he had done to the father of tobias or as had happened in the sheeppool of bethesda but notwithstanding these human lapses the moral purity of m de charlus’s conversation had none the less become alarming vanity slander the insanity of malice and pride had alike disappeared morally m de charlus had been raised far above the level at which he had lived in the past but this moral perfection as to the reality of which his oratorical art was for that matter capable of deceiving more than one of his compassionate audience this perfection vanished with the malady which had laboured on its behalf m de charlus returned along the downward slope with a rapidity which as we shall see continued steadily to increase but the verdurins’ attitude towards him was by that time no more than a somewhat distant memory which more immediate outbursts prevented from reviving

   to turn back to the verdurins’ party when the host and hostess were by themselves m verdurin said to his wife “you know where cottard has gone he is with saniette he has been speculating to put himself straight and has gone smash when he got home just now after leaving us and learned that he hadn’t a penny in the world and nearly a million francs of debts saniette had a stroke” “but then why did he gamble it’s idiotic he was the last person in the world to succeed at that game cleverer men than he get plucked at it and he was born to let himself be swindled by every tom dick and harry” “why of course we have always known that he was an idiot” said m verdurin “anyhow this is the result here you have a man who will be turned out of house and home tomorrow by his landlord who is going to find himself utterly penniless his family don’t like him forcheville is the last man in the world to do anything for him and so it occurred to me i don’t wish to do anything that doesn’t meet with your approval but we might perhaps be able to scrape up a small income for him so that he shan’t be too conscious of his ruin so that he can keep a roof over his head” “i entirely agree with you it is very good of you to have thought of it but you say ‘a roof the imbecile has kept on an apartment beyond his means he can’t remain in it we shall have to find him a couple of rooms somewhere i understand that at the present moment he is still paying six or seven thousand francs for his apartment” “six thousand five hundred but he is greatly attached to his home in short he has had his first stroke he can scarcely live more than two or three years suppose we were to allow him ten thousand francs for three years it seems to me that we should be able to afford that we might for instance this year instead of taking la raspelière again get hold of something on a simpler scale with our income it seems to me that to sacrifice ten thousand francs a year for three years is not out of the question” “very well there’s only the nuisance that people will get to know about it we shall be expected to do it again for others” “believe me i have thought about that i shall do it only upon the express condition that nobody knows anything about it thank you i have no desire that we should become the benefactors of the human race no philanthropy what we might do is to tell him that the money has been left to him by princess sherbatoff” “but will he believe it she consulted cottard about her will” “if the worse comes to the worst we might take cottard into our confidence he is used to professional secrecy he makes an enormous amount of money he won’t be like one of those busybodies one is obliged to hush up he may even be willing to say perhaps that it was himself that the princess appointed as her agent in that way we shouldn’t even appear that would avoid all the nuisance of scenes and gratitude and speeches” m verdurin added an expression which made quite plain the kind of touching scenes and speeches which they were anxious to avoid but it cannot have been reported to me correctly for it was not a french expression but one of those terms that are to be found in certain families to denote certain things annoying things especially probably because people wish to indicate them in the hearing of the persons concerned without being understood an expression of this sort is generally a survival from an earlier condition of the family in a jewish family for instance it will be a ritual term diverted from its true meaning and perhaps the only hebrew word with which the family now thoroughly french is still acquainted in a family that is strongly provincial it will be a term in the local dialect albeit the family no longer speaks or even understands that dialect in a family that has come from south america and no longer speaks anything but french it will be a spanish word and in the next generation the word will no longer exist save as a childish memory they may remember quite well that their parents at table used to allude to the servants who were waiting without being understood by them by employing some such word but the children cannot tell exactly what the word meant whether it was spanish hebrew german dialect if indeed it ever belonged to any language and was not a proper name or a word entirely forged the uncertainty can be cleared up only if they have a greatuncle a cousin still surviving who must have used the same expression as i never knew any relative of the verdurins i have never been able to reconstruct the word all i know is that it certainly drew a smile from mme verdurin for the use of this language less general more personal more secret than their everyday speech inspires in those who use it among themselves a sense of selfimportance which is always accompanied by a certain satisfaction after this moment of mirth “but if cottard talks” mme verdurin objected “he will not talk” he did mention it to myself at least for it was from him that i learned of this incident a few years later actually at the funeral of saniette i was sorry that i had not known of it earlier for one thing the knowledge would have brought me more rapidly to the idea that we ought never to feel resentment towards other people ought never to judge them by some memory of an unkind action for we do not know all the good that at other moments their hearts may have sincerely desired and realised no doubt the evil form which we have established once and for all will recur but the heart is far more rich than that has many other forms that will recur also to these people whose kindness we refuse to admit because of the occasion on which they behaved badly furthermore this revelation by cottard must inevitably have had an effect upon me because by altering my opinion of the verdurins this revelation had it been made to me earlier would have dispelled the suspicions that i had formed as to the part that the verdurins might be playing between albertine and myself would have dispelled them wrongly perhaps as it happened for if m verdurin — whom i supposed with increasing certainty to be the most malicious man alive — had certain virtues he was nevertheless tormenting to the point of the most savage persecution and so jealous of his domination over the little clan as not to shrink from the basest falsehoods from the fomentation of the most unjustified hatreds in order to sever any ties between the faithful which had not as their sole object the strengthening of the little group he was a man capable of disinterested action of unostentatious generosity that does not necessarily mean a man of feeling nor a pleasant man nor a scrupulous nor a truthful nor always a good man a partial goodness in which there persisted perhaps a trace of the family whom my greataunt had known existed probably in him in view of this action before i discovered it as america or the north pole existed before columbus or peary nevertheless at the moment of my discovery m verdurin’s nature offered me a new and unimagined aspect and so i am brought up against the difficulty of presenting a permanent image as well of a character as of societies and passions for it changes no less than they and if we seek to portray what is relatively unchanging in it we see it present in succession different aspects implying that it cannot remain still but keeps moving to the disconcerted artistembed"
