one two three

verse 1
somebody save me me from myself
ive spent so long living in hell
they say my lifestyle is bad for my health
its the only thing that seems to help

prechorus
all of this drinkin and smokin is hopeless but feel like its all that i need
somethin inside of mes broken i hold on to anything that sets me free

chorus
im a lost cause
baby dont waste your time on me
im so damaged beyond repair
life has shattered my hopes and my dreams
im a lost cause
baby dont waste your time on me
im so damaged beyond repair
life has shattered my hopes and my dreams

verse 2
what if the night sky was missin the moon
there were no shootin stars to use wishin on you
and all of my sorrows id just wash them down
its the only peace ive ever found
