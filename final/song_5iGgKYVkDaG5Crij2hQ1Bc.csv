metal in mask but still keep an elegant class

verse 17 rah digga

verse 18 billy danze

verse 21 joell ortiz

in the 840 playin new e40 with some horny hoes

verse 22 lord tariq

verse 23 cory gunz

verse 24 peter gunz

verse 25 shaquille oneal

verse 26 roy jones jr

verse 29 mc serch
kay wanted me to be one of the buck because i been a buck
back when a pack of newports was a buck i was a young buck
on the corner of monarch kids from far rock hoppin over the turnstile
to set up shop up top by the jamaican spot
my joints have been a bop from vinyl cassettes cds and streams
on every martin luther boulevard they payin homage to the shooter from queens
right now you wanna be this cracker from queens
fact though im covered from special fleece to my wallaby supremes

verse 30 big daddy kane
this one image is unblemished without one gimmick
your line of scrimmage i cross it in one sentence

of the promenade now heed the words of the poor righteous
that build with mathematics for those whose path is empty
but yall know math was in me for the past half a century
now do the knowledge how the real writers do it
cause i want the smoke charcoal and lighter fluid

verse 31 mc shan
talk shit but i could back up game
the way you silly motherfuckers on the mic talk the same old same

pressure gets so violent givin a fuck what i hit
i play your songs like a lullaby that put me to sleep
and i sing it like a pussy thats this deep

verse 32 krsone

temple of hiphop rising to the top kid

verse 33 jon connor

bunch of designer heard a human loses deserve these bruises go

designed to put these rappers out of commission
all i spit is dope and after this yall gon need intervention
taking it back to that driving ambition

verse 34 twista
look up to twista how i be killing em like im in wimbledon
i make a sweep when im doing the murdering
i put the cinnamon up in the pendulum
minimum damage i would never do i dead em like a barbiturates
omnivorous with the flow it dont matter which bar i bit you with
i could reorganize the confusion of a child pharaoh
now munch on that food for thought from a piss poor pimp from the ghetto
hmm i am approaching so i hope youre using a radar
causing beautiful chaos in this unusual séance

verse 35 dragon

yall gotta stop i want more cash and more fast
i went on a run like im all gas from all bad

verse 38 locksmith
youre dealing with a locksmith my mindset is too meticulous
rhymes melt when i sing like the wings from kid icarus
every rap is indicative diction is like a diction
im ditching that status quo to inhabit flows that i stitched in
youre pitching garbage each comment is like a gauntlet
a conscious effort to execute rappers that try to test it
ingest them and exit through my excrement through my intestine
intestinal fortitude afforded you is what you left with

verse 39 3d natee
i dont smoke but stay with a cig like marykate olsen

verse 41 tragedy khadafi

laser beams i done turn niggas foamposites to red bottoms

verse 42 easki
yeah im underrated and i never sold my soul
and i never switched slang to sound southern when the game changed
niggas say they real til you see em on the real

your insecurity gon make this 45 open up your mind and bring enlightenment
and then youll have more clarity

verse 43 cassidy
if i roll a hundred deep its two hundred fists two hundred feet
at least a hundred guns so every nigga get one apiece

i run the streets so when cass scheme that mean
they gotta get shot like a mandatory vaccine

verse 44 bumpy knuckles

two phones next to that old bitch out in wales

verse 80 mike cee

when parties over we boom boom for you its gravity
a tragedy by two masterpieces causing catastrophe

verse 83 page kennedy

but this one emerges
and its curtains when you get to squirting on a piece of birkin
detroit is a mindset as soon as the verse ends you rewind it

verse 93 consequence

verse 94 millyz

you try to tell him calm down bro was doing the most
they left him in the hospital with a tube in his throat

verse 95 ot the real
i trap with the guys knowing ima capitalize
but slaps ima drive to dc those capital rides
put rappin aside i got yak and captions to buy
she smashin up lines so big they look like capital is

verse 96 ron artest

i changed my ways and now i just wanna get paid
smoking haze out a trombone nicholas cage
fire tire is burning times is turning

verse 97 kaflow
kaflow kaboom rolling a hundred deep
ever since a young wolf i always hunted sheep
i already killed all the wolves that wanted beef
seen a nigga brains on the floor and it made ya stomach weak
im from the streets where they brag about puttin you underneath
a lot of niggas gon get shot before the summer reach
take you to the balcony hang you from your feet
my office hours are from nine to five not from one to three

verse 98 tone trump

cause when i spot em ima dot em like the letter i

verse 100 omar epps
im toussaint louverture unfamiliar google more
gurkha out the humidor wise man who fool em all
prove em wrong told kay slay i would do the song
move along if you aint about that communion dawg
through the fog and darkness the world be in peril
til we expel the devils and renew the godly process
im blessed not pressed but im vexed the game culture
brothers obeyin other suckers who aint of us
we reppin that red black and green thats a thing
like pythagorean themes that put data in the machines
the latter means i saw a lot earth a tourist spot
still we universal beings this rehearsal vn
ps we turn tshirts to tuxedos
with flowers from the mall with no gmos or cheat codes
the power is in lovin the death of your own ego
oe go thats that brooklyn

verse 101 bodega bamz
who really the best rapper since pun aint here

verse 102 bynoe

verse 105 king kirk

period lyricists storytellin

verse 106 big dubez

verse 107 tony moxberg
i been livin on the road for the past week for real
makin more moves than an athlete uh huh
im from the backstreets where they pack heat
i deliver got more drop offs than a taxi
hated by the ones who love shits weird
i been seein six figures for like six years
young boy goin dumb and he bout to go dumber
two sticks on him he think he a drummer

verse 108 styleon
a fist up for black people our lives matter
like your life but my life they wont understand it
traumatic stress on my hands this is from being captured
mutilated like castration part of them chapters
but this a never ending story them pages continue
my shade part of that food chain minus the menu
its deeply rooted in genetics the past that weve been through
original hebrew got me feelin it sacrificial

verse 109 chuck d
i got the power im putting in punching the clock like the 99
89 before that seventyfive
when i was around and i first rhymed
while many searched hard for punchlines
i had some that you cannot find
had some that you cant rehearse
all i had to do was voice a verse the kay slay show

verse 110 sauce money
fuck chill i think its time that people really know
whats real nobody else get to spin it
i know these haters wont condone everything i own
pointed at the throne and i dont care whos sittin in it
bank on that nobody son trust
after the clashes and the ashes come dust
you came for the fame you gotta do what one must
but me im only here to eradicate the unjust
real talk motherfuckers the worst
they aint grow into fuck niggas they were suckers from birth
rub shoulders and then its over you touch em you cursed
i cant wait to put love in reverse
the verse woulda been iller if it wasnt for slay
he said sau its for the culture not today
i said cool and usually youre always right
but just remember culture vultures aint always white

outro dj kay slay
dj kay slay the drama king
rolling 110 deep
thats right
it had to be done
everything revolves 360°
what comes around goes around
bring it back to the talent over popularity
start talkin to the people
instead of about the people
