theres something sweet and almost kind
but he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined
and now hes dear and so unsure
i wonder why i didnt see it there before

beast
she glanced this way i thought i saw
and when we touched she didnt shudder at my paw
no it cant be ill just ignore
but then shes never looked at me that way before

belle
new and a bit alarming
whod have ever thought that this could be
true that hes no prince charming
but theres something in him that i simply didnt see

lumière
well whod have thought

mrs potts
well bless my soul

cogsworth
well whod have known
you might also likemrs potts
well who indeed

lumière
and whod have guessed theyd come together on their own

mrs potts
its so peculiar

lumière mrs potts  cogsworth
well wait and see a few days more
there may be something there that wasnt there before

cogsworth
you know perhaps theres something there that wasnt there before

mrs potts
there may be something there that wasnt there before1embed"
