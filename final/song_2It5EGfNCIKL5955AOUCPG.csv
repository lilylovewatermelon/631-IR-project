i can hear your heartbeat ive tried so hard to forget
im being buried under the memory of all of my regrets

prechorus
ive spent ages losing sleep while strangers warmed your bed
i know its over please be over theres nothing left to save

chorus
let me let you down
i cant watch you drown with me
let me let you down
i cant watch you drown with me

verse 2
your voice is ringing in my ears but i cant see you talk
you could tell me to go straight to hell and id enjoy the walk

prechorus
ive spent ages losing sleep while strangers warmed your bed
i know its over please be over theres nothing left to save

chorus
let me let you down
i cant watch you drown with me
let me let you down
i cant watch you drown with me
see bad omens liveget tickets as low as 48you might also likebridge
if i could make it simpler if i could get back to the start
i would keep you even closer so that i could hear your heart
but your pulse has started fading ill try to hold on to the sound
i know its over please be over cause ill just let you down

chorus
let me let you down
i cant watch you drown with me
let me let you down
i cant watch you drown with me4embed"
