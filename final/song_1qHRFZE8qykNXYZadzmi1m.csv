she was storming through the house that day
and i could tell she was leaving
and i thought aw shell be back
till she turned around and pointed at the wall and said

verse 2
that picture from our honeymoon
that night in frisco bay
just give it away
she said give it away
and that big fourposter kingsize bed
where so much love was made
just give it away
she said just give it away

chorus
just give it away
there aint nothing in this house worth fighting over
oh and were both tired of fighting anyway
just give it away

so i tried to move on
but i found that each woman i held

when that front door swung wide open
she flung her diamond ring
said give it away
just give it away
and i said now honey dont you even want
your half of everything
she said give it away
just give it away

chorus
just give it away
there aint nothing in this house worth fighting over
oh and were both tired of fighting anyway
just give it away

verse 4
so im still right here where she left me
along with all the other things
she dont care about anymore
mmm like that picture from our honeymoon
that night in frisco bay
she said give it away
well i cant give it away
and that big fourposter kingsize bed
where all our love was made
she said give it away
well i cant give it away
outro
ive got a furnished house a diamond ring
and a lonely broken heart
full of love and i cant even give it away4embed"
