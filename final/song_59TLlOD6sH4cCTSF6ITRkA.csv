i see nothing in your eyes
and the more i see the less i like
is it over yet
in my head
i know nothing of your kind
and i wont reveal your evil mind
is it over yet
i cant win

prechorus
so sacrifice yourself
and let me have whats left
i know that i can find
the fire in your eyes
im going all the way
get away please

chorus
you take the breath right out of me
you left a hole where my heart should be
you got to fight just to make it through
cause i will be the death of you

verse 2
this will be all over soon this will all be over soon
pour the salt into the open wound
is it over yet
let me in
