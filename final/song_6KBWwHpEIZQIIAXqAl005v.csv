theres a house down on the corner
with the porch light on
and a window i can look in
and see youre always home
waiting for me with the lights low
in your silk nightgown
somewhere on the outskirts
of memory town

verse 2
and past the stoplight
theres a desert where my coupe deville
roars down a lonely highway
and it always will
the wind is in your hair
and were nowhere to be found
two spirits on the boulevard
in memory town

chorus
i can pull the shades and feel your lips
theyre touching mine again
i can watch the shadows of the moon
slow dance across your skin
hold you in a place where lovers
never say goodbye
every moment comes alive
when i go down to memory town
see brooks  dunn liveget tickets as low as 30you might also likeverse 3
and round the corner
theres an ocean where the waves roll in
and a feeling that you only feel
when love begins
we lie together in the sand
and watch the sun go down
i close my eyes and smell the warm salt air
in memory town

chorus
i can pull the shades and feel your lips
theyre touching mine again
i can watch the shadows of the moon
slow dance across your skin
hold you in a place where lovers
never say goodbye
every moment comes alive
every time i close my eyes
and go back down to memory town

bridge
theres a house down on the corner
with the porch light on
a window i can look
and see youre always home
waiting for me with the light low
in your silk nightgown
somewhere on the outskirts
of memory town
outro
take me down
take me down
to memory town
take me down
to memory townembed"
