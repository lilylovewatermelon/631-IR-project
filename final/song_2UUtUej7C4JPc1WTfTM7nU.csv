the summer wind came blowin in
from across the sea
it lingered there touched your hair
and walked with me
all summer long we sang a song
then we strolled that golden sand
two sweethearts
and the summer wind

verse 2
like painted kites those days and nights
went flying by
the world was new beneath a blue
umbrella sky
then softer than a piper man
one day it called to you
i lost you to
the summer wind

verse 3
the autumn wind and the winter wind
they have come and gone
but still those days those lonely days
go on and on
but guess who sighs his lullabies
through nights that never end
my fickle friend
the summer wind
you might also likeinstrumental break

verse 3
oh the autumn wind and the winter wind
they have come and gone
but still those days those lonely days
go on and on
and guess who sighs his lullabies
through nights that never end
my fickle friend
the summer wind

outro
mmm that summer wind
warm warm summer wind
mmm
that summer windembed"
