verse 1
life come and go
so let the history be told
were all out here
hustlin to make our way
and while youre stumblin and fallin stumblin and fallin
why dont you pick yourself up now pick yourself up now
you see we all out here
working day by day

chorus
so tell me
how can we work it out
on that day when its time to share the gold at the end of the rainbow
how can we work it out
when good and evil meet
the day you kiss his feet
cause it will soon come

you soon lose track of which way is up when your always being put down being put down
you gotta be strong and do what you feel in your heart
regardless of whos around regardless of whos around
i know it might seem bold
but thats all we have all we have
many centuries and were steady gettin old
but you know to what we never had
