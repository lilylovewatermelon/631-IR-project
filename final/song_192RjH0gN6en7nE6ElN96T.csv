well respected in this hiphop lil polo be spittin facts
a lot of rappers doin way more stuntin than givin back
you aint my color then you don’t know the struggle of livin black
cops kill us and we protest what type of shit is that
man if the police shoot at one of my brothers im blickin back
we hate each other so we just wanna score and go titfortat
all these shorties want is points they aint chasin a different stat
really riskin it all what’s the point when that nigga rat
we seventeen got forty years in that court when we gettin cracked
stuck in the system they just watchin us fail while they sittin back
the government cuttin checks but cant cut a nigga some slack
its hard to get a job so we hustle and flip a pack
its all a setup no wonder why they call this bitch a trap
life was messed up a matter of time til that nigga snap
posttraumatic stress so them triggers keep gettin tapped
rip malcolm i promise to conquer and fill them gaps
them corners leave a nigga boxed in tryna break free
crazy how i love the same block that tried to break me
pray that i aint in my own hood when they take me
this all we know a life of peace what we cant see
im from where we unheard and we cant speak
we go to school they try to tell us what we cant be
profit with a billiondollar mind like im jayz
they killed martin for dreamin and now i cant sleep
why would the devil take my brother if he close to me
now if you stare into my soul youll see my bros in me
we missin you man this aint how this shit supposed to be
feel like im stuck i wish them streets never proposed to me
out there posted in the field with them soldiers deep
so now the other side wanna put a hole in me
like every day might be the end of the road for me
we die young so i couldnt picture a older me
fightin demons let them drugs take control of me
all in my head go and kill what they told to me
member we aint have a thing same clothes for weeks
hardbody thats how them situations molded me
needed money and grew accustomed to this fast life
pressure from this way of livin so we blast pipes
shit got me stressin three hundred and sixtyfive nights
them people workin against us like we dont have rights
it dont matter what this money and this fame can give
ive been hurtin tryna smile through the pain and tears
wish we could go back to them days when we played as kids
a lot of shit changed thats just the way it is
