does your heart skip a beat when he kisses you baby
yeah i just gotta know for my peace of mind
staying up all night cause its driving me crazy
tell me yes or no either way im fine

prechorus
last time we talked said youve never been better
thats what you said though when we were together
mine in july but youre his in december

chorus
i guess i was your gateway love
i didnt get you high enough
kinda like an eighth grade crush
that never lasts
are you on that heavy stuff
tell me did you find the one
find the one i thought i was
but now i know that i was just
your gateway love baby
yeah i was your gateway love baby

verse 2
was i just one piece of the puzzle youre playing
did you have your eye on a different prize
was i just another number on a whole other waitlist
i knew it had to end but it was sublime
