your lips are nettles your tongue is wine
your laughters liquid but your bodys pine
you love all sailors but hate the beach
you say come touch me but youre always out of reach

chorus
in the dark you tell me of a flower
that only blooms in the violet hour

verse 2
your arms are lovely yellow and rose
your backs a meadow covered in snow
your thighs are thistles and hothouse grapes
you breathe your sweet breath and have me wait

chorus
in the dark you tell me of a flower
that only blooms in the violet hour

verse 3
i turned the lights out i cleaned the sheets
you changed the station turned up the heat
and now youre sailing upon your chair
you got me tangled up inside with your beautiful black hair

in the dark you tell me of a flower
that only blooms in the violet hour
in the dark you tell me of a flower
that only blooms in the violet hourembed"
