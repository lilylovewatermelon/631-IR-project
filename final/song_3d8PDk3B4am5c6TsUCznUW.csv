verse 1 drake
uh say baby i had to mention
that if you were a star youd be the one im searching for
other girls they they got attention
but i just always feel like theyre in need of something you got
its obvious youre pretty
heard that youre a student working weekends in the city
tryna take you out girl hope youre not too busy
and if theres nothing wrong got this little song
for you to get ready to put those fucking heels on and work it girl
let that mirror show you what youre doing
put that fucking dress on and work it kind of vicious
like somebodys taking pictures

chorus drake

youd be the baddest girl around aye round aye round aye
and theyd notice theyd notice

you would shut it down aye down aye down aye
youd be the baddest girl around aye round aye round aye
and theyd notice theyd notice
you would shut it—

verse 3 drake  thedream
shooting stars all around her fire comets yes indeed
i could bring her through and shut em down onyx
no youre not imagining theyre looking at you long stares
even though shes standing out she look like she belongs here
you feel the hours pass until ya find somethin
i feel like when she moves the time doesnt
yeah baby you finer than your fine cousin and your cousin fine
but she aint got my heart beating double time
you just shut it down girl who told the cops where the party was
why do i feel like i found the one
whats in these shots that you ordered us
damn i mean you sure know how to paint a town
ever since you came around its obvious—

part ii

verse 4 drake
the way i’m feeling things i say
all just happen when you pass my way oh
what can i do to make you stay
i know it’s getting late but girl i don’t want you to leave
you tell me you’re just not the type you wanna do this right
and i’m not tryna say i don’t believe you
but i refuse to feel ashamed and if you feel the same
does waiting really make us better people
take those fucking heels off it’s worth it girl
nothing is what i can picture you in
so take that fucking dress off i swear you won’t forget me
you’ll be happy that you let me

outro drake
lay you down down down
i’m tryna lay you down down down
you still the baddest girl around round round
theyd notice theyd notice
let me lay you down down down
tryna lay you down down down
you still the baddest girl around round round
and theyd notice theyd notice
you would shut it48embed"
