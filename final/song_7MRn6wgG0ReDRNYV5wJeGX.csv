too many shadows in my room
too many hours in this midnight
too many corners in my mind
so much to do to set my heart right

chorus
oh its taking so long i could be wrong
i could be ready
oh but if i take my hearts advice
i should assume its still unsteady
i am in repair i am in repair

verse 2
stood on the corner for a while
to wait for the wind to blow down on me
hoping it takes with it my old ways
and brings some brand new luck upon me

chorus
oh its taking so long i could be wrong
i could be ready
oh but if i take my hearts advice
i should assume its still unsteady
i am in repair i am in repair

verse 3
and now im walking in a park
all of the birds they dance below me
maybe when things turn green again
it will be good to say you know me

chorus
oh its taking so long i could be wrong
i could be ready
oh but if i take my hearts advice
i should assume its still unsteady
i am in repair i am in repair

outro
im never really ready
oh im never really ready
im in repair
im not together but im getting there
im in repair
im not together but im getting there
im in repair
im not together but im getting there
im in repair
im not together but im getting there
im in repair
im not together but im getting there
im in repair
im not together but im getting there7embed"
