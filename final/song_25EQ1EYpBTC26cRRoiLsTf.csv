i pull off with my nigga finna throw a fit
i pull up on a bitch i dont say shit she gettin in
but i had to kick her out cuz i aint tell her ass to get in
i embarrass her in front of her little friends
you see i do a lot of shit now just because i can
i could kill a man with my bare fuckin hands
and i dont need a gun to fuckin help with my defense
you play with me ill hang em up on the front fence
leave it up to me im terrortuga man the prince
and i dont give a fuck about nothing but a spliff
you switch it back to us my whole squad smokin ghost dust shit 
couldnt pull my damn blunt with a tow truck
leave it up to me i smoke the whole thing one puff i had enough
i aint finna mingle with no fuck boy
which one imma hit first when i come for em
cant sit back bitch im trynna go and look for em
squad said to chill man them little niggas aint that important
i said yea you right my boy now its time to get to smoking
see me on a mountain looking out im cold as nova scotia
you can sip some lean little bitch i drink my own potion
all these little niggas dont even know where they goin
i trip a fool so easily cuz he dont know what he doin
i make a make a new tag and lay it up on you prick niggas
dont come asking me about shit i dont talk about nothin nigga
i think ive seen too much im trapped inside a trip nigga
now i be zoning in and zoning out until i see the children
now i feel a little better im smoking on the ceiling
im like mifune i aint puny
ill surround your building
its just me and my shadow clones finna get em
you see me chillin on a ship smokin on a twister
she got respect for me look how she call me sir and mister
im like chill bitch im young but i dig the gesture
now pull up to the show look like limp bizkit in it
you see the line too long they think that kurt cobain up in it
im like the new foo fighter i dont like to fuck with niggas
i been through shit that took the pain up off my whole picture
i turn the other cheek if she pass a swisher
im mr excellent philosopher professor
im not easily impressed im pressin extra pressure
i pull up and make a hater wanna find the exit
im headed back to texas but i aint got no exs
who is rob dyrdeks friend bitch im more reckless
i pull in doin 100 through whoevers section
i aint switchin back for nothin  tortuga heaven
i run this whole damn city cuz nobody livin
i clean the blood off my door cuz here come the children
you give no fuck about no hater nor no imitator
when you the only damn captain sittin at the table
