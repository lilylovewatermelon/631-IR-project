my heart and soul were never mine to own
what you care to die for what you care to die for
we die alone well all die young
what you care to die for what you care to die from
snow snow glistens on the ledge whiskey on the bed
shake it out and light a cigarette
miss me when you you wish you werent right

prechorus
shake me all out if im wrong
for you for you
shake it all out when im gone
i for you

chorus
is the devil so bad if he cries in his sleep while the earth turns
and his kids learn to say fuck you they dont love you
does the devil get scared if she dies in her dreams while the earth burns
she cries cause shes nothin like you is she like you

verse 2
what you want from a devil like me devil like me
you see the devil dont mean to be evil
he just regrettably forgets to exceed expectation
holes riddled in your head little bit of lead
shake it out and line a silhouette
miss me when you you wish werent kind of glad
you might also likeprechorus
shake me all out when youre done
for you for you
shake it all out when im gone
i you

chorus
is the devil so bad if he cries in his sleep while the earth turns
and his kids learn to say fuck you they dont love you
does the devil get scared if she dies in her dreams while the earth burns
she cries cause shes nothin like you is she like you

outro
what do you want from a devil like me
am i like you12embed"
