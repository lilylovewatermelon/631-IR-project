verse 1
to leave from this tale follow closely ahead
prepare to exist by the living  dead
too slow or too kind or too wary of those too at ease
past all the buried impressions of then
sullen drawn eyes and expressions to mend
continued through mirrors left broken to sing and be heard
through when it seems all the senses are lost to absurd

chorus
so the part where we are
trapped in active depart
in the fate of the stars
no not one who we are
no control pumping heart
button pressed mind in art
mind control mind restart
verse 2
to leave from the present with no source of sound
they laugh because silence is never around
ignored and forgotten the past may continue to breathe
feared not a rest by this desolate friend
whose patience revealed what intent comes to send
with a stare at a hole in the world comes a lust to be high
above all the dark nested clouds that keep guard of the sky

so the part where we are
trapped in active depart
in the fate of the stars
no not one who we are
no control pumping heart
button pressed mind in art
mind control mind restart

bridge
step onto the ferris wheel
round for day  night
lost in whats forever more
complacent in its reasons for
give  take  sleep  wake 
pray for day  night to come
again we see theres certainty in
what we feel and what weve heard
again we see theres certainty in
expectations all the same17embed"
