bite chunks out of me
youre a shark and im swimming
my heart still thumps as i bleed
and all your friends come sniffing
chorus
triangles are my favourite shape
three points where two lines meet
toe to toe back to back lets go
my love its very late
til morning comes
lets tessellate

break
go alone my flower
and keep my whole lovely you
wild green stones alone my lover
and keep us on my heart

verse 2
three guns and one goes off
ones empty ones not quick enough
one burn one red one grin
search the graves while the camera spins
chunks of you will sink down to seals
blubber rich in mourning
theyll nosh you up yes theyll nosh the love away
but its fair to say you will still haunt me
you might also likechorus
triangles are my favourite shape
three points where two lines meet
toe to toe back to back lets go
my love its very late
til morning comes
lets tessellate66embed"
