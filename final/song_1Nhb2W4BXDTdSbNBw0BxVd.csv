caught in a cold sweat
stuck splitting hairs and drinking too much
im on my way to striking out
go to sleep with the pressure of everyone watching and waiting
theyre yours for the taking but i still have my doubts

prechorus
before you ask which way to go
remember where youve been

chorus
stay awake get a grip and get out
youre safe from the weight of the world
just take a second to set things straight
ill be fine even though im not always right
i can count on the sun to shine
dedication takes a lifetime
but dreams only last for a night

verse 2
figure it out
boy youre tripping so pull yourself together
or youll wash up like the rest
this ship is sinking
im thinking im done for
ill watch as the sails disappear under water
cause im no captain yet
see all time low liveget tickets as low as 114you might also likeprechorus
i said before you ask which way to go
remember where youve been

chorus
stay awake get a grip and get out
youre safe from the weight of the world
just take a second to set things straight
ill be fine even though im not always right
i can count on the sun to shine
dedication takes a lifetime
but dreams only last for a night

bridge
believe you me
ill give them everything
id tell them anything
to show them everything
believe you me
ill give them everything
id tell them anything
to show them everything

cause you aint the only ones who want to live it up
you aint the only ones
you aint the only ones who want to live it up
you aint the only ones
you aint the only ones who want to live it up
you aint the only ones
you aint the only ones who want to live it up
you aint the only ones
chorus
stay awake get a grip and get out
youre safe from the weight of the world
just take a second to set things straight
ill be fine even though im not always right
i can count on the sun to shine
dedication takes a lifetime
but dreams only last for a night2embed"
