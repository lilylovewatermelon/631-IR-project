im from the bottom of the bottom check your sources baby
im a war baby but i cant divorce the pavement
im a hood nigga that turned rich so i got diors latest
and you know i gotta stick to my roots i still rock jordans baby yeah
it was hell in the projects i survived the storm
got brothers in the sky they die fore they born
i know the worst conditions make a champion
look at my ice froze like a mannequin
im underwater like im swimmin and panickin
body bags zipped up like a laminate
the only solution for the opps is to stay inside
how your niggas say they rock but they dont slide

chorus
cause we was hoppin out in broad day
serving fiends in the hallway yeah
promethazine til the mornin
hope i dont wake up tomorrow
we was the type of niggas that would rob the robbers
ima make the choppa sing like ladidadada lada lada
the choppa sing like ladidadada
survived in the trenches im a war baby mhmm
had to slide on the sliders that aint normal baby mhmm

verse 2
like the mob ties in houston we got rag ties
i pray the lord forgive me the day that i got baptized
cause ima clutch the sticky every time a car passin by
i dont wanna be ricky or another victim to homicide
cause i know the soul never dies
i make the chromechrome fly
bitch im a wave roll tide
bullets at your face botox
my persona done got her tonguetied
i was taught that a legend never dies
when its time gotta let the lead fly
cause im a warwarwar baby
posttraumatic stress i know the war changed me
had to bend back but they could never break me
had to slide

we was hoppin out in broad day
serving fiends in the hallway
promethazine til the mornin
hope i dont wake up tomorrow
we was the type of niggas that would rob the robbers
ima make the choppa sing like ladidadada lada lada
the choppa sing like ladidadada
survived in the trenches im a war baby
had to slide on the sliders that aint normal baby mhmm yeah
