do you remember happy together
i do dont you
then all of a sudden youre sick to your stomach
is that still true

chorus
you said forever in the end i fought it
please be honest are we better for it
thought youd hate me but instead you called
and said i miss you
i caught it

verse 2
good to each other give it the summer
i knew you too
but i only saw you once in december
im still confused

chorus
you said forever and i almost bought it
i miss fighting in your old apartment
breaking dishes when youre disappointed
i still love you i promise
nothing happened in the way i wanted
every corner of this house is haunted
and i know you said that were not talking
but i miss you im sorry

i dont wanna go think ill make it worse
everything i know brings me back to us
i dont wanna go weve been here before
everywhere i go leads me back to you you said forever and i almost bought it
i dont wanna go think ill make it worse i miss fighting in your old apartment
everything i know brings me back to us breaking dishes when youre disappointed
i dont wanna go weve been here before i still love you i promise
everywhere i go leads me back to you nothing happened in the way i wanted
i dont wanna go think ill make it worse every corner of this house is haunted
everything i know brings me back to us and i know you said that were not talking
i dont wanna go weve been here before but i miss you
everywhere i go leads me back to you
i dont wanna go think ill make it worse
everything i know brings me back to us
i dont wanna go weve been here before
everywhere i go leads me back to you29embed"
