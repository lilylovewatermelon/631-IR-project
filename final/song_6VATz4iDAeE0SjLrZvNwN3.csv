this the timothy song if you dont know about me

verse 1 timbaland
yeah they call me tim vas phenomenon
i kill em all winter until the summer come
from just another name all the way to number one
and im simply the best when its all said and done
remember when me and magoo was tryna make a mill
well we did and years later we got it still
gave you my bio under construction 1 and 2
hundred percent ginuwine that was from me to you
im makin moves while they ridicule
im like a warm summer breeze in the swimmin pool  im cool
i never kept it basic i been so many places
been gettin money since them honies had them small faces
so many little mes i can hear small traces
but i just ignore it cause im too big for it
and i can hear em screamin

verse 3 timbaland
ay some say i went away but really i never left
they wonder where i been but they can never guess
i been around the world here to the other side
and i successfully achieved what all those others tried
carry my city on my back like a crucifix
for more than a decade cause i can do this shit
a lot of people want my spot but i dont hesitate
the track label my legacy wont appreciate
i stand strong everything i put my hands on
me and mr iovine cause aint no i in team
cause i can hear em sayin
