in a sandalwood frame
we bought in new mexico
i was wearing the chain that old indian made
that we practically stole

little shells in a jar
we found in hanalei bay
got those matching tattoos
and those ten dollar shoes
to remember our stay

chorus
if it hadnt been so good
i wouldnt feel so sad
if we hadnt been so happy baby
it wouldnt hurt this bad

if you had told me this last summer
id be on the floor laughing
instead of standing round
breaking down
wondering what happened

verse 2
what am i supposed to do
without my very best friend
boy you left me in shock
and tied up in knots
then it hits me again
you might also likerepeat chorus

if you had told me this last summer
id be on the floor laughing
instead of standing around
breaking down
wondering what happenedembed"
