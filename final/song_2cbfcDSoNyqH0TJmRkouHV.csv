despondent distracted
youre vicious and romantic
these are a few of my favorite things
all of those flavors and
this is what you choose
past the blues past the blues
and on to something new

chorus
something real make it timeless
an act of god and nothing less will be accepted
so if youre calling me out
then count me out

verse 2
yeah were stubborn and melodramatic
a real class act
you see i know a few of your favorite things
five in the morning and all comes out pouring
love out the same way in

chorus
something real make it timeless
an act of god and nothing less will be accepted
now if youre calling me out
then count me out

something real make it timeless
an act of god and nothing less will be accepted

an act of god and nothing less will be accepted
now if youre calling me out
then count me out
