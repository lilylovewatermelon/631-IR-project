as long as youre gone we may as well pretend
ive been dreaming
and thats straight from the heart
you said its easy but whos to say
that wed be able to keep it this way
but its easier
coming straight from the heart

give it to me straight from the heart
tell me we could make another start
you know ill never go
as long as i know
its coming straight from the heart

ill see you on the street some other time
but all our words will just fall out of line
while were dreaming
straight from the heart

give it to me straight from the heart
tell me we could make another start
you know ill never go
as long as i know
its coming straight from the heart

tell me we could make another start
you know ill never go
as long as lknow
its coming straight from the heart

give it to me straight from the heart
tell me we could make another start
you know ill never go
as long as i know
its coming straight from the heart

you know ill never go
as long as i know
its coming straight from the heart

you know ill never go
as long as i know
its coming straight from the heartembed"
