well you can dig me up a grave
and try and stick me in the ground
well you can tie me to the bed
and try and beat me half to death
but you can never keep me down
well you can stick me in a hole
and you can pray all day for rain
you can shoot me in the leg
just to try to make me beg
and you can leave me there for days

chorus
and ill stay alive
just to follow you home yeah
and i will survive
cause youre my mississippi princess youre my california queen
like the duchess of detroit and every city in between
you can slap me in the face and you can scream profanity
leave me here to die alone but ill still follow you home
ill still follow you home

verse 2
you can make a couple calls
and tell your brothers im in town
put a bounty on my head
and tell my parents that im dead
and hope to hell im never found
you can steal me the keys
to your daddys cadillac
well you can tamper with the brakes
call it a mistake
and pray im never coming back
