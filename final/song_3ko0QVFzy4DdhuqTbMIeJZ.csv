all around
the world theres an echo
as he takes
a bow and they all know
all the girls the boys
they chase the noise
through the highs and through the lows
they will follow the echo
echo echo echo
they will follow the echo
echo echo

preverse 1 eminem
it seems like no matter what i do i just cant get away from them
get away from what
the voices
i can hear em callin callin callin callin callin me

verse 1 eminem
i eat rappers with the rhyme consume em
the only fucking thing that you consume is time im super human
my world is like a rubiks cube its too complex girl you assumin
cupids looming my mentalitys caveman stupid woman
my life is truman show all i have is music ho
i stopped chasing every chick under the sun many moons ago so pretend my dick is a balloon and blow
but you better put a fork in it if you think i’ma lay here just spooning yo
oh you think you the shit cause i just said you was beautiful
diabolical to my last molecule down to my last hair follicle and cuticle
rotten to the core to the bone cold all the way down to my soul from my head to my toe
ever since i was 13 i learned how to sew and sewed shut my own bootyhole
cause i aint took no shit since i looked down to my nuts and saw my first pubic grow
i told these stupid hoes when i come back i’ma set this bitch on fire
and this time i dont mean ima pour gasoline on some chick and light her
cause this time when i fuck this world i’ma put the whole goddamn dick inside her
i aint even put my tip in that hole yet ima go get nickel and try to rip it wider

preverse 2 royce da 5’9”  eminem
shh
did you hear that somebody just said something
is anybody there
i can hear em callin callin callin callin callin me

verse 2 royce da 5’9”
classical poems battle my own demons i need a glass of patron
bad as i need a horn stabbing my clavicle bone im matador prone
first time i seen a desert eagle i was letting the 44 buss the 44 pop
the first time you seen one you was eating coco puffs looking at robocop
i am not a man im a logo im a such thang
in order to clean my veins you need saleen im never referring to the solution i’m talking about more like the mustang
vroom get respect from the getgo hello step to the echo echo echo
pen got a mind of its own got to write my rhymes with a timer
otherwise i’ll probably vibe out to a nine minute song
as the echo follows the maserati as the petrol swallows
im a thousand bodies away from a skeleton check your bible inside it
itll say this guys an elephant i’m fly like i’m killing the scene like
i’m a villain with wings i’ll sleep when i’m 6 feet deep
right now i’m living a dream though we may be reckless
the ladies check us they whisper shady records baby echo
