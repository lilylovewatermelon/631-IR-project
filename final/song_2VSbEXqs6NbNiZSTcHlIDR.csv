hello my friend we meet again
its been a while where should we begin
feels like forever
within my heart are memories
of perfect love that you gave to me
oh i remember

chorus
when you are with me im free
im careless i believe
above all the others well fly
this brings tears to my eyes
my sacrifice

verse 2
weve seen our share of ups and downs
oh how quickly life can turn around
in an instant
it feels so good to reunite
within yourself and within your mind
lets find peace there

chorus
cause when you are with me im free
im careless i believe
above all the others well fly
this brings tears to my eyes
my sacrifice
