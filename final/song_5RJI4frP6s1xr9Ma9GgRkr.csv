verse 1
it doesnt matter if it is good it only matters if it rocks
the main thing that we do is to rock your socks off
theres no such thing as a rock prodigy
cause rocknroll is bogus right kg right
only thing that really matters is a classical sauce
and thats why me and kg are classically trained
to rock your fuckin socks off give em a taste kg okay

interlude
that is bach and it rocks
its a rock block of bach
that he learned in the school
called the school of hard knocks

chorus 1
give it up for kg give it up for me
give it up for kg give it up for me
give it up for rock give it up for blues
give it up for everything that is not to lose
now rock your socks off woman
well rock your shit up yall
give it up children now to freak your shit out
all right

now i know what a lot of you are saying
i just figured out what im gonna do with the rest of my days
im gonna get me an oversized guitar
gain forty pounds and be the next d
well i got sour news for you jack
it aint that easy
for instance are you willing to make the commitment
to waking up at the crack of noon
for deepknee rock squats
seven or eight at a time in a row
how bout are you willing to make the commitment
to rock hard tasty abs washer board style
glistening in the sun
how bout are you willing to make the commitment
waking up going okay its gig time
what tshirt am i gonna wear
cant decide cant decide brain aneurysm
weve been through so much bullshit
just to be here tonight to rock your fuckin socks off
and all we ask in return is so precious little
all were askin you to do is drop trou
and squeeze out a cleveland steamer on my chest oh
two three four

chorus 2
give it up for kg give it up for me
give it up for kg give it up for me
give it up for rock give it up for blues
give it up for everything that is not to lose
now rock your socks off woman
well rock your shit up yall
give it up children not to freak your shit out
