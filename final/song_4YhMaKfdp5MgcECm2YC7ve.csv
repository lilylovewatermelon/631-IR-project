i think its funny how you could find yourself alone
with someone else in an ideal situation
without a shred of good intentions between you
much less a decent explanation
i couldnt tell you why she summoned me
sometimes you get lucky
and they think that you were someone else
i cant remember what she said
was she trying to tell me something
or talking to herself

chorus
go upstairs dont close the door
why dont you give her what shes asking for
spill the drink onto the bed
thats just between her and her friend

verse 2
but it made it hard to sleep
til her head felt even worse
and i hope that she felt miserable
when it was time to go to work
her and her friend
just did it as revenge
so any excess pain you feel
isnt any consequence
but dont feel bad
cause you didnt stand a chance
you can make a hasty exit
thats how they handle it in france
little consolation
even if you always knew it
so any nasty things i say
are purely therapeutic

go upstairs dont close the door
why dont you give her what shes asking for
spill the drink onto the bed
thats just between her and her friend
close the door leave on the light
and kiss her for a little while
the liquor soaked into the sheets
she said its getting late youd better leave

outro
im not budging until you tell me why
please go
not until you look me straight in the eye and tell me why
go away and never come back again
go away please go away
go away please go away1embed"
