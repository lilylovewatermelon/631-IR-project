pick me up pick me up and drive around
pick me up pick me up and leave this town
pistol on my side when she not around
bitch i— bitch i wanna die when you throw it down

chorus lil peep
pick me up pick me up and drive around
pick me up pick me up and leave this town
pistol on my side when she not around
bitch i— bitch i wanna die when you throw it down

verse 1 lil peep
she said she aint never comin back
she aint never comin back
i aint never comin back bitch
now they wanna put me on a track
cant put me on a track
can i put you on my tracklist

bridge lil peep
id rather watch you bleed to death id rather watch you bleed to death
than see you leave just like the rest see you leave just like the rest
