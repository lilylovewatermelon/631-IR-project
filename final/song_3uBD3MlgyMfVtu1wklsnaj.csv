to this big time lonesome town
they got a lot of ice and snow here
half as cold as all the people ive found
every way i try to go here
somebody is always trying to bring me down
ive seen about enough to know where i belong

ive got a mind to see the headlights shining
on that old white line between my heart and home
sick of spendin sundays wishing they were mondays
sittin in a park alone
give my best to anyone whos left who ever done me
any lovin way but wrong
and tell em that the pride of just the other side o nowheres
goin home

takin nothin back to show there
for these dues that ive paid
but the soul i almost sold here
and the body ive been givin away
fadin from the neon nighttime glow here
headin for the light of day
just the other side of nowhere goin home

ive got a mind to see the headlights shinin
on that old white line between my heart and home
sick of spendin sundays wishin they were mondays
sittin in a park alone
give my best to anyone whos left who ever done me
any lovin way but wrong
and tell them that the pride of just the other side of nowheres
goin home
just the other side on nowhere goin homeyou might also likeembed"
