ive been in the deep end since i realized
there is a difference between body and mind
ive been at my lowest for the longest time
knowing my existence is not one of a kind

chorus
but ive had
my deepest cries for now
my hearts out
my guards down
yeah ive had
my deepest cries for now
my hearts out
my guards down

verse 2
ive been seeking solace in the strangest of things
gettin my hands dirty while i beat out the kinks
ive been chasing everything that makes mе feel cold
practicing selflove is something i dont rеally know
so i suppose
i cannot live like this no more
filling a lifetime with remorse
im closing up the void

been in the deep end since i realized
there is a difference between body and mind
if i could make it go quiet inside
get some rest for my weary eyes
tonight im giving my all for a remedy
grant myself serenity
but if i dont leave it all behind

chorus
but ive had
my deepest cries for now
my hearts out
my guards down
yeah ive had
my deepest cries for now
my hearts out
