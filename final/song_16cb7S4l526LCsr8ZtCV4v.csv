verse 1
when the cotillion arrived
we threw out the television
model d575 has custom flute presets
and harmonyplus in addition
now for an arm and a leg
we get three halfdozen beats to choose from
so now we can pretend
theres an orchestra in the lounge room

verse 2
i put the genie bass on
so my left hand can play the choir
with 16ft diapason
and lowreys patented orchestral symphonizer
banjos great on repeat
the kids want to play but theyll have to be patient
the wife cant help tapping her feet
its a genuine home entertainment revelation

chorus
state state state state of the art state of the art
hold the phone its so
state state state state of the art listen to the difference
state state state state of the art by use of a computer
oh my god its so
state state state state of the art

verse 3
now we dont want to go out
when we could spend the night at home with the cotillion
invite the neighbours around
start the bossanova beat and limbo from the living to the kitchen
enjoy the state of the art
the magic swing piano really is astounding
now we cant tell them apart
but these amazing simulations end up sounding even better than the real thing

chorus
state state state state of the art state of the art
hold the phone its so
state state state state of the art computer controlled tone colour
state state state state of the art the marriage of music to computers is quite natural
oh my god its so
state state state state of the art it is time to hear the results

outro
hold the phone its so
oh my god its so
incidentally on the track you just heard there were no keyboard performances
just the occasional pressing of buttons1embed"
