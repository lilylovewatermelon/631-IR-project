verse 1 brad petering
are you sick of me
would you like to be
im tryin to tell you somethin
somethin that i already said
you like a pretty boy
with a pretty voice
who is tryin to sell you somethin
somethin that you already have

chorus brad petering brad petering  faith harding
but if youre too drunk to drive and the music is right
she might let you stay but just for the night
and if she grabs for your hand and drags you along
she might want a kiss before the end of the song
because love can burn like a cigarette
and leave you with nothin
and leave you with nothin

verse 2 brad petering
while the others talked
we were listenin to lovers rock
in her bedroom
in her bedroom
and if you start to kiss
and the record skips
flip it over
and sit a little closer
you might also likechorus brad petering brad petering  faith harding
but if youre too drunk to drive and the music is right
she might let you stay but just for the night
and if she grabs for your hand and drags you along
she might want a kiss before the end of the song
because love can burn like a cigarette
and leave you with nothin
and leave you with nothin
dialogue lafitte  constance
now how many men have you kissed
very few 
but you offered me a kiss why
such a foolish reason im afraid i just wanted to kiss you
