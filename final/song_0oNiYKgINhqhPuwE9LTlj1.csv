im not supposed to be scared of anything
but i dont know where i am
i wish that i could move
but im exhausted and nobody understands how i feel
im trying hard to breathe now
but theres no air in my lungs
theres no one here to talk to
and the pain inside is making me numb

bridge
i try to hold this under control
they cant help me because no one knows

chorus
now im going through changes changes
god i feel so frustrated lately
when i get suffocated save me
now im going through changes changes

verse 2
im feeling weak and weary
walking through this world alone
everything you say every word of it
cuts me to the bone
ive got something to say
but now ive got nowhere to turn
it feels like ive been buried underneath
all the weight of the world

i try to hold this under control
they cant help me because no one knows

chorus
now im going through changes changes
god i feel so frustrated lately
when i get suffocated save me
now im going through changes changes

refrain
im blind and shaking
bound and breaking
i hope i make it through all these changes

chorus
now im going through changes changes
god i feel so frustrated lately
when i get suffocated save me
now im falling apart now i feel it
but im going through changes changes
god i feel so frustrated lately
and i get suffocated i hate this
but im going through changes changesembed"
