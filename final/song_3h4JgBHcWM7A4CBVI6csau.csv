im still trying to figure out how to tell you i was wrong
i cant fill the emptiness inside since youve been gone
so is it you or is it me
i know i said things that i didnt mean
but you shouldve known me by now
you shouldve known me

chorus
if you believed
when i said
id be better off without you
then you never really knew me at all
if you believed
when i said
that i wouldnt be thinking about you
you thought you knew the truth but youre wrong
youre all that i need
just tell me that you still believe

verse 2
i cant undo the things that led us to this place
but i know theres something more to us than our mistakes
so is it you or is it me
i know im so blind when we dont agree
but you shouldve known me by now
you shouldve known me
