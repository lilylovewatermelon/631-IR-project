i met him once way after midnightâ€“
he lit a smoke and i just stared
he seemed to me like such a sore sight
bobby tanqueray with his gorgeous face and hair

verse 2
i never see him on the weekends
he rides the highways lined in bars
his search for fame and fortune bleakens
bobby tanqueray he will not dismay thus far
ooh

he plays his shows shalala ooh la la
and away he goes ooh

i still cant help but think hes out there
and he could use someone like me
and i would tell him but he wont care
