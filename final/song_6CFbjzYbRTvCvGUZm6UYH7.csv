okay
this hospitality bracelet
lets do something crazy

verse 1
i cant believe what you did to me
down on my knees and i need to break free
all these years you violated me violated me
i dont know why i cant feel inside
i try to hide cant make it alright
its overkill
now im ready to fight ready to fight

chorus
i dont need nobody tryin to make me over make me over
i just wanna live simple and free
i just wanna get away
savin all your bullshit for another day

verse 2
feeling confined like im bein force fed
my visions blurry and im lost in regrets
its overload and im outta control outta control
so sick and tired of bein so misused so misused
youre taking me down with all your mental abuse
and i said said i gotta get you outta my head

bridge
leaving the house around a quarter to five
zipped up my boots and im ready to ride ready to ride
and i feel so high feel so high i feel so alive
let down my hair feel the wind on my skin wind on my skin
crossin the border where my new life begins
and i close my eyes and take it all in close my eyes

chorus
i dont need nobody tryna make me over make me over
i just wanna live simple and free
i just wanna get away
savin all your bullshit for another day
im the only one that can rescue me from me
i just wanna get away
savin all your bullshit for another day
im the only one that can rescue me from me

outro
you wanna bring me down
