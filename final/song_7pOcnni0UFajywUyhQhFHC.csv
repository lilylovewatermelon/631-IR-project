he only wants to show you the things he wants to learn too
the hardest parts youll get through
and in the end youll have your best friend
love like this may come once baby its fate
like a soul mate hes your penguin
baby its fate baby its fate not luck

can you find the time to let your lover hold you
he needs somebody to hold too
his love is strong and so true his arrow is aiming for you
and hes the one that you were born to love

love like this may come once baby its fate
like a soul mate hes your penguin
baby its fate baby its fate not luck

let go let go of time for you and i
let go let go of time for you and i
let go let go of time for you and i

love like this is all i want baby were fate
love like this may come once baby were fate
like a soul mate youre my penguin
baby were fate baby its fate not luckyou might also like6embed"
