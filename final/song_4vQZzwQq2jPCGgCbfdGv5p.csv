heaven on earth
we need it now
im sick of all of this
hanging around
sick of sorrow
sick of the pain
sick of hearing again and again
that theres gonna be
peace on earth

verse 2
where i grew up
there werent many trees
where there was wed tear them down
and use them on our enemies
they say that what you mock
will surely overtake you
and you become a monster
so the monster will not break you

prechorus
and its already gone too far
who said that if you go in hard
you wont get hurt
see u2 liveget tickets as low as 450you might also likechorus
jesus can you take the time
to throw a drowning man a line
peace on earth
tell the ones who hear no sound
whose sons are living in the ground
peace on earth
no whos or whys
no one cries like a mother cries
for peace on earth
she never got to say goodbye
to see the colour in his eyes
now hes in the dirt
peace on earth

verse 3
theyre reading names out
over the radio
all the folks the rest of us
wont get to know
sean and julia
gareth ann and breda
their lives are bigger than
any big idea

chorus
jesus can you take the time
to throw a drowning man a line
peace on earth
to tell the ones who hear no sound
whose sons are living in the ground
peace on earth
jesus in the song you wrote
the words are sticking in my throat
peace on earth
hear it every christmas time
but hope and history wont rhyme
so whats it worth
this peace on earth
outro
peace on earth
peace on earth
peace on earthembed"
