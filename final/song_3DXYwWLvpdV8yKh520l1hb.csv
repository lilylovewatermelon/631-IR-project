this sound like i been up to some shit dont it
this sound like all these niggas is my kids dont it
this sound like i aint got no respect for my opponents
this sound like i got a point to make this sound like im whippin up the cake
i should wear a cape
superhuman with the melodies
i go dumb retarded with the harmonies
and my voice is somethin like a therapy to your girl
need a hit i got the recipe
aint no nigga here they can compare to me
keep it player word to bill bellamy
oh yeah oh yeah
look at em look at em snappin
damn niggas cant tell if he singin or rappin
damn smokin and drinkin so you know what happen next

hook
bitches is snappin and niggas is trappin
bitches is snappin and niggas is trappin
bitches is snappin and niggas is trappin
smokin and drinkin so you know what happen
