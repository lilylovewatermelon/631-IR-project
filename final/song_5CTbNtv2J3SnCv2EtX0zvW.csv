i’ll be here awhile ain’t going nowhere
i’ll be here awhile ain’t going nowhere
i’ll be here awhile ain’t going nowhere
i’ll be here awhile

verse 1
far is solace in the maddening pace
sad state written on my face
not a tight rope walk but dance
uncertain game of chance
but i’ll see it through in time

chorus
i’ll be here awhile ain’t going nowhere
i’ll be here awhile ain’t going nowhere
i’ll be here awhile ain’t going nowhere
i’ll be here awhile

verse 2
and if a person place or thing can delive i would quiver with delight
tempted by the hand that could blind my vision and sight
but at twenty years of age
in frolic and in rage
i will see it through in time

chorus
i’ll be here awhile ain’t going nowhere
i’ll be here awhile ain’t going nowhere
i’ll be here awhile ain’t going nowhere
i’ll be here awhile

bridge
but the dawn has come into the endless night
and everything’s going to be all right
but at thirty years of age
through frolic and in rage
all regressed and healed in time

i’ll be here awhile ain’t going nowhere
