you used to be scared of the water
youre safe by the side of your father
your sense of the world lay
in your little home by the harbor
youve always felt small in the city
to think that last fall you were with me
and all of your old clothes
are still in the hall of my building

chorus
you never asked once
no you never asked why
if i was putting things off
if i was drinking too much of that red wine
oh youd wear yourself thin
and accept every sin
and if i glued myself shut
you would find your way in

verse 2
we gambled our souls to the summer
and rattled our bones to the thunder
we watched every sunset
until we got sick of each other
youve always said fall was your season
that everyones here for a reason
i stare at your packed bags
and ask what the hell you were meaning
see noah kahan liveget tickets as low as 102you might also likechorus
you never asked once
no you never asked why
if i was putting things off
if i was drinking too much of that red wine
oh youd wear yourself thin
and accept every sin
and if i glued myself shut
you would find your way in

bridge
it only feels real after raining
and hearts only heal after breaking
i stare at the tree line
and noticed the leaves arent changing
and does the wind blow in cape elizabeth
constant and cold how do you live with this
love was a deadline
spend the rest of my life fuckin missing it

chorus
you never asked once
no you never asked why
if i was putting things off
if i was drinking too much of that red wine
oh youd wear yourself thin
and accept every sin
and if i glued myself shut
you would find your way inembed"
