intro frank zappa
sleeping in a jar
sleeping in a jar
the jar is under the bed
sleeping in a jar
the jar is under the bed
verse mf doom
tripping off the beat kinda dripping off the meat grinder
heat niner pimping stripping soft sweet minor
china was a neat signer trouble with the script digits
double dipped bubble lipped subtle lisp midget
borderline schizo sort of fine tits though
pour the wine whore to grind quarter to nine lets go
ever since ten eleven glad she made a brethren
then its last down seven alligator seven
at the gates of heaven knocking  no answer
slow dancer hopeless romancer dopest flow stanzas
yes no villain metal face to destro
guess so still incredible in escrow
just say ho ill test the yayo
wild west style fest yall best to lay low
hey bro day glo set the bet pay dough
before the cheddar get away best to get maaco
the worst hated god who perpetrated odd favors
demonstrated in the perforated rod lavers
in all quad flavors lord save us
still back in the game like jack lalanne
think you know the name dont rack your brain
on a fast track to half insane
either in a slow beat or that the speed of wrath of kane
laughter pain
hackthooing songs lit in the booth with the best host
doing bong hits on the roof in the west coast
hes at it again mad at the pen
glad that we win a tad fat in a bad hat for men
grind the cinnamon manhattan warmongers
you can find the villain in satin kongas
the van screeches
the old man preaches about the gold sand beaches
the cold hand reaches for the old tan ellesses
