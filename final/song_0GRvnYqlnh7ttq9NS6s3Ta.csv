all alone not by myself
another girl bad for my health
ive seen it all through someone else and i—
another girl bad for my health
acelebrated but undisturbed
and serenaded by the terror bird
its seldom seen and its never heard oh
serenaded by the terror bird

chorus anthony kiedis
never in the wrong time or wrong place
desecration is the smile on my face
the love i made is the shape of my space
my face my face

verse 2 anthony kiedis john frusciante
disintegrated by the rising sun
a rolling blackout of oblivion
and i like to think that im your number one now—
now im rolling blackout of oblivion
i wanna leave but i just get stuck
a broken record runnin low on luck
theres heavy metal coming from your truck and im—
im a broken record runnin low on luck
see red hot chili peppers liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likechorus anthony kiedis
never in the wrong time or wrong place
desecration is the smile on my face
the love i made is the shape of my space
my face my face

bridge anthony kiedis john frusciante
ohoh we could all go down to malibu and make some noise
ohoh coca cola doesnt do the justice she enjoys
ohoh we could all come up with something new to be destroyed
we could all go down

verse 3 anthony kiedis john frusciante
i love the feeling when it falls apart
im slow to finish but im quick to start
and beneath the heather lies the meadowlark and im—
slow to finish but im quick to start

chorus anthony kiedis
never in the wrong time or wrong place
desecration is the smile on my face
the love i made is the shape of my space
my face my face
never in the wrong time or wrong place
desecration is the smile on my face
the love i made is the shape of my space
my face my face
