she wants me to go there
she wants to live in brooklyn
she told me to move there
i like the way you move there
when we’re in the club dancing
all night all night ah

she wants to be my girlfriend
she wants me to go there
she wants to live in italy
every boy and every guy
every boy and every girl

every day is like a movie
girl you were so good to me
but i wasn’t good to you
i wasn’t true wasn’t true
i learned so much from you
if you knew if you knew
you wouldn’t feel the same
that’s why i can’t be your boyfriend
and you can’t be my girlfriend
cause i got a new girlfriend
moving on moving on moving on
i’m moving onsee eyedress liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likeembed"
