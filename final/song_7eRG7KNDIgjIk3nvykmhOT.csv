sitting in the dark i cant forget
even now i realize the time ill never get
another story of the bitter pills of fate
i cant go back again i cant go back again
but you asked me to love you and i did
traded my emotions for a contract to commit
and when i got away i only got so far
the other me is dead
i hear his voice inside my head

prechorus
we were never alive
and we wont be born again
but ill never survive

chorus
with dead memories in my heart
dead memories in my heart
dead memories in my heart

verse 2
you told me to love you and i did
tied my soul into a knot and got me to submit
so when i got away i only kept my scars
the other me is gone
now i dont know where i belong

we were never alive
and we wont be born again
but ill never survive

with dead memories in my heart
dead memories in my heart
