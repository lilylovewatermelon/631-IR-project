youd move a mountain move to new york
to a run down apartment you can barely afford
ditch all of your plans to follow her dream
knowing it might work out or fall apart at the seams

prechorus
you just wanna see her smile
you just wanna see her happy
just wanna make her happy

chorus
things you do for love things you do for love
things you do for love
things you do for love things you do for love
things you do for love
its crazy

verse 2
shell buy you tickets see a band she dont like
shell watch you go crazy shell be beside you rocking all night
shell say you look handsome in that suit that dont fit
shell laugh at a joke that both of you know she dont even get

prechorus
she just wants to see you smile
she just wants to see you happy
she just wants to make you happy yeah
