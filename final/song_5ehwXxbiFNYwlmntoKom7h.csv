verse 1 yung joc
this aint no love song mo like a cut song

ima tell ya one time just relax and unwind
whisper sweet nothings now youre blushin chills down your spine
oh yeah you hot and tempted oh no not pretty ricky
but when you grind on me imma leave you hot and drippin
slip in those satin sheets now go and roll over
