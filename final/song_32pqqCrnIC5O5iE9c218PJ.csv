theres a line where the sky meets the sea and it calls me
but no one knows how far it goes
all the time wondering where i need to be is behind me
im on my own to worlds unknown

refrain
every turn i take every trail i track
is a choice i make now i cant turn back
from the great unknown where i go alone
where i long to be

chorus 2
see her light up the night in the sea she calls me
and yes i know that i can go
theres a moon in the sky and the wind is behind me
soon ill know how far ill goyou might also like2embed"
