compound rocafella
and neyo is like young michael im quincy ho
now hear the flow that broke the da vinci code
im psycho
everything i wrote go
together so nice
like a wedding make you wanna throw rice
im schitzo
kookoo clock dont tick so
write sometimes til the chicks noodles
i got screws loose
i pull words out the air like bluetooth
im a sandwich short of a picnic
ignorant thoughts come across youve sworn that i written this
but i didnt so maybe
its good to be crazy
isnt it baby

verse 2 neyo
i wrote your name on my wall
3000 times last night
you were on my mind
thats what you do to me
thats what you do
thats what you do to me
thats what you
then one by one i went down the line
just repeating it
cause it makes me smile
thats what you do to me
thats what you do
thats what you do to me
thats what you
some say that its
just strange
to act that way
but they dont understand
no they dont get it
youre so magnetic
though its pathetic
to them i simply turn and say
see neyo liveget tickets as low as 54you might also likechorus neyo

verse 3 neyo
lately it seems
like every song i write is about you
oooh i love your style
thats what you do to me
thats what you do
thats what you do to me
thats what you do
and it just dont make no sense
how my swagger is crooked
if you aint by my side
thats what you do to me
thats what you do
thats what you do to me
thats what you do
chorus neyo
just call me crazy
insane deranged
it dont matter to me

oooh write your name in the mirror
right after i love you down

call it what you want to
i dont care
and it doesnt make a difference
long as shes there
