oohooh ooh ooh ooh
its been a long year
would we survive in a horror movie
i doubt it were too slow moving
we trust everyone we meet
two bodies riddled with scars from our preteens
intertwine in a cars dirty backseat
and stare at a drivein screen

prechorus
we didnt know that the sun was collapsing
til the seas rose and the buildings came crashing
we cried oh ohoh oh ohoh oh

chorus
everywhere everything i wanna love you
til were food for the worms to eat
til our fingers decompose keep my hands in yours
everywhеre everything i wanna lovе you
til were food for the worms to eat
til our fingers decompose keep my hands in yours

verse 2
oohooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
drive slowly i know every route in this county
maybe that aint such a bad thing
ill tell where not to speed
its been a long year
and all of our books pages dogeared
well write out the ends on our palms dear
then forget to read
