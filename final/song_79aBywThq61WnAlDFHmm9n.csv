we goin all out we goin all out
we goin all out
watch your motherfuckin mouth niggas
thats right fuck these fag niggas
do it do it do it

verse 1 2pac
come hell or high water down to slaughter opposers
just another lost soul stuck callin jehovah
outlaw til its over brandish my strap back like a cobra
i stay drunk ‘cause im a mad man whenever sober
on a oneman mission my ambitions to hold up
the rap game while i pluck holes in niggas like donuts
and still down to die for all my soldiers like hillbillies
they dont fear me so we feud bringin war to the city
with each breath death before dishonor
never let you swallow me no apologies your honor
a general in war im the first to bomb
with a squad of trusted killers quick to move shit heavily armed
im similar to saddam sometimes i question whos sane
like fiends frantic for that last vein stuck in the game
i hit the scene like sandstorms then transform watch me
i take the figure of 30 niggas who all got me
while bitches wonderin who shot me
no love keep a grudge shootin slugs like muammar gaddafi
murder my friends build a new posse
we takin shots at paparazzi go and fly now nigga like rocky
you got a lot of nerve to play me another gay rapper
bustin caps at jayz and still avoid capture buck buck buck buck
while yall caught up in the rapture still after me
im in jamaica sippin daquiris no doubt
we used to havin nothin then grabbin somethin and bustin
wanted to be the thug nigga that my old man wasnt
i cant tour fear of catchin cases litigation
niggas playerhatin got me crooked in all 50 states
im screamin death row throw my westside aint no thing
we was raised off drivebys brought up to bang
we claim mob mob if you be specific
we control all cash from atlanticpacific
and get this im hard to kill when i peel with this live spot
father how the hell did i survive these five shots
live it up or give it up and like demons
late night hear them screamin we goin all out
you might also likehook edi
we goin all out bomb first til they fall out
take them the war route without a doubt
ball which means we all ride if its on
each nigga handle your own bring it on strong
if you got bills to pay nigga go all out
bustas playin with your papes better go all out
tryna see the next day nigga go all out
obstacles in your way you better go all out

verse 2 napoleon
im on my last leg walkin through the belly of the beast
feelin like im all out drunk as can be
its plain to see that we mob niggas hidin in bushes
claimin that they ride rough but they softer than cushion
they softer than bitches in the worst way drownin in blood
outlawz my blood brothers id die for these thugs
say hi to this slug
its a shame how some niggas on the west coast
was ridin with pac but when he died they went pop
im out in jers to the fullest like some west coast love
but after pac stopped rappin it aint no west coast thug
just west coast slut to my real niggas stuck in the street game
‘cause rappers like jayz be pumpin koolaid through they veins
is it true what im sayin slap your soft ass to the floor
and watch my fofo put peek holes through your door
i ride or die but these other fag niggas be bitin this
its all from my heart when i was writin this all out
hook edi
we goin all out bomb first til they fall out
take them the war route without a doubt
ball which means we all ride if its on
each nigga handle your own bring it on strong
if you got bills to pay nigga go all out
bustas playin with your papes better go all out
tryna see the next day nigga go all out
obstacles in your way you better go all out

verse 3 kastro
now we all ride and down to die — who with us
speak up or get treated like you comin to kill us
they ain’t nothin but squealers
in this rap game swearin they rough
tattooed up and now them niggas swearin they pac
stop that and watch your back we aint forgot bout ya
these glocks hot and when shot itll bring the bitch up out ya
its me kastro with the goattee walkin like a og
‘cause all these fag motherfuckers owe me
i pray to thug lords like them motherfuckers holy
frontline soldier til the heavens call me
i go all out and if you real you real
feel what im talkin bout ‘cause this game is ill
i live it forbidden fruit shoot til they feel it
livin proof pac breed niggas they cant deal with
holla back right back and watch your mouth
or get blood in it what we goin all out nigga
hook edi
we goin all out bomb first til they fall out
take them the war route without a doubt
ball which means we all ride if its on
each nigga handle your own bring it on strong
if you got bills to pay nigga go all out
bustas playin with your papes better go all out
tryna see the next day nigga go all out
obstacles in your way you better go all out

outro edi
fool you better go all out
keep goin all out
all my niggas goin all out
without a muthafuckin doubt
