you make me feel out of my element
like im walking on broken glass
like my world spinnin in slow motion
and youre movin too fast

chorus
were you right was i wrong
were you weak was i strong
yeah both of us broken
caught in a moment
we lived and we loved
and we hurt and we jumped yeah
but the planets all aligned when you looked into my eyes
and just like that the chemicals react
the chemicals react

verse 2
you make me feel out of my element
like im drifting out to the sea
like the tides pulling me in deeper
makin it harder to breath
we cannot deny how we feel inside
we cannot deny

chorus
were you right was i wrong
were you weak was i strong
yeah both of us broken
caught in a moment
we lived and we loved
and we hurt and we jumped yeah
but the planets all aligned when you looked into my eyes
and just like that the chemicals react
