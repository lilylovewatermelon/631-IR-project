shhhhhhhh
this song is called purity

alright on the count of four
i want to see everyone of you fucking jumping
one two three now now now now now

maze psychopathic daze i create this waste
back away from tangents on the verge of drastic ways
cant escape this place i deny your face
sweat gets in my eyes i think im slowly dying
put me in a homemade cellar
put me in a hole for shelter
someone hear me please all i see is hate
i can hardly breathe and i can hardly take it
hands on my face overbearing i cant get out
hands on my face overbearing i cant
lost run at my own cost fearing laughter scoffed
running from the rush detached from such and such
bleak all around me weak listening incomplete
i am not a dog but im the one youre dogging
i am in a buried kennel
i have never felt so final
someone find me please losing all reserve
i am fucking gone i think im fucking dying
hands on my face overbearing i cant get out
hands on my face overbearing i cant
you all stare but youll never see theres something inside me
you all stare but youll never see theres something inside me
you all stare but youll never see theres something inside me
you all stare but youll never see theres something in you i despise
cut me show me enter
i am willing and able and never any danger to myself
knowledge of my pain knowledge of my pain
or was my tolerance a phase empathy out of my way
i cant die i cant die
i cant die i cant die
you all stare but youll never see theres something inside me
you all stare but youll never see theres something inside me
you all stare but youll never see theres something inside me
you all stare but youll never see theres something in you i despise
despise despise
purity purity purity purity
purity purity purity purity
have you ever seen god
have you ever seen god
have you ever seen god
