verse
i just seen lil mama instagram and she flexin
dont care about your puppy just that ass and them breastses
oh girl you a model damn i never woulda guessed it
and if you tryna throw out all them vibes ima catch em
the lifestyle we live is just too dangerous
paranoid since theyve been leakin my shit
wonder if itll come out on the web
and i cant help all these bitches on my dick
takin a photo and postin that shit
comin home late and i crawl into bed
she always be askin me where have you been
whoa

prechorus
the world has gone to shit and we all know that

well fuck the internet and you can quote that whoa
