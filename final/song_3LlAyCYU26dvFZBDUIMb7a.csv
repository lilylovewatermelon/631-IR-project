when the days are cold and the cards all fold
and the saints we see are all made of gold
when your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
are the worst of all and the bloods run stale

prechorus
i wanna hide the truth i wanna shelter you
but with the beast inside theres nowhere we can hide
no matter what we breed we still are made of greed
this is my kingdom come this is my kingdom come

chorus
when you feel my heat look into my eyes
its where my demons hide its where my demons hide
dont get too close its dark inside
its where my demons hide its where my demons hide

verse 2
at the curtains call its the last of all
when the lights fade out all the sinners crawl
so they dug your grave and the masquerade
will come calling out at the mess youve made

prechorus
dont wanna let you down but i am hellbound
though this is all for you dont wanna hide the truth
no matter what we breed we still are made of greed
this is my kingdom come this is my kingdom come

when you feel my heat look into my eyes
its where my demons hide its where my demons hide
dont get too close its dark inside
its where my demons hide its where my demons hide

bridge
they say its what you make i say its up to fate
its woven in my soul i need to let you go
your eyes they shine so bright i wanna save that light
i cant escape this now unless you show me how

chorus
when you feel my heat look into my eyes
its where my demons hide its where my demons hide
dont get too close its dark inside
its where my demons hide its where my demons hide401embed"
