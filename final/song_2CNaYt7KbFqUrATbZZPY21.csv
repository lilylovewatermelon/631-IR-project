intro
yeah yeah can you turn up my headphones
yeah yeah yeah
this music go with my funeral yeah yeah
music go with my funeral ahem yeah i said

verse 1
said i was raised inside this gritty city ridin through you probably miss me
my bicycle fell i hit the road the mailman almost hit me
all these sins were more than shitty i just pray the lord forgive me
doin drugs is just a war with boredom but they sure to get me
my sidebitch is sort of pretty but she got enormous titties
know im worth a fortune she just want a brand new porsche or bentley
had a few abortions unfortunately i forced them
lord knows ill turn a child to an orphan when im tourin
im more than what i think of myself i really have to be
sit at home and drink by myself my thoughts harassin me
actually as a matter of fact she aint gettin back to me
a shame that my tragedy my masterpiece yeah
trapped inside these dreams of mine
just tryna get some peace of mind yeah
ive been trapped inside these dreams of mine
so youll never get a piece of mind

verse 2
see we swallowed in this web of lies never try to exercise
you used to be a fantasy but now i guess its televised
i heard the legends never die oh this lonely hell of mine
there never was a better time to better myself
forever i melt and float away like waves in the ocean
starin inside of heavens eyes the gates will never open
im smokin on this field of hope waitin til my deal gets closed
i keep gettin hotter but all i seem to feel is cold
twentytwo dont feel so old but i think im eightytwo
you mean to tell me god took seven days and all he made was you
im out here with the kangaroos makin danger break the rules
celebrate my date of birth with acid get the days confused
happiness i take from you searchin for the naked truth
im not awake im in a lake ill swim away with you
bitch check out the butterfly
if you the truth then what the fuck am i
yeah

party like its the last last day day
of your life of your life yeah
