verse 1
since the prehistoric ages and the days of ancient greece
right down through the middle ages
planet earth kept going through changes
and then no renaissance came came
and times continued to change change
nothing stayed the same but there were always renegades
like chief sitting bull tom paine
dr martin luther king malcolm x
they were renegades of their time and age
so many renegades

were teachers of the funk and not of empty popping
were blessed with the force and the sight of electronics

to take a man to the dance floor
