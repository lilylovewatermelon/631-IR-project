i know it must be just your way
keep me on my knees and beggin
i aint got time for the games you play

well your actions speak so damn loud darlin
you shake your ass on saturdays
monday hits you without warnin
find yourself outside my place

dont waste your time cryin
dont turn around and shout
take your things and go this time
dont let the door hit you on your way out

weve tried and tried but nothins different
you cant have your cake and eat it too
i gave up on this disasterpiece honey
im done with us im done with you

dont waste your time cryin
dont turn around and shout
take your things and go this time
dont let the door hit you on your way out
on your way out

i know it must be just your way

i aint got time for the games you play
