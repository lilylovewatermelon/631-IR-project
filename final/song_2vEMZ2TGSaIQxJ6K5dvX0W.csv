an old pickup truck means youre down on your luck
anymore
and boots and straw hats are just a thing of the past
anymore
and ever since waylon i cant find no one
to buy into sad country songs
now tell me whos gonna ride us away
when the last cowboys gone

verse 2
is there a place i can find any three quarter time
anymore
is there a dirty jukebox that spins on a dime
anymore
they changed all the words
and the cowgirls they all sing along
but tell me whos gonna ride them away
when the last cowboy is gone

interlude

verse 3
if john wayne gene and roy are now just some cowboys
that yesterday stampeded on
then tell me whos gonna ride us away whos gonna do it that way
does everything good have to change til the last cowboy is goneyou might also likeembed"
