i know youre thinking
that you got me all figured out
a music man like me aint ever going to settle down
and youre just waiting around for the day
that youre convinced aint ever gonna come
and just the thought of wedding bells
would make me want to run away
well all i can say

chorus
is dont believe everything you think
baby i might just have a ring in my pocket right now
so settle on down girl
reel that wild imagination in
baby come on back to me again
yeah oh the minds a funny thing
dont believe everything you think

verse 2
everytime another pretty girl comes walking by
i see your wheels turning
the way you watch my eyes girl i dont know why
you let it cross your mind that i aint crazy over you
and i dont want all the very same things you do
babe all im going to say
see lee brice liveget tickets as low as 88you might also likechorus
is dont believe everything you think
baby i might just have a ring in my pocket right now
so settle on down girl
reel that wild imagination in
baby come on back to me again
yeah the minds a funny thing
dont believe everything you think

bridge
girl you need to get on out of your head
and into your heart instead
like i said
chorus
dont believe everything you think
baby i might just have a ring in my pocket right now
so settle on down girl
reel that wild imagination back in
baby come on back to me again
yeah the minds a funny thing
dont believe everything you think
