straighten my sweater fix my spine
step up in line im ordering food high
and i dont know why
im so nervous i wont make it
cause thats my favorite waitress
those big brown eyes
i dont know what i ordered
but youre smiling like i cant afford it
ooh

addicted to ted talks
waiting for lift off
but i dont know it if its doing much
cause i just lost my mind
in the fluorescent lights of my life
in my mind a river running free like rapids

chorus
but julia
fix me a blue sky in a warm sun
and ill be back now
julia
how long how long till im all gone
cause here i am
see mt joy liveget tickets as low as 35you might also likeinterlude
just stumbling down
elysian fields
the spanish moss
and that southern feel
the silver moonlight in the trees
and the devils in my bloodstream
dont say you loved the old me

stumbling down elysian fields
your vision coming clear
that i dont know where home is
and the doors wide open

julia
how long how long how long oh lord oh lord
julia
how long how long till its all gone
how long how long
cause you deserve a man to lead you in
but here i am just stumbling down elysian fields againembed"
