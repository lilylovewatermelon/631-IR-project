when i read your face its like a screen door
i can see right through your hearts a window
why you gotta treat me like the bimbo
who sticks it out when you dont care anymore

prechorus 1
you make it so easy
youre sweet like a reeses pieces
but i promise if you leave me youll be crawling on your knees
so if you go its a joke

chorus
if you drive away
hope you get a flat tire get stranded
if its goodbye today
know youre leaving here emptyhanded
cause ive got my own life and youre just a punch line
if you go youre a joke
but i forgot to laugh

verse 2
you dont like it when i check your iphone
i dont even get my own ringtone
when youre heading out with all your best bros
you dont wanna tell me where you guys go
you might also likeprechorus 2
you say that im needy
like a kid needs reeses pieces
but i promise if you leave me youll be running back to me at my door
what a joke

chorus
if you drive away
hope you get a flat tire get stranded
if its goodbye today
know youre leaving here emptyhanded
cause ive got my own life and youre just a punch line
if you go youre a joke
but i forgot to laugh

bridge
so if youre saying peace like youre so over me
trying to sting like a bee then i gotta laugh
youre more like a ducky or a cute little bunny
think that youre funny i forgot to laugh
laugh

breakdown
like a diamond in a mountain of coal
im the girl the guys cant find anymore
hey yeah
chorus
if you drive away
hope you get a flat tire get stranded
if its goodbye today goodbye
know youre leaving here emptyhanded
cause ive got my own life and youre just a punch line oh oh
if you go go youre a joke
i forgot to laugh
if you drive away if you drive away
hope you get a flat tire get stranded
if its goodbye today goodbye
know youre leaving here emptyhanded
cause ive got my own life and youre just a punch line
if you go go youre a joke youre a joke
but i forgot to laugh
