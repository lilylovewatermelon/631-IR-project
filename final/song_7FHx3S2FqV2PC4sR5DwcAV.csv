youre the only girl that i have ever wanted
every other girl is trying to be you
my mama says that i should write you letters
but i think youre with other dudes

take my hand youll like it
you dont even have to call
yes ive had some alcohol im sorry
take my hand
you dont even have to call
youre somewhere out there after all
