lips meet teeth and tongue
my heart skips eight beats at once
if we were meant to be we would have been by now
see what you wanna see but all i see is him right now

chorus
ill sit and watch your car burn
with the fire that you started in me
but you never came back to ask it out
go ahead and watch my heart burn
with the fire that you started in me
but ill never let you back to put it out

verse 2
your love feels so fake
and my demands arent high to make
if i could get to sleep i would have slept by now
your lies will never keep i think you need to blow em out

chorus
ill sit and watch your car burn
with the fire that you started in me
but you never came back to ask it out
go ahead and watch my heart burn
with the fire that you started in me
but ill never let you back to put it out
you might also likebridge
when you call my name
do you think ill come runnin
you never did the same
so good at givin me nothin
when you close your eyes do you picture me
when you fantasize am i your fantasy
now you know
now im free

chorus
ill sit and watch your car burn
with the fire that you started in me
but you never came back to ask it out
watch my heart burn
with the fire that you started in me
but ill never let you back to put it out

outro
ooh never let you back
let you back let you back
never gonna let you back
let you back72embed"
