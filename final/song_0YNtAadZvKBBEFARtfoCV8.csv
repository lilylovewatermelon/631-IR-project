if i dont have you with me im alone
you know i never know which way to go
i think i need you with me for alltime
when i need new direction for my mind
you listen to my lectures on the phone
you help me find the treasure in the hole
youll tell me if im acting like a fool
i know that youre not something to lose now

chorus
ive got something to confess
i keep you in my pocket to use
youre my only compass
i might get lost without you

verse 2
could you tell me where to go
youre always there to help me when im down
im lucky youve been keeping me around
youre the star i look for every night
when its dark youll stick right by my side

chorus
ive got something to confess
i keep you in my pocket to use i keep you in my pocket
youre my only compass yeah
i might get lost without you
you might also likebridge
like a magnet
hard to imagine ever changing
anything changing my way
baby like a magnet
cant help that im attracted to you i am
could you keep on guiding me
please

extended chorus
ive got something to confess
i keep you in my pocket to use
youre my only compass
i might get lost without you
i might get lost without you
ive got something to confess
i might get lost without you
youre my only compass
i might get lost without you46embed"
