if youve got bills that you cant pay
if you need cash like yesterday
if youve got junk just laying around
no credit check just bring it on down

chorus
at the pawn shop
get your guns and guitars in one stop
whatever it is it wont cost a lot
living on the cheap
get your vinyl records and some dvds
at the pawn shop
get your jewels and your tools in one spot
it dont matter if the goods are hot
if theyre yours or not
buy anything you want
sell everything you got
at the pawn shop

verse 2
across the street from the texaco
is a neon sign saying we buy gold
one mans pain is another mans pleasure
one mans trash is another mans treasure

at the pawn shop
get your guns and guitars in one stop
whatever it is it wont cost a lot
living on the cheap
get your vinyl records and some dvds
at the pawn shop
get your jewels and your tools in one spot
it dont matter if the goods are hot
if theyre yours or not
buy anything you want
sell everything you got
at the pawn shop

get your girl the dress get a vhs
a whole mess of tools and a secondhand suit
get some picture frames nintendo games
buy a cheap gold necklace with a strangers name

chorus
at the pawn shop
get your guns and guitars in one stop
whatever it is it wont cost a lot
living on the cheap
get your vinyl records and some dvds
at the pawn shop
get your jewels and your tools in one spot
it dont matter if the goods are hot
if theyre yours or not
buy anything you want
sell everything you got
at the pawn shop
