chorus lloyd
aint nothin but the street life
thats money cars and hoes
its the only life i chose street life
aint nothin but the street life
they love they way i shine
this world is mine its all mine

verse 1 rick ross
up early in the mornin got gold in my eye
got a 45 thatll leave a hole in the sky
sittin at this table why i take a soul for a guy
music and the street life thats a whole nother side
hoes used to call me small time
my clothes aint know what to call mine
no logos or no tags in it
no polos til i started baggin it
way before my first key
my nigga e showed me how to parlay a z good lookin nigga
i know my mama pullin overtime
pocket full of dimes so im out here pullin mine

verse 2 rick ross
you cant close shop not on my block
im 247 like ihop
came from the bottom to the skybox
now a penthouse you can call me hitop
hop up in the 4040 got bout forty on me
fifty grand in a band ima roll it homie
breitling cost bout another dub
ten grand for the pound of the bubble bud
twenty birds in a room down in atlanta
i caught a bird but the birds cant buy a camper
just an example by an extrapper
dress the coupe in the shoes now thats dapper

chorus lloyd
aint nothin but the street life
thats money cars and hoes

aint nothin but the street life
they love they way i shine
this world is mine all mine
verse 3 rick ross
street life sellin dope fuckin hoes
big b smoke comin out a nigga nose
candy paintin on the corner sellin everythin
im on the move i aint called mama in a couple days
this life and nothin will ever change that
i love the game and well never give the game back
we lost a lotta good niggas in the game
but in the game all the good niggas get a name
i got a name everybody dont die the same
like all dope dont fly the same
miyayo boy i buy them thangs
its like the people want me to come and fly the plane

chorus lloyd
aint nothin but the street life
thats money cars and hoes
its the only life i chose street life
aint nothin but the street life
they love they way i shine
this world is mine all mine

outro lloyd
aint nothin but the street life
thats money cars and hoes
its the only life i chose street life
aint nothin but the street life
they love they way i shine
this world is mine all mine4embed"
