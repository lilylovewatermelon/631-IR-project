calling out my name
yeah your makeup was a mess
and your hair was covered in rain

well the record played our favorite song
we danced the night away
yeah the record played our favorite song
and we drank the night away

and lover of mine slow down your pace
cause in the morning youll be getting right back to it
and lay down with me come back to bed
cause ill be here waiting for you to put on that dress
and lover of mine and im standing in line
to ask for your hand i just pray that its mine

and ive been trying just to keep you round
but youve got big plans
and if you ever find yourself on this side of town
just know youve got a place to sleep
just know youve got a place to sleep
just know that youll be safe with me
oh just know that i will always be there for you
just know youve got a place to sleep
