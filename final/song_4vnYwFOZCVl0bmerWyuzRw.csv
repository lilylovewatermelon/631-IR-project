so the story begins

verse 1
city dweller successful fella
thought to himself oops ive got a lot of money lot of money
caught in a rat race terminally
im a professional cynic but my hearts not in it
im paying the price of living life at the limit to the limit
caught up in the centurys anxiety
yes it preys on him preys on him
hes getting thin getting thin
try the simple life

chorus
he lives in a house
a very big house in the country
watching afternoon repeats
and the food he eats in the country
he takes all manner of pills
and piles up analyst bills in the country
oh its like an animal farm
thats the rural charm in the country

verse 2
hes got morning glory and lifes a different story
everythings going jackanory jackanory
touched with his own mortality
hes reading balzac and knocking back prozac
its a helping hand that makes you feel wonderfully bland
close your eyes try it
oh its a centurys remedy
for the faint at heart faint at heart
a new start new start
try the simple life

he lives in a house
a very big house in the country
blow blow me out i am so sad i dont know why
hes got a fog in his chest
so he needs a lot of rest in the country
he doesnt drink smoke laugh
takes herbal baths in the country
blow blow me out i am so sad i dont know why
but youll come to no harm
on the animal farm in the country
in the country in the country in the country

chorus
oh he lives in a house
a very big house in the country
blow blow me out i am so sad i dont know why
watching afternoon repeats
and the food he eats in the country
