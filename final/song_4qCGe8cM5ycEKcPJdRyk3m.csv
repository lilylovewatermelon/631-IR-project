somewhere theres a stolen halo
i use to watch her wear it well
everything would shine
wherever she would go
but looking at her now youd never tell

verse 2
someone ran away with her innocence
a memory she cant get out of her head
and i can only imagine
what shes feelin when shes prayin
kneeling at the edge of her bed

chorus
and she says take me away
then take me farther
surround me now
and hold hold hold me
like holy water
holy water

verse 3
she wants someone to call her angel
someone to put the light back in her eyes
shes lookin through the faces
and unfamiliar places
she needs someone to hear her when she cries

and she says take me away
then take me farther
surround me now
and hold hold hold me
like holy water
holy water

bridge
she just needs a little help
to wash away the pain shes felt
she wants to feel the healin hands
of someone who understands

chorus
and she says take me away
then take me farther
surround me now
and hold hold hold me

chorus
and she says take me away
then take me farther
surround me now
and hold hold hold me
like holy water

like holy water
like holy water
like holy waterembed"
