oh my gosh i did it again

verse 1 jesy leighanne
i dont even know how i did that
need a round of applause
just like cream to a kitty cat
lining up at the door
maybe its the way i work it
my beach bring the boys to the shore
maybe its the way i flirt that they get hurt
they just dont learn

prechorus jade
i dont even know
why they fall like dominoes

chorus jade  leighanne

why they always fall for
oh my gosh i did it again
he said i broke his heart it keeps happenin
i dont know why they always fall for me
why they always fall for
