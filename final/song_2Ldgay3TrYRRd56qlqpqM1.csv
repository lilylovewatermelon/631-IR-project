as i walk along these streets
i see a man that walks alone
distant echo of peoples feet
he has no place to call his own
a shot rings out from a roof overhead
a crackhead asks for change nearby
an old man lies in an alleyway dead
a little girl lost just stands there and cries

chorus
what would you do what would you do
if it was you if it was you
would you take everything
for granted like you do

verse 2
a boy just 13 on the corner for sale
swallows his pride for another hit
overpopulation theres no room in jail
and most of you dont give a shit
that your daughters are porno stars
and your sons sell death to kids
so lost in your little worlds
your little worlds youll never fix
see staind liveget tickets as low as 41you might also likechorus
what would you do what would you do
if it was you if it was you
would you take everything
for granted like you do

bridge
you turn away
you turn away
you turn away
you turn away

verse 3
as i walk along the streets
soaking up the acid rain
underneath the taxicabs
i hear the streets cry out in vain

chorus
what would you do what would you do
if it was you if it was you
would you take everything
for granted like you do

chorus
what would you do what would you do
if it was you if it was you
would you take everything
for granted like you do1embed"
