i got a short attention span
cant sit around couch potato land
i wanna do all kinds of stuff
talking about its not enough oh
i wanna go to the extreme
i wanna stretch my limousine
i wanna take it way off road
go where im not supposed to go

prechorus
life is music play it louder
life is music play it louder

chorus
if youre gonna jump then jump far
fly like a sky diver
if youre gonna be a singer then you better be a rockstar
if youre gonna be a driver then you better drive a race car
cause im looking for a guard dog not buying a chihuahua

verse 2
