its summertime
and i can understand if you still feel sad
its summertime
although its hard to see its true possibilities
when you look inside all youll see
when you look inside all youll see is a selfreflected inner sadness
look outside i know that youll recognize its summertime
look outside i know that youll recognize its summertimesee the flaming lips liveget tickets as low as 87you might also likeembed"
