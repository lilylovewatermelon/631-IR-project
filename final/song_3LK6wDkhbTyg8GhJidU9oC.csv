hey buddies that i grew up with
all straightlaced and married up now
you aint foolin me wasnt long ago
we tore the roof off that one red light town
and hey darlin sippin that red wine
all classy kicked back on the couch
you smile and i see ya shootin tequila
us shuttin them college bars down

chorus
and no matter how much time goes by
and no matter how much we grow up
for worse or for better from now til forever
ill always remember you young

verse 2
and hey babies crawlin’ on the carpet
no you won’t be that little for long
one day you’ll move away but you’re still gonna stay
this innocent after you’re gone

chorus
cause no matter how much time goes by
and no matter how much you grow up
for worse or for better from now til forever
ill always remember you young

shameless and painless and perfect and ageless
forgives all the wrong that we did
