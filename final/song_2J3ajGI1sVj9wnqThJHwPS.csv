i’ve got a godshaped hole that’s infected
and i’m petrified of being alone now
its pathetic i know

prechorus
and i tossed and i turn in my bed
its just like i lost my head lost my head

chorus
and if i believe you
will that make it stop
if i told you i need you
is that what you want
and im broken and bleeding
and begging for help
theres no use singing a song
and im asking you jesus show yourself

verse 2
i thought i’d met you once or twice
but that was just because the dabs were nice and opening up my mind
showing me consciousness is primary in the universe
and i had a revelation
ill be your child if you insist
i mean if it was you that made my body
you probably shouldnt have made me atheist
but oh i’m a lesbian kiss
im an evangelist
and if you dont want to go to hell then miss you better start selling this

and if i believe you

and im broken and bleeding
and begging for help
