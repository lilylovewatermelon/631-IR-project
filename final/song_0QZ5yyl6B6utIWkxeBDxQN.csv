verse 1
i am not the only traveler
who has not repaid his debt
ive been searching for a trail to follow again
take me back to the night we met
and then i can tell myself
what the hell im supposed to do
and then i can tell myself
not to ride along with you

chorus
i had all and then most of you
some and now none of you
take me back to the night we met
i dont know what im supposed to do
haunted by the ghost of you
oh take me back to the night we met

verse 2
when the night was full of terrors
and your eyes were filled with tears
when you had not touched me yet
oh take me back to the night we met

some and now none of you

i dont know what im supposed to do
haunted by the ghost of you
take me back to the night we met120embed"
