dead on the inside

verse 1
raised by wolves in sheeps clothes that abandoned me
but taught me to get up when i fall to my knees
man makes monster monster kills man
taking your crowns always been part of the plan
if you werent so stuck in your own head
youd be where i am now instead

prechorus
nobodys gonna hear you
when youre calling for help when youre calling for help
nobodys gonna hear you
cause the sound of my screams are gonna drown you out
drown you out

chorus
ive learned a lot but it took me too long
to find out who i am and to prove you wrong
how can you live before you die
when youre already dead on the inside
dead on the inside
dead on the inside

if you want an enemy ill be the last one that you ever meet
but i can tell you now that you dont stand a goddamn chance against me

prechorus
nobodys gonna hear you
when youre calling for help when youre calling for help
nobodys gonna hear you
cause the sound of my screams are gonna drown you out

chorus
ive learned a lot but it took me too long
to find out who i am and to prove you wrong
how can you live before you die
when youre already dead on the inside

bridge
fuck that fuck this
if youre gonna burn a bridge
you better hold your breath and learn to swim
fuck that fuck this
if youre gonna burn a bridge
you better hold your breath and learn to swim

chorus
ive learned a lot but it took me too long
to find out who i am and to prove you wrong
how can you live before you die
when youre already dead on the inside
ive learned a lot but it took me too long
to find out who i am and to prove you wrong
how can you live before you die
when youre already dead on the inside
dead on the inside
