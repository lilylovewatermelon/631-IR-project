i dont really wanna go there with you
we picking fights like it’s fortnite
i dont wanna go there with you
lets end the night on a good time
i can find a better way to be all in your face
a better way to scream your name baby
i would rather go there with you
go there with you

verse
let’s put them arguments on layaway layaway
all i wanna do is lay away
im tryna get laid today
make up quicker than some minute maid
let it fade to gray
gotta give it time like cabernet
its the player way

prechorus
out of all of the things we could do
id rather not throw off the mood
can we switch up the page and keep it cool
so neither one of us lose

chorus
cause i dont really wanna go there with you
we picking fights like its fortnite
i dont wanna go there with you
let’s end the night on a good time
i can find a better way to be all in your face
a better way to scream your name baby
i would rather go there with you
go there with you

chorus
’cause i dont really wanna go there with you
we picking fights like it’s fortnite

lets end the night on a good time
i can find a better way to be all in your face
a better way to scream your name baby
i would rather go there with you
go there with you
