its not time to make a change
just relax and take it easy
youre still young thats your fault
theres so much you have to know
find a girl settle down
if you want you can marry
look at me i am old but im happy
i was once like you are now
and i know that its not easy
to be calm when youve found something going on
but take your time think a lot
why think of everything youve got
for you will still be here tomorrow but your dreams may not

verse 2 johnny cash and fiona apple
how can i try to explain
when i do he turns away again
its always been the same the same old story
from the moment i could talk
i was ordered to listen
theres a way and i know that i have to go away
i know i have to go

verse 3 johnny cash
its not time to make a change
just sit down take it slowly
youre still young thats your fault
theres so much you have to go through
find a girl settle down
if you want you can marry
look at me i am old but im happy

all the times that i cried
keeping all the things i knew inside
its hard but its harder to ignore it
if they were right id agree
but its them you know not me
now theres a way and i know that i have to go away
i know i have to goembed"
