we can go around club hopping
tell you all i want to do is drop in
have a drink and catch a good band
couple songs and hey were gone again
act like thats all were doing the truth is

chorus
i just want to show you off
drive em all crazy watch all the boys hate me
is that so wrong come on
i just want the world to see how lucky i am
its a fine girl damn be all i ever saw
i just want to show you off

verse 2
maybe take a ride down broadway
all the dodges and the fords and the chevrolets
slow rolling looking over and
girl youve got that super cab glowing
roll down that tinted window there you go

chorus
i just want to show you off
drive em all crazy watch all the boys hate me
is that so wrong come on
i just want the world to see how lucky i am
its a fine girl damn
be all i ever saw i just want to show you off

chorus
i just want to show you off
drive em all crazy watch all the boys hate me
is that so wrong come on
i just want the world to see how lucky i am
its a fine girl damn be all i ever saw
i just want to show you off
