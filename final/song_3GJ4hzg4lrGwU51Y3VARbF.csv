you say youll be down in five
the smell of your perfume is floating down the stairs
youre fixing up your hair like you do
i know that ill be a mess
the second that i see you
you wont be surprised
it happens every time
its nothin new

prechorus
its always on a night like tonight
i thank god you can read my mind
cause when you look at me with those eyes

chorus
im speechless
starin at you standin there in that dress
what its doin to me aint a secret
cause watching you is all that i can do
and im speechless
you already know that youre my weakness
after all this time im just as nervous
every time you walk into the room
im speechless

it started when you said hello
just did something to me
and ive been in a daze
ever since the day that we met
you take the breath out of my lungs
cant even fight it
and all of the words out of my mouth without even tryin

chorus
and im speechless
starin at you standin there in that dress
what its doin to me aint a secret
cause watching you is all that i can do
and im speechless
you already know that youre my weakness
after all this time im just as nervous
every time you walk into the room
im speechless

cause when you look at me with those eyes
chorus
