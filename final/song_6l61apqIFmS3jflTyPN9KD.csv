oh my god
its happenin again
why does this keep happenin
im losin my mind
i gotta find somebody to talk to
i cant stop

you think you can catch keyser soze
you think a guy like that comes this close to getting caught
and sticks his head out
if he comes up for anything itll be to get rid of me
after that my guess is youll never hear from me again

chorus x2
sometimes i think im losin it im losin it im losin it
aint no pill aint no cure for it im losin it im losin it
aint nothin i can do for it im losin it im losin it
everyday my mind is provin it im losin it im losin it

verse lord infamous
i cant focus i cannot figure this i thinks its hopeless
medicine man fill my prescription give me a stronger dose
i went to the reverend father he talked to me about god
but the praying did not stop soze from acting very odd
a black heart that gets soft im smelling corpses rot
aint enough room in my backyard for another burial plot
i love doom
im keeping candles lit like voodoo in my bedroom
i keep six bitches around the bedpost tortured in a sex room
satan sings a lullaby in my ears every night
its a song of suffering sin and a motherfucking fright it goes
keyser soze bring the souls
bring me babies men women and animals
my victory over the almighty is very vital
cut 6s in they foreheads and burn the bibles
and im snapping and body snatching
triple six rapping if the world shall end
i will be the one that makes it happen

sometimes i think im losin it im losin it im losin it
aint no pill aint no cure for it im losin it im losin it
aint nothin i can do for it im losin it im losin it
everyday my mind is provin it im losin it im losin itembed"
