if you wouldve blinked then i wouldve
looked away at the first glance
if you tasted poison you couldve
spit me out at the first chance
and if i was some paint did it splatter
on a promising grown man
and if i was a child did it matter
if you got to wash your hands

prechorus
ooh all i used to do was pray
wouldve couldve shouldve
if youd never looked my way

chorus
i wouldve stayed on my knees
and i damn sure never wouldve danced with the devil
at nineteen
and the gods honest truth is that the pain was heaven
and now that im grown im scared of ghosts
memories feel like weapons
and now that i know i wish youd left me wondering

verse 2
if you never touched me i wouldve
gone along with the righteous
if i never blushed then they couldve
never whispered about this
and if you never saved me from boredom
i couldve gone on as i was
but lord you made me feel important
and then you tried to erase us

ooh youre a crisis of my faith
wouldve couldve shouldve
if id only played it safe

chorus
i wouldve stayed on my knees
and i damn sure never wouldve danced with the devil
at nineteen
and the gods honest truth is that the pain was heaven
and now that im grown im scared of ghosts
memories feel like weapons
and now that i know i wish youd left me wondering

bridge
god rest my soul
i miss who i used to be
the tomb wont close
stained glass windows in my mind
i regret you all the time
i cant let this go
i fight with you in my sleep
the wound wont close
i keep on waiting for a sign
i regret you all the time
verse 3
if claritys in death then why wont this die
years of tearing down our banners you and i
living for the thrill of hitting you where it hurts
give me back my girlhood it was mine first

chorus
and i damn sure never wouldve danced with the devil
at nineteen
and the gods honest truth is that the pain was heaven
and now that im grown im scared of ghosts
memories feel like weapons
and now that i know i wish youd left me wondering

outro
god rest my soul
i miss who i used to be
the tomb wont close
stained glass windows in my mind
i regret you all the time
i cant let this go
i fight with you in my sleep
the wound wont close
i keep on waiting for a sign
i regret you all the time
oh god rest my soul
i miss who i used to be
the tomb wont close
stained glass windows in my mind
i regret you all the time
i cant let this go
i fight with you in my sleep
the wound wont close
i keep on waiting for a sign
i regret you all the time28embed"
