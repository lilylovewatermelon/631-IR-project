yeah is that bounce right here
time to move on time to be strong

someone who truly understands
how to treat a man
this is what i need

verse 1 diddy  ginuwine
girl you made me believe again
if you happy then be with him
go head mami breathe again go head mami breathe again
dont stop now straight to the top now
go head mami make it hot now
i need me a love thats gon make my heart stop now
and what i need is simple five foot five with dimples
potential wife credentials
know about the life im into life i been through
and how i had a triflin mental
so ride with me g force fly with me
times get hard cry with me die with me
white beach sands lie with me
my advice is forget the limelight

verse 2 loon with mario winans   diddy
listen to me now what should i say now come on ma
been a whole day now i wanna lay round
and sip coladas dipped in prada
im smooth as erik estrada dipped in dollars
we out in vegas nevada bubble bath in the champagne glass
bout the size of a campaign ad
you dont know how you look to me
but if love was a crime youd be a crook to me
cause mami i done been around the world
seen a lot of places
been around your girl believe i read faces
i can tell she dont want me to prevail
but i learn my lesson watchin sean stressin
so why listen to her and start guessin
mami you aint ready to ride then start dressin
i need a girl to receive my moms blessin
confession my love no contestin
i need affection
yes i need affection lets go mario
bridge mario winans
girl what the hell is on your mind
i could be dumb but im not blind
theres something leakin in your mind
dont look too good for you and me
always getting weak
that aint what i need baby

chorus mario winans with ginuwine
is a pretty woman next to me oh please baby
to share the dreams that i believe i need a girl in my life
maybe we could start a family start a family baby
someone who truly understands
how to treat a man how to treat a man
this is what i need

verse 3 diddy
ayo the sun dont shine forever
but as long as were here then we might as well shine together
never mind the weather go somewhere and get our minds together
build a love thatll last forever
so lets stop the pain stop the rain
put stress to rest girl stop the games
name the spot mami i got the plane
roll through rough i got the range
ma i got some thangs known to put rocks in rings
pushing hundredfoot yachts and thangs
your man dont play have you ever been to sainttropez
or seen a brotha play a mandolay
girl i wanna just look in your eyes and watch the sunrise
no more lies no more tears to cry
no more reasons for leavin you i believe in
love you til the day i stop breathing
i love you girl
outro mario winans  ginuwine
this is what i need
is a pretty woman next to me
a pretty woman next to me
to share the dreams that i believe
when i wake up in the morning
maybe we could start a family
i wanna see your pretty face
someone who truly understands how to treat a man
oh yeah oh yeah
this is what i need
is a pretty woman next to me
to share the dreams that i believe
someone who truly understands how to treat a man
this is what i need baby
is a pretty woman next to me
standing next to me
to share the dreams that i believe
when i wake up in the morning
maybe we could start a family
i wanna see your pretty face baby
someone who truly understands how to treat a man
oh yeah oh yeah
this is what i need
is a pretty woman next to me13embed"
