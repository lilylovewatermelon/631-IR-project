i know youre rollin down a runway out of lax
takin off to wherever youre going next
doesnt matter that im nowhere near that jet
baby im on it
you know this memory aint gonna leave you alone
you can try to drown it out with your headphones
but it really doesnt matter what comes on
baby im on it

chorus
girl you thought i was gone when you left me
but its gonna be hard to forget me
keep tellin yourself that its over
the only over ill be is over your shoulder
i aint gonna fade away with the taillights
down with the moon baby up with the sunrise
any song any scene any ol side street
when you think youre rid of me then ill be

verse 2
on the wind in the fall when the leaves turn brown
but its still warm enough to put your windows down
every cobblestone corner in that college town
baby im on it
and when youre out at a bar with some new guy
and you end up in his arms at the end of the night
i oughta be the furthest thing from your mind
but baby im on it

girl you thought i was gone when you left me
but its gonna be hard to forget me
keep tellin yourself that its over
the only over ill be is over your shoulder
i aint gonna fade away with the taillights
down with the moon baby up with the sunrise
any song any scene any ol side street
baby im on it

chorus
girl you thought i was gone when you left me
but its gonna be hard to forget me
keep tellin yourself that its over
the only over ill be is over your shoulder
i aint gonna fade away with the taillights
down with the moon baby up with the sunrise
any song any scene any ol side street
baby im on it

outro
yeah yeah
baby im on it
any sunny summer white sand beach
any bed where you just cant fall asleep
anywhere the road youre on might lead
baby im on itembed"
