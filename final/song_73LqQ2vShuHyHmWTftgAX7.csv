verse 1 tory lanez
you know i speak no lie when im gettin high
she want me and that nigga see
sippin on patrón and hennessy
i been on the dope no lie cause i dont lie
wonderin if we finna go live
jump in the pussy and change your whole life
when i get in the nookie i spend the whole night
i been on the tea so long
shawty you dont need to tease at all
quit sellin the pussy dont want the fees at all
just relax your mind and let me ease it off ease it off
cause we done did some things to make it cold in the summer summer
when i swim in your water water
