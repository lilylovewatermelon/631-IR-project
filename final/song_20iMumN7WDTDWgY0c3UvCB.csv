a wild pack of family dogs came runnin through the yard one day
my father got his gun shot it up they ran away okay
a wild pack of family dogs came runnin through the yard
and as my own dog ran away with them
i didnt say much of anything at all
didnt say much of anything at all
didnt say much of anything at all

verse 2
a wild pack of family dogs came runnin through the yard
as my little sister played the dogs took her away
and i guess she was eaten up okay yeah she was eaten up okay
my mothers cryin blood dust now
my mothers cryin blood dust now
mothers cryin blood dust now

verse 3
my dad he quit his job today
well i guess he was fired but thats okay
and im sittin outside by my mud lake
waitin for the pack to take me away
right after i die
the dogs start floating up towards the glowing sky
now theyll receive their reward
now they will receive their reward
yeah they will receive their rewardssee modest mouse liveget tickets as low as 76you might also like2embed"
