verse 1
this aint a test fuck the rest
time to set the record straight
talk your shit behind my back
lets hear you say it to my face
ive heard the words fall out your lips
you little trendy fucking bitch
the time has come to get you some
cause i just do not give a shit

chorus
do you take me for a fool
hows it feel to be a tool
see to me youre just a cancer
motherfucker war is the answer

verse 2
as of now the end begins
i want to laugh but theres no joke
to eat with the beast and run with the wolves
on the ashes you must choke
i know its got to chap your ass
to think i just wont go away
affects me not im writing you off
ive got nothing more to say
see five finger death punch liveget tickets as low as 79you might also likechorus
do you take me for a fool
hows it feel to be a tool
to me youre just a cancer
motherfucker war is the answer

you wanna disrespect me
you little fucking punk
everything ive done to be who i am
as far as ive fucking come
ill slap you so fucking hard
itll feel like you kissed a freight train
fuck you

chorus
do you take me for a fool
hows it feel to be a tool
talk your shit behind my back
see to me youre just a cancer
the time has come to get you some
motherfucker war is the answer
