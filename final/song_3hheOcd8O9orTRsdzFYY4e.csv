theres a dusty hat up on the dash of every truck you meet
country roads and fenceposts as far as you can see
billboard sign says rodeo june eleven through thirteen
when you get to town just look around for the rusty nail cafe
where the old hands sip their coffee and relive their glory days
a modern day charlie russell scene
where cowboys are king

chorus
i get back there every now and then
turn a few steers in the roping pen
just a couple of days and im gone again
chasin this old six string
oh but i sure love to be
where cowboys are king

verse 2
runs the horses down turn em out head over to the bar
therell be george strait on the jukebox and ill bet the chances are
therell be some cowgirls in wellworn jeans
where cowboys are king

chorus
i get back there every now and then
turn a few steers in the roping pen
just a couple of days and im gone again
chasin this old six string
oh but i sure love to be
where cowboys are king
see cody johnson liveget tickets as low as 15you might also likerefrain
boys as bad as i wish i could stay
i just hope this never goes away

outro
so i can get back here every now and then
turn a few steers in the roping pen
spend a little time with some good old friends
yall make it so hard to leave
oh but i sure love to be
where cowboys are king
oh and i sure love to be
where cowboys are kingembed"
