here i lie forever
sorrow still remains
will the water pull me down
and wash it all away
come and take me over
welcome to the game
will the current drag me down
and carry me away
suddenly the light begins to fade

chorus
hopeless
im falling down
filthy
i cant wake up
i cannot hold on
i will not let go
worthless
its over now
guilty
theres no way out
i cannot hold on
i will not let go

verse 2
silent i go under
i am not afraid
i can see the daylight shine
and slowly drift away
safe to say its over
sink into the grave
there is nothing left inside
but i am wide awake
i can hear the devil call my name

hopeless
im falling down
filthy
i cant wake up
i cannot hold on
i will not let go
worthless
its over now
guilty
theres no way out
i cannot hold on
i will not let go
