i know they say if you love somebody you should set them free
but it sure is hard to do it sure is hard to do
i know they say if you dont come back again then its meant to be so they say
those words dont pull me through cause im still in love with you

prechorus
i spend each day here waitin for a miracle
but its just you and me goin through the mill climbin up a hill

chorus
this is the long goodbye
somebody tell me why
two lovers in love cant make it
just what kind of love keeps breakin a heart
no matter how hard i try
i always make you cry
come on baby its over lets face it
all thats happenin here is a long goodbye

verse 2
sometimes i ask my heart did we really give our love a chance just one more chance
but i know without a doubt we turned it inside out
and if we walked away would it make more sense
but it tears me up inside just to think we could still try

how long must we keep runnin on a carousel
goin round and round and never gettin anywhere on a wing and prayer

chorus
this is the long goodbye
somebody tell me why
two lovers in love cant make it
just what kind of love keeps breakin a heart
no matter how hard i try
i always make you cry
come on baby its over lets face it
all thats happenin here is a long goodbye

outro
long goodbye
ohoh oh
long goodbye
oh its a long goodbye its a long goodbyeembed"
