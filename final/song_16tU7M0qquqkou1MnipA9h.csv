sometimes i find myself sitting back and reminiscing
especially when i have to watch other people kissing
and i remember when you started calling me your missus
all the play fighting all the flirtatious disses
id tell you sad stories about my childhood
i dont know why i trusted you but i knew that i could
wed spend the whole weekend lying in our own dirt
i was just so happy in your boxers and your tshirt

prechorus
dreams dreams
of when we had just started things
dreams of you and me
and it seems it seems
that i cant shake those memories
i wonder if you have the same dreams too

chorus
the littlest things that take me there
i know it sounds lame but its so true
i know its not right but it seems unfair
that the things are reminding me of you
sometimes i wish we could just pretend
even if only for one weekend
so come on tell me
is this the end

drinking tea in bed watching dvds
when i discovered all your dirty grotty magazines
you take me out shopping and all wed buy is trainers
as if we ever needed anything to entertain us
the first time that you introduced me to your friends
and you could tell i was nervous so you held my hand
when i was feeling down you made that face you do
theres no one in the world who could replace you

prechorus
dreams dreams
of when we had just started things
dreams of me and you
and it seems it seems
that i cant shake those memories
i wonder if you feel the same way too

chorus
the littlest things that take me there
i know it sounds lame but its so true
i know its not right but it seems unfair
that the things are reminding me of you
sometimes i wish we could just pretend
even if only for one weekend
so come on tell me
is this the end6embed"
