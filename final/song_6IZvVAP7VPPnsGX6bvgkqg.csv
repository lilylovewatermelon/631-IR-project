loves gonna get you killed
but pride’s gonna be the death of you and you and me
and you and you and you and me
and you and you and you and me
and you and you and you and me and—

chorus steve lacy  kendrick lamar
me i wasnt taught to share but care
in another life i surely was there
me i wasnt taught to share but care
i care i care

verse 1 kendrick lamar
hellraising wheelchasing new worldly possessions
fleshmaking spiritbreaking which one would you lessen
the better part the human heart you love ’em or dissect em
happiness or flashiness how do you serve the question
see in a perfect world i would be perfect world
i dont trust people enough beyond they surface world
i dont love people enough to put my faith in man
i put my faith in these lyrics hoping i make a band
i understand i aint perfect i probably wont come around
this time i might put you down
last time i aint give a fuck i still feel the same now
my feelings might go numb youre dealing with cold thumb
i’m willing to give up a leg and arm to show empathy from
pity parties and functions of you and yours
a perfect world you probably live another 24
i can’t fake humble just cause your ass is insecure
i can’t fake humble just cause your ass is insecure

verse 2 kendrick lamar
now in a perfect world i probably wont be insensitive
cold as december but never remember what winter did
i wouldnt blame you for mistakes i made or the bed i laid
seems like i point the finger just to make a point nowadays
smiles and cold stares the temperature goes there
indigenous disposition feel like we belong here
i know the walls they can listen i wish they could talk back
the hurt becomes repetition the love almost lost that
sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
a perfect world is never perfect only filled with lies
promises are broken and more resentment come alive
race barriers make inferior of you and i
see in a perfect world ill choose faith over riches
ill choose work over bitches ill make schools out of prison
ill take all the religions and put em all in one service
just to tell em we aint shit but hes been perfect world

me i wasnt taught to share but care
in another life i surely was there
me i wasnt taught to share but care
i care i care
