i can see it in your eyes as im stumbling home
youre living with a man that you no longer know
you forgot to smile as i passed you by
now were sitting down for dinner we got nothing to say
its like im watching you slowly slipping away
from me from me

prechorus
remember when i used to make you laugh
and every joke was better than the last
tell me how to bring you back to this
maybe i just need to reminisce and work it out

chorus 1
what happened to perfect
what happened to us
we used to be worth it
we never gave up
it wasnt on purpose
but it hurts like it was
nobody deserves this
what happened to perfect

verse 2
if you left me baby where would you go
i cant imagine you ever being alone
iâ€™m a jealous man but id try to understand
so many things to say i dont know where to start
i cant pick up the pieces of a crumbling heart
so true so true

chorus 1
what happened to perfect
what happened to us
we used to be worth it

chorus 2
whats under the surface
it used to be love
would you call if you heard this
would you know it was us
it wasnt on purpose
but it hurts like it was
nobody deserves this
what happened to perfect
