its just the normal noises in here

verse 1
well it was nearly summer we sat on your roof
yeah we smoked cigarettes and we stared at the moon
and i showed you stars you never could see
it couldnt have been that easy to forget about me
baby time meant nothing anything seemed real
yeah you could kiss like fire and you made me feel
like every word you said was meant to be
but it couldnt been that easy to forget about me

chorus
baby even the losers
get lucky sometimes
even the losers
keep a little bit of pride
they get lucky sometimes

guitar solo

bridge
two cars park on the overpass
rocks hit the water like broken glass
i shoulda known right then it was too good to last
god its such a drag when youre living in the past
