you said it once before
you dont do those things you used to anymore
you say in doubt were fadin out
forgetting who we used to be

chorus
cause i will bring you down
i dont wanna miss i dont think you can handle this
youve lost what you cant find
never what you had in mind

verse 2
you take it with a smile
its so easy when youre always in denial
just in time but out of line
i cant make all the same mistakes you want me to

chorus
cause i will bring you down
i dont wanna miss i dont think you can handle this
youve lost what you cant find
never what you had in mind

guitar solo
see sum 41 liveget tickets as low as 26you might also likebridge
youre givin up you know its not what you need
and its true what youre goin through try so hard not to listen to
everything i never say

chorus
cause i will bring you down
i dont wanna miss i dont think you can handle this
cause i will bring you down
i dont wanna miss and i dont think you could handle this
youve lost what you cant find
never what you had in mind

outro
im getting over getting used to
and after all that i put you through
now i see im not the only one
never thought it would ever come to
this in fact was never what you
wanted from me or how you meant it to be
youve lost what you cant find im getting over getting used to
and after all that i put you through
now i see im not the only one
youve lost what you cant find never thought it would ever come to
this in fact was never what you
wanted from me or how you meant it to be2embed"
