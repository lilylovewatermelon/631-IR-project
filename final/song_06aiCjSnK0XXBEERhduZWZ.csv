justice league

verse 1 ti
my garage is flawless under a hundred thou aint allowed
maybach triple white like im ridin in a cloud
no denim on my seats baby you gon need a towel
ride sexy through the city see me you will be aroused
my bankroll so wellendowed
pull bitches from mia to atl in style
and in crowds catch me in tao
on the strip in vegas chillin fillin bitches faces with babies
bitch bite your tongue this just aint a mercedes
tell the atf im ridin with another threeeighty
thats my car cost—yall thought i would fall off
that was just a small loss we can have a balloff
fly to ny meet me at the waldorf
astorian architecture victorian
ridin in the past like youre drivin a delorean
hard times never heard of those
in the bach my feet kicked up gettin my dick sucked with the curtains closed
and for the record kid my final question is
how your bitch gon feel in that when you two pull up next to this

verse 3 rick ross
i came alive like a moth in the summertime ugh
japanese wheel blades all samurai
shine brighter than them bitches on the other side
time to make a blind motherfucker recognize
ammunition got the competition nonexistent
had the bubble crack but didnt have a pot to piss in
ill double that—how dare you try to knock a nigga
street scholar graduated no father figure
still tote chrome check my chromosomes
meet me halfway with things in a mobile home
money machines yeah they rrring like a mobile phone
im a 7up and need a cocacola loan
im in the hood like im james evans
cashmere handmade sweater
me and money got a vendetta
lookin back to tell the truth i couldve did better woo
parents never had a good job
now its black american express cards
outro rick ross
ugh
