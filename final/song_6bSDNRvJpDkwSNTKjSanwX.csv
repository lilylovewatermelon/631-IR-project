ive waited years
for you my dear
i’ll be alone
you you appeared
from the night my dear
like i was home

prechorus both
you said follow me deeper and down
our love cannot believe what we found
i said look what we found i said

chorus both
ooh i’m hypnotised
i will give it all for you one life
ooh you’re all mine
just a moment here with you for all time

verse 2 tyrone lindqvist  dena amy
talk speak my mind
looking for one more sign
to take me home
sleep by my side
maybe we’re lost in time
i’m not alone
