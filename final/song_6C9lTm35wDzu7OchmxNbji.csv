its caving in around me
what i thought was solid ground
i tried to look the other way
but i couldnt turn around
its okay for you to hate me
for all the things ive done
ive made a few mistakes
but im not the only one

prechorus
step away from the ledge
im coming down

chorus
i could never be what you want me to
you pull me under to save yourself save yourself
you will never see whats inside of me
i pull you under just to save myself

verse 2
was there ever any question
on how much i could take
you kept feeding me your bullshit
hoping i would break
is there anybody out there
is there anyone who cares
is there anybody listening
will they hear my final prayers

its caving in around me

its tearing me apart
