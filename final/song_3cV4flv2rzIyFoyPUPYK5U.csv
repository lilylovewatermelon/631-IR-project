here comes the pain

spoken
get your motherfucking hands in the air

verse 1
enemy show me what you wanna be
i can handle anything
even if i cant handle you
readily either way it better be
don’t you fuckin pity me
get up get off
what the hell am i sayin
i don’t know about malevolent
sure as hell decadent
i want somebody to step up step off
walls let me fall
fuck you all
get a grip dont let me slip til i drop the ball

chorus

press your face against the glass suffer
