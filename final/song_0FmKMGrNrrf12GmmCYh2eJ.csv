i been watchin this opp on a drone
pull up cockin it aim at his dome
bust a right i could never be wrong
ima fight for the love that we on
when we fuckin i never be lone
and i never go the same way home
when i slide gotta switch up the route
cant let em follow the snipe to the house

i wish i could stop thuggin for real
leave the streets without me bein killed
for so long i been goin on drills
drinkin that lean pour it straight out the seal
