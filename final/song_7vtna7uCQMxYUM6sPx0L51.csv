verse 1
some girls play the game
they all walk and talk and they dress the same
nothing new to say nothing new to say
dont they realize
its so easy to see right through their disguise
makes me wonder why

prechorus
when the whole worlds turning left
is when im going right
i need someone to let me be
just who i am inside

chorus
cause a girl like me is just a little different from all the rest
and a girl like me
never gonna settle for second best
could it be a boy like you
can give me anything if i asked him to
would take all my dreams and to make them true
show me all the reasons you oughta be with a girl like me girl like me
