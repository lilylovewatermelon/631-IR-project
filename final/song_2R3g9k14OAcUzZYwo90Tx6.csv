his father was a drinker
and his mother cried in bed
folding john waynes tshirts
when the swingset hit his head
the neighbors they adored him
for his humor and his conversation
look underneath the house there
find the few living things rotting fast in their sleep
oh the dead
twentyseven people
even more they were boys
with their cars summer jobs
oh my god
are you one of them

verse 2
he dressed up like a clown for them
with his face paint white and red
and on his best behavior
in a dark room on the bed
he kissed them all
hed kill ten thousand people
with a sleight of his hand
running far running fast to the dead
he took off all their clothes for them
he put a cloth on their lips
quiet hands quiet kiss on the mouth
you might also likeoutro
and in my best behavior
i am really just like him
look beneath the floor boards
for the secrets i have hid18embed"
