i tasted tasted love so sweet
and all of it was lost on me
bought and sold like property
sugar on my tongue
i kept falling over
i kept looking backward
i went broke believing
that the simple should be hard

chorus
all we are we are
all we are we are
and every day is a start of something beautiful

verse 2
i wasted wasted love for you
traded out for something new
well its hard to change the way you lose
if you think youve never won

chorus
cause all we are we are
all we are we are
and every day is a start of something beautiful
you might also likebridge
and in the end the words wont matter
cause in the end nothing stays the same
and in the end dreams just scatter and fall like rain

chorus
cause all we are we are
all we are we are
and every day is a start of something beautiful something real
all we are we are
all we are we are
and every day is a start of something beautiful beautifulembed"
