the only joint my mama burned was on a rural route
she parked in old man taylors woods
so she wouldnt be found out
turned off her dome light snuck off by herself
crouched down beneath that window
fired it up and gave it hell

chorus
that hang out my daddy used to hang around
we watched it all go up in smoke until it all came down
just like that the taps n stools and tables got turned
to the only joint my mama ever burned burned

verse 2
just like someone flipped a switch dad started comin home
no more eatin late cause suppers with that tavern gone
i had my suspicions till one night when we said grace
dad said forgive us our trangression
a smile lit up mamas face

chorus
like that hangout my daddy used to hang around
we watched it all go up in smoke until it all came down
just like at the taps n stools and tables got turned
to the only joint my mama ever burned
burned burned burned
see eric church liveget tickets as low as 200you might also likereverb under horn
burned burned burned burned

bridge
of all the small town barney fifes
and bloodhounds in this town
im only the one who ever found out about

chorus
that hangout my daddy used to hang around
we watched it all go up in smoke until it all came down
just like at the taps n stools and tables got turned
to the only joint my mama ever burned
burned burned burned burned
