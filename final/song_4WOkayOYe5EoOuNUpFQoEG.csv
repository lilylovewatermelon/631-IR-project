verse 2
so stuck in the mirror
start getting clearer
when i close my eyes i
i can see the sky at night
past the blue and the ozone layer
past the polluted atmosphere
nothing is more important than our connection
me and the mother
singing the universal song
calling each other
why dont we all just sing along
