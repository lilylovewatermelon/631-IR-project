youre my number one youre the one i want
and ive turned down every hand
that has beckoned me to come
youre my number one youre the one i want
and ive turned down every hand
that has beckoned me to come

prechorus
cause youre the one i got youre the one i got
so ill keep turning down the hands
that beckon me to come

chorus
though im a geyser feel it bubbling from below
hear it call hear it call hear it call to me constantly
and hear the harmony only when its harming me
its not real its not real its not real enough
outro
but i will be the one you need
the way i cant be without you
i will be the one you need
i just cant be without yousee mitski liveget tickets as low as 55you might also like24embed"
