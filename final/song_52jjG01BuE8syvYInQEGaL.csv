now i know
youve woke up to find
you were wrong
there aint no doubt
put me out
nearly made me blind

you sent me a letter brought tears to my eyes
tell me youve changed after all this time
like a stone rolling down the mountainside
its over you cant turn the tide and its

tears falling about love falling without love
tears falling about love falling without love

i was glad
to be with you
near to you
my heart cant deny
i was sad
to leave your side
stripped of pride
when you said goodbye
for every new road there must be a friend
for every broken heart there must be a mend
and the rain only lasted so long
its over the thing we had is gone and its

tears falling about love falling without love

to tell me youve changed brought tears to my eyes
say youve rearranged after all this time
like a stone rolling down the mountainside
its over you cant turn the tide and its

tears falling about love falling without love
tears falling about love falling without love

tears falling about love falling without love
tears falling about love falling without loveembed"
