guess i should have caught your call
but i just had to waste the phone forget it all
bones are trembling hands are cold
you dont know how that feels
youve got me up against the wall

verse 2 peter bjorn  john
maybe we could make this work
but i just had to leave before its getting worse
i dont know what you came here for
its almost that i wish we hadnt met at all

verse 3 peter bjorn  john
your slap just like a wakeup call
the bruises on my face dont bother me at all
bones are trembling hands are cold
its almost that i wish you had me up against the wallyou might also like2embed"
