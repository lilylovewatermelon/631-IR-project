he said lets get out of this town
drive out of the city away from the crowds
i thought heaven cant help me now
nothing lasts forever
but this is gonna take me down

prechorus
hes so tall and handsome as hell
hes so bad but he does it so well
i can see the end as it begins
my one condition is

chorus
say youll remember me
standin in a nice dress
starin at the sunset babe
red lips and rosy cheeks
say youll see me again
even if its just in your
wildest dreams ah ha
wildest dreams ah ha

verse 2
i said no one has to know what we do
his hands are in my hair his clothes are in my room
and his voice is a familiar sound
nothin lasts forever
but this is gettin good now
