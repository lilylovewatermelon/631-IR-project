shes only eighteen dont like the rolling stones
she took the short cut to being fully grown
shes got that mood ring a little sister rose
the smell of springsteen a pair of pantyhose

prechorus anthony kiedis with john frusciante
this talking picture show is leaking from a silhouette
she said “my man you know its time to get your fingers wet”
your hustles busted when you cant afford a cigarette
the last i heard from you you were screaming “handle it”

chorus anthony kiedis with john frusciante
knock the world right off its feet and straight onto its head
the book of love will long be laughing after you are dead
fascinated by the look of you and what was said
make a play for all the brightest minds and light will shed

verse 2 anthony kiedis
i heard some pfunk out on the road again
to get your head shrunk is what i recommend
its in your bloodline a perfect frankenstein
out on that lone pine im going to make you mine

prechorus anthony kiedis with john frusciante
its understood you wrapped your voodoo right around my neck
youve got some glitter on your kitty at the discotheque
i put my loving in your oven not a head to check
the last i heard from you you were screaming “resurrect”
see red hot chili peppers liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likechorus anthony kiedis with john frusciante
knock the world right off its feet and straight onto its head
the book of love will long be laughing after you are dead
fascinated by the look of you and what was said
make a play for all the brightest minds and light will shed
