your whole family’s racist
i’ve killed so many smack rappers i’m your grandpas favorite
fuckinmgkkk
nah thats an angle i cant try
you reversed racism i can’t lie
cause he dressed up as lincoln and got his chain taken by a black guy
this that white in white crime
you were the biggest cokehead in all of grind time
if that was the truth hollohan switch over to my side
what again
im just prayin this mans lucky
the only person to come cum from behind rone is sandusky
you asked ganik for more money gave him all kind of quotes
he flew me first class he made you ride the coach
he like bro thats a piece of cake thats the cheapest angle he can take
well if you don’t like rape jokes then stopped being raped
hes like be more creative next time my name wasnt in the headlines
he never gave me red wine before bed time
youre from philly  if it wasn’t sandusky it was tech9
you blew pat in a cadillac why was it filmed for
his throats still sore
we saw adam choke in choking the caddy happy gilmore
in a press conference you told head ice i suck your dick straight like that and guess what wolf it tastes like pat
rone fans we need to see you
yall need to hold this lgbtq
i mean you gave head to head and blew pat stay too
that’s gay dude
were all waiting for you to come out like your smack debut
used to be the man now you background
represent philly worse than the smack crowd

field goal flip shit i’m madden with the hit stick
fuckin up his return this the squib kick
you need pallbearers ill pick six
6 zip that’s mean i got this oat down i’m bout kick shit
pistolz with that big shit sig gripped
johnny manziel first round bust on this rich kid

get laced out and turn bitch ray finkle
this guy ain’t a motherfuckin mc
i know everything he’s bout to say against me
i am autistic i do rap about guns
i did sell furnaces door to door like a scum
and have a dumb friend named 100 bulletz that got me slapped over a cap gun
i did get jumped kshines still a chump
and shotty horroh did fuck my girl
i still killed every smack rapper in the whole fuckin world
i told the url i have a small dick i say it proudly
crowd starts shouting
i told the url i dont have a small dick i wont say it proudly
i act gangster and wear suits wrong fuck yall if you doubt me
i’m bout to sell your grandma a furnace i don’t wanna win i’m outtie
i’m 8 miles ahead of you tell them something they don’t know about me
you might also likeround 1 rone
my first battle was in 2009 shit is truly a disgrace
ive been battle rapping for 10 years someone shoot me in the face
what am i doing with my life
im fuckin fat now
plus my comebacks versus charron im doin bad wow
i mean wasnt i supposed to make a run off rap
tv shows movies dumb contracts
stand up radio 1 podcast
sold out concert waiti done all that
see i dont do it for the fame like my enemy does
ill put a bone through your cheek like an elephant tusk
and i dont do it for the cash cause my cheddar been up
oh im just doin this for the adrenaline rush
so whats up i know you been watchin me walk
on the sack sac for 10 years like vlade divac
two call outs three calls outs i said fuck it hes unstable
four call outs five call outs im gettin up from the lunch table
but first a history lesson
your name was triple c until you ever heard of me
and then you changed it to chrone two months after i hit the scene
and while that might all seem above board travis
imagine a battle rapper came out named chorganik
i would probably bother you but i always show buddy love
just clumped klumpd him with the rest never let push come to shove
but somehow you turned into this little brother to me
whod always want to compete
whod always tug at my sleeve
the bother the little toddler the fly buzzing at me
food stuck in my teeth the tag under my tee
the terrible combination of awkward and cocky
chronically sloppy sonically off beat
every single day you should curse god for your body
your cringe worthy demeanor his this tailored for the perfect take down
but the second hand awkwardness of sharing the stage with you made me want to turn the plate down
we watched you grow up from a boy you have a perverts face now
any character assassination would be a nervous breakdown
yo your eyes movin how hes quivering like its puberty that crippled him
hes a wet noodle a drenched poodle a drooping piece of licorice
from your shoulders to your arms how you move them like an idiot
if we were judging off body language bro you would be illiterate
but his karate action arms thats his true talent
throw him some melons while hes rappin hell make a fruit salad
but im not here to make an impression of you im here to make an impression on you
to prove that none of your family matters dont your uncle or auntie anti matter
im unstable im billy idol minus the stratocaster
ill put a foreigner through the rafters im the coroner for these rappers
its a champ versus a stepping stool im the former youre the latter ladder
bro you always wanted my chains well today we can fulfill that
you never have to win a title ill leave you permanently stilled champ
see i am offended at any list where your name is ranked ahead of me
i am resentful of anyone that puts you in the same breath as me
the only chance youd ever be ranked ahead of me is alphabetically so thank the letter c
its gon be agony like you were at gethsemane
you should be banned indefinitely like randy gregory
im here to get under your skin like an appendectomy or patrick beverley
bro you have the personality of a patch of celery
you shouldve been an abandoned pregnancy
you misunderstood your girls tinder bio when she said she wanted to be challenged mentally
hes been chasin me for so long its really got me in a whirlwind
its got me wonderin whos really your white whale
me or your little girlfriend
i mean he think thats whores a looker cause she look like some sorta hooker
its no wonder that he get jerseyd as soon as corey book her cory booker
but you came a long way from laura tarsi
we look back and still laugh
you used to have a fake girlfriend now your new one is real fat
but your jokes stolen
concepts stolen
wordplay stolen
and he thinks all of its fine
he cant go one battle without repurposing someone elses good idea shit probably mine
so for your raps bout sellin drugs to the bars that corey still in stealin
i might have to take a hand off since he act like corey dillon
but you said i turned my back on battle rap we need to stop the cap
youre actin like i robbed the culture with a gun and a stocking mask
ive had battle rappers on my phone suicidal im the one that they called to chat
it wasnt the king of the dot facebook group im the one talking back
i see a battle rapper down no problem i offer cash
i had them eating off my plate when you wouldnt offer scraps
gofundmes tickets payperviews no problem im droppin racks
i put my money where my mouth is whats more king of the dot than that
bro you could never match my moves either in or out the ring
they call me roney bae the price but to you ill always be the king
round 2 charron
hey man he always tellin me my hands are out of place
philly losin back 2 back this is meek mill when he battlin drake
he said im makin fruit salad but you dressed in purple put the strap in his face
man ill have this fruit on the wall alexander the grape
and you keep doin a lot of gay jokes man i dont know why yall playin
you said my girlfriend is fat how many times have i told you were not datin
so organik hit his phone up
for two years he never showed up
i’m not surprised he split that’s what atoms adams do when they blow up
but i’m not out here exposing you
you already done that
i’m not hurt you moved on from battling that’s what your supposed to do
i’m mad that once you made it you didnt put on anyone that’s close to you
see i helped carter with wild n out we trained a lot
i told ward come here if you wanna take my spot
if i had your platform do you know how many names id drop
once you get a barstool you’re supposed to start takin shots
a real king wouldve came back to start raisin his stock
youre an nfl blocker you should know when you drop the ball the game doesn’t stop
you are not one of us
who was on your number one podcast not one of us
doesn’t matter if you’re gz i’m still supportin you
go to war with you
you want me cause mtv can do more for you
the midget in joker you need a killer to open up doors for you
i have more money and still do this for fun
you’re from philly you should know where your roots started from
i got a bone to pick with him look what you have become
on god ill make a bitch outta adam genesis 221
you gotta look at me when im killing you

to go viral you’d change you’re gender like caitlyn jenner you have no shame what so ever
weve outgrown you
adams bitchmade from the rib cage we want the old you
do this pussy so bad if you were ti’s kid he’d disown you
hes like im american as shit honest abe mixed with john mccain
well i battle rap his shit
i’m bodybag mixed with shottyswave the near divorce caustic made
tom cruise moms shoes we don’t walk the same
i’m a lush intro with his nostrils glazed
im the energy of dizaster but not the braids
im three of them thangs off the brain
i’m pat stay when he got the chain
i’m the apology you forgot to make to cadalack ron when you dropped his name
i’m ph in his team homi ways
i’ve every bender multi schemed on a stage
i’m king of the dot in their beat boxing days
mixed with the six people that lost their life getting crushed by ttop on stage
and in this battle he started off with battling for a decade youre truly a disgrace
if im battling in 2021 someone shoot me in the face
youve used battle rap since day one this is where we both got our fame from
if im battling in 2029 pat me on the back like thanks for remembering where you came from
you got nice flow but no punching skill
ten years i’m punching still
the philly prince will get sonned in cali i’m uncle phil
slashed throat
they put his face on a shirt rip the frat goat
this time when you go viral on a tee t it ain’t for fat jokes
you handpick opportunities it’s see through
ganik didn’t even say your name and i knew it’d be you
i just said i think i’ll win and he wrote metoo
im your executioner lucifer shut the fuck up
your time is fading
rone who you annihilating
you look like all five people that died from vaping
you callin out mike p dawg thats light
bring him to the smack killer we are not alike
i’ll treat him like the show you got fired from and drop the micmike
i got a violent left antifa
you getting floored this time fuck a metaphor or rhyme
the right will have him higher than our credit scores combined
while you were doing keg stands grabbin your friends erection
i beat you in a freestyle battle with less aggression
listen rone this ain’t beer pong you won’t get redemption
the frat killer tell brad thad and chad that this verse is amazing
you can’t fuck with the goat this ain’t fraternity hazing
how many ipas have you tried today
your parents got the job done
my sweet 16 not fun
what you know bout asking your dad for two mercedes and you got one
this ain’t for the news fans that just want us to hold lead
code red
connor mcgregor this for the old heads
rone you ain’t nothing but a fuckin cokehead
waitin for someone to have a bump for him like an old thread
i got all kinds of tablets i can supply this addict
so much speed al davis tried to draft it
have him snortin til he feel ill
coke so white method man assumed it voted for real deal
he gon make this barstool vs wild n out and thats a fact
i mean i dont care and you claimin i dont clap a gat
bring up timothy de la ghetto cause hes got the man purse that just means my man is strapped
who from barstool is here to support you
i mean well that guys wack
your friends arent in your corner and thats a fact
no matter how much you ignore this you will always be welcomed in battle rap
one day youll be fired from your job and thats a fact
dont be surprised cause a barstool never has your back
time

round 2 rone
imagine being a grown man charron fan
you talk about bodied like its rocky the delusion is astounding
its budget was 15000000 and it grossed 100000
and you had what two more lines than me
shit aint never been funny
congratulations you had a bigger part in losing eminems money
but while we were shooting bodied you were drinkin in the lobby
in the standard in los angeles you were gettin sloppy
you started mouthing off to pat stay i thought this wont go well
and sure enough he bitch slapped you in front of the whole hotel
and i dont wanna misconstrue it you got slapped and your lip was drooling
you wouldve thought that he dropped this fruit from the way that this bitch was bruising
thats why we laugh when you talk tough like who does he think hes fooling
you almost died off that smack in an la hotel we wouldve thought it was whitney houston
you were a terrible drunk and he smacked you in the standard
so kshines not an outlier smacking you is the standard
i mean aye verb stepped to you shotgun peppered you
bonnie almost broke her fuckin wrist dick checkin you
shine made a mess of you pat disrespected you
ars had his hands on your face like he was blessin you
so who the fuck are you playin with
youve already been 86d
i dont mean they cancelled you i mean number of hands on you if they dusted your face for prints
why does that always happen to you
why does that never happen to me
its not happenstance that they slot you fam thats just who you happen to be
but you embrace the school shooter image like you think that shit is powerful
til i lift you up and beat the fucking warning signs outta you
bro this ones a camcorder itll help deliver the picture
this ones a transformer itll turn him into a sprinter
your dads a mechanic from orleans well i had to have a talk with him
its funny he works at midas and you got a touch of autism
but you take pride in wild n out when its legitimately terrible
15 straight years of the same mariah carey joke
word to nick cannons turban ive been offered wild n out six times theres written record of that
six times aint that the amount of seasons that youve been in the cast
bro from wild n out to drop the mic to battles in this league
theyll only ever call you when they cant book me
the name brand versus the budget version
undeserving less funny person
the first choice that they cater too versus the back up the safety school
the option is less sexy when they cant sign gretzky
the chrysler 300 they rent when they cant afford the bentley
bro all of viacom loves me they would kill to write a check
theyd have a pilot waitin on me like a fuckin private jet
yo you sound like youre high on helium the show is the height of tedium
this skinny little geek is tryin to make it on tv thats a dying medium
but before i retire his ass like andrew luck
lets talk about that time organik watched some groupie bitch and you fuck
you went soft but tried to keep going cause the audience had you rattled
isnt it bad enough he had to watch you pretend to be hard in your battles
bro you love to go on smack to brag on the fake crack you slang
and gats you bang
if it were up to you youd be on a banned band every month like andrew yang
but what about that time you said mexicans cant be super heroes cause quote theyre too lazy bro
but whats really lazy though
the accent the basic quotes
the fact that you were hitting a dominican with racist tropes that arent even creative jokes
i mean corey charron hates the mexicans more than the border patrol
hes not callin shots hes callin cops to a foreigners home
hell cock his gun he hears someone say señor on the phone
well the coroners home put four in his dome
get beat to death leave the flesh around your cornea swole
this an orchestra what you pen is boring and slow
past your expiration date baby wait your formulas old
you go the wrong way at every single fork in the road
ill leave your body stretched out like the warrior pose
out of all of battle rap i got the corniest clone
you hate mexicans then get the fuck out california bro
bro im a mix of rambo and tony soprano
ill tag your mans toe like i was virgil abloh
youre off white thinking you got the best answer
unless theres something you want to get off your chest after like breast cancer
cause at the negotiating table youre softer than ned flanders
youre not scoring travi scotts jordans your checks backwards
bro you said i got a million ways kill him but if none of all that work
ill just drop him off in east oakland in his confederate flag shirt
bro you could never match my moves in or out the ring
call me roney bae the prince but to you ill always be the king

round 3 charron
he callin me racist but
they say head ice robbed you your third round was light
if you couldnt make it out of harlem how did my dad make it out of harlem
because he’s white
like was that a third round or a third reich
i’m no b dot im not an expert on this situation
and this coming from someone that accused bet of discrimination
but between your dad and head ice who struggled in life more
you said it’s not your fault if your born poor but it is if you die poor
that’s what your physicist dad taught you while he set up your trust fund
due to his skin which harlem cops did he run from
which neighborhoods which schools was he shunned from
that mentality is the same reason that trump won
you said my dad was racist about the mexicans but cmon son
it’s not your fault if youre born to a racist but it is if you become one
also against head ice you also said you’re tethered to an existence that doesn’t mean shit to me
while i was taking trips to sicily
you were in self imposed poverty figuring out what kid to feed
cringe
the epitome
you act black now look inwardly nwordly
predatory lending they couldnt get help yet
they were designated to hoods they couldnt get out yet
this motherfucker thought redlining was a microsoft spell check
only people on 4chan like how you rap
your favorite chore is laundry day so you can separate the whites from the blacks
you spit those bars in toronto in front of a bunch of crackers
i dare you to come to cali and say all lives fucking matter
you know how many trump supporters are here one dizaster
aye i did wear the confederate flag sleeve i accept all the scrutiny
i acted foolishly
apologize i didnt know the history and apologized to the community
we move as a unit
why because of unity
yesterday i was called out for appropriation today you wont hear an ooops from me
this ain’t even a battle this is a eulogy
that’s why shhh rone cause when i look at you it’s a moment of silence for who i used to be
you brag about your vacas like look at my big trips
you make 100k you think mtv is how i get rich
air bb hvac that’s the right business
you get bud light i sip cris
knock over his barstool you aint wild n out like this bitch
last year 700k those are my digits
you’d have to save up 7 years pay to get my interest
two apps get paid when the site gets hits
i inspire kids with autism plus my girl has nice big tits
listen rone i ain’t the one to talk that i’m winning at life shit with
you tried to stunt on head ice dawg relax
bring up my autism i have retarded stacks
if i wake up feeling like a million bucks the market crashed
a millionaire at 25 how can the prince be proud
after this quick beat down
you can battle my pockets and spit your big t rounds
i don’t watch barstool i put that on the bible
i’d rather swallow crack before my morgan’s piano recital
or watch another chillatrevor rematch for the title
you got at the saurus for gambling you bet on sports games all the time
so i made my own odds on the ways that you’ll die
a trillion to one
you died from your fans getting trampled in the streets
1000 to 1
you odd after your motherfuckin panics increased
10 to 1 youll develop aids from sanduskys beef
or 1 to 1 you die of shame after admitting you got raped once this battles released
this is karma for all your rounds
i mean you’re not big t fat but you put on some pounds
you quit battling for a podcast you’re basically okwerdz now
you only hit up ganik when hes got something to offer you
you look like a bird and flock like a vulture
your dads a physicist and he need you adam atom cause you make up everything that’s wrong with this culture
so fuck your mother fuck your brother i hope your step mom dies
fuck every ben shapiro speech on your desktop drive
fuck barstools segments on the best pop flies
you make podcasts for white kids that drop the n bomb on xbox live
fuck you for not knowing what your privilege does
fuck the barstool founder for calling all women sluts
fuck you for laughing at it with your buds
fuck you for promoting a rape culture that you’re a victim of
fuck joseph kahn for giving you a pity role and 100’s of bucks
after you got rejected for the role of adam cause you weren’t funny enough
fuck your character in bodied you wouldn’t engage to a thing
how can you propose for two years you stayed away from the ring
fuck your for not leading as an example
fuck you for not giving a shot to those trapped in your shadow
youre from philly so fuck you for the last two cassidy battles
fuck you for thinking king of the dot isnt the place for you
fuck you for only showing up to a smack event look what you made me do
and fuck the url for last night when they hacked our ppv
i mean people wanna go against rone but watch how i rhyme first
he wants to do this hes diggin up dirt
well watch how he goes in his guys hearse
he says i hate spanish people i mean is that how your mind works
he also said organik watched me fuck a bitch ill show him how the dime hurts
youre right he was watching while i had a tag team with myverse
you’re an ungrateful hypocrite the truths gotta sting
i am more successful then you and i’m still doing my thing
so trevor it’s time for me to see you in the ring
it’s charoney baby the prince and soon to be king
lets get it

round 3 rone
bro i always knew he had a side hustle poppin fly shit in the bay
i always assumed he worked for uber cause he always drives women away
but you love to talk about this money and never tell us where you got it
turns out you were a doortodoor energy salesman who just ran old peoples pockets
you were scamming their life away and then treating it like a game
and because of your lying ways they were broke in their dying days
well try that shit with my grandma find out if shes really with the shit
shed be off the porch like clint eastwood wed see billy pistol whipped
bro being part of a pyramid scheme makes you a sucker regardless
but scamming old people i give a fuck if youre autistic that shit is retarded
bro scamming the senile old folks losing their memory
the irony you taking advantage of people who arent all there mentally
well i bet you wish you were back selling gas facing the elderly instead of me
cause ill give you the option that you didnt lets see if you keep that same energy
yo ill get your girlfriend dog when she comes through the east bay
and ill pay michael vick to abuse it each day
ill bring it right up in her room if she refuse the bj
ill beat it right in front of her like louis ck
see it could get real eventful if i use the steel against you
you catch six from the tre tray thats a philly special
ill philly pretzel billy pistolz hell be lookin like whoopis braids
but if i really pistol billy pistolz hell be lookin like billy mays
so youre saying that autism shits real though ooh thats mean
bet you wish you listened to hollow and skipped the flu vaccine
but i love my people with autism unconditionally best believe it
but for you to bring it up in a title match for sympathy and expect other people not to talk about it almost seems like youre askin for special treatment
see im here to dig a hole for you soulremove and lower you
and just cause you have autism dont mean ill take it slow for you
ill whip your ass like anyone else cause thats what im supposed to do
but its a shame you dont understand social cues cause you have no idea how bad im owning you
ive read up on nonverbal learning disorder as some insight on your brain for me
it said you can read a civil war book remember every generals name but not realize its about slavery
and that explained to me why your concepts cant hit and each angles a bad miss
because other than generally general lee you really dont understand shit
i kept reading and i almost felt bad for the geek
but the deeper i got what did i happen to see
it helps you focus on a task you are the man with your frees
it helps you access rhymes you are fast on your feet
youre less likely to be insulted that helps you battle with ease
it compartmentalizes thoughts all your facts and your schemes
so by the time i finished reading i was mad as can be
until i realized the one thats really disadvantagedis me
i mean do you know how hard it is to be a battle rapper without autism
whos done a drug a beer whos really got bitches
i started schemin vaccinein you dont know how bad i want the shit
the more im reading i cant believe it its like everybodys got the shit
fucking steve jobs dickinson einstein newton bill gates burton mozart darwin
and wouldnt it be crazy if someone like jobs went on stage with a sob story instead of making the ipod
if einstein was woe is me instead of finding relativity
if newton never understood his own gifts gravity
if mozart never played strings and curled up in a ball
if darwin had played the victim and had never evolved
see thats my problem with your scamming shit it isnt moralism
it doesnt matter how rich you are if youre still making poor decisions
youre a scumbag from your actions no ones exploiting you
being autistic doesnt make you any less of a man dawg but your choices do
see im up front youre sidewinding im a lone wolf youre hiveminded
im obsessed with originality youre the most derivative on the battle scene
you have the charm of rush limbaugh women love me you make their skin crawl
im good at everything you find your second talent then show me
youre a punk bitch fuck stick one trick pony
and those that pay attention are never gon respect him
it has nothing to do with autism were just on different ends of the spectrum
and he could never match my moves either in or out the ring
they call me roney bae the prince but to you ill always be the kingembed"
