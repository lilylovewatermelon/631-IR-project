keep your hoes in check
super
verse
i got this girl and she wants me to duke her
i told her id come scoop her around eight she said super
that sounds great shorty girls a trooper
no matter what i need her to do she be like super
own his own throne the boss like king koopa
on the microphone he flossed the ring super
average emcees is like a tv blooper
mf doom hes like db cooper
out with the moolah i let her get a outfit
just to cool her off she said niggas aint about shit
i wonder if she meant it i doubt it
the way it be in her mouth she cant live without it
and cant live with this handle your business
villainll stay on a scandalous hos shit list
one pack of cookies please mr hooper
its fun smacking rookies he is the super
look like a black wookiee when he let his beard grow
weirdo brownskinnedd always kept his hair low
rumors has it its a scurl accident
doom was always known to keep the best girls backs bent
some say its the eyes some say the accent
a lot of guys wonder where they stacks went
i call her thunderthighs with the fatty swolluh
only mess with high rollers do what daddy told her
no matter the city she with me to do the thangthang
work in the coochie hoopty chittychitty bangbang
same name on the titty as on the name ring
pretty like baby d off all in the same gang
keep my eye on her really dont trust her
but i treat her like a daughter taught her how to bust a nut
and the heat to turn beef to horsemeat chalupa
teach her how to hold it of course he is the super
see most cats treat her like foofur
or beat her to a stupor take it from the super
you need to make her feel cuter
and lay down the g like luther everythingll be super
do for her keep her in a new fur
so she look sweet when she go to meet the super
got the buddha get the grenadiers twist it
put it in the air come here kiss it
listen here scooter let her try to bag you
when shes on the rag never let her fry the ragù
whichll have you under some type of spell crying dag boo
her name on your back in a tattoo
whether a bougie broad nerd ho street chick
dont call her wifey if you met her at the freaknik
you dont want her dont waste her time ill duke her
and be a father to your child like the super
he keep his hoes in check
sends em out to get glows from off frozen necks
tell em take his clothes leave him posing naked for real
better yet get him for the check off the record deal
