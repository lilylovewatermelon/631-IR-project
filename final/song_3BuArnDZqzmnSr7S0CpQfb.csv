this city so pretty
under moonlit skies well be hanging like a cigarette
so stunning start running
tonights like a knife would you cut me with your kiss
i bleed red lips youre unbelievable
cant miss this chance to take you
and heres my invitation

chorus
hello brooklyn hey la
take the streets all night cause we sleep all day
when the world comes crashing down whos ready to party
hello brooklyn hey la
coast to coast ill take you down in flames
let the good times roll we can let go
everybody knows theres a party at the end of the world

verse 2
this city is your city
heels on the sidewalk begging for a backbeat
dont worry i fight dirty
