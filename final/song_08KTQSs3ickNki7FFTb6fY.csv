yesterday i heard you say
your lust for life has gone away
it got me thinking i think i feel a similar way
and thats sad thats sad thats sad
so lets make a decision start a new religion
yeah were gonna build a temple to our love
orgiastic dances nymphs in trances
yeah well be the envy of the gods above

im feeling devious youre looking glamorous
lets get mischievous and polyamorous
wine and women and wonderful vices
welcome to the cult of dionysus

verse 2 orion and linda
we could take a holiday
in the month of may run free and play
in fields of flowers pass the hours
making love is how well pray
or start a secret society
for the wild and free our ideology
is you can do what you want too much is never enough
we are the light we are the life we are the envy of the gods above
