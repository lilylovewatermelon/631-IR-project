do you believe
do you fade like a dream
let me hear you breathe let me watch as you sleep
the sparrows eyes
promises shift into judgments
i cannot deny that you were designed for my punishments

verse 2
the blood and the body control the cut so its seamless
show me your heart show me the way to complete this
tethered to a scene i treasure can you help me
i sever god its perfect its never really perfect
now i can finally be myself cause i dont wanna be myself

chorus
free my severed heart give me you
i want it i dont wanna be myself
free my severed heart give me you
i want it i dont wanna be myself
free my severed heart give me you
i want it i dont wanna be myself
free my severed heart give me you
i want it i dont wanna be myself

guitar solo

i cannot maintain a semblance of normal anymore
id rather feel pain than try to fit in with you anymore
ill throw it all away like everybody else
i can finally be myself cause i donâ€™t wanna be myself

chorus
free my severed heart give me you
i want it i dont wanna be myself
free my severed heart give me you
i want it i dont wanna be myself
free my severed heart give me you
i want it i dont wanna be myself
free my severed heart give me you
i want it i dont wanna be myself

chorus
free my severed heart give me you
i want it i dont wanna be myself
free my severed heart give me you
i want it i dont wanna be myself
free my severed heart give me you
i want it i dont wanna be myself
free my severed heart give me you
i want it i dont wanna be myself8embed"
