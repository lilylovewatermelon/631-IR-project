sweatin her weave out moans as she breathes out
fuck im doin in parties with hova and steve stoute
i step over piranha death over dishonor
they killin niggas for js thats death over designer
hey cole heatin up like that leftover lasagna
remember when i used to be stressed over dwana

and we always argue bout the same thing
and tell me why we gotta argue bout the same thing same thing

oh yeah to my college girl take the weekend off and come home soon
i graduated way too long ago to be sneakin all in your dorm room
but that thing tight like fort knox
so i call you when the tour stops
but baby where your roommates
did you make sure the doors locked
she love it when we get together
smoke a little weed but her shit together
now that im on i can pick and choose
only fuck with hoes who got shit to lose
yeah i heard the stories bout different dudes
her man on campus but its fine by me
she say she only fucked like four–five niggas
so you know you gotta multiply by three
