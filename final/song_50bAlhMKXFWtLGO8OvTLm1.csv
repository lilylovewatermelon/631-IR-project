with yellow feathers in her hair
and a dress cut down to there
she would meringue and do the cha cha
and while she tried to be a star
tony always tended bar

across the crowded floor
they worked from 8 til 4
they were young and they had each other
who could ask for more

chorus
at the copa co
copacabana copacabana
the hottest spot north of havana here
at the copa
copacabana
music and passion were
always the fashion
at the copa
they fell in love

his name was rico he wore a diamond
he was escorted to a chair
he saw lola dancing there
and when she finished he called her over whistle
but rico went a bit too far
tony sailed acrossed the bar
you might also likeand then the punches flew
and chairs were smashed in two
there was blood and a single gunshot
but just who shot who
repeat chorus
she lost her love in the end

instrumental break
her name was lola she was a show girl
but that was 30 years ago
when they used to have a show
now its a disco but not for lola
still in that dress she use to wear
faded feathers in her hair

she sits there so refined
and drinks herself halfblind
she lost her youth and she lost her toni
has she lost her mind
repeat chorus

at the copa
dont fall in loveembed"
