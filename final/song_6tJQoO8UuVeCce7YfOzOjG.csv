big breakfast
yo

verse
excelent
im on my lou bega shit
steady getting chips
to my core mega record skips
fly as a pegasus
they annoyed ever since im getting paper
like im playing sega genesis
effortless when im wreckin shit
sexy scentences on the premises
damn it bitch
if it wont get him a necklace to heck with it
give me everything or im mega pissed
on the dlow when he smoke he blow three os in a row
ticktacktoe
holy moly the pro at this rap show
stole till his foes were broke as a kitkat yo
im with big rat
asking where the chips at dingbat
when the kid raps nymphs ask if they can hit that
spit back get in line like the dmv
pull up rob them blind they aint seein me
at the mall plottin a robery
when suddenly a squad of wannabes wanna bother me
prolly poppin molly on a shoppin spree
they wanted beef until i hollared olly olly oxen free
now hes on his knees like sorry b
no apologies meet the bottom of his wallabies
honestly you should empty out your pockets
till my wallets green as the common marijuana leaf
you might also likeoutro
marijuana leaf bro
occassionally smoke reckless
breakfast
never pay for drugs
taste fudge skate thugs dragnet
more coke
ayeaye
drastic mastic
beach shirley
