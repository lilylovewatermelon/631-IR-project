spinning inside rotting away
something inside of me has been taken away
feeling my heart breaking in vain
it wont get better now when will this end

chorus
i cant seem to get away
i feel im here so you can play with my head
theres nothing i can say
i keep feeling like im to blame when will this end

verse 2
hopeless inside alone as i wait
brewing inside of me is your endless hate
feeling my heart breaking in vain
it wont get better now when will this end

chorus
i cant seem to get away
i feel im here so you can play with my head
theres nothing i can say
i keep feeling like im to blame when will this end

verse 3
the stress is rising and i cant seem to get away from you
youre always trying and the lying always shines right through
my god i hate this always take shit
can i let this go on
why cant i break this
i just take this as this goes on and on
end
when will this end
when will this end
when will this end
when will this end
when will this end
when will this end
when will this end
when will this end
