im in transit
floating stranded on this boat
and i pledge my self allegiance
to a better nights sleep at home
and the sweet sweet suns comin down hard
the suns comin down hard it burns the bones
so hold a hand for cover hold a hand for cover
hold a hand for cover from harm

chorus
wooooooooh ooooooooh ooooooooh ooooh
talk dont change a thing
wooooooooh wooooooooh wooooooooh
oh its fading fader
wooooooooh ooooooooh ooooooooh ooooh
words dont sink they swims
wooooooooh wooooooooh wooooooooh
oh its fading fader

verse 2
bless this mess
we tried our best thats all that we can do
while the angels walk with the lonely ones
in the cold rain to rescue you
and this fable worlds comin down hard
the walls comin down hard on all our homes
so hold a hand for cover hold a hand for cover
hold a hand for cover from harm
