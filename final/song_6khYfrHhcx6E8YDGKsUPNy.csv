yeah me and bobby p stayed out all night
kicking it and cutting up and getting right
i had a good time
till i cam crawling in bout daylight
and you were bawling
and remember that time i took your car
you told me not to drive it but my truck wouldnt start
i had to leave it parked it got a whiskey dent
down at the handlebar where i swore i never went darling

chorus
you get mad sometimes
i drive you right out of your mind
i dont mean to make you crazy
im not the devil just a dude
baby girl i know that you
could do better than me maybe
but it’s too later you already love me
yeah it’s too late you already love me

verse 2
starch my shirt and press my pants
meet your boss at tour christmas dance
in a suit and tie
i wore my boots and jeans
and when he rolled his eyes
girl i caused a scene baby
you might also likechorus
you get mad sometimes
i drive you right out of your mind
i dont mean to make you crazy
im not the devil just a dude
baby girl i know that you
could do better than me maybe
but it’s too later you already love me
yeah it’s too late you already love meembed"
