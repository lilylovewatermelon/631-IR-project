verse 1
everywhere i turn no matter where i look
the systems in control its all ran by the book
ive got to get away so i can free my mind
escape is what i need away from electric eyes

prechorus
no matter where i am i see my face around
they pin lies on my name then push them town to town
dont have a place to run but theres no need to hide
ive got to find a place but i wont hide away

chorus

had to go away
