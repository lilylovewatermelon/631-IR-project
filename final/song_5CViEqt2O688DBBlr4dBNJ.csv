havin you and livin life with no cares a big difference
its somethin bout the love that we share it hits different
so baby we can ride whatever you wanna do
and if the police pull us over i aint worried bout you
i know that you gonna keep it solid i know youll never break
i know that you gon post my bail and do whatever it takes
surrounded by fakes and youre the only thing i see thats real
you picked this broken man up youre what i need to heal

prechorus
so whatever you need baby ill be there
i can see us old and grey a porch and two rockin chairs
bonnie and clydе yeah thats cool
but its a whole differеnt vibe with me and you

chorus
i just wanna love like johnny and june
we can leave tomorrow take a trip to the moon
into the ring of fire met a boy named sue
but now i walk the line and its all cause of you
daddy sang bass yeah i miss him so bad
sunday mornin comin down i just wanna go back
so baby its whatever you wanna do
i just wanna love like johnny and june johnny and june

have you ever had a angel fly down and stand before you
be amazed by her beauty and then find out that shes loyal
thats that once in a lifetime my partner in crime
til the wheels fall off we put it all on the line
i knew it when we met thered be storms we would weather
and you can crack the finest of diamonds with dew pressure
we got the kinda story that only gets better
it starts at forever and ends never

prechorus
carry my last name im carrying you
the best decision i ever made was marrying you
mickey and mallory yeah thats cool
its a whole different vibe with me and you

chorus
i just wanna love like johnny and june
we can leave tomorrow take a trip to the moon
into the ring of fire met a boy named sue
but now i walk the line and its all cause of you
daddy sang bass yeah i miss him so bad
sunday mornin comin down i just wanna go back
so baby its whatever you wanna do
i just wanna love like johnny and june johnny and juneembed"
