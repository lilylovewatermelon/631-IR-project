uh first verse uh im on til im on an island
my lifes ridin on the autobahn on autopilot
before i touch dirt or kill yall with kindness
i kill ya my natural personas much worse
youve been warned if youve been borned or if you conformed
slap up a cop and then snatch him out of his uniform
leave him with his socks hard bottoms and bloomers on
and hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn
yall niggas intellect mad slow yall fags know
claimin you bangin you flamin
bet you could light your own cigarette with your asshole
me and shady deaded the past so
that basically resurrected my cashflow
i might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke
though i aint wrapped tight my blood types the 80s
my 90s was like the navy you was like the bradys
you still fly kites daily

verse 2 eminem
catch me in my mercedes bumpin ice ice baby
screaming shady til i die
like a half a pair of dice lifes crazy
so i live it to the fullest til im swayze
and you only live it once so im thinking bout this nice nice lady
wait no stop me now fore i get on a roll danish
let me tell you what this pretty little dames name is cause shes kinda famous
and i hope that i dont sound too heinous when i say this
nicki minaj but i wanna stick my penis in your anus
you morons think that im a genius
really i belong inside a dang insane asylum
came to drive them trailer parks crazy
i am back and i am razorsharp baby
and thats back with a capital b with an exclamation mark
maybe you should listen when i flip the linguistics
‘cause i wanna rip this mystical slick shit
you dont wanna become another victim a statistic of this shit
‘cause after i spit the bullets ima treat these shell casings like a soccer ball
ima kick the ballistics so get this dick ima live this—

verse 3 royce da 59  eminem
uh yeah my whole goal as a poets to be relaxed in orbit
at war with a bottle as captain morgan attacks my organs cmon
my slow flow is euphoric its like i rap endorphins woo
i made a pact with the devil that says
ill let you take me you let me take a shovel
dig up the corpse of jack kevorkian cmon

verse 5 royce da 59  eminem

its gon say the whole rap game passed away on top of the affidavit
graduated from master debater slash massive masturbator
to michael jacksons activator woo
meanin im on fire off the top might wanna back up data
rollin over hiphop in a verbal tractor trailer
homie they sick you could normally ask a hater

dropped in the lap of a tax evader homie they spent

verse 6 eminem
