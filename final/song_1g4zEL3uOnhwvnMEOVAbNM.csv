spittin verses im desperate i need a mansion and a coupe
you done signed over your life and now you slavin in the booth
now we hang ourself with chains they used to make us rock a noose
shorties hoppin off the porch cause it aint shit else to do
nothin but trouble in the hood normal sentence for the youth
you a king you not a gangster im just tellin you the truth
please just take my word cause they done scrambled all the proof
his big bro aint tryna warn him he just taught him how to shoot
out there warrin with each other will there ever be a truce
why the fuck we into it im going through oppression too
feel death in the air its like a nightmare this shit is scary
riding for gang now your casket is gettin carried
mama break down you gettin put in that cemetery
shit fucked up my mental seen too many obituaries
these bodies keep dropping summer cold like its january
when you die they gon praise you now they see that you legendary
just another cold case look what they did to kenneka
hear them screams after that chopper sing like aretha
homicide puddles i got blood stains on my sneakers
out here playing life or death tryna run from the reaper
shit been fucked up at the crib lashin out on the teacher
grandma taking me to church i fell asleep on that preacher
chains clothes hit the block hardheaded and eager
we just tryna stay afloat but this shit gettin deeper
im just tryna talk to you and tell my life through these speakers
yeah i conquered them struggles i just had to stay focused
told myself that im the greatest i wont wait til they notice
wouldnt nobody help me up when i was down at my lowest
im the only one believe when everybody was hopeless
i done got so used to funerals cant show no emotion
man this lifestyle crazy swear this shit get atrocious
like one minute on that block you just laughing and joking
now your mans shot up on that ground gasping and choking
in them streets deep we was mobbin went from innocent to goblins
had to take we started robbin catchin white folks while they joggin
battle scars we hate the rain bullet wounds steady throbbin
fiends lookin like zombies halfdead they just noddin
that peer pressure comin at you and its too hard to dodge it
got dreams to make the league late night plans might sabotage it
my homie made the news he posed to be on espn
came and left the same day rip to the twins
doctor said he could make it but his chances was thin
my homie just came home did three in the pen
back in them streets few weeks later now he locked up again
i wonder one day will we wake up is the cycle gon end
