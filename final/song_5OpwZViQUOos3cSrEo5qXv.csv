to go to go now far away from here now
and im gonna be so brave and im gonna go so far away

where are the wise men where have they all gone to did they
follow the spirit children down the road that only they know
and you and i know that the answer lies
somewhere deep in the city of skies and

were gonna go there were gonna see the daylight
and im gonna fly away now
and im gonna go where the path runs high

into the sky and when the breeze blows
all you can see is the green and gold and

the street night lights and were gonna find it
were gonna find the gold that illuminates our lives
and im gonna go so far away and im gonna see the stars up high
