fight

verse 1
youre afraid like i make my deals with the devil
youve been at it for years but couldnt reach that next level
lets keep it real this is no competition to me
even if everyone around you acts like they dont see

chorus
oh is anybody else listening
outta sight outta mind is what youll always be
oh i hold my cards to my chest
i laid my life on the line so i expect nothing less from you

verse 2
i speak the truth and everybody else knows it
so set your ego to the side and just get the fuck over it
cant waste my time on hateful people like you
so keep wishing you were me and ill keep making you have to

chorus
oh is anybody else listening
outta sight outta mind is what youll always be
oh i hold my cards to my chest
i laid my life on the line so i expect nothing less from you
see a day to remember liveget tickets as low as 108you might also likebreakdown
i just cant believe its really come to this
because without me you would not exist
alright

verse 3
hey hey still got something left to say
only one in the world that i depend on is me
i need nothing from no one i take what i need
get a hold of yourself and keep away from me

chorus
oh is anybody else listening
outta sight outta mind is what youll always be
oh i hold my cards to my chest
i laid my life on the line so i expect nothing less from you11embed"
