verse 1
she said at night in my dreams
you dance on a tightrope of weird
oh but when i wake up
youre so normal that you just disappear
youre so straight like commuters
with briefcases towing the line
theres no residue of a torturer
inside of your eyes

prechorus
she said youre just like mike love
but you wanna be brian wilson brian wilson
said youre just like mike love
but youll never be brian wilson

chorus
and i said
hey hey if crazy equals genius

then im a fucking arsonist hey
im a rocket scientist hey hey
hey hey if crazy equals genius

verse 2
she said darlin you know
how the wine plays tricks on my tongue
but you dont seem to change
when you stuff all of your feelings with drugs
other boys you may have dated
serrated your heart with a slice
but the cut of your love never hurts
baby its a sweet butter knife

said youre just like mike love
but youll never be dennis wilson
