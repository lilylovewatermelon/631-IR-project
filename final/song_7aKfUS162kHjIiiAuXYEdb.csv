verse 1
i knew the dance i felt the heat
a million faces stared at me
i felt the earth move to a beat
a million ways in which to sing ah
and in the midst i saw the mayor
he looked at me with such a glare
and then i danced my secret dance
a million angels sang to me ah

chorus 1
make sure she will be all right
make sure she will be fine
a million voices will lead her

verse 2
and then the crowd began to sway
a million eyes looking my way
i felt the sun beat on the earth
a thousand ways in which to play ah
and then i felt one hundred hearts
a million angels smiled at me
and then i danced another dance
as people started to begin ah

tell her she will be all right
tell her she will be fine
a million voices will lead her
