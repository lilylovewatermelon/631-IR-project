it aint just about the bars
it aint just about an umbrella in your drink
it aint just about the cars
chopped up dropped down ridin low in the street
and it aint the sand on my feet
thats got me thinkin i might never leave
im feelin words that i cant speak
i can learn girl if you can teach

chorus jake owen
señorita yes i need ya
on my lips like a shot of tequila
so ¿cómo se dice i think i might stay
leave an empty seat on that airplane
youre the only thing ive been lookin at all night
mamacita got me movin down to paradise
mi bonita i cant leave ya
