i spent a long time watering a plant made out of plastic
and i cursed the ground for growing green
i spent a long time substituting honest with sarcastic
and i cursed my tongue for being mean

verse
and weightless breathless restitute
motionless and absolute
you cut me open sucked the poison from an aging wound
now fifty thousand war cadets
would cower at this small brunette
to my surprise not six feet high
whod reach and grab the moon if i
should ask or just imply
that i wanted a bit more light
so i could look inside his eyes
and get the colors just right
just right just right just

interlude

outro
build love build god build provinces
build calluses break promises
cause i could never hold a perfect thing and not demolish it
what am i thinking what does this mean
how could somebody ever love me
talk to your man tell him hes got bad news cominyou might also like30embed"
