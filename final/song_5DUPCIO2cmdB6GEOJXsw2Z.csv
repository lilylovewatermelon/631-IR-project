youve been out here tryna work on me for a minute
fall in love for a minute
youve been tryna see me through the problems
but everything youre sayin is the problem
you keep tryna make me slow down for a minute
when i just wanna drown for a minute
you can take advantage
but youre taking chances

prechorus
and im so glad you took it
so glad you took it
cheap shot caught me when i wasnt looking for you
shots in the dark got me following your heart
cheap shot got me taking cheap shots
why are you taking cheap shots

chorus
drinking smoking doses potions
got me doing things i aint do
got me doing things i aint do true
drinking smoking doses emotions
somethin bout the pain mixed with you
got me doing things i aint doing right

verse 3
its so hard to admit all the changes
stuck in the same system for ages
im just tryna take a hold of whats left of me
it cant get the best of me
its amazing what little lies can do
theyre just pieces but they devour you
im a monster just tryna vibe with you
so come over if you want but you can never call me yours when were

drinking smoking doses potions
somethin bout the pain mixed with you
you know you got me doing things i aint do

postchorus
and it aint really what it seems
but what it seems is what it looks like true
and you can never call me yours
but can call me when you feel like it
drinking smoking doses no emotions
somethin bout the pain mixed with you
got me doing things i aint doing right true
