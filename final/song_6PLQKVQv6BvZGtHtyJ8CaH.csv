your shadow walks faster than you
you dont really know what to do
do you think that youre not alone
you really think that you are immune to it
its going to get that the best of you
its going to lift you up and let you down
mmmmmmmmm

prechorus 1
it will defeat you then teach you to get back up
after it takes away all that you learned to love

verse 2
your reflection is a blur
out of focus but in confusion
the frames are suddenly burnt
and in the end of a roll of illusion
is a ghost waiting its turn
now i can see right through
its a warning that nobody heard

prechorus 2
it will teach you to love what youre afraid of
after it takes away all that you learned to love
see jack johnson liveget tickets as low as 95you might also likebridge
but you dont always have to hold your head
higher than your heart

chorus
you better hope youre not alone
you better hope youre not alone
you better hope youre not alone
you better hope youre not alone
you better hope youre not alone
you better hope youre not alone
you better hope youre not alone
you better be hoping youre not so
hope youre not alone

verse 3
your your echo comes back out of tune
now you can quite get used to it
reverb is just a room
the problem is that theres no truth to it
its fading way too soon
the shadow is on the move
and maybe you should be moving too

prechorus 3
before it takes away all that you learned to love
it will defeat you then teach you to get back up
bridge
cause you dont always have to hold your head
higher than your heart

chorus
you better hope youre not alone
you better hope youre not alone
you better hope youre not alone
you better be hoping youre not alone
you better hope youre not alone
you better hope youre not alone
you better hope youre not alone
you better hope youre not so

outro
hope youre not alone
better hoohohohope
hope better hope youre not alone
