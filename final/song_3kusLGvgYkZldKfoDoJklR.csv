they say it fades if you let it
love was made to forget it
i carved your name across my eyelids
you pray for rain i pray for blindness

chorus 1
if you still want me please forgive me
the crown of love has fallen from me
if you still want me please forgive me
because the spark is not within me

postchorus
i snuffed it out before my mom walked
in my bedroom

verse 2
the only thing that you keep changing
is your name my love keeps growing
still the same just like a cancer
and you wont give me a straight answer

chorus 2
if you still want me please forgive me
the crown of love has fallen from me
if you still want me please forgive me
because your hands are not upon me

i shrugged them off before my mom walked
in my bedroom

verse 3
the pains of love and they keep growing
in my heart theres flowers growing
on the grave of our old love
since you gave me a straight answer

chorus 3
if you still want me please forgive me
the crown of love is not upon me
if you still want me please forgive me

bridge
cause the spark is not within me
its not within me
its not within me
you gotta be the one
you gotta be the way
your name is the only word that i can say
you gotta be the one
you gotta be the way
your name is the only word
the only word that i can say
outro
only word that i can say
no no no no no
no no no no21embed"
