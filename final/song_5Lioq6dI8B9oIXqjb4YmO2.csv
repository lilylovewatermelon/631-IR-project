verse 1
you hunched and blinded mutants living in chat rooms
you masturbate on the sheets your mothers clean for you
you have lined my pockets overflowed with gold
youre living with your parents and youre 35 years old

chorus
youre a bunch of banks that id like to rob
youre my online cash transaction youre my future stocks
transfer you like money to a swiss account
spend you on an impulse buy and zero you all out

think youre fucking better than us you cant leave your house
deluded little maggots fold your arms and frown
go to work and make me money before i put you down

bridge
i would like to get some sleep
but you keep buying all our things
my overhead is way too deep
for us to not make all these things
its way too cynical you see
hating whats supporting me
i am not you i thank the gods
and if i were id die like dogs
die die die die die die die die

chorus
youre a bunch of banks that id like to rob
youre my online cash transaction youre my future stocks
transfer you like money to a swiss account
spend you on an impulse buy and zero you all out
youre a credit card that i will defile
every time i max you out i get a thousand miles
youre a brand new car that i do not need
wrap you round a telephone pole shrug it off and leave

just follow me
down the elevator
through the gates
down the stairs
just keep on walking
through the hallway
now open the door1embed"
