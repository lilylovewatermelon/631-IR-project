can you feel your heartbeat racing
can you taste the fear in her sweat
youve done this wrong
its too far gone these sheets tell of regret
i admit that im just a fool for you
i am just a fool for you

interlude spencer chamberlain
here is where we both go wrong

verse 1 spencer chamberlain aaron gillespie
tonights your last chance to
do exactly what you want to
and this could be my night
this is what makes me feel alive makes you feel alive
here is where we both go wrong
so sign me up and toss this key
cause for now were living

prechorus spencer chamberlain
in this moment that we both ignore the truth
its all over its all over
i feel your heart against mine
so take a breath and close your eyes eyes

your lungs have failed and theyve both stopped breathing
my heart is dead its way past beating
something has gone terribly wrong
im scared youre scared were scared of this
i never thought wed make it out alive
i never told you but its all in your goodbyes
its all in your goodbyes

verse 2 spencer chamberlain aaron gillespie
well look whos dying now
slit wrists sleeping with the girl next door
i always knew you were such a sucker for that
it doesnt matter what you say
you never mattered anyway
i never mattered anyway
