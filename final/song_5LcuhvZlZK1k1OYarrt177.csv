all my life ive been debating
all the crows they sit there waiting
wondering what im going to eat
until i have it i cant sleep
i finally see you on the floor
your hearts not beating any more
my lust for you just cannot wait
your skin it tastes like chocolate
oh it tastes so good

verse 2 elena siegman
staring blankly at the sun
waiting for my time to come
your happy life it makes me sick
all the screaming sounds like music
lucid are my pooling dreams
someone tell me what they mean
theres an iron smell of blood in the air
but i cant find it anywhere

chorus elena siegman
ive been waiting for someone to find me and become a part of me
become part of me
ive been waiting for you to come here
and kill me and set me free set me free
ive been waiting for

blood flavor so metallic smell makes me go fanatic
texture that i find in you is a thick viscous glue
my senses have become so keen with all i touch and all i see
theres an iron smell of blood in the air
and now i see it everywhere

chorus elena siegman
ive been waiting for someone to find me and become a part of me
become part of me
ive been waiting for you to come here
and kill me and set me free
ive been waiting for the one
