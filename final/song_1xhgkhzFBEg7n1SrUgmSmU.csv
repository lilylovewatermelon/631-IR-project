when the wine stops working and youre all run out
and all of your high hopes have all headed south
and the songs left the stable and they never came home
and there aint no forgetting that youre out on your own

verse 2
turned the scrub oaks to timber and youre left without friends
and you dont put your book down even after it ends
smoke curls up from the table in your quiet little room
and your hearts worn the handle of an old pushing broom

chorus
broken bottles shine just like stars
make a wish anyway
just your smile lit a sixtywatt bulb in my house
that was darkened for days
been thinking you probably should stay

verse 3
when the going is long gone and the kick drum wont kick
when you fumble with your fiddle are you fresh out of tricks
and the horseflies are biting but the fish never do
and your hearts a thousand colors but theyre all shades of blue

chorus
broken bottles shine just like stars
make a wish anyway
just your smile lit a sixtywatt bulb in my house
that was darkened for days
i been thinking you probably should stay
yeah i think that you probably should stay

and our dreams on the windowsill
see those trees turning gold in the hillsembed"
