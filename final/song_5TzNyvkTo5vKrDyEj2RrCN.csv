watch the stars turn you to nothing
now blush and smile as they whisk you away
part your lips a bit more
ill swallow your fear
i will show you how
all the bite marks impressed
a need to be here
a need to see

chorus
city lights like rain
dance and explode
fall upon debutantes
reeling from nights that
kiss and control
all of our broken hearts

verse 2
velvet burns the wrists while restraining
you blushed and smiled and said you would stay
one more time steal my breath
ill feed you the sky
i will show you how
steal the glamour from death
and before you die
oh you should see
you might also likechorus
city lights like rain
dance and explode
fall upon debutantes
reeling from nights that
kiss and control
all of our broken hearts

postchorus
hearts
our hearts

bridge
we all want to die like movie stars you said
as you jumped from the height of our cutting room floor
while above us glowing exploding
our dreams burst forth in light and death
hold me and tell me well burn like stars
well burn as we fall
watch as the city lights dance for us

chorus
city lights like rain
dance and explode
fall upon the pain of our lives as they
reeling from nights that
kiss and control
fall upon the pain of our lives as they
dance and explode
city lights like rain
city lights sowcress me
kiss and control
all of our broken heartsembed"
