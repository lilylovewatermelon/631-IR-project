time to lay claim to the evidence
fingerprints sold me out
but our footprints washed away from the docks downtown
its been getting late for days
and i think myself deserving of a little time off
we can kick it hang for hours
and just mouth off about the world
and how we know its going straight to hell

prechorus
pass me another bottle honey
the jagers so sweet
but if it keeps you around then im down

chorus
meet me on thames street
ill take you out though im hardly worth your time
in the cold you look so fierce but im warm enough
because the tensions like a fire
well hit south broadway in a matter of minutes
and like a bad movie ill drop a line
fall in the grave ive been digging myself
but theres room for two
six feet under the stars
see all time low liveget tickets as low as 114you might also likeverse 2
i should have known better than to call you out
on a night like this a night like this
if not for you i know id tear this place to the ground
but im alright like this alright like this
im gonna roll the dice before you sober up and get gone
im always in over my head

chorus
thames street
ill take you out though im hardly worth your time
in the cold you look so fierce but im warm enough
because the tensions like a fire
well hit south broadway in a matter of minutes
and like a bad movie ill drop a line
fall in the grave ive been digging myself
but theres room for two
six feet under the stars

bridge
time to lay claim to the evidence
fingerprints sold me out
but our footprints washed away
im guilty but im safe for one more day
overdressed and underage what a let down
do you really need to see an id
this is embarrassing as hell what a let down
but i can cover for it so well
when were six feet under the stars
chorus
thames street
ill take you out though im hardly worth your time
in the cold you look so fierce but im warm enough
because the tensions like a fire
well hit south broadway in a matter of minutes
and like a bad movie ill drop a line
fall in the grave ive been digging myself
but theres room for two
six feet under the stars
six feet under the stars
six feet under the stars1embed"
