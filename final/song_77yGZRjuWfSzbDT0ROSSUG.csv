carved out of stone
earth blood and bone
they knock the mountains down
the earths grating sounds
they soothe the great machines
that yearn desperately
just to lay them down
within her gaping mouth

chorus
more than a symbol
more than i bargained for
more than a symbol
more than i bargained for

verse 1
they wander ridges high
between the earth and sky
like spikes upon a crown
we wear upon our brow

and want is not a need
reserved for human beings
its fingers on your throat
is pain that all things know
you might also likechorus
more than a symbol
more than i bargained for
more than a symbol
more than i bargained for

verse 2
an army of the golems is stalking now the hearts lands
eating all reality
producing only dust and sand
nothing hurts them
nothing gets under their stone skin
and when their earthen mouths will open up
and just what words will come out but
we wish we were dead
