waves upon waves keep me down
and i cant get to the top
but when i get there ill still be nowhere
cause i aint find the one i love
and if i make it out
then we shouldnt talk about how you left me
just how you left me

hook
drowning again yeah
drowning again yeah
drowning again yeah
you should see how good it would be
to come drown with me

verse 2
days upon days ive been floating
and you dont care if i die or not
but when im deceased i hope you will be
dying next to me in my watery grave
and before we go i just want my baby to know
how it feels to be
