i love sleeping in on saturdays
and i love college football games
i love not acting my age
and good barbecue
yea im a fan of faulkner books
and anything my mama cooks
small mouthed bass have got me hooked on sunday afternoons

chorus
yes i love good cold beer
and mustard on my fries
i love a good loud honky tonk that rocks on friday nights
and hell yes i love my truck but i want you to know
honey i love your love the most

verse 2
man i love how redman tastes
damn i love my nascar race
any song sung by george strait is country at its best

chorus
yes i love good cold beer
and mustard on my fries
i love a good loud honky tonk that rocks on friday nights
and hell yes i love my truck but i want you to know
honey i love your love the most
i love
see eric church liveget tickets as low as 200you might also likeverse 3
yeah i love scuffed up cowboy boots
and broken torn up jeans
my 4wheel drive 8 point bucks
and rocky road ice cream
and hell yes i love my dog
and jack d in my coke
but honey i love your love
yeah i love your love

outro
i love your love the most
i love your love the mostembed"
