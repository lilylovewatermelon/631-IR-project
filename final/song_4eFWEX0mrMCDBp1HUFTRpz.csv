sure feels good sure feels right
sure enough feels like love tonight
aint no movie aint no bar
aint nothing out there beats where we are

chorus
lay back baby catch your breath
this fire aint as hot as its gonna get
were just getting started aint close to done
theres a whole lot more where that came from

verse 2
weve been working so hard had no breaks
got a lot of overdue love to make
if we get no sleep well thats okay
about time me and you and me got this way

chorus
lay back baby catch your breath
this fire aint as hot as its gonna get
were just getting started aint close to done
theres a whole lot more where that came from
