older than water stubborn as stone
therell be no forgiveness for all that youve known
oh these days oh these days get heavy
hotter than friction subtle as sound
therell be no forgiveness for you to come around
oh these days oh these days get heavy

prechorus
i get older and life fades
but you remain

chorus
open up again i believe in second chances
please let me in oh i believe in second chances
i wont break you i will not let you down
open up again i believe in second chances

verse 2
quicker than lightning whiter than bone
if you can erase it then i can atone
oh these days oh these days get heavy

prechorus  chorus
i get older and life fades
but you remain
open up again i believe in second chances
please let me in oh i believe in second chances
i wont break you i will not let you down
open up again i believe in second chances
