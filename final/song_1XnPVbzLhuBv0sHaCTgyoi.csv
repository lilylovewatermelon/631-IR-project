this is the david bowies song

verse 1
we passed upon the stairs
we spoke of was and when
although i wasnt there
he said i was his friend
which came as a surprise
i spoke into his eyes
i thought you died alone
a long long time ago

chorus
who knows not me
we never lost control
youre face to face
with the man who sold the world

verse 2
i laughed and shook his hand
and made my way back home
i searched for foreign land
for years and years i roamed
i gazed a gazeless stare
wе walked a million hills
i must have died alonе
a long long time ago

we never lost control
youre face to face
with the man who sold the world

chorus
who knows not me
we never lost control
youre face to face
with the man who sold the world
