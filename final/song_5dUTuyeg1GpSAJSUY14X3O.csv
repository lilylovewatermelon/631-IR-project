phones lighting up grab my favourite shirt and my keys on the counter
cause you said you wanna dance
halfway down the drive mustve changed your mind
it aint even been an hour tell me youve got other plans
i wouldnt be surprised if later or tonight
youre calling begging me to come over

chorus
cause baby im caught up in the back and forth
im somewhere in the middle of you
and i dont know what i do it for
you love me you hate me
you make me you break me
ooh yeah

verse 2
ooh when you do what you do its like you do it on purpose
got me spinning in circles
first you say youre mad then you take it back
like youve forgotten all about it
i dont even understand

chorus
why baby im caught up in the back and forth
im somewhere in the middle of you
and i dont know what i do it for
you love me you hate me
you make me you break me
see dan  shay liveget tickets as low as 12you might also likebridge
you love me you hate me
you make me you break me
ooh its like you do it on purpose

outro
and baby im caught up in the back and forth
im somewhere in the middle of you
and i dont know what i do it for
you love me you hate me
you make me you break me
im somewhere in the middle of you
somewhere in the middle of you
and i dont know what i do it for
you love me you hate me
you make me you break me
ooh you break me
ooh
you love me you hate me
oh you break me1embed"
