twano got the recipe


and i juss burned my lip on this grabba leaf
it’s money in my pocket
every time that i do laundry
smoke out my nose
baby imma prodigy

how you block a nigga
just to follow me
now i do my thang
use to care
if they was proud at me

niggas hatin on me
but they wish that
they was hot as me
people make me nervous
so that’s why i keep a glock wit me
who gon rock wit me
sometime i question my self

who gon have that money
just to post up my bail
this bitch want a hunnid
and it’s just for her nails
you might also likewhen i was 14
i was serving them grams
and when i goto sleep
i be dreaming bout bands
phone line ring
this is trap on demand
like that tax free money
tell em fuck uncle sam

ian file my taxes
ion even think i’m gettin shit
mansion in miami
tell a thotty that we gettin lit
fuck with how i’m livin
but she’ll never understand
we been gettin money
but ain’t postin on the gram

my nigga just jumped
did 2 in the can
and a couple bitches ghosted
but they all wanna fuck now
this nigga owe me money
i juss prayed not to run down
i juss caught a play
from my mans
that’s a rebound
we don’t ever close
even on the holidays
trap all day
sun up till the sundown
2022 i’m tryna own a couple
buss downs
niggas talk a lot
but when i see them
they be hush mouth

rock a plain jane
with the cuts in my teeth
you don’t get no cash
lil nigga take a seat
lurkin on my twitter
ian kno you was a creep
i juss flew back to miami
but i never left the heat
pussy so good
put a nigga right to sleep
her attitude bad
but we buried in the sheets

told me she’ll be fine yea
i know she be goin through it
she expensive get a bag
and she be running through it
nowadays everybody wanna flex hard
said you drinkin act
but i know  u drinking wok hart
says you gotta foreign
u don’t even gotta push start
grown bitch 36
like a powder key
jewelry on my body
fell in love with all the finer things
niggas say they gangster
but they really be drama queensembed"
