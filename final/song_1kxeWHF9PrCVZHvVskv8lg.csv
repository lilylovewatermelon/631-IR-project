im not loving you way i wanted to
what i had to do had to run from you
im in love with you but the vibe is wrong
and that haunted me all the way home
so you never know never never know
never know enough til its over love
til we lose control system overload
screaming no no no nnooo
im not loving you way i wanted to
see i wanna move but cant escape from you
so i keep it low keep a secret code
so everybody else dont have to know

chorus
so keep your love lockdown your love lockdown
keeping your love lockdown your love lockdown
now keep your love lockdown your love lockdown
now keep your love lockdown you lose

verse 2
im not loving you way i wanted to
i cant keep my cool so i keep it true
i got something to lose so i gotta move
i cant keep myself and still keep you too
so i keep in mind when im on my own
somewhere far from home in the danger zone
how many times did i tell you fore it finally got through
you lose you lose
im not loving you way i wanted to
see i had to go see i had to move
no more wasting time you cant wait for life
were just racin time wheres the finish line

so keep your love lockdown your love lockdown
keeping your love lockdown your love lockdown
now keep your love lockdown your love lockdown
now keep your love lockdown you lose

verse 3
im not loving you way i wanted to
i bet no one knew i got no one new
know i said im through but got love for you
but im not loving you the way i wanted to
gotta keep it goin keep the loving goin
keep it on the roll only god knows
if i be with you baby im confused
you choose you choose
im not loving you way i wanted to
where i wanna go i dont need you
ive been down this road too many times before
im not loving you way i wanted to

chorus
so keep your love lockdown your love lockdown
keeping your love lockdown your love lockdown
now keep your love lockdown your love lockdown
now keep your love lockdown you lose
outro
you lose you lose
you lose you lose
