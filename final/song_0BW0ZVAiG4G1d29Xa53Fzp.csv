skinny little skater boys
they only wanna play
they jump around all day
but you can never make them stay
pretty girls in overalls
are everywhere these days
talking up their game
but they only go away

chorus
all of this to say
its just an ordinary day

verse 2
little birds might sing to you
as if they were your friend
but dont be fooled again
they only want whats in your hand
couple with the silver hair
kissing on the bench
falling in love again
guess it never ends

chorus
all of this to say
its just an ordinary day
all the world to stay
on an ordinary dayyou might also likeembed"
