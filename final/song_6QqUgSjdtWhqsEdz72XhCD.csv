i gave too much of my heart tonight
can you come to where im staying
and make some extra love
that i can save til tomorrows show

cause i need somebody to remember my name
after all that i can do for them is done
i need someone to remember me

i need something bigger than the sky
hold it in my arms and know its mine
just how many stars will i need to hang around me
to finally call it heaven

after all that i can do for them is done
