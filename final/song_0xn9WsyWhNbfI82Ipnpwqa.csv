judging from recent conversations among thirdworld intellectuals there is now an obsessive return of the national situation itself the name of the country that returns again and again like a gong the collective attention to us and what we have to do and how we do it to what we cant do and what we do better than this or that nationality our unique characteristics in short to the level of the people this is not the way american intellectuals have been discussing america and indeed one might feel that the whole matter is nothing but that old thing called nationalism long since liquidated here and rightly so yet a certain nationalism is fundamental in the third world and also in the most vital areas of the second world thus making it legitimate to ask whether it is all that bad in the end1 does in fact the message of some disabused and more experienced firstworld wisdom that of europe even more than of the united states consist in urging these nation states to outgrow it as fast as possible the predictable reminders of kampuchea and of iraq and iran do not really seem to me to settle anything or suggest by what these nationalisms might be replaced except perhaps some global american postmodernist culture

many arguments can be made for the importance and interest of non­ canonical forms of literature such as that of the third world 2 but one is peculiarly selfdefeating because it borrows the weapons of the adversary the strategy of trying to prove that these texts are as great as those of the canon itself the object is then to show that to take an example from another noncanonical form dashiell hammett is really as great as dostoyevsky and therefore can be admitted this is to attempt dutifully to wish away all traces of that pulp format which is constitutive of subgenres and it invites immediate failure insofar as any passionate reader of dostoyevsky will know at once after a few pages that those kinds of satisfactions are not present nothing is to be gained by passing over in silence the radical difference of noncanonical texts the thirdworld novel will not offer the satisfactions of proust or joyce what is more damaging than that perhaps is its tendency to remind us of outmoded stages of our own firstworld cultural development and to cause us to conclude that they are still writing novels like dreiser or sherwood anderson

a case could be built on this kind of discouragement with its deep existential commitment to a rhythm of modernist innovation if not fashionchanges but it

66

would not be a moralizinghistoricist one rather which challenges our imprisonment in the present of postmodernism and calls for a reinvention of the radical difference of our own cultural past and its now seemingly oldfashioned situations and novelties

but i would rather argue all this a different way at least for now 3 these reactions to thirdworld texts are at one and the same time perfectly natural perfectly comprehensible and terribly parochial if the purpose of the canon is to restrict our aesthetic sympathies to develop a range of rich and subtle perceptions which can be exercised only on the occasion of a small but choice body of texts to discourage us from reading anything else or from reading those things in different ways then it is humanly impoverishing indeed our want of sympathy for these often unmodern thirdworld texts is itself frequently but a disguise for some deeper fear of the affluent about the way people actually live in other parts of the worlda way of life that still has little in common with daily life in the american suburb there is nothing particularly disgraceful in having lived a sheltered life in never having had to confront the difficulties the complications and the frustrations of urban living but it is nothing to be particularly proud of either moreover a limited experience of life normally does not make for a wide range of sympathies with very different kinds of people im thinking of differences that range from gender and race all the way to those of social class and culture

the way in which all this affects the reading process seems to be as follows as western readers whose tastes and much else have been formed by our own modernisms a popular or socially realistic thirdworld novel tends to come before us not immediately but as though alreadyread we sense between ourselves and this alien text the presence of another reader of the other reader for whom a narrative which strikes us as conventional or naive has a freshness of information and a social interest that we cannot share the fear and the resistance im evoking has to do then with the sense of our own noncoincidence with that other reader so different from ourselves our sense that to coincide in any adequate way with that other ideal readerthat is to say to read this text adequatelywe would have to give up a great deal that is individually precious to us and acknowledge an existence and a situation unfamiliar and therefore frighteningone that we do not know and prefer not to know

why returning to the question of the canon should we only read certain kinds of books no one is suggesting we should not read those but why should we not also read other ones we are not after all being shipped to that desert island beloved of the devisers of great books lists and as a matter of factand this is to me the conclusive nail in the argumentwe all do read many different kinds of texts in this life of ours since whether we are willing to admit it or not we spend much of our existence in the force field of a mass culture that is radically

67

different from our great books and live at least a double life in the various compartments of our unavoidably fragmented society we need to be aware that we are even more fundamentally fragmented than that rather than clinging to this particular mirage of the centered subject and the unified personal identity we would do better to confront honestly the fact of fragmentation on a global scale it is a confrontation with which we can here at least make a cultural beginning

a final observation on my use of the term third world i take the point of criticisms of this expression particularly those which stress the way in which it obliterates profound differences between a whole range of nonwestern countries and situations indeed one such fundamental oppositionbetween the traditions of the great eastern empires and those of the postcolonial african nation states­is central in what follows i dont however see any comparable expression that articulates as this one does the fundamental breaks between the capitalist first world the socialist bloc of the second world and a range of other countries which have suffered the experience of colonialism and imperialism one can only deplore the ideological implications of oppositions such as that between developed and underdeveloped or developing countries while the more recent conception of northern and southern tiers which has a very different ideological content and import than the rhetoric of development and is used by very different people nonetheless implies an unquestioning acceptance of convergence theory namely the idea that the soviet union and the united states are from this perspective largely the same thing i am using the term third world in an essentially descriptive sense and objections to it do not strike me as especially relevant to the argument i am making

  
in these last years of the century the old question of a properly world literature reasserts itself this is due as much or more to the disintegration of our own conceptions of cultural study as to any very lucid awareness of the great outside world around us we may thereforeas humanistsacknowledge the pertinence of the critique of presentday humanities by our titular leader william bennett without finding any great satisfaction in his embarrassing solution yet another impoverished and ethnocentric graecojudaic great books list of the civilization of the west great texts great minds great ideas4 one is tempted to turn back on bennett himself the question he approvingly quotes from maynard mack how long can a democratic nation afford to support a narcissistic minority so transfixed by its own image nevertheless the present moment does offer a remarkable opportunity to rethink our humanities curriculum in a new wayto reexamine the shambles and ruins of all our older great books humanities freshmanintroductory and core course type traditions

today the reinvention of cultural studies in the united states demands the reinvention in a new situation of what goethe long ago theorized as world literature in our more immediate context then any conception of world literature necessarily demands some specific engagement with the question of third­world literature and it is this not necessarily narrower subject about which i have something to say today

it would be presumptuous to offer some general theory of what is often called thirdworld literature given the enormous variety both of national cultures in the third world and of specific historical trajectories in each of those areas all of this then is provisional and intended both to suggest specific perspectives for research and to convey a sense of the interest and value of these clearly neglected literatures for people formed by the values and stereotypes of a firstworld culture one important distinction would seem to impose itself at the outset namely that none of these cultures can be conceived as anthropologically independent or autonomous rather they are all in various distinct ways locked in a lifeanddeath struggle with firstworld cultural imperialisma cultural struggle that is itself a reflection of the economic situation of such areas in their penetration by various stages of capital or as it is sometimes euphemistically termed of modernization this then is some first sense in which a study of thirdworld culture necessarily entails a new view of ourselves from the outside insofar as we ourselves are perhaps without fully knowing it constitutive forces powerfully at work on the remains of older cultures in our general world capitalist system

but if this is the case the initial distinction that imposes itself has to do with the nature and development of older cultures at the moment of capitalist penetration something it seems to me most enlightening to examine in terms of the marxian concept of modes of production5 contemporary historians seem to be in the process of reaching a consensus on the specificity of feudalism as a form which issuing from the breakup of the roman empire or the japanese shogunate is able to develop directly into capitalism6 this is not the case with the other modes of production which in some sense must be disaggregated or destroyed by violence before capitalism is able to implant its specific forms and displace the older ones in the gradual expansion of capitalism across the globe then our economic system confronts two very distinct modes of production that pose two very different types of social and cultural resistance to its influence these are socalled primitive or tribal society on the one hand and the asiatic mode of production or the great bureaucratic imperial systems on the other african societies and cultures as they became the object of systematic colonization in the 1880s provide the most striking examples of the symbiosis of capital and tribal societies while china and india offer the principal examples of another and quite different sort of engagement of capitalism with the great empires of the socalled

69

asiatic mode my examples below then will be primarily african and chinese however the special case of latin america must be noted in passing latin america offers yet a third kind of developmentone involving an even earlier destruction of imperial systems now projected by collective memory back into the archaic or tribal thus the earlier nominal conquests of independence open them at once to a kind of indirect economic penetration and controlsomething africa and asia will come to experience only more recently with decolonization in the
1950s and 60s

having made these initial distinctions let me now by way of a sweeping hypothesis try to say what all thirdworld cultural productions seem to have in common and what distinguishes them radically from analogous cultural forms in the first world all thirdworld texts are necessarily i want to argue allegorical and in a very specific way they are to be read as what i will call national allegories even when or perhaps i should say particularly when their forms develop out of predominantly western machineries of representation such as the novel let me try to state this distinction in a grossly oversimplified way one of the determinants of capitalist culture that is the culture of the western realist and modernist novel is a radical split between the private and the public between the poetic and the political between what we have come to think of as the domain of sexuality and the unconscious and that of the public world of classes of the economic and of secular political power in other words freud versus marx our numerous theoretical attempts to overcome this great split only reconfirm its existence and its shaping power over our individual and collective lives we have been trained in a deep cultural conviction that the lived experience of our private existences is somehow incommensurable with the abstractions of economic science and politi­ cal dynamics politics in our novels therefore is according to stendhals canonical formulation a pistol shot in the middle of a concert

i will argue that although we may retain for convenience and for analysis such categories as the subjective and the public or political the relations between them are wholly different in thirdworld culture thirdworld texts even those which are seemingly private and invested with a properly libidinal dynamic­ necessarily project a political dimension in the form of national allegory the story of the private individual destiny is always an allegory of the embattled situation of the public thirdworld culture and society need i add that it is precisely this very different ratio of the political to the personal which makes such texts alien to us at first approach and consequently resistant to our conventional western habits of reading

i will offer as something like the supreme example of this process of allegori­ zation the first masterwork of chinas greatest writer lu xun whose neglect in western cultural studies is a matter of shame which no excuses based on ignorance

70

can rectify diary of a madman 1918 must at first be read by any western reader as the protocol of what our essentially psychological language terms a nervous breakdown it offers the notes and perceptions of a subject in intensify­ ing prey to a terrifying psychic delusion the conviction that the people around him are concealing a dreadful secret and that that secret can be none other than the increasingly obvious fact that they are cannibals at the climax of the development of the delusion which threatens his own physical safety and his very life itself as a potential victim the narrator understands that his own brother is himself a cannibal and that the death of their little sister a number of years earlier far from being the result of childhood illness as he had thought was in reality a murder as befits the protocol of a psychosis these perceptions are objective ones which can be rendered without any introspective machinery the paranoid subject observes sinister glances around him in the real world he overhears telltale conversations between his brother and an alleged physician obviously in reality another cannibal which carry all the conviction of the real and can be objectively or realistically represented this is not the place to demonstrate in any detail the absolute pertinence to lu xuns case history of the preeminent western or firstworld reading of such phenomena namely freuds interpretation of the paranoid delusions of senatspräsident schreber an emptying of the world a radical withdrawal of libido what schreber describes as worldcatastrophe followed by the attempt to recathect by the obviously imperfect mechanisms of paranoia the delusionformation freud explains which we take to be a pathological product is in reality an attempt at recovery a process of reconstruction7

what is reconstructed however is a grisly and terrifying objective real world beneath the appearances of our own world an unveiling or deconcealment of the nightmarish reality of things a stripping away of our conventional illusions or rationalizations about daily life and existence it is a process comparable as a literary effect only to some of the processes of western modernism and in particu­ lar of existentialism in which narrative is employed as a powerful instrument for the experimental exploration of reality and illusion an exploration which how­ ever unlike some of the older realisms presupposes a certain prior personal knowledge the reader must in other words have had some analogous experience whether in physical illness or psychic crisis of a lived and balefully trans­ formed real world from which we cannot even mentally escape for the full horror of lu xuns nightmare to be appreciated terms like depression deform such experience by psychologizing it and projecting it back into the pathological other while the analogous western literary approaches to this same experienceim thinking of the archetypal deathbed murmur of kurtz in conrads heart of darkness the horror the horrorrecontains precisely that horror by transforming it into a rigorously private and subjective mood which can only be
71

designated by recourse to an aesthetic of expressionthe unspeakable unnameable inner feeling whose external formulation can only designate it from without like a symptom

but this representational power of lu xuns text cannot be appreciated prop­erly without some sense of what i have called its allegorical resonance for it should be clear that the cannibalism literally apprehended by the sufferer in the attitudes and bearing of his family and neighbors is at one and the same time being attributed by lu xun himself to chinese society as a whole and if this attribution is to be called figural it is indeed a figure more powerful and literal than the literal level of the text lu xuns proposition is that the people of this great maimed and retarded disintegrating china of the late and postimperial period his fellow citizens are literally cannibals in their desperation disguised and indeed intensified by the most traditional forms and procedures of chinese culture they must devour one another ruthlessly to stay alive this occurs at all levels of that exceedingly hierarchical society from lumpens and peasants all the way to the most privileged elite positions in the mandarin bureaucracy it is i want to stress a social and historical nightmare a vision of the horror of life specifically grasped through history itself whose consequences go far beyond the more local western realistic or naturalistic representation of cutthroat capitalist or market competition and it exhibits a specifically political resonance absent from its natural or mythological western equivalent in the nightmare of darwinian natural selection

now i want to offer four additional remarks about this text which will touch respectively on the libidinal dimension of the story on the structure of its allegory on the role of the thirdworld cultural producer himself and on the perspective of futurity projected by the tales double resolution i will be concerned in dealing with all four of these topics to stress the radical structural difference between the dynamics of thirdworld culture and those of the firstworld cultural tradition in which we have ourselves been formed

i have suggested that in thirdworld texts such as this story by lu xun the relationship between the libidinal and the political components of individual and social experience is radically different from what obtains in the west and what shapes our own cultural forms let me try to characterize this difference or if you like this radical reversal by way of the following generalization in the west conventionally political commitment is recontained and psychologized or subjectivized by way of the publicprivate split i have already evoked interpretations for example of political movements of the 60s in terms of oedipal revolts are familiar to everyone and need no further comment that such interpretations are episodes in a much longer tradition whereby political commitment is repsychologized and accounted for in terms of the subjective dynamics of ressentiment or the authorita

72

rian personality is perhaps less well understood but can be demonstrated by a careful reading of antipolitical texts from nietzsche and conrad all the way to the latest coldwar propaganda

what is relevant to our present context is not however the demonstration of that proposition but rather of its inversion in thirdworld culture where i want to suggest that psychology or more specifically libidinal investment is to be read in primarily political and social terms it is i hope unnecessary to add that what follows is speculative and very much subject to correction by specialists it is offered as a methodological example rather than a theory of chinese culture were told for one thing that the great ancient imperial cosmologies identify by analogy what we in the west analytically separate thus the classical sex manuals are at one with the texts that reveal the dynamics of political forces the charts of the heavens at one with the logic of medical lore and so forth8 here already then in an ancient past western antinomiesand most particularly that between the subjective and the public or politicalare refused in advance the libidinal center of lu xuns text is however not sexuality but rather the oral stage the whole bodily question of eating of ingestion devoration incorporation from which such fundamental categories as the pure and the impure spring we must now recall not merely the extraordinary symbolic complexity of chinese cuisine but also the central role this art and practice occupies in chinese culture as a whole when we find that centrality confirmed by the observation that the very rich chinese vocabulary for sexual matters is extraordinarily intertwined with the language of eating and when we observe the multiple uses to which the verb to eat is put in ordinary chinese language one eats a fear or a fright for example we may feel in a somewhat better position to sense the enormous sensitivity of this libidinal region and of lu xuns mobilization of it for the dramatization of an essentially social nightmaresomething which in a western writer would be consigned to the realm of the merely private obsession the vertical dimension of the personal trauma

a different alimentary transgression can be observed throughout lu xuns works but nowhere quite so strikingly as in his terrible little story medicine the story portrays a dying childthe death of children is a constant in these workswhose parents have the good fortune to procure an infallible remedy at this point we must recall both that traditional chinese medicine is not taken as in the west but eaten and that for lu xun traditional chinese medicine was the supreme locus of the unspeakable and exploitative charlatanry of traditional chinese culture in general in his crucially important preface to the first collection of his stories9 he recounts the suffering and death of his own father from tuberculosis while declining family reserves rapidly disappeared into the purchase of expensive and rare exotic and ludicrous medicaments we will not sense the

73

symbolic significance of this indignation unless we remember that for all these reasons lu xun decided to study western medicine in japanthe epitome of some new western science that promised collective regenerationonly later to decide that the production of culturei am tempted to say the elaboration of a political culturewas a more effective form of political medicine10 as a writer then lu xun remains a diagnostician and a physician hence this terrible story in which the cure for the male child the fathers only hope for survival in future generations turns out to be one of those large doughywhite chinese steamed rolls soaked in the blood of a criminal who has just been executed the child dies anyway of course but it is important to note that the hapless victim of a more properly state violence the supposed criminal was a political militant whose grave is mysteriously covered in flowers by absent sympathizers of whom one knows nothing in the analysis of a story like this we must rethink our conventional conception of the symbolic levels of a narrative where sexuality and politics might be in homology to each other for instance as a set of loops or circuits which intersect and overdetermine each otherthe enormity of therapeutic cannibalism finally intersecting in a paupers cemetery with the more overt violence of family betrayal and political repression

this new mapping process brings me to the cautionary remark i wanted to make about allegory itselfa form long discredited in the west and the specific target of the romantic revolution of wordsworth and coleridge yet a linguistic structure which also seems to be experiencing a remarkable reawakening of interest in contemporary literary theory if allegory has once again become somehow congenial for us today as over against the massive and monumental unifications of an older modernist symbolism or even realism itself it is because the allegorical spirit is profoundly discontinuous a matter of breaks and heterogeneities of the multiple polysemia of the dream rather than the homogeneous representation of the symbol our traditional conception of allegorybased for instance on stereotypes of bunyan is that of an elaborate set of figures and personifications to be read against some onetoone table of equivalences this is so to speak a onedimensional view of this signifying process which might only be set in motion and complexified were we willing to entertain the more alarming notion that such equivalences are themselves in constant change and transformation at each perpetual present of the text

here too lu xun has some lessons for us this writer of short stories and sketches which never evolved into the novel form as such produced at least one approach to the longer form in a much lengthier series of anecdotes about a hapless coolie named ah q who comes to serve as we might have suspected as the allegory of a certain set of chinese attitudes and modes of behavior it is interesting to note that the enlargement of the form determines a shift in tone or
74

generic discourse now everything that had been stricken with the stillness and emptiness of death and suffering without hopethe room was not only too silent it was far too big as well and the things in it were far too empty11 becomes material for a more properly chaplinesque comedy ah qs resiliency springs from an unusualbut we are to understand culturally very normal and familiartechnique for overcoming humiliation when set upon by his persecutors ah q serene in his superiority over them reflects it is as if i were beaten by my own son what is the world coming to nowadays  thereupon he too would walk away satisfied at having won12 admit that you are not even human they insist that you are nothing but an animal on the contrary he tells them im worse than an animal im an insect there does that satisfy you in less than ten seconds however ah q would walk away also satisfied that he had won thinking that he was after all number one in selfbelittlement and that after removing the selfbelittlement what remained was still the glory of remaining number one13 when one recalls the remarkable selfesteem of the manchu dynasty in its final throes and the serene contempt for foreign devils who had nothing but modern science gunboats armies technology and power to their credit one achieves a more precise sense of the historical and social topicality of lu xuns satire

ah q is thus allegorically china itself what i want to observe however what complicates the whole issue is that his persecutorsthe idlers and bullies who find their daily pleasures in getting a rise out of just such miserable victims as ah qthey too are china in the allegorical sense this very simple example then shows the capacity of allegory to generate a range of distinct meanings or messages simultaneously as the allegorical tenor and vehicle change places ah q is china humiliated by the foreigners a china so well versed in the spiritual techniques of selfjustification that such humiliations are not even registered let alone recalled but the persecutors are also china in a different sense the terrible selfcannibalistic china of the diary of a madman whose response to powerlessness is the senseless persecution of the weaker and more inferior members of the hierarchy

all of which slowly brings us to the question of the writer himself in the third world and to what must be called the function of the intellectual it being under­ stood that in the thirdworld situation the intellectual is always in one way or another a political intellectual no thirdworld lesson is more timely or more urgent for us today among whom the very term intellectual has withered away as though it were the name for an extinct species nowhere has the strangeness of this vacant position been brought home to me more strongly than on a recent trip to cuba when i had occasion to visit a remarkable collegepreparatory school on the outskirts of havana it is a matter of some shame for an american to witness the cultural curriculum in a socialist setting which also very much identifies itself

75

with the third world over some three or four years cuban teenagers study poems of homer dantes inferno the spanish theatrical classics the great realistic novels of the 19thcentury european tradition and finally contemporary cuban revolutionary novels of which incidentally we desperately need english translations but the semesters work i found most challenging was one explicitly devoted to the study of the role of the intellectual as such the cultural intellectual who is also a political militant the intellectual who produces both poetry and praxis the cuban illustrations of this processho chi minh and augustino nietoare obviously enough culturally determined our own equivalents would probably be the more familiar figures of dubois and clr james of sartre and neruda or brecht of kollontai or louise michel but as this whole talk aims implicitly at suggesting a new conception of the humanities in american education today it is appropriate to add that the study of the role of the intellectual as such ought to be a key component in any such proposals

ive already said something about lu xuns own conception of his vocation and its extrapolation from the practice of medicine but there is a great deal more to be said specifically about the preface not only is it one of the fundamental documents for understanding the situation of the third world artist it is also a dense text in its own right fully as much a work of art as any of the greatest stories and in lu xuns own work it is the supreme example of the very unusual ratio of subjective investment and a deliberately depersonalized objective narration we have no time to do justice to those relationships which would demand a linebyline commentary yet i will quote the little fable by which lu xun responding to requests for publication by his friends and future collaborators dramatizes his dilemmaimagine an iron house without windows absolutely indestructible with many people fast sleep inside who will shortly die of suffocation but you know that since they will die in their sleep they will not feel the pain of death now if you cry aloud to wake a few of the lighter sleepers making those unfortunate few suffer the agony of irrevocable death do you think you are doing them a good turn 14the seemingly hopeless situation of the thirdworld intellectual in this historical period shortly after the founding of the chinese communist party but also after the bankruptcy of the middleclass revolution had become apparentin which no solutions no forms of praxis or change seem conceivablethis situation will find its parallel as we shall see shortly in the situation of african intellectuals after the achievement of independence when once again no political solutions seem present or visible on the historical horizon the formal or literary manifestation of

76

this political problem is the possibility of narrative closure something we will return to more specifically

in a more general theoretical contextand it is this theoretical form of the problem i should now like at least to thematize and set in place on the agendawe must recover a sense of what cultural revolution means in its strongest form in the marxist tradition the reference is not to the immediate events of that violent and tumultuous interruption of the eleven years in recent chinese history al­ though some reference to maoism as a doctrine is necessarily implicit the term we are told was lenins own and in that form explicitly designated the literacy campaign and the new problems of universal scholarity and education something of which cuba again remains the most stunning and successful example in recent history we must however enlarge the conception still further to include a range of seemingly very different preoccupations of which the names of gramsci and wilhelm reich frantz fanon herbert marcuse rudolph bahro and paolo freire may give an indication of their scope and focus overhastily i will suggest that cultural revolution as it is projected in such works turns on the phenomenon of what gramsci called subalternity namely the feelings of mental inferiority and habits of subservience and obedience which necessarily and structurally develop in situations of dominationmost dramatically in the experience of colonized peoples but here as so often the subjectivizing and psychologizing habits of firstworld peoples such as ourselves can play us false and lead us into misunderstandings subalternity is not in that sense a psychological matter although it governs psychologies and i suppose that the strategic choice of the term cultural aims precisely at restructuring that view of the problem and projecting it outwards into the realm of objective or collective spirit in some nonpsychological but also nonreductionist or noneconomistic materialistic fashion when a psychic structure is objectively determined by economic and political relation­ ships it cannot be dealt with by means of purely psychological therapies yet it equally cannot be dealt with by means of purely objective transformations of the economic and political situation itself since the habits remain and exercise a baleful and crippling residual effect15 this is a more dramatic form of that old mystery the unity of theory and practice and it is specifically in the context of this problem of cultural revolution now so strange and alien to us that the achievements and failures of thirdworld intellectuals writers and artists must be replaced if their concrete historical meaning is to be grasped we have allowed ourselves as firstworld cultural intellectuals to restrict our consciousness of our lifes work to the narrowest professional or bureaucratic terms thereby encouraging in ourselves a special sense of subalternity and guilt which only reinforces the vicious circle that a literary article could be a political act with real consequences is for most of us little more than a curiosity of the literary history of czarist

77

russia or of modern china itself but we perhaps should also consider the possibility that as intellectuals we ourselves are at present soundly sleeping in that indestructable iron room of which lu xun spoke on the point of suffocation

the matter of narrative closure then and of the relationship of a narrative text to futurity and to some collective project yet to come is not merely a formal or literarycritical issue diary of a madman has in fact two distinct and incom­ patible endings which prove instructive to examine in light of the writers own hesitations and anxieties about his social role one ending that of the deluded subject himself is very much a call to the future in the impossible situation of a wellnigh universal cannibalism the last desperate lines launched into the void are the words save the children  but the tale has a second ending as well which is disclosed on the opening page when the older supposedly cannibalistic brother greets the narrator with the following cheerful remark i appreciate your coming such a long way to see us but my brother recovered some time ago and has gone elsewhere to take up an official post so in advance the nightmare is annulled the paranoid visionary his brief and terrible glimpse of the grisly reality beneath the appearance now vouchsafed gratefully returns to the realm of illusion and oblivion therein again to take up his place in the space of bureaucratic power and privilege i want to suggest that it is only at this price by way of a complex play of simultaneous and antithetical messages that the narrative text is able to open up a concrete perspective on the real future

  

i must interrupt myself here to interpolate several observations before proceeding for one thing it is clear to me that any articulation of radical differencethat of gender incidentally fully as much as that of culture is susceptible to appropriation by that strategy of otherness which edward said in the context of the middle east called orientalism it does not matter much that the radical otherness of the culture in question is praised or valorized positively as in the preceding pages the essential operation is that of differentiation and once that has been accomplished the mechanism said denounces has been set in place on the other hand i dont see how a firstworld intellectual can avoid this operation without falling back into some general liberal and humanistic universalism it seems to me that one of our basic political tasks lies precisely in the ceaseless effort to remind the american public of the radical difference of other national situations

but at this point one should insert a cautionary reminder about the dangers of the concept of culture itself the very speculative remarks i have allowed myself to make about chinese culture will not be complete unless i add that culture in this sense is by no means the final term at which one stops one must imagine

78

such cultural structures and attitudes as having been themselves in the beginning vital responses to infrastructural realities economic and geographic for example as attempts to resolve more fundamental contradictionsattempts which then outlive the situations for which they were devised and survive in reified forms as cultural patterns those patterns themselves then become part of the objective situation confronted by later generations and as in the case of confucianism having once been part of the solution to a dilemma then become part of the new problem

nor can i feel that the concept of cultural identity or even national iden­tity is adequate one cannot acknowledge the justice of the general poststructuralist assault on the socalled centered subject the old unified ego of bourgeois individualism and then resuscitate this same ideological mirage of psychic unification on the collective level in the form of a doctrine of collective identity appeals to collective identity need to be evaluated from a historical perspective rather than from the standpoint of some dogmatic and placeless ideological analysis when a thirdworld writer invokes this to us ideological value we need to examine the concrete historical situation closely in order to determine the political consequences of the strategic use of this concept lu xuns moment for example is very clearly one in which a critique of chinese culture and cultural identity has powerful and revolutionary consequences­ consequences which may not obtain in a later social configuration this is then perhaps another and more complicated way of raising the issue of nationalism to which i referred earlier

as far as national allegory is concerned i think it may be appropriate to stress its presence in what is generally considered western literature in order to under­ score certain structural differences the example i have in mind is the work of benito perez galdosthe last and among the richest achievements of 19th century realism galdos novels are more visibly allegorical in the national sense than most of their betterknown european predecessors 16 something that might well be explained in terms of immanuel wallersteins worldsystem terminology17 although 19th century spain is not strictly peripheral after the fashion of the countries we are here designating under the term third world it is certainly semi­peripheral in his sense when contrasted with england or france it is therefore not terribly surprising to find the situation of the male protagonist of fortunata y jacinta 1887alternating between the two women of the title between the wife and the mistress between the woman of the uppermiddle classes and the woman of the peoplecharacterized in terms of the nationstate itself hesitating between the republican revolution of 1868 and the bourbon restoration of 187318 here too the same floating or transferable structure of allegorical reference detected in ah q comes into play for fortunata is also married and the alterna

tion of revolution and restoration is likewise adapted to her situation as she leaves her legal home to seek her lover and then returns to it in abandonment

what it is important to stress is not merely the wit of the analogy as galdos uses it but also its optional nature we can use it to convert the entire situation of the novel into an allegorical commentary on the destiny of spain but we are also free to reverse its priorities and to read the political analogy as metaphorical decoration for the individual drama and as a mere figural intensification of this last here far from dramatizing the identity of the political and the individual or psychic the allegorical structure tends essentially to separate these levels in some absolute way we cannot feel its force unless we are convinced of the radical difference between politics and the libidinal so that its operation reconfirms rather than annuls that split between public and private which was attributed to western civilization earlier in our discussion in one of the more powerful contemporary denunciations of this split and this habit deleuze and guattari argue for a conception of desire that is at once social and individualhow does a delirium begin perhaps the cinema is able to capture the movement of madness precisely because it is not analytical or regressive but explores a global field of coexistence witness a film by nicholas ray supposedly represent­ ing the formation of a cortisone delirium an overworked father a highschool teacher who works overtime for a radiotaxi service and is being treated for heart trouble he begins to rave about the educational system in general the need to restore a pure race the salvation of the social and moral order then he passes to religion the timeliness of a return to the bible abraham but what in fact did abraham do well now he killed or wanted to kill his son and perhaps gods only error lies in having stayed his hand but doesnt this man the films protagonist have a son of his own hmmm  what the film shows so well to the shame of psychiatrists is that every delirium is first of all the investment of a field that is social economic political cultural racial and racist pedagogical and religious the delirious person applies a delirium to his family and his son that overreaches them on all sides 19i am not myself sure that the objective consequences of this essentially social and concrete gap in firstworld experience between the public and the private can be abolished by intellectual diagnosis or by some more adequate theory of their deeper interrelationship rather it seems to me that what deleuze and guattari are proposing here is a new and more adequate allegorical reading of this film such allegorical structures then are not so much absent from firstworld cultural texts as they are unconscious and therefore they must be deciphered by interpretive mechanisms that necessarily entail a whole social and historical critique of our current firstworld situation the point here is that in distinction to the uncon

scious allegories of our own cultural texts thirdworld national allegories are conscious and overt they imply a radically different and objective relationship of politics to libidinal dynamics

  

now before turning to the african texts i remind you of the very special occasion of the present talk which is concerned to honor the memory of robert c elliott and to commemorate his lifes work i take it that the very center of his two most important books the power of satire and the shape of utopia20 is to be found in his path breaking association of satire and the utopian impulse as two seemingly antithetical drives and literary discourses which in reality replicate each other such that each is always secretly active within the others sphere of influence all satire he taught us necessarily carries a utopian frame of reference within itself all utopias no matter how serene or disembodied are driven secretly by the satirists rage at a fallen reality when i spoke of futurity a moment ago i took pains to withhold the world utopia which in my language is another word for the socialist project

but now i will be more explicit and take as my motto an astonishing passage from the novel xala by the great contemporary senegalese novelist and film­ maker ousmane sembene the title designates a ritual curse or affliction of a very special kind which has been visited on a prosperous and corrupt senegalese businessman at the moment in which at the height of his fortune he takes to himself a beautiful young third wife shades of the power of satire the curse is of course as you may have guessed sexual impotence the hadj the unfortunate hero of this novel desperately explores a number of remedies both western and tribal to no avail and is finally persuaded to undertake a laborious trip into the hinterland of dakar to seek out a shaman of reputedly extraordinary powers here is the conclusion of his hot and dusty journey in a horsedrawn cartas they emerged from a ravine they saw conical thatched roofs greyblack with weathering standing out against the horizon in the middle of the empty plain freeranging skinny cattle with dangerouslooking horns fenced with one another to get at what little grass there was no more than silhouettes in the distance a few people were busy around the only well the driver of the cart was in familiar territory and greeted people as they passed sereen madas house apart from its imposing size was identical in construction with all the others it was situated in the center of the village whose huts were arranged in a semicircle which you entered by a single main entrance the village had neither shop nor school nor dispensary there was nothing at all attractive about it in fact gusmane concludes then he adds as if in afterthought this searing line there was nothing at all attractive about it in fact its life was based on the principles of community interdependence 2181

here then more emblematically than virtually any other text i know the space of a past and future utopiaa social world of collective cooperationis dramatically inserted into the corrupt and westernized money economy of the new post­ independence national or comprador bourgeoisie indeed ousmane takes pains to show us that the hadj is not an industrialist that his business is in no sense productive but functions as a middleman between european multinationals and local extraction industries to this biographical sketch must be added a very significant fact that in his youth the hadj was political and spent some time in jail for his nationalist and proindependence activities the extraordinary satire of these corrupt classes which ousmane will extend to the person of senghor him­ self in the last of the empire is explicitly marked as the failure of the independence movement to develop into a general social revolution

the fact of nominal national independence in latin america in the 19th century in africa in the mid20th puts an end to a movement for which genuine national autonomy was the only conceivable goal nor is this symbolic myopia the only problem the african states also had to face the crippling effects of what fanon prophetically warned them againstto receive independence is not the same as to take it since it is in the revolutionary struggle itself that new social relationships and a new consciousness is developed here again the history of cuba is instructive cuba was the last of the latin american nations to win its freedom in the 19th centurya freedom which would immediately be taken in charge by another greater colonial power we now know the incalculable role played in the cuban revolution of 1959 by the protracted guerrilla struggles of the late 19th century of which the figure of jose martf is the emblem contemporary cuba would not be the same without that laborious and subterranean one wants to say thompsonian experience of the mole of history burrowing through a lengthy past and creating its specific traditions in the process

so it is that after the poisoned gift of independence radical african writers like ousmane or like ngugi in kenya find themselves back in the dilemma of lu xun bearing a passion for change and social regeneration which has not yet found its agents i hope it is clear that this is also very much an aesthetic dilemma a crisis of representation it was not difficult to identify an adversary who spoke another language and wore the visible trappings of colonial occupation when those are replaced by your own people the connections to external controlling forces are much more difficult to represent the newer leaders may of course throw off their masks and reveal the person of the dictator whether in its older individual or newer military form but this moment also determines problems of representation the dictator novel has become a virtual genre of latin american literature and such works are marked above all by a profound and uneasy ambivalence a deeper ultimate sympathy for the dictator which can perhaps only be properly accounted

for by some enlarged social variant of the freudian mechanism of transference22

the form normally taken by a radical diagnosis of the failures of contemporary thirdworld societies is however what is conventionally designated as cultural imperialism a faceless influence without representable agents whose literary expression seems to demand the invention of new forms manuel puigs betrayed by rita hayworth may be cited as one of the most striking and innovative of those one is led to conclude that under these circumstances traditional realism is less effective than the satiric fable whence to my mind the greater power of certain of ousmanes narratives besides xala we should mention the moneyorder as over against ngugis impressive but problematical petals of blood

with the fable however we are clearly back into the whole question of allegory the moneyorder mobilizes the traditional catch22 dilemmaits hapless protagonist cannot cash his parisian check without identity papers but since he was born long before independence there are no documents and meanwhile the moneyorder uncashed begins to melt away before an accumulation of new credits and new debts i am tempted to suggest anachronistically that this work published in 1965 prophetically dramatizes the greatest misfortune that can happen to a thirdworld country in our time namely the discovery of vast amounts of oil resourcessomething which as economists have shown us far from representing salvation at once sinks them incalculably into foreign debts they can never dream of liquidating

on another level however this tale raises the issue of what must finally be one of the key problems in any analysis of ousmanes work namely the ambiguous role played in it by archaic or tribal elements viewers may perhaps remember the curious ending of his first film the black girl in which the european employer is inconclusively pursued by the little boy wearing an archaic mask meanwhile such historical films as ceddo or emitai seem intent on evoking older moments of tribal resistance either to islam or to the west yet in a historical perspective which with few exceptions is that of failure and ultimate defeat ousmane cannot however be suspected of any archaizing or nostalgic cultural nationalism thus it becomes important to determine the significance of this appeal to older tribal values particularly as they are more subtly active in modern works like xala or the moneyorder

i suspect that the deeper subject of this second novel is not so much the evident one of the denunciation of a modern national bureaucracy but rather the historical transformation of the traditional islamic value of almsgiving in a contemporary money economy a muslim has the duty to give almsindeed the work concludes with just such another unfulfilled request yet in a modern economy this sacred duty to the poor is transformed into a frenzied assault by freeloaders from all the levels of society at length the cash is appropriated by a

83

westernized and affluent influential cousin the hero is literally picked clean by the vultures better still the unsought for unexpected treasure fallen from heaven at once transforms the entire society around him into ferocious and insatiable petitioners in something like a monetary version of lu xuns cannibalism

the same double historical perspectivearchaic customs radically trans­formed and denatured by the superposition of capitalist relationsseems to me demonstrable in xala as well in the often hilarious results of the more ancient islamic and tribal institution of polygamy this is what ousmane has to say about that institution it being understood that authorial intervention no longer tolerable in realistic narrative is still perfectly suitable to the allegorical fable as a formit is worth knowing something about the life led by urban polygamists it could be called geographical polygamy as opposed to rural polygamy where all the wives and children live together in the same compound in the town since the families a re scattered the children have little contact with their father because of his way of life the father must go from house to house villa to villa and is only there in the evenings at bedtime he is therefore primarily a source of finance when he has work 23indeed we are treated to the vivid spectacle of the hadjs misery when at the moment of his third marriage which should secure his social status he realizes he has no real home of his own and is condemned to shuttle from one wifes villa to the other in a situation in which he suspects each of them in turn as being responsible for his ritual affliction but the passage i have just read shows that­whatever one would wish to think about polygamy in and of itself as an institutionit functions here as a twinvalenced element designed to open up historical perspective the more and more frenzied trips of the hadj through the great city secure a juxtaposition between capitalism and the older collective tribal form of social life

these are not as yet however the most remarkable feature of xala which can be described as a stunning and controlled virtually textbook exercise in what i have elsewhere called generic discontinuities24 the novel begins in effect in one generic convention in terms of which the hadj is read as a comic victim everything goes wrong all at once and the news of his disability suddenly triggers a greater misfortune his numerous debtors begin to descend on someone whose bad luck clearly marks him out as a loser a comic pity and terror accompanies this process though it does not imply any great sympathy for the personage indeed it conveys a greater revulsion against the privileged new westernized society in which this rapid overturning of the wheel of fortune can take place yet we have all been in error as it turns out the wives have not been the source of the ritual

84

curse in an abrupt generic reversal and enlargement comparable to some of the mechanisms freud describes in the uncanny we suddenly learn something new and chilling about the hadjs pastout story goes back a long way it was shortly before your marriage to that woman there dont you remember i was sure you would not what i am now a beggar in rags is addressing him what i am now is your fault do you remember selling a large piece of land at jeko belonging to our clan after falsifying the clan names with the complicity of people in high places you took our land from us in spite of our protests our proof of ownership we lost our case in the courts not satisfied with taking our land you had me thrown into prison 25thus the primordial crime of capitalism is exposed not so much wage labor as such or the ravages of the money form or the remorseless and impersonal rhythms of the market but rather this primal displacement of the older forms of collective life from a land now seized and privatized it is the oldest of modern tragedies visited on the native americans yesterday on the palestinians today and significantly reintroduced by ousmane into his film version of the money­ order called mandabi in which the protagonist is now threatened with the imminent loss of his dwelling itself

the point i want to make about this terrible return of the repressed is that it determines a remarkable generic transformation of the narrative suddenly we are no longer in satire but in ritual the beggars and the lumpens led by sereen mada himself descend on the hadj and require him to submit for the removal of his xala to an abominable ceremony of ritual humiliation and abasement the representational space of the narrative is lifted to a new generic realm which reaches back to touch the powers of the archaic even as it foretells the utopian destruction of the fallen present in the mode of prophecy the word brechtian which inevitably springs to mind probably does inadequate justice to these new forms which have emerged from a properly thirdworld reality yet in light of this unexpected generic ending the preceding satiric text is itself retroactively transformed from a satire whose subjectmatter or content was the ritual curse visited on a character within the narrative it suddenly becomes revealed as a ritual curse in its own rightthe entire imagined chain of events becomes ousmanes own curse upon his hero and people like him no more stunning confirmation could be adduced for robert c elliotts great insight into the anthropological origins of satiric discourse in real acts of shamanistic malediction

i want to conclude with a few thoughts on why all this should be so and on the origins and status of what i have identified as the primacy of national allegory in thirdworld culture we are after all familiar with the mechanisms of auto

85

referentiality in contemporary western literature is this not simply to be taken as another form of that in a structurally distinct social and cultural context perhaps but in that case our priorities must be reversed for proper understanding of this mechanism consider the disrepute of social allegory in our culture and the wellnigh inescapable operation of social allegory in the wests other these two contrasting realities are to be grasped i think in terms of situational conscious­ness an expression i prefer to the more common term materialism hegels old analysis of the masterslave relationship 26 may still be the most effective way of dramatizing this distinction between two cultural logics two equals struggle each for recognition by the other the one is willing to sacrifice life for this supreme value the other a heroic coward in the brechtian schweykian sense of loving the body and the material world too well gives in in order to continue life the masternow the fulfillment of a baleful and inhuman feudalaristocratic disdain for life without honorproceeds to enjoy the benefits of his recognition by the other now become his humble serf or slave but at this point two distinct and dialectically ironic reversals take place only the master is now genuinely human so that recognition by this henceforth subhuman form of life which is the slave evaporates at the moment of its attainment and offers no genuine satisfaction the truth of the master hegel observes grimly is the slave while the truth of the slave on the other hand is the master but a second reversal is in process as well for the slave is called upon to labor for the master and to furnish him with all the material benefits befitting his supremacy but this means that in the end only the slave knows what reality and the resistance of matter really are only the slave can attain some true materialistic consciousness of his situation since it is precisely to that that he is condemned the master however is condemned to idealismto the luxury of a placeless freedom in which any consciousness of his own concrete situation flees like a dream like a word unremembered on the tip of the tongue a nagging doubt which the puzzled mind is unable to formulate

it strikes me that we americans we masters of the world are in something of that very same position the view from the top is epistemologically crippling and reduces its subjects to the illusions of a host of fragmented subjectivities to the poverty of the individual experience of isolated monads to dying individual bodies without collective pasts or futures bereft of any possibility of grasping the social totality this placeless individuality this structural idealism which affords us the luxury of the sartrean blink offers a welcome escape from the nightmare of history but at the same time it condemns our culture to psychologism and the projections of private subjectivity all of this is denied to thirdworld culture which must be situational and materialist despite itself and it is this finally which must account for the allegorical nature of thirdworld culture where the telling of the individual story and the individual experience cannot but ultimately

86

involve the whole laborious telling of the experience of the collectivity itself

i hope i have suggested the epistemological priority of this unfamiliar kind of allegorical vision but i must admit that old habits die hard and that for us such unaccustomed exposure to reality or to the collective totality is often intolerable leaving us in quentins position at the end of absalom absalom murmuring the great denial “idont hate the third world i dont i dont i dont

even that resistance is instructive however and we may well feel confronted with the daily reality of the other twothirds of the globe that there was nothing at all attractive about it in fact but we must not allow ourselves that feeling without also acknowledging its ultimate mocking completion its life was based on the principles of community interdependence

besides modeofproduction theory whose validity is in any case widely debated there have also appeared in recent years a number of important synthesizing works on thirdworld history as a unified field three works in particular deserve mention global rift by ls stavrianos morrow 1981 europe and the people without history by eric r wolf california 1982 and the three worlds by peter worsley chicago 1984 such works suggest a more general methodological consequence implicit in the present essay but which should be stated explicitly here first that the kind of comparative work demanded by this concept of thirdworld literature involves comparison not of the individual texts which are formally and culturally very different from each other but of the concrete situations from which such texts spring and to which they constitute distinct responses and second that such an approach suggests the possibility of a literary and cultural comparatism of a new type distantly modelled on the new comparative history of barrington moore and exemplified in books like theda skocpols states and social revolutions or eric wolfs peasant revolutions of the 20th century such a

new cultural comparatism would juxtapose the study of the differences and similarities of specific literary and cultural texts with a more typological analysis of the various sociocultural situations from which they spring an analysis whose variables would necessarily include such features as the inter­ relationship of social classes the role of intellectuals the dynamics of language and writing the configuration of traditional forms the relationship to western influences the development of urban experience and money and so forth such comparatism however need not be restricted to thirdworld literature
