its way too late
to be this locked inside ourselves
the trouble is
that youre in love with someone else
it should be me
oh it should be me

verse 2
sacred parts
your getaways
you come along
on summer days
tenderly
tastefully

hook
and so may
we make time
try and find somebody else
this place is mine

verse 2
set the date
you know exactly how i feel
i had my doubts little girl
im in love with something real
it could be me
thats changing
see interpol liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likehook
and so may
we make time
to try and find somebody else
who has aligned

chorus
now seasoned with health
two lovers walk a lakeside mile
try pleasing with stealth rodeo
see what stands long ending fast

bridge
oh how i love you
oh in the evenings
when we are sleeping
we are sleeping
oh we are sleeping

hook
and so may
we make time
we try and find somebody else who
has aligned

chorus
now seasoned with health
two lovers walk a lakeside mile
try pleasing with stealth rodeo
see what stands long oh ending fast8embed"
