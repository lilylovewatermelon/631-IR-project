ah ah

verse 1
i spend all my days
trying to forget her face
shes so hard to erase
i dont think she can be replaced

chorus
she stole my heart and ran away
left me with some things to say
i dont understand
she stole my heart and ran away
left me with some things to say
i dont understand

verse 2

thinking of her embrace
the way it slowly changed
some things will never fade

chorus
she stole my heart and ran away
left me with some things to say
i dont understand
she stole my heart and ran away
left me with some things to say
i dont understandsee ​girl in red liveget tickets as low as 23you might also like7embed"
