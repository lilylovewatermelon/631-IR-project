i know your leavin i see the signs
your going to walk out on this heart of mine
youll never call me youll never write
you made your mind up and youre gone tonight

prechorus
if some rainy day youre all alone
and feel like talking you can log me on

chorus
at www memory
ill be waitin for you patiently
if you feel the need just click on me
at www memory

bridge
you wont even have to hold me or look into my eyes
you can tell me that you love me through your keyboard and wires
no you wont have to touch me or even take my hand
just slide your little mouse around until you see it land

if you feel the need just click on me
