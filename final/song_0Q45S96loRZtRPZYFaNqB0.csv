dont ya hate hearing that clock on the wall chiming
saying its time
and dont you just wish we could just stay right here together
all day long
you know it wouldnt be a crime
if we crawl back into bed
got as close as we could get
trying to figure out where this thing is going

chorus
baby baby dont
dont just say youre leaving
why dont you just stay a little bit longer
got it going on
and i just cant believe it
this feeling it just keeps getting stronger

verse 2
if ya got to go
you got to know
i might go crazy
here without you baby
were living every kiss
you aint leaving me like this
it just aint right
wait until tonight
to light another flame
you know it wouldnt be the same as the fire we got burning this morning

baby baby dont
dont just say youre leaving
why dont you just stay a little bit longer

this feeling it just keeps getting stronger

bridge
love no one else can love me like you do
you know i aint even close to through loving you

chorus
baby baby dont
dont just say youre leaving
why dont you just stay a little bit longer
got it going on
and i just cant believe it
this feeling it just keeps getting stronger
