to watch the leaves grow on the trees with you
is out of question
i walk into this summer all alone
the usual session
you feel your instinct then you act
but was it your intention
to leave me down and broken
now youve ended our ascension

verse 2
i still can feel the beach sand in my shoes
remember when
we talked along the oceans song
til blue from black fade in
but that was then
i learned to live
without you far within
i ask you why youre back to try
to let me lose again

prechorus
you brought me here
you whet my taste
you disappear
without a trace
it wasnt me who made the call
you might also likechorus
cause now i wanna be
where you sleep
where you laugh
where you breathe
and i hate to say
still i swear
brown your eyes
gone away

verse 3
should i feel some closure
i deserve if that at least
and would you be so kind to show
reasons for your release
you woke me up from a distant past
i left behind complete
the message that you sent that night
now falls to bittersweet

prechorus
or was it me
my honesty
you fail to show
i never know
it wasnt me who made the call
chorus
cause now i wanna be
where you sleep
where you laugh
where you breathe
and i hate to say
still i swear
brown your eyes
gone away

bridge
or was it me
my honesty
you fail to show
i never know
you brought me here
you whet my taste
you disappear
without a trace
did you think id ever lead you wrong
just know ill save all of our moments
that we are

chorus 2
and still i wanna be
where you sleep
where you laugh
where you breathe
and i hate to say
still i swear
brown your eyes
gone away
outro
now i wanna be someday youll wish you never
where you sleep someday youll wish you never
where you laugh someday youll wish you never
where you breathe someday youll wish you never
and i hate to say someday youll wish you never
still i swear someday youll wish you never
brown your eyes someday youll wish you never
gone away someday youll wish you never
you took it all the way
you took it all awayembed"
