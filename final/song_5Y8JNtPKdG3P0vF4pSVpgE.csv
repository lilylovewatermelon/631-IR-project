and it seems that the answer it is comin quite clear
oh i dont even know what i am doin here
but i can drive with my eyes closed
and play by ear
and i can sleep beneath the piano
just like thats my natural home
with all those keys i never feel alone
yes i can sleep beneath the piano
just like thats my natural home
with all those keys i never feel alone

i met a girl in a sleepy town down by the sea
she swore she didnt want nothin from me
now if you ever hear that line boy dont you dare believe
ah there aint nothin but deep blues down in that bitter recipe
anda when i left town she had those tears in her eyes
buta i aint one for no emotional goodbyes
so she swam into that bottle like a fish back to its home
couple more drinks and you dont know shes alone
yeah she swam into that bottle like a fish back to the sea
a couple more drinks and she forgot all about me
met a lot of guys a lot tougher than me
its like it aint no kinda competition indeed
they saida hey boy have you ever been stabbed before
i said not yet im grabbin my hat and just headin for the door
anda i made my way down to that rich side of town
where everybodys tossin big words around
but as soon as i turn my back to head downtown
i hear those whispers like rain just afallin on down
say he drinks like a fish and he gonna fly like a stone
boy is better off left alone
they say he drink like a fish and he gonna fly like a stone
boy is better off left aloneyou might also likeembed"
