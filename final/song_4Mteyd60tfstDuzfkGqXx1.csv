too late for us
we both dangerous
movin so close we combust
is it bad that i want more

verse 1
i been gone so long i dont know where im going
you be on my phone talkin bout whats my problem
had to go alone to get it how i wanted
had to be alone to figure out how i should be loved
and if its just us is that enough
is it bad that i want more

chorus
is it too late for us
we both dangerous
movin so close we combust
is it bad that i want more
is it too late for us
we both scared of love
movin so close we combust
is it bad that i want more

verse 2
see bust it like a toolie in your waistband
bust it like that booty too big and you need two hands
bust it like you catchin a body and you in g stance
bust it like its casual friday and you herе to dance
call bluff i know whats up
cant get enough
