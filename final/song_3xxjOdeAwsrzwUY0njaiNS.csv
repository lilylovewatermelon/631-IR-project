its perfect
one two three four
man i got a song for yall
interesting
actual writing
something yall aint ever heard of

verse 1
well she wants a cowboy
so i just might
find me some boots
that fit me right
chew some tobacco
ride me a bronco
on a southern saturday night

verse 2
i aint never rode a horse
or worn a cowboy hat
but ill find me one that fits my head
and she wont know any of that
i keep walking this town
tryna get me some advice
but all the ranch hands around
keep on sayin they wanna fight
and i learned to two step so i can spin her
off her pretty little country feet
if she wants a cowboy
then ill be as cowboy
as a cowboy can be
see zach bryan liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likechorus
find me a horse that i can cover
find me some stars to sleep under
find me a train ill hop out west
if she wants a cowboy ill cowboy the best

verse 3
she wanted a cowboy so i went off
and rode me a horse about every day
got pretty good at ranching and riding
but she didnt care anyway
champion buckles and champion spurs
i got everything but her
now im a cowboy and she wants nashville
what the hell was all this worth

chorus
find me a horse that i can cover
find me some stars to sleep under
find me a train ill hop out west
if she wants nashville ill nashville the best
one more
man i never heard a song this good

chorus
so find me a horse that i can cover
find me some stars to sleep under
find me a train ill hop out west
if she wants a cowboy ill cowboy the best
outro
alright boys im leaving for the day take it easy
that was mine that was it
throw it on the damn radioembed"
