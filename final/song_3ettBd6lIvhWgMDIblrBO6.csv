tired of breathing in all this office air
need to get back home feel the sand in my hair

prechorus
but when the sun goes down
ill come back around
if you wanna find me in that old town

chorus
ill be out in the backyard with the porch light on
sipping on a shiner
all my friends in the background passing round a guitar
or around a bonfire
drink the night away while the radio plays some old charlie daniels song
oh you can find me there

verse 2
yeah this damn bar… still smells the same
still filled with the same damn creatures
who will never change

prechorus
but when the sun goes down
ill come back around
if you wanna find me in my hometown
see flatland cavalry liveget tickets as low as 32you might also likechorus
ill be out at the dancehall with the bar lights on
sipping on a shiner
old flame in the background staring me down
she know i dont mind her
drink the night away
while the dj plays some old waylon jennings song
oh you can find me there
you can find me there

outro
then someday ill move on
when i do put on your boots dance on my headstone
bring a bottle of tennessee for two
ill be pushin up daisies just for you
and you can find me there
you can find me there
you can find me there
i aint goin nowhere
and when the sun goes down
ill come back around
you and i will be twosteppin there at our old stompin grounds
our old stompin grounds
