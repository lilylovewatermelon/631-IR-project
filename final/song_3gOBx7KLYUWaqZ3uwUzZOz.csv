verse 1 ti
i was born into poverty raised in the sewage
streets will always would be a part of me they made me the truest
and even when my days wasnt the bluest
i never ran from adversity instead i ran to it
fear aint in the heart of me i learned just do it
you get courage from your fears right after you go through it
now i come through in a coupe on 22s
that aint bad for a nigga who aint even finish school
dont get me wrong i aint never been a fool
i just put off graduating for a pair of tennis shoes
i used to use the beats to paint my pain
but nowadays man i cant complain
i got several automobiles and they all on them thangs
several solitaires and they all in one chain
they used to see me in the mall im the same
and gettin brains from a couple of broads on the plane
see ti liveget tickets as low as 97you might also likechorus ti  pharrell williams
i keep telling myself man im living the good life
im living the good life
i keep telling myself man im living the good life
im living the good life
im on top of the world
im on top of the world
im on top of the world
im on top of the world
im on top of the world

verse 2 common
i come from chitown lost and found in the struggle
where dudes say stay safe and say out of trouble
speakers muffled the law and bms try to cuff you
those with duffles move weight and have muscle
i dug through the dirt with a verse for the people
open up for daddy kane and eazy at the regal
the radio rarely put their needle on my record
they aint see how the hood and heaven were connected
sales projected aint show how effective
lessons learned sessions turned to life reflected
and everything i found real in life yo i kept it
they say lifes a teacher youre gonna get tested
when a nigga changed they kept saying that nigga strange
they couldnt see how my mind on bigger things
ahead of my time now i caught up with the game
making good music making paper making change
and its good
chorus ti  pharrell williams
i keep telling myself man im living the good life
im living the good life
i keep telling myself man im living the good life
im living the good life
im on top of the world
im on top of the world
im on top of the world
im on top of the world
im on top of the world

verse 3 ti
i put gasoline drawers on i stood in the fire
with enough heat to set the hood on fire
man you niggas think suge was off the wire
you shouldve seen the squad before i had messiah
we assumed the title as the number one supplier
felt like i was selling blow since i was in diapers
and we wished a nigga would come try us
we was cool with the killers best friends with the lifers
quick to up and scrap if a nigga wanna to deny
for what we considered then a lucrative empire
but like that pimping time flash by you
now i wonder what the judge think as he reading my priors
cause prisons aint full and the reaper aint biased
anybody telling ya differents a damn liar
gave the jail hell and shot birds at the hearse
lived through worse and reversed the curse
chorus ti  pharrell williams
i keep telling myself man im living the good life
im living the good life
i keep telling myself man im living the good life
im living the good life
im on top of the world
im on top of the world
im on top of the world
im on top of the world
im on top of the world2embed"
