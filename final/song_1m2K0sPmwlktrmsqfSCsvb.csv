rolling her homeward
with blood on our knives
whod have known you’re a deviant sister
guts on your blouse
you’re worth your own weight

in diamonds a dozen
sailing to nowhere
vapor to float on
still we roll on through the night

battle systems trading in lies
taken down by the hounds one by one
longing to find our way out
following the ghost down

running in circles a mouse on the table
i try to feel but just don’t
curling and dead inside
“go on and cut him in half” said iyou might also like3embed"
