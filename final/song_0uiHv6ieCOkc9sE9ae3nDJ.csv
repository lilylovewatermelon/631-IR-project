it get worse fore it get better
just make sure you mean it before you say them four letters
feel like this could be forever
i aint tryna pick for you but its now or never
the streets and you i be torn between the two
got to a point i was lyin to keep you
knowin she just talkin but she talmbout how she through
im like bitch stop playin with me find you somethin safe to do
they want my attention but you saw me play it cool
i really paid dues your foot couldnt fit inside my shoes
im stamped where im from i aint got nothin else to prove
tryna better my position i had no choice but to choose
your bitch see what you dont see when them niggas actin fool
if shit pop out right now who you really know gon shoot
mean but loveydovey gangster when she in public
fuck her she talkin slutty left it in when i nutted

chorus
trouble in paradise sometimes it be
pointless if we aint on the same time it be
listen quit talkin over me when i be tryna speak
her vibe like the guys so i call her my g
