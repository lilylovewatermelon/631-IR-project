verse 1 joe hawley
ive been sleeping in a cardboard box
spending every dollar at the liquor shop
and even though i know i havent got a lot
ill try to give you love until the day you drop

verse 2 rob cantor
ive been training like a pavlov dog
let my independence out to take a hike
all you gotta do is activate my bell
and ill fetch you anything you like

chorus joe hawley rob cantor zubin sedghi bora karaca
going once going twice
every man here has a price
over where over there
sold sold to not a single lady in here
you might also likeverse 3 zubin sedghi
ive been here like a thousand times
dated every woman in the atmosphere
ive been to every continent
broken all the hearts in every hemisphere
and if im not the type of guy you like to circumvent
just remember not to love me when i disappear

verse 4 joe hawley
i graduated at the top
i like to take advantage of the bourgeoisie
so if you have a fantasy of being a queen
maybe you should blow a couple bucks on me

chorus joe hawley rob cantor zubin sedghi
going once going twice
wont these gentlemen suffice
any here any there
any motions anywhere
going twice going thrice
guess this means well go four times a lady

bridge joe hawley rob cantor zubin sedghi
i promise ill be all youll need ever need
youll never have to shop around dont shop around
and ill give you all youll ever need ever need
dont worry i will never let you down let you down
dont worry i will never let you down
outro joe hawley rob cantor zubin sedghi
so many ladies are wanting for mates
and the prospects are good but the dates never great
over here over there over where anywhere
theyre too busy with winning the bidding to care
and hes sold31embed"
