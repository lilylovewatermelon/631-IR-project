i dont fall slow like i used to i fall straight down
youve stolen my air catcher that kept me safe and sound
my parachutes would guide me safely to ground
but now my chords not workin and i see you staring me down

chorus
i wont fall in love with fallin
i will try to avoid those eyes oh

verse 2
i think you would beat the moon in a pretty contest
and the moon just happened to be the very first thing that i missed
i was doing fine on my own and there wasnt much i lacked
but youve stolen my air catcher and i dont know if i want it back

chorus
i wont fall in love with fallin
i will try to avoid those eyes
cause im not sure i want to give you
tools that can destroy my heart

bridge
and i just dont say what you wanna hear
so ill write my fears
and i dont believe in talkin just to breathe
in fallin selfishly

i wont fall in love with fallin
i will try to avoid those eyes
but now im here to give you words as
tools that can destroy my heart47embed"
