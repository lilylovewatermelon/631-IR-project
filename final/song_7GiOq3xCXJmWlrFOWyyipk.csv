coffee keeps me up and i cant sleep
and when i drink too much then i cant eat
losing you has led me to believe

everything i love is killin me
cigarettes jack daniels and caffeine
and thats the way youre turnin out to be
everything i love gonna have to give up
cause everything i love is killin me

i guess i made a big mistake
thinkin youre a habit i can break
well im addicted to you now i see
everything i love is killin me

chorus
everything i love is killin me

and thats the way youre turnin out to be
everything i love gonna have to give up
