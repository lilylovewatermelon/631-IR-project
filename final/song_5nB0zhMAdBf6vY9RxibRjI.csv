i know you
so better than the city in the rear view
i drive to
eliminate the ball that im chained to

prechorus
take me break me
every mile further theres a part of me that slips away
one day youll see
even if you got down on your knees you couldnt make me stay

chorus
drive all night
never gonna get me
night by night
to get away from it all
fight fight fight
all you want to do is hurt me
you wrecked my life
so im going to have to drive all night

verse 2
ill stay strong
im pushing on the pedal until i break dawn
so im gone
go find another shoulder you can cry on

every mile further theres a part of me that slips away
one day youll see
even if you got down on your knees you couldnt make me stay

all you want to do is hurt me

so im going to have to drive all night
you wrecked my life
