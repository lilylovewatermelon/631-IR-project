used to drive a car that ain’t running right
overheats in the day so i drive at night
and i know it sounds funny but it’s real life

we wouldnt wanna turn on the heat keep the bills low
we sitting in the living room in our winter coats
yeah we sitting in the living room in our winter coats

driving around town in the grand prix
people telling me that i should get a plan b
snow on the windshield cant see
tryna work 600 in the morning thats me
sometimes i miss all those memories
they pop up back in my mind like remember me
records stop selling these people wont care for me
the older you get the more family is everything
