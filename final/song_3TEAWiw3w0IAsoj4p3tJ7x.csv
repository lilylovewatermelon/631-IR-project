she says i got something to say
she knows what she says will change everything
shes laid through so many sleepless nights
she’s crying she’s crying she’s crying

chorus
mother that man took my soul away
father how could you ever treat me this way
brother dont ever let him do this again
this time it’s over i’m gonna make it end
now it’s over and the old man is dead
lying on the ground bullet in his head

verse 2
she stood at the foot of the guilty bed last night
she held what could set her free for the rest of her life
she did all that she said that she planned to do
she’s through she’s through she’s through yeah

chorus
mother that man took my soul away
father how could you ever treat me this way
brother dont ever let him do this again
this time it’s over i’m gonna make it end
now it’s over and the old man is dead
lying on the ground bullet in his head
