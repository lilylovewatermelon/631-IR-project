verse 1
this is how i feel i got your love attached to me
and you know i truly love you it was never about no pussy
and you told me that them niggas aint for me they just want my money
and i like the way you is you aint tryna kick it with my buddies
and i got a habit and i like that you dont judge me
and thats so fucked up that im glad to be a junkie
to fall in love i say i been afraid
im mixin lean with lyrical lemonade
and we on top aint no more public aid
or callin your boss to get another raise
i drop some backwood ashes in the wraith
reminiscing bout the older days

chorus
oh oh oh oh
i gotta raise the roof for the people dont let the net ruin they relationship
oh oh oh oh
i gotta raise the roof for the females who wont listen to another bitch
oh oh oh oh
i gotta raise the roof for the niggas in the trenches turned to gentlemen
oh oh oh oh
i gotta tell the truth this the best relationship i ever been in
