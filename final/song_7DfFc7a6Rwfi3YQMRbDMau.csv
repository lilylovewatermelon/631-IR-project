verse 2
no i dont like you i just thought you were cool enough to kick it
got a beach house i could sell you in idaho
since you think i dont love you i just thought you were cute
thats why i kissed you
got a fighter jet i dont get to fly it though im lying down

well go down this road til it turns from color to black and white
