she had a flower in her hair
said she wasnt from round here
i said me neither girl
aint that a daisy
fancy meeting you like this
girl i dont believe this is
only blind coincidence
im thinking maybe

chorus
we should stay awhile see where it leads us
i think we got something cool between us
weve got two more nights before leaving pasadena

verse 2
rhinestone shining on her hips
cotton candy on her lips
that was the sweetest kiss id ever tasted
friday night rodeo
cut short by a lightning show
even though that rain was freezing
fеlt good to be in

chorus
so we stayed a whilе to see where itd lead us
we had something cool between us
and we had one more night before leaving pasadena
we took it slow
till we could find out where it was going
we found just what we were needing
right there in pasadena
see dustin lynch liveget tickets as low as 30you might also likebridge
sunday morning bout a quarter past nine
she had to go her way and i had to go mine
but i go back there all the time in my mind
in my mind in my mind

chorus
im still in pasadena pasadena
i still smell the freedom in the air
right there in pasadena
i still see that lightning striking back
in pasadena
feel her hands all over me all over me
in pasadena
wonder if she ever thinks about me
me and pasadena

outro
felt good baby
i still see that lightning strike
oohwhoa ooh all night
wondering if youll ever think about meembed"
