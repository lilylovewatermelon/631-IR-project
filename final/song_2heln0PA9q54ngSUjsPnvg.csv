why am i mad i dont get it
it seems like every time you give me signs and i miss it
i did it again i admit it
i left you standing there and now i regret it

prechorus
seems like every time i get the chance
i lose my cool and i blow it
and i get all tonguetied lost in your eyes
im a fool and i know it

chorus
i shouldve kissed you i shouldve told you
told you just how i feel
and next time i wont stop ill listen to my heart
cause what i feel is real
i shouldve kissed you
i shouldve told you how i feel
i shouldve kissed you
i shouldve showed you just how i feel

verse 2
now why didnt i give you my two cents
a million reasons why i should have and it makes no sense
so here i am by myself again
stopping for green lights and i know i wanna be more than friends
