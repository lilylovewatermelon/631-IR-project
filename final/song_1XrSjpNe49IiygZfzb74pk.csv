i guess i knew this would happen to you
inside i did but i refused to know the truth
im headin back inside to sit at home with you
i think i know whats wrong

verse 2
my friends put on their bravest face
their tails between their legs somethings out of place
i bet their mothers let them know what im about to face
keep your mouth zipped son

chorus
baby ive been there before
i was at the point where all i really wanted was someone
and now im still hangin on
i was at the end of every tether waitin for what once was

verse 3
tell me all the important stuff
whats your favorite color what makes you so tough
please dont let go when youve had enough
im on my knees

chorus
baby ive been there before
i was at the point where all i really wanted was someone
and now im still hangin on
i was at the end of every tether waiting for what once was
