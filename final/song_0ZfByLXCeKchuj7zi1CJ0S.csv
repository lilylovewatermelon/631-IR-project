i want you by my side
so that i never feel alone again
theyve always been so kind
but now theyve brought you away from me
i hope they didnt get your mind
your heart is too strong anyway
we need to fetch back the time
they have stolen from us

chorus
and i want you we can bring it on the floor
youve never danced like this before
we dont talk about it
dancin on doin the boogie all night long
stoned in paradise
shouldnt talk about it
and i want you we can bring it on the floor
youve never danced like this before
we dont talk about it
dancin on doin the boogie all night long
stoned in paradise
shouldnt talk about it
shouldnt talk about it

verse 2
coldest winter for me
no sun is shining anymore
the only thing i feel is pain
caused by absence of you
suspense controlled in my mind
i cannot find the way outta here
i want you by my side
so that i never feel alone again

and i want you we can bring it on the floor
youve never danced like this before
we dont talk about it
dancin on doin the boogie all night long
stoned in paradise
shouldnt talk about it
and i want you we can bring it on the floor
youve never danced like this before
we dont talk about it
dancin on doin the boogie all night long
stoned in paradise
shouldnt talk about it
shouldnt talk about it

chorus
and i want you we can bring it on the floor
youve never danced like this before
we dont talk about it
dancin on doin the boogie all night long
stoned in paradise
shouldnt talk about it
and i want you we can bring it on the floor
youve never danced like this before
we dont talk about it
dancin on doin the boogie all night long
stoned in paradise
shouldnt talk about it
