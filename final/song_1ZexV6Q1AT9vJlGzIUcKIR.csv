im sick of living under everybodys shadow
im sick of everyones success i know thats shallow
im sick of hearing people lie to get by to get by
im sick of people that cant look me in the eye all the time

im tired of girls
im tired of boys
im tired of nonsense
im tttttttired of the process

im sick and tired of always feeling second best
im tired of never ever making any progress

chorus
to all the cool kids on my block
wheres the original thought tell me

oh yeah you never heard us
dont ever try to turn us down
were making all the noise
were making teenage sounds
its the same old song and dance
were sick of everybody trying to be famous

verse 2
im sick of always operating out of fear
im sick of being called a fag because im queer
im sick of everybody saying to be happy laughs
im positive that im allowed to have a bad day
im tired of everybody trying to be a dj

im sick of people saying rock n roll is dead
learn how to play guitar and save yourself instead

chorus
to all the cool kids on my block
wheres the original thought tell me

oh yeah you never heard us
dont ever try to turn us down
were making all the noise
were making teenage sounds
its the same old song and dance
were sick of everybody trying to be famous

verse 3
the truth is hard to swallow when its true
the truth is hard to swallow when its choking you
the truth is hard to swallow when its true
the truth is hard to swallow when its choking you

were making all the noise
were making teenage sounds
its the same old song and dance
were sick of everybody trying to be famous
