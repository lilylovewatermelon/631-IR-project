im taking my time
im trying to leave the memories of you behind
im gonna be fine
as soon as i get your picture right out of my mind

chorus
i wanna feel the way you make me feel when im with you
i wanna be the only hand you need to hold on to
but every time i call you dont have time
i guess ill never get to call you mine

verse 2
youre nothing at all
i know theres a million reasons why i shouldnt call
with nothing to say
could easily make this conversation last all day

chorus
i wanna feel the way you make me feel when im with you
i wanna be the only hand you need to hold on to
but every time i call you dont have time
i guess ill never get to call you mine
