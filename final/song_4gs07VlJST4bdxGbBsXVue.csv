lightning strike
inside my chest to keep me up at night
dream of ways
to make you understand my pain

prechorus
clouds of sulfur in the air
bombs are falling everywhere
its heartbreak warfare
once you want it to begin
no one really ever wins
in heartbreak warfare

chorus
if you want more love
why dont you say so
if you want more love
why dont you say so

verse 2
drop his name
push it in and twist the knife again
watch my face
as i pretend to feel no pain pain pain
see john mayer liveget tickets as low as 99you might also likeprechorus
clouds of sulfur in the air
bombs are falling everywhere
its heartbreak warfare
once you want it to begin
no one really ever wins
in heartbreak warfare

chorus
if you want more love
why dont you say so
if you want more love
why dont you say so
just say so

bridge
how come the only way to know how high you get me
is to see how far i fall
god only knows how much id love you if you let me
but i cant break through it all
its a heart heartbreak

verse 3
i dont care if we dont sleep at all tonight
lets just fix this whole thing now
i swear to god were gonna get it right
if you lay your weapon down

red wine and ambien
youre talking shit again

disappointment has a name
its heartbreak heartbreak
