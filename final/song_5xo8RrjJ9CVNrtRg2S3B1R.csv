i hate you for what you did
and i miss you like a little kid
i faked it every time but thats alright
i can hardly feel anything
i hardly feel anything at all
you gave me fifteen hundred
to see your hypnotherapist
i only went one time you let it slide
fell on hard times a year ago
was hopin you would let it go and you did

chorus
i have emotional motion sickness
somebody roll the windows down
there are no words in the english language
i could scream to drown you out

verse 2
im on the outside looking through
youre throwing rocks around your room
and while youre bleeding on your back in the glass
ill be glad that i made it out
and sorry that it all went down like it did

chorus
i have emotional motion sickness
somebody roll the windows down
there are no words in the english language
i could scream to drown you out
hey why do you sing with an english accent
i guess its too late to change it now
you know im never gonna let you have it
but i will try to drown you out
you might also likebridge
you said when you met me you were bored
you said when you met me you were bored
and you you were in a band when i was born

chorus
i have emotional motion sickness
i try to stay clean and live without
and i wanna know what would happen
if i surrender to the sound
surrender to the sound31embed"
