baby you understand me now
if sometimes you see that im mad
dont you know no one alive can always be an angel
when everything goes wrong you see some bad

chorus
but im just a soul whose intentions are good
oh lord please dont let me be misunderstood

verse 2
you know sometimes baby im so carefree
with a joy thats hard to hide
and then sometimes again it seems that all i have is worry
and then youre bound to see my other side

chorus
but im just a soul whose intentions are good
oh lord please dont let me be misunderstood

bridge
if i seem edgy i want you to know
i never meant to take it out on you
life has its problems and i get more than my share
but thats one thing i never mean to do cause i love you

oh lord please dont let me be misunderstood
