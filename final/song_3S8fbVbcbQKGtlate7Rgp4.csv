how long has it taken me to find you
five hundred years five hundred thousand miles
it dont matter now
loves always on time
meet me underneath the oklahoma sky

verse 2
lightning flashed everything went silent
a feather could have knocked me to the floor
missing piece was found
i was finally alive
meet me underneath the oklahoma sky

bridge
with the speed of sound
im homeward bound mhmm

verse 3
all our sorrows swept away forever
each and every tear washed out to sea
there aint no goodbye
with your hand in mine
meet me underneath the oklahoma sky
