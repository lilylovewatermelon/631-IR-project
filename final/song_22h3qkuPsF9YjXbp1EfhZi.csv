i found your silver bracelet in my backseat
that you left it seems like yesterday
its like i found a treasure when i held it
how could i have ever let her get away
i still got a faded picture on my rearview
its almost like shes looking right at me
somehow just like that it all comes rushing back
shes right here the way it used to be

chorus
yeah miss that girl
knowing theyll never be another one like her not like her
kicking myself for ever letting her slip out of my world
i just miss that girl

verse 2
way back then it felt like i had things together
whenever shed coming smiling through that door
but ive had one or two tonight
and it just makes me realize
that i aint so together anymore

chorus
and i miss that girl
knowing theyll never be another one like her not like her
kicking myself for ever letting her slip out of my world
i just miss that girl
yeah i miss that little girl

kicking myself for ever letting her slip out of my world
