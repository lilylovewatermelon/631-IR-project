verse 1
i hope youre proud of me dude i grew to be
ingenuity influenced by your eulogy
going through memories like they were movie scenes
i know i been the shit all these people full of me
i admit i guess im full of myself too
theres just a bunch of shit i wish i could tell you but
this life move fast i never knew that
yours wouldnt have lasted the dirt hittin your casket like raindrops
i swear ill let you know when the pain stop
for now i need to run to any place that a train stops
and everybody wanna talk to me about some business shit
never really listenin couldnt get real interested
my days gettin darker so the haze get sparked up
all this hate sound the same when my name get brought up
you had a girl i kinda wish you knocked her up
so i could meet your son and talk you up

chorus
i remember
when we were just kids
we knew nothin at all
and we would talk about the life we lived in
west virginia
lost somewhere out in
west virginia

its a dark science when your friends start dyin
like how could he go he was partlion
life goes on the tears all dried and
couple years are gone by by then uh

i heard he moved to a place where the time dont end
so you dont need money all you got is time to spend
yeah lifes short dont ever question the length
its cool to cry dont ever question your strength
i recommend no limits intricate thought
go head just give it a shot youll remember shit you forgot

bridge
cause way back then i didnt know shit
and i dont know shit now
when the worlds lookin hopeless
ima still hold shit down

chorus
i remember
when we were just kids
we knew nothing at all
and we would talk about the life we lived in
west virginia
lost somewhere out in
west virginia
