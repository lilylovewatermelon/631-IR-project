he is sensible and so incredible
and all my single friends are jealous
he says everything i need to hear
and its like i couldnt ask for anything better

prechorus
he opens up my door and i get into his car
and he says you look beautiful tonight
and i feel perfectly fine

chorus
but i miss screamin and fightin and kissin in the rain
and its 2 am and im cursin your name
so in love that you act insane
and thats the way i loved you
breakin down and comin undone
its a a rollercoaster kind of rush
and i never knew i could feel that much
and thats the way i loved you

verse 2
he respects my space
and never makes me wait
and he calls exactly when he says he will
hes close to my mother
talks business with my father
hes charming and endearing
and im comfortable
