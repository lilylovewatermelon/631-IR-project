dirty fingernails same as your mind
but he could strum the guitar just fine
every now and then hed think about his life
daydreamin just to pass the time

sadder days why do they keep on using me

finally he found a way to reach the sky
but he didnt know what hed find

now the sun is closer than it was before
anyone whos anyone can feel it mmm

chorus
saturdays are not the same as they used to be
sadder days why do they keep on using me
they keep on using me
