at the best of times im lonely in my mind
but i can find something to show you
if you have got the time
why would i rely on the things that i did right
she said i gave you four years of my life

chorus
so what about these feelings ive got
we got it wrong and you said youd had enough
what about these feelings ive got
i couldnt be more in love

verse 2
i could have been a great line
i could have been a sign
or overstay my time
say whats on your mind
maybe ill rely on all the things that made it right
because id give you all the years of my life

chorus
so what about these feelings ive got
we got it wrong and you said youd had enough
but what about these feelings ive got
i couldnt be more in love
