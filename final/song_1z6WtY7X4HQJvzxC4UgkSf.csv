verse 1
honey honey
i can see the stars all the way from here
cant you see the glow on the window pane
i can feel the sun whenever youre near
every time you touch me i just melt away

prechorus
now everybody asks me
why im smilin out from ear to ear they say love hurts
but i know its gonna take a little work

after fightin through my tears
and finally you put me first
