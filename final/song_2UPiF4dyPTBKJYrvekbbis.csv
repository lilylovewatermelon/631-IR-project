yeah
yeah we can ride to this
just lay back and cruise

verse 1
heres a taste of my life its bitter and sweet
i pour my heart out to the sounds of the drums and the beat
i put my life on the line when im out on the street
put my teflon on and roll with my heat
i keep my circle nice and small i dont fuck with these clown niggas
in the race for the cheese i run laps around niggas
soon as i step on stage the crowd applauds
soon as my sneaker went in stores reebok stock soared
i aint gotta say im a boss niggas can tell
the east coast crib the size of a small hotel
the shit journalists write about me leave me confused
have me feeling like the heavyweight champ when he lose
i read somewhere im homophobic shit
go through the hood theres mad niggas on my dick
now we can get hostile or we can do this smooth
tnt around i can still make blow move

chorus
this is what you call rider music
all the gangsters are riding to it—cmon lets roll
i can show you how we do it
when we ride to that rider music lets go lets go
this is what you call rider music
all the gangsters are riding to it—cmon lets roll
i can show you how we do it
when we ride to that rider music lets go lets go

last year i woke up with good luck damn it feels good

in my favorite position—you know how it goes
and my bentley bumpin prince shit this is when doves cry
this is what it sounds like when hollowtip slugs fly
homie this is something you can ride and smoke to
stay on point cause niggas will ride and smoke you
jealousys for women but some niggas is bitchmade
they make you wanna run across they head with a switchblade
they point the finger at me saying im bugged
my flows crack you listen your fucking brains on drugs
look ice drippin on my neck hands gripping on a tec
fool tripping threw a set you can get your ass wet
cards messing up my deck screws loose show respect
you try to come at me kid your ass better come correct

verse 3
my mama gave birth to a winner i gotta win
pray the lord forgive me for my sins uhhuh im still thugging
cruising rims gleaming like the stones on my wrist
zoning—guess this is how it feels to be rich homie

chase the paper they come with the shit
im falling in love with success
entrepreneur connoisseur i maneuver the best
rolling ruger on my lap rubber grip on the handle
stunner have your homies burning restinpeace candles
as wise men speak i listen and learn
a man dies a babys born my nigga the world turns
rappers i make em sick when i say im the shit
they mistake my confidence for arrogance they hate on the kid
in 99 i had a vision and made a decision
being broke is against my religion now im caked up what
