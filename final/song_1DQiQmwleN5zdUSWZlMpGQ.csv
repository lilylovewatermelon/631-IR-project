i like to think im more than what my age is
with my fucked up sense of patience
and my deep selfdeprecations
i i try to cope with all the changes
when i smile on rare occasions
can you see how old my face is

prechorus
if im getting old im getting old im getting old
why are there so many things that i dont know that i dont know

chorus
wake up every day and put on my clothes
hoping that 401k might fill up the hole in my soul
but im hollow
yeah im hollow
im scared to check the date
im scared of the dark
you cant escape it
no matter how fast the car
when youre hollow
and im hollow

verse 2
i act like its a choice that im still single
im smaller than the raindrops on the window
im colder than the backside of a pillow
and ive tried to hold my temper and obscure my rage
but these kids they never act their age
and ive got one foot in the grave

when youre hollow
and im hollow

oh welcome to the other side
