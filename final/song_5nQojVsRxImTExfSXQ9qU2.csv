youre not alone
im awake and ive been missing you
i remember it well
shut out the lights
so i can lay here and just think about you
dont wanna dream again tonight

ohohoh ill just lay here and wait
for the first light of the day
ohohoh youre the sun that i crave
youre the first light of the day

youre not alone
im awake and ive been thinking of you
i wanna hold onto you right
i wanna see whatever you see when you open your eyes
i wanna be right by your side

chorus rhodes
ohohoh ill just lay here and wait
for the first light of the day
