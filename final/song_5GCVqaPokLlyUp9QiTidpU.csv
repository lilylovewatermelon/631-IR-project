whim of wind
took me south
deserts where
i settled down
met a man
showed me how
lifes a breeze
ride it out

chorus
and maybe someday babe my ashll land on your nose
i guess well never know whichever way the wind blows

verse 2
well i had fun
i was young
now im ash
in the sun
all dressed up
and burnt out
whats it matter anyhow

chorus
and maybe someday babe my ashll land on your nose
i guess well never know whichever way the wind blows

and maybe someday babe my ashll land on your nose
i guess well never know whichever way the wind blows

bury me bury me please i cant go home i cant stay here
bury me bury me please i cant come down i cant stay free1embed"
