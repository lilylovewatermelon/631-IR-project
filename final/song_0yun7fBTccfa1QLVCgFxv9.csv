youre shaking tell me what is the matter babe
do i make you a little bit nervous girl dont be afraid
im not here to hurt you just the opposite indeed
you can let your guard down baby youre safe in here with me

hook
if you let me take control
baby i got you i swear
more passion than youve ever known
im about to take you there
and you can keep your eyes closed
but baby dont be scared
hold on here we go
im about to take you there

verse 2
these arms are for for your warmth and protection girl
lay your head on my chest just chill before we start the session girl
im gonna put my love in you baby
gonna give you all of me
just submit to my love baby
bite your lip and grip the sheets

hook
if you let me take control
girl i got you i swear
more passion than youve ever known
im about to take you there
and you can keep your eyes closed
but baby dont be scared
hold on here we go
im about to take you there

just let go go on and let yourself give it up
your body worshipped by mine is what this night holds for us
and if we happen to fall in love im not opposed
grown enough to handle the real baby
but lets not sweat it right now
all i want you to do is focus on how it feels baby

hook
if you let me take control
baby i got you i swear
more passion than youve ever known
im about to take you there
and you can keep your eyes closed
but baby dont be afraid
hold on here we go
im about to take you there
if you let me take control
girl i got you i swear
more passion than youve ever known
im about to take you there
and you can keep your eyes closed
but baby dont be scared
hold on here we go
im about to take you there6embed"
