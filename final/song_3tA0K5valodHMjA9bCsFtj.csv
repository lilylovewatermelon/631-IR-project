i got a death wish
her looks can kill
shes got a red dress
lipstick and heels
pull me in
get me hooked like a junkie
you got me feeling so high

chorus
you’re such a beautiful drug
i cant get enough
addicted and im dying for a hit of your love
got a death wish baby baby
dont want you to save me save me

verse 2
she lets her hair down
and all of mine stand up
cant help but stare now
gotta feel that touch
her kiss my fix so sweet
cant quit those lips are a habit to me

sweet intoxication and im never getting sober
i can tell that the effects are taking over
pull me in get me hooked like a junkie
you got me feeling so high tonight
