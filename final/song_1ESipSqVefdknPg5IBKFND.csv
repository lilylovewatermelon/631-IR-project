verse 1
turn the quiet up turn the noise down
let this ol world just spin around
i wanna feel it swing wanna feel it sway
and put some feel good in my soul
drink a little drink smoke a little smoke

want a little more right and a little less left
little more right now a little less whats next
act like tomorrows ten years away
and just kick back and let the feelin flow
drink a little drink smoke a little smoke

verse 2
i set my sails for a new direction
but the wind got in my way
i changed my course
but my definition of change
just aint the same

im gonna sit right here
stay away from there
im gonna make pretend
i just dont care
and i could get up
go get her back
or maybe ill just let her go
drink a little drink smoke a little smoke
ah come on now
go get her back ohhh
drink a little drink smoke a little smoke
drink a little drink smoke a little smoke
you guys put your hands together like this
see eric church liveget tickets as low as 200you might also likebridge
kick back gives the blues a spin
break out the wine forget again
dig down deep find my stash
light it up take me back

bridge
kick back gives the blues a spin
break out the wine forget again
dig down deep find my stash
light it up memory crash

outro
oh no i don’t know
baby it might take all night
then i’ll maybe break out that old rock and roll
drink a little drink smoke a little smoke

lets all stay out here and
drink a little drink smoke a little smoke
