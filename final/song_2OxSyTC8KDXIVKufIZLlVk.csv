i relate to your kind your design
your devotion to wave
get your brain on the prize
then dive inside

chorus 1
mindset of a killer
with your mind out of phase

verse 2
its a game that we like we crave
yet nobody wins
any way you decide you try
but you die

chorus 2
mindset of a killer
with your gaze you paint the room
bloodred with your tears
pouring from the stage

postchorus
and you cant stop now
rung by rung almost out
covered in black and gold
no one cares no one knows
my gift to the world outside
its okay im alright
now open your empty hands
here comes the fun here comes the end

click erase the device give thanks
then clear out the room
blow kisses wave them goodbye
goodnight

chorus 2
mindset of a killer
with your gaze you paint the room
bloodred with your tears
pouring from the stage

postchorus
and you cant stop now
rung by rung almost out
covered in black and gold
no one cares no one knows
my gift to the world outside
its okay im alright
now open your empty hands
here comes the fun here comes the end7embed"
