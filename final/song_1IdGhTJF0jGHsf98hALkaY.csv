mm so its over
hes with someone else and you know her
and you just cant get any lower
you sit in the dark alone
and wont answer your phone
well im sorry
i wont attend your pity party
id rather go have calamari
and maybe a drink and yes i think
you should come with me
life isnt long
there will be pain but life goes on
with every day a brand new song
but if youd rather stay at home
let me do you a favor

chorus
ill ask the sun to shine
away from you today so you can cry
if thats what you want alright
and ill ask the clouds to bring
the rain for you today so you can cry
if thats what you want alright
mm if thats what you want alright
