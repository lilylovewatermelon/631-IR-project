someone wrote this song before
and i could tell you where its from
the 4736251 to put my mind at ease

chorus
please just have a laugh with me
cause you know im borrowing by now
these sounds have already crowned
come on its a silly dream
dreaming of the imagery unfound
the view sits nice from that cloud

postchorus
and if you want a piece of my thoughts
theres a coin worth flipping
why dont you toss
guitar solo
