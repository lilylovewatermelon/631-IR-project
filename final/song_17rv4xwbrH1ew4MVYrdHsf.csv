        the major more bluefaced and staring—more overripe as it were than ever—and giving vent every now and then to one of the horses coughs not so much of necessity as in a spontaneous explosion of importance walked arminarm with mr dombey up the sunny side of the way with his cheeks swelling over his tight stock his legs majestically wide apart and his great head wagging from side to side as if he were remonstrating within himself for being such a captivating object they had not walked many yards before the major encountered somebody he knew nor many yards farther before the major encountered somebody else he knew but he merely shook his fingers at them as he passed and led mr dombey on pointing out the localities as they went and enlivening the walk with any current scandal suggested by them

        in this manner the major and mr dombey were walking arminarm much to their own satisfaction when they beheld advancing towards them a wheeled chair in which a lady was seated indolently steering her carriage by a kind of rudder in front while it was propelled by some unseen power in the rear although the lady was not young she was very blooming in the face—quite rosy—and her dress and attitude were perfectly juvenile walking by the side of the chair and carrying her gossamer parasol with a proud and weary air as if so great an effort must be soon abandoned and the parasol dropped sauntered a much younger lady very handsome very haughty very wilful who tossed her head and drooped her eyelids as though if there were anything in all the world worth looking into save a mirror it certainly was not the earth or sky

        why what the devil have we here sir cried the major stopping as this little cavalcade drew near

        my dearest edith drawled the lady in the chair major bagstock

        the major no sooner heard the voice than he relinquished mr dombeys arm darted forward took the hand of the lady in the chair and pressed it to his lips with no less gallantry the major folded both his gloves upon his heart and bowed low to the other lady and now the chair having stopped the motive power became visible in the shape of a flushed page pushing behind who seemed to have in part outgrown and in part outpushed his strength for when he stood upright he was tall and wan and thin and his plight appeared the more forlorn from his having injured the shape of his hat by butting at the carriage with his head to urge it forward as is sometimes done by elephants in oriental countries

        joe bagstock said the major to both ladies is a proud and happy man for the rest of his life

        you false creature said the old lady in the chair insipidly where do you come from i cant bear you

        then suffer old joe to present a friend maam said the major promptly as a reason for being tolerated mr dombey mrs skewton the lady in the chair was gracious mr dombey mrs granger the lady with the parasol was faintly conscious of mr dombeys taking off his hat and bowing low i am delighted sir said the major to have this opportunity

        the major seemed in earnest for he looked at all the three and leered in his ugliest manner

        mrs skewton dombey said the major makes havoc in the heart of old josh

        mr dombey signified that he didnt wonder at it

        you perfidious goblin said the lady in the chair have done how long have you been here bad man
        one day replied the major

        and can you be a day or even a minute returned the lady slightly settling her false curls and false eyebrows with her fan and showing her false teeth set off by her false complexion in the garden of whatsitsname

        eden i suppose mama interrupted the younger lady scornfully

        my dear edith said the other i cannot help it i never can remember those frightful names—without having your whole soul and being inspired by the sight of nature by the perfume said mrs skewton rustling a handkerchief that was faint and sickly with essences of her artless breath you creature

        the discrepancy between mrs skewtons fresh enthusiasm of words and forlornly faded manner was hardly less observable than that between her age which was about seventy and her dress which would have been youthful for twentyseven her attitude in the wheeled chair which she never varied was one in which she had been taken in a barouche some fifty years before by a then fashionable artist who had appended to his published sketch the name of cleopatra in consequence of a discovery made by the critics of the time that it bore an exact resemblance to that princess as she reclined on board her galley mrs skewton was a beauty then and bucks threw wineglasses over their heads by dozens in her honour the beauty and the barouche had both passed away but she still preserved the attitude and for this reason expressly maintained the wheeled chair and the butting page there being nothing whatever except the attitude to prevent her from walking

        mr dombey is devoted to nature i trust said mrs skewton settling her diamond brooch and by the way she chiefly lived upon the reputation of some diamonds and her family connexions

        my friend dombey maam returned the major may be devoted to her in secret but a man who is paramount in the greatest city in the universe—

        no one can be a stranger said mrs skewton to mr dombeys immense influence

        as mr dombey acknowledged the compliment with a bend of his head the younger lady glancing at him met his eyes

        you reside here madam said mr dombey addressing her

        no we have been to a great many places to harrogate and scarborough and into devonshire we have been visiting and resting here and there mama likes change

        edith of course does not said mrs skewton with a ghastly archness

        i have not found that there is any change in such places was the answer delivered with supreme indifference
        they libel me there is only one change mr dombey observed mrs skewton with a mincing sigh for which i really care and that i fear i shall never be permitted to enjoy people cannot spare one but seclusion and contemplation are my whathisname—

        if you mean paradise mama you had better say so to render yourself intelligible said the younger lady

        my dearest edith returned mrs skewton you know that i am wholly dependent upon you for those odious names i assure you mr dombey nature intended me for an arcadian i am thrown away in society cows are my passion what i have ever sighed for has been to retreat to a swiss farm and live entirely surrounded by cows—and china

        this curious association of objects suggesting a remembrance of the celebrated bull who got by mistake into a crockery shop was received with perfect gravity by mr dombey who intimated his opinion that nature was no doubt a very respectable institution

        what i want drawled mrs skewton pinching her shrivelled throat is heart it was frightfully true in one sense if not in that in which she used the phrase what i want is frankness confidence less conventionality and freer play of soul we are so dreadfully artificial

        we were indeed

        in short said mrs skewton i want nature everywhere it would be so extremely charming

        nature is inviting us away now mama if you are ready said the younger lady curling her handsome lip at this hint the wan page who had been surveying the party over the top of the chair vanished behind it as if the ground had swallowed him up

        stop a moment withers said mrs skewton as the chair began to move calling to the page with all the languid dignity with which she had called in days of yore to a coachman with a wig cauliflower nosegay and silk stockings where are you staying abomination

        the major was staying at the royal hotel with his friend dombey

        you may come and see us any evening when you are good lisped mrs skewton if mr dombey will honour us we shall be happy withers go on

        the major again pressed to his blue lips the tips of the fingers that were disposed on the ledge of the wheeled chair with careful carelessness after the cleopatra model and mr dombey bowed the elder lady honoured them both with a very gracious smile and a girlish wave of her hand the younger lady with the very slightest inclination of her head that common courtesy allowed

        the last glimpse of the wrinkled face of the mother with that patched colour on it which the sun made infinitely more haggard and dismal than any want of colour could have been and of the proud beauty of the daughter with her graceful figure and erect deportment engendered such an involuntary disposition on the part of both the major and mr dombey to look after them that they both turned at the same moment the page nearly as much aslant as his own shadow was toiling after the chair uphill like a slow batteringram the top of cleopatras bonnet was fluttering in exactly the same corner to the inch as before and the beauty loitering by herself a little in advance expressed in all her elegant form from head to foot the same supreme disregard of everything and everybody
        i tell you what sir said the major as they resumed their walk again if joe bagstock were a younger man theres not a woman in the world whom hed prefer for mrs bagstock to that woman by george sir said the major shes superb

        do you mean the daughter inquired mr dombey

        is joey b a turnip dombey said the major that he should mean the mother

        you were complimentary to the mother returned mr dombey

        an ancient flame sir chuckled major bagstock devilish ancient i humour her

        she impresses me as being perfectly genteel said mr dombey

        genteel sir said the major stopping short and staring in his companions face the honourable mrs skewton sir is sister to the late lord feenix and aunt to the present lord the family are not wealthy—theyre poor indeed—and she lives upon a small jointure but if you come to blood sir the major gave a flourish with his stick and walked on again in despair of being able to say what you came to if you came to that

        you addressed the daughter i observed said mr dombey after a short pause as mrs granger

        edith skewton sir returned the major stopping short again and punching a mark in the ground with his cane to represent her married at eighteen granger of ours whom the major indicated by another punch granger sir said the major tapping the last ideal portrait and rolling his head emphatically was colonel of ours a devilish handsome fellow sir of fortyone he died sir in the second year of his marriage the major ran the representative of the deceased granger through and through the body with his walkingstick and went on again carrying his stick over his shoulder

        how long is this ago asked mr dombey making another halt

        edith granger sir replied the major shutting one eye putting his head on one side passing his cane into his left hand and smoothing his shirtfrill with his right is at this present time not quite thirty and damme sir said the major shouldering his stick once more and walking on again shes a peerless woman

        was there any family asked mr dombey presently

        yes sir said the major there was a boy

        mr dombeys eyes sought the ground and a shade came over his face

        who was drowned sir pursued the major when a child of four or five years old

        indeed said mr dombey raising his head

        by the upsetting of a boat in which his nurse had no business to have put him said the major thats his history edith granger is edith granger still but if tough old joey b sir were a little younger and a little richer the name of that immortal paragon should be bagstock

        the major heaved his shoulders and his cheeks and laughed more like an overfed mephistopheles than ever as he said the words

        provided the lady made no objection i suppose said mr dombey coldly

        by gad sir said the major the bagstock breed are not accustomed to that sort of obstacle though its true enough that edith might have married twenty times but for being proud sir proud

        mr dombey seemed by his face to think no worse of her for that

        its a great quality after all said the major by the lord its a high quality dombey you are proud yourself and your friend old joe respects you for it sir

        with this tribute to the character of his ally which seemed to be wrung from him by the force of circumstances and the irresistible tendency of their conversation the major closed the subject and glided into a general exposition of the extent to which he had been beloved and doted on by splendid women and brilliant creatures

        on the next day but one mr dombey and the major encountered the honourable mrs skewton and her daughter in the pumproom on the day after they met them again very near the place where they had met them first after meeting them thus three or four times in all it became a point of mere civility to old acquaintances that the major should go there one evening mr dombey had not originally intended to pay visits but on the major announcing this intention he said he would have the pleasure of accompanying him so the major told the native to go round before dinner and say with his and mr dombeys compliments that they would have the honour of visiting the ladies that same evening if the ladies were alone in answer to which message the native brought back a very small note with a very large quantity of scent about it indited by the honourable mrs skewton to major bagstock and briefly saying you are a shocking bear and i have a great mind not to forgive you but if you are very good indeed which was underlined you may come compliments in which edith unites to mr dombey

        the honourable mrs skewton and her daughter mrs granger resided while at leamington in lodgings that were fashionable enough and dear enough but rather limited in point of space and conveniences so that the honourable mrs skewton being in bed had her feet in the window and her head in the fireplace while the honourable mrs skewtons maid was quartered in a closet within the drawingroom so extremely small that to avoid developing the whole of its accommodations she was obliged to writhe in and out of the door like a beautiful serpent withers the wan page slept out of the house immediately under the tiles at a neighbouring milkshop and the wheeled chair which was the stone of that young sisyphus passed the night in a shed belonging to the same dairy where newlaid eggs were produced by the poultry connected with the establishment who roosted on a broken donkeycart persuaded to all appearance that it grew there and was a species of tree

        mr dombey and the major found mrs skewton arranged as cleopatra among the cushions of a sofa very airily dressed and certainly not resembling shakespeares cleopatra whom age could not wither on their way upstairs they had heard the sound of a harp but it had ceased on their being announced and edith now stood beside it handsomer and haughtier than ever it was a remarkable characteristic of this ladys beauty that it appeared to vaunt and assert itself without her aid and against her will she knew that she was beautiful it was impossible that it could be otherwise but she seemed with her own pride to defy her very self

        whether she held cheap attractions that could only call forth admiration that was worthless to her or whether she designed to render them more precious to admirers by this usage of them those to whom they were precious seldom paused to consider

        i hope mrs granger said mr dombey advancing a step towards her we are not the cause of your ceasing to play

        you oh no

        why do you not go on then my dearest edith said cleopatra

        i left off as i began—of my own fancy

        the exquisite indifference of her manner in saying this an indifference quite removed from dulness or insensibility for it was pointed with proud purpose was well set off by the carelessness with which she drew her hand across the strings and came from that part of the room

        do you know mr dombey said her languishing mother playing with a handscreen that occasionally my dearest edith and myself actually almost differ—

        not quite sometimes mama said edith

        oh never quite my darling fie fie it would break my heart returned her mother making a faint attempt to pat her with the screen which edith made no movement to meet —about these old conventionalities of manner that are observed in little things why are we not more natural dear me with all those yearnings and gushings and impulsive throbbings that we have implanted in our souls and which are so very charming why are we not more natural

        mr dombey said it was very true very true

        we could be more natural i suppose if we tried said mrs skewton

        mr dombey thought it possible

        devil a bit maam said the major we couldnt afford it unless the world was peopled with jbs—tough and blunt old joes maam plain red herrings with hard roes sir—we couldnt afford it it wouldnt do

        you naughty infidel said mrs skewton be mute

        cleopatra commands returned the major kissing his hand and antony bagstock obeys

        the man has no sensitiveness said mrs skewton cruelly holding up the handscreen so as to shut the major out no sympathy and what do we live for but sympathy what else is so extremely charming without that gleam of sunshine on our cold cold earth said mrs skewton arranging her lace tucker and complacently observing the effect of her bare lean arm looking upward from the wrist how could we possibly bear it in short obdurate man glancing at the major round the screen i would have my world all heart and faith is so excessively charming that i wont allow you to disturb it do you hear

        the major replied that it was hard in cleopatra to require the world to be all heart and yet to appropriate to herself the hearts of all the world which obliged cleopatra to remind him that flattery was insupportable to her and that if he had the boldness to address her in that strain any more she would positively send him home

        withers the wan at this period handing round the tea mr dombey again addressed himself to edith

        there is not much company here it would seem said mr dombey in his own portentous gentlemanly way

        i believe not we see none

        why really observed mrs skewton from her couch there are no people here just now with whom we care to associate

        they have not enough heart said edith with a smile the very twilight of a smile so singularly were its light and darkness blended

        my dearest edith rallies me you see said her mother shaking her head which shook a little of itself sometimes as if the palsy twinkled now and then in opposition to the diamonds wicked one

        you have been here before if i am not mistaken said mr dombey still to edith

        oh several times i think we have been everywhere

        a beautiful country

        i suppose it is everybody says so

        your cousin feenix raves about it edith interposed her mother from her couch

        the daughter slightly turned her graceful head and raising her eyebrows by a hairsbreadth as if her cousin feenix were of all the mortal world the least to be regarded turned her eyes again towards mr dombey

        i hope for the credit of my good taste that i am tired of the neighbourhood she said

        you have almost reason to be madam he replied glancing at a variety of landscape drawings of which he had already recognised several as representing neighbouring points of view and which were strewn abundantly about the room if these beautiful productions are from your hand

        she gave him no reply but sat in a disdainful beauty quite amazing

        have they that interest said mr dombey are they yours

        yes

        and you play i already know

        yes

        and sing

        yes

        she answered all these questions with a strange reluctance and with that remarkable air of opposition to herself already noticed as belonging to her beauty yet she was not embarrassed but wholly selfpossessed neither did she seem to wish to avoid the conversation for she addressed her face and—so far as she could—her manner also to him and continued to do so when he was silent

        you have many resources against weariness at least said mr dombey

        whatever their efficiency may be she returned you know them all now i have no more

        may i hope to prove them all said mr dombey with solemn gallantry laying down a drawing he had held and motioning towards the harp

        oh certainly if you desire it

        she rose as she spoke and crossing by her mothers couch and directing a stately look towards her which was instantaneous in its duration but inclusive if anyone had seen it of a multitude of expressions among which that of the twilight smile without the smile itself overshadowed all the rest went out of the room

        the major who was quite forgiven by this time had wheeled a little table up to cleopatra and was sitting down to play picquet with her mr dombey not knowing the game sat down to watch them for his edification until edith should return

        we are going to have some music mr dombey i hope said cleopatra

        mrs granger has been kind enough to promise so said mr dombey

        ah thats very nice do you propose major

        no maam said the major couldnt do it

        youre a barbarous being replied the lady and my hands destroyed you are fond of music mr dombey

        eminently so was mr dombeys answer

        yes its very nice said cleopatra looking at her cards so much heart in it—undeveloped recollections of a previous state of existence—and all that—which is so truly charming do you know simpered cleopatra reversing the knave of clubs who had come into her game with his heels uppermost that if anything could tempt me to put a period to my life it would be curiosity to find out what its all about and what it means there are so many provoking mysteries really that are hidden from us major you to play

        the major played and mr dombey looking on for his instruction would soon have been in a state of dire confusion but that he gave no attention to the game whatever and sat wondering instead when edith would come back

        she came at last and sat down to her harp and mr dombey rose and stood beside her listening he had little taste for music and no knowledge of the strain she played but he saw her bending over it and perhaps he heard among the sounding strings some distant music of his own that tamed the monster of the iron road and made it less inexorable

        cleopatra had a sharp eye verily at picquet it glistened like a birds and did not fix itself upon the game but pierced the room from end to end and gleamed on harp performer listener everything

        when the haughty beauty had concluded she arose and receiving mr dombeys thanks and compliments in exactly the same manner as before went with scarcely any pause to the piano and began there

        edith granger any song but that edith granger you are very handsome and your touch upon the keys is brilliant and your voice is deep and rich but not the air that his neglected daughter sang to his dead son

        alas he knows it not and if he did what air of hers would stir him rigid man sleep lonely florence sleep peace in thy dreams although the night has turned dark and the clouds are gathering and threaten to discharge themselves in hailembed"
