tired out not a miracle in days oh yeah
deciders for the lonely whispering tears
you try out for nothing then you drop dead
not a miracle in years leisure for the lonely
whispering unnecess–ess–essary unless–ess–ess youre in

chorus
die and succeed
i say it out loud but you just dont care
farewell –well –well –well –well –well –well
til you know me well
farewell –well –well –well –well –well –well
til you know me well
girlfriend

verse 2
we are far from home i am with you now
i am longing you i am longing us two
who bought a miracle sells these fortune tears
decembers death or glory how you want it
no not a miracle in years deciders for the lonely
wishing death death death wishes death death death unless

chorus
die and succeed
i say it out loud but you just dont care
farewell –well –well –well –well –well –well
til you know me well
farewell –well –well –well –well –well –well
til you know me well
girlfriend
die and succeed
i say it out loud but she just dont care
farewell –well –well –well –well –well –well
–well –well –well –well –well –well
–well –well –well –well –well –well
