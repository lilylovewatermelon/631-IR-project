i dont remember the first time
but i think i survived
probably better not to try to recall cause it feeds it yeah it keeps it alive

verse 1
there are specific things
that i have to do
day to day just to keep it at bay
you wouldnt believe if you knew

tom
oh no this isnt real
oh no this isnt real

chorus
heres a little secret
heres the best part
this is going to take me
right back to the start
if i cant hear it
if its out of mind
wait until it settles
comes round a second time

i dont remember the first time
but i think i survived
probably better not to try to recall cause it feeds it yeah it keeps it alive

heres a little secret

if its out of mind
wait until it settles
comes round a second time

verse 2
i can feel it loom
up into my head
it is in the room
panicking in bed
i feel it coming on
taking over view
oh please not tonight
there’s nothing i can do
verse 3
this is bigger than me
this is in my fear
this is pitiful
i just disappear
swells up all around me
swallowed up inside
sell my senses if
it would make this subside

verse 4
i can barely handle
i can pass the time
staring through the curtains
up into the sky
where there is no
depth perception
keep preoccupied
self deception
nobody recognizes
it doesn’t have a name
my brother is infected he’s acting just the same
screaming like a siren up and down the hall
he just wants to stop it
he wants to end it all
verse 5
i am just a child
i have nothing more
than the basic function i am running from
i curl up and wallow
my distortion
everything is disproportion

verse 6
suddenly i wake
all is back again
everything is closer
morning is the same
and i can’t hear it
it’s way out of mind
i will just forget this till the next time1embed"
