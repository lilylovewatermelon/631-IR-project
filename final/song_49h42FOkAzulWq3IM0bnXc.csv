felt too much did she feel a thing
long dark hair never saw her cry
in two halves i was torn
my maybe love who wouldnt even try

chorus
she loves me she loves me not
she loves me she loves me not

verse 2
i saw you only yesterday
we shared a smile then went our separate ways
perhaps one day never mind
all the nights we shared were we just killing time

chorus
she loves me she loves me not
she loves me she loves me not

bridge
for all the things i said to her and all the ways i tried
and all the things i did for her theyre lost with one goodbye

she loved me she loved me not
