heres to bein human
all the pain and sufferin
theres beauty in the bleedin
at least you feel somethin

prechorus
i wish i knew what it was like
to care enough to carry on
i wish i knew what it was like
to find a place where i belong

chorus
but i am machine i never sleep
i keep my eyes wide open
i am machine a part of me
wishes i could just feel somethin
i am machine i never sleep
until i fix whats broken
i am machine a part of me
wishes i could just feel somethin

verse 2
heres to bein human
takin it for granted
the highs and lows of livin
to getting second chances

it wasnt supposed to be this way
we were meant to feel the pain
