yeah i cant do these long drives sittin in the back seat
thinkin bout that one night when the world caught fire youre driving me crazy
baby and your eyes brightened up this dark scene
you told me i would be fine i called you a liar youre driving me crazy

verse 1
we just facetime is this a sign im fallin out of your life
i try my hardest not to think about what i just realized
you said i was your light i think thats just a white lie
feelin so rotten inside thought i died
i kinda wanna go back im missin the pain
of a heartbreak and life just dont hit the same
im havin migrainеs my friends all over the placе
with their lifes straight i guess im afraid of growin out of my place

chorus
cause i cant do these long drives sittin in the back seat
thinkin bout that one night when the world caught fire youre driving me crazy
baby and your eyes brightened up this dark scene
you told me i would be fine i called you a liar youre driving me crazy

verse 2
and all i want is to take you by the sea
ill show you sights from above and take you to my dismal dreams
ill see that falling stars will set your world on fire baby
these flames werent meant for you and me
youre makebelieve why cant you see
ill make these roses all turn green
the seven seas and all the ocean tides
will fall into my dreams im drowning oh woah
i wish you werent so far from me woah
i wish you werent so far from me ohwoah
