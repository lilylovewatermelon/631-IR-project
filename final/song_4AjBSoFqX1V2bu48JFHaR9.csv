i dug a single seed into the ground
i hope it grows grows
in a year or two if youre around
youll see a rose rose
pack me up and keep me hidden somewhere
that you can find me
on a train to paris goin nowhere
draw the bridge behind me

cause you wont be there to love me when youre gone
dont be gone too long too long
tell me whos gonna love me when youre gone

golden leaves are dancing on the ground
its getting cold cold ohoh
safe from time well be forever young
never old old
see a ball of fire out in space
zoomin up behind me
all the wonder written on your face
was there inside me
