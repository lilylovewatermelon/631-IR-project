i have been searching for your touch
unlike any touch ive ever known
and i never thought about you much
till im broken down and all alone ohohohoh
though i dont understand the meaning of love
i do not mind if i die trying ohohohoh
took it for granted when you lifted me up

chorus
im asking for your help
i am going through hell
afraid nothing can save me but the sound of your voice
you cut out all the noise
and now that i can see mistakes so clearly now
id kill if i could take you back
but how
but how

verse 2
i can feel it in my guts
whats going on with him now
and dont patronize me with lies
im a man be a woman now ohohohoh
i have been bound by the shackles of love
and i dont mind if i die tied up ohohohoh
took it for granted when you lifted me up

im asking for your help
i am going through hell
afraid nothing can save me but the sound of your voice
you cut out all the noise
and now that i can see mistakes so clearly now
id kill if i could take you back
but how
but how
but how
but how
oh yeah

why must we be so ugly
and please do not think ill of me
why does the one you love
become the one who makes you want to cry
why
why

and how how

but i dont understand the meaning of love
