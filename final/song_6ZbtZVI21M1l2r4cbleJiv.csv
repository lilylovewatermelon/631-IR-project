hold on tight
and wrap your arms around me til your
knuckles are burning white
and all your tears all your tears
they couldnt match the bitter taste
of all these wasted years

prechorus
and all tou take take
everything that wasnt even yours
wait wait
you dont got a hold of me anymore

chorus
in a clear view theres a silhouette
and i watch you and i cant forget
knew we were done when you locked that door
yeah i figured it out now
breakings what the heart is for
when i see you in a silhouette
and you hold close do you feel regret
keeping me down when i hit that floor
and i figured it out girl
breakings what your heart is for
see the allamerican rejects liveget tickets as low as 245you might also likeverse 2
for so long
ive had to bite my tongue but whats the
point if the feelings gone
i turn my head i turn my head
a blind eye only sees a memory
but all i see is red all i see is red

prechorus
now dont dont say it didnt happen that way
i wont wont believe another word that you say

chorus
in a clear view theres a silhouette
and i watch you and i cant forget
knew we were done when you locked that door
yeah i figured it out now
breakings what the heart is for
when i see you in a silhouette
and you hold close do you feel regret
keeping me down when i hit that floor
and i figured it out girl

another heart skips a beat
its every note that you wrote
and i hope that you choke on the lines
youre wasting my time
another heart beats tonight
