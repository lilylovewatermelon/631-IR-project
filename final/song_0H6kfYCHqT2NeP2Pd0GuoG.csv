im doing time im guilty
rise in the morning oh sleepy

verse
the clouds in sky unknown and untied
a reason for reasons you die
the eye of the storm beware beware and still theres a thrill in the air
unbearable why
while im doing time im guilty for now
rise in the morning oh sleepy dream on
the clouds in sky alone and untied
a reason for reasons you die
the eye of the storm beware beware
and still theres a thrill in the air
unbearable why
while im doing time therefore now im not guilty
sun rise up in the morning what a dream oh so sleepy
lying in letters to someone i dont know
like an old song in the waiting for something from the past
so long from nowsee dr dog liveget tickets as low as 72you might also likeembed"
