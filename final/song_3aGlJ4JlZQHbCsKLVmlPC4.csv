yeah its like a song playing all night long
stuck in my head
things i shouldve done
things i couldve shouldve said
forgive and forgetting
lifes too short to let hate hang around

verse 2
sometimes i wonder is this the last summer
i go fishing with my daddy
in 20 years from now if im still here
will my beautiful wife still have me
these are the voices wont leave me alone
questions i cant put down

chorus 1
what keeps you up at night
what makes your heartbeat wild
what weighs on your mind leaves you paralyzed
what keeps you up at night
alright

verse 3
see i believe in god with all my heart
sometimes i doubt and wonder
and i know thatd break my mammas heart
and that weighs on me like thunder
are these the best days of my life
and when tomorrow comes
will the skies open up and blow my mind

what makes you take a stand
want to get up and dance

raise your hands to the sky
what keeps you up at night

of this beautiful life im living

and what they learn from me
