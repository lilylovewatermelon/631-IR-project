youd love this bar
i stumbled on
they play george strait
and they pour their doubles strong
ive been gone
for two weeks now
theres some missing you in every little town

prechorus luke combs
ain’t sure what i thought id find ridin these yellow lines

chorus luke combs  miranda lambert luke combs
outrunnin your memory is like
outrunnin the wind
i cant get where im goin if i cant leave where youve been
i see you in every sunset
every star in the sky
i hear you callin my name in the middle of the night
the longer gone i get on down the road
reminds me baby that there just ain’t no
outrunnin your memory

verse 2 miranda lambert miranda lambert  luke combs
im by myself but im not alone
cause youve been right here in this truck since san antone
