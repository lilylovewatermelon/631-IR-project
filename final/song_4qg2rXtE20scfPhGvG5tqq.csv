pitchin myself for leads in other peoples dreams

verse 1
fell out of bed butterfly bandage but dont worry
youll never remember your head is far too blurry
put him in the back of a squad car restrain that man
he needs his head put through a cat scan
hey editor im undeniable hey doctor im certifiable

prechorus
oh im a loose bolt of a complete machine
what a match im halfdoomed and youre semisweet

chorus

and id promise you anything for another shot at life
and perfect boys with their perfect lives
nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy
wants to hear you sing about tragedy oh

verse 2
little girl you got me staring odd
oh or was that just a telescopic camera nod
pppainted dolls  in the highway truck stop stalls
lot lizards scales cool your nightlife moods
all the rookies leave your badge and your gun on the desk
when you leave the room
