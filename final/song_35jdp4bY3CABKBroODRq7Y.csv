verse 1 mike shinoda
no regret for the confidence betrayed
no more hiding in shadow
cause i wont wait for the debt to be repaid
time has come for you

chorus chester bennington
victimized victimized
never again victimized
victimized victimized
never again victimized

verse 2 mike shinoda
theyre acting like they want a riot its a riot ill give em
as the siren climbs higher on this violent rhythm
for you snakes in the grass supplyin the venom
i aint scared of your teeth i admire whats in em
you been waitin in the shadows there thinkin youre hidden
but the truth is you dont have the stomach to get em
go on already hit em yeah you gotta be kiddin
wanna talk about a victim imma put you there with em

chorus chester bennington
victimized victimized
never again victimized
victimized victimized
never again victimized
