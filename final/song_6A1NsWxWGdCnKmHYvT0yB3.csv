see you done had your moment you done had your turn
now move around clown for the sound that got the streets on burn
the trillest player out the va since the authors of lord willin

while haters is bored chillin hes focused and mashin
he bringin big faces and then them checks he be cashin
he got some places to go and some people to see
but he gon rep for virginia baby keepin it g
in the streets and tv dont matter he gon keep it 100
cause cant nobody do it like young trey done done it
so dont tell me that its dos or claimin its uno
why hate em congratulate him cause nigga you know
