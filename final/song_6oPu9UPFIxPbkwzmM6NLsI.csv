coro naldo
cause youre the only one for me all i want is a girl like you
its the way that you make me feel all i want is a girl like you
cause youre the only one for me all i want is a girl like you
its the way that you make me feel all i want is a girl like you

verso 1 daddy yankee maybe
straight up youre so bad baby you hot
in the hood you feel the tension when you walk down the block
thats the reason you in my head believe it or not
me and you can run the world like big pun and pac
cause you my main homie my main shawty
cock back hammers and bang homie protecting our gauge slowly
with a girl like you forget the nonsense
we dont give a fuck about the chicos and gossip dile
daddy yankee you shining right now

what you know about big thingsz chrome wheels own deals
me and you holding it down its all real come on

verso 2 daddy yankee
yo la negra tiene tumbao cuando camina de lao
por la calle ocho sin miedo we be wildin out
switching lanes on the freeway corriendo por miles
a little foreplay like bonnie and clyde en el crimen
flossing jewels is not a felony
how am i a playa ma do i look like bill bellamy
no te molestes yo soy tuyo na mas
im not a player i just crush a lot
come on

coro naldo
tú eres la chica ideal para mí all i want is a girl like you
como tú nadie me ha hecho sentir all i want is a girl like you
cause youre the only one for me all i want is a girl like you
its the way that you make me feel all i want is a girl like you

coro naldo
cause youre the only one for me all i want is a girl like you
its the way that you make me feel all i want is a girl like you
cause youre the only one for me all i want is a girl like you
its the way that you make me feel all i want is a girl like you
