you pull me by my hair so i dont go nowhere
tell me you love me but you treat me like im never there
you say the cruelest words and yes they break my heart
cause im over here working my ass off

prechorus
why is it so hard to see why
if i cut myself i would bleed ouch
im just like you youre like me
imperfect and human are we

chorus
show and tell
im on display for all you fuckers to see
show you tell
harsh words if you dont get a pic with me
buy and sell buy and sell me baby
like im a product to society
art dont sell
unless youve fucked every authority

verse 2
you beg and cry for more and yet im on the floor
there are strangers takin pictures of me when i ask no more
its really hard for me to say just how i feel
im scared that ill get thrown away like a banana peel
