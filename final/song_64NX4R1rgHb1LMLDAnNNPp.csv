verse
i wrote this song for you so you should pay attention
i was just staring at the ceiling and got in my feelings
reminiscing about us fighting fucking and chilling
right now im riding through memphis passing through the city
im with my niggas but i miss you girl dont get it twisted
and i cannot wait til i see you hug you and kiss you
remember when i had first met you how i used to sweat you
i used to call your phone and text you and tell you youre special
like girl youre special you the kinda girl that i need
i actually made you mine sometimes i cant believe
wonder what your nigga was thinking when he let you leave
you try to leave i might get down on my hands and knees
im still a g please believe but girl you make me weak
you make me feel something i never felt the reason i never left
a lot of hoes want your position but they tripping
you been with me since the beginning and thats the way ima end it
you might also likechorus
but just in case you feel you cannot stay babe
cars clothes and hoes id trade it all
for a guaranteed spot in your heart
wonder do you miss me when im busy on the road
wonder do you hear me im in houston all alone
and im thinking bout you yeah yeah
i been thinking bout you yeah yeah yeah yeah
just in case you feel you cannot stay babe
cars clothes and hoes id trade it all
for a guaranteed spot in your heart
wonder do you miss me when im busy on the road
wonder do you hear me im in houston all alone
and im thinking bout you yeah yeah
i been thinking bout you yeah yeah yeah yeah20embed"
