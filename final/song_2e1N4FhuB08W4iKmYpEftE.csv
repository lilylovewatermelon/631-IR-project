everybodys on the same page
no new chapters
well never change
everybody wants to be cool yes they do
and im just like them
but i wont be no fool
i guess i could waste all my time and my money
just tryna look right
but it doesnt change who i am in my heart if i look like a dime

chorus
so i want you to close your eyes
sing to the world tonight
and show them whats beautiful
i dont care what they think
no im not listening
cause i know im beautiful
so close your eyes

postchorus
