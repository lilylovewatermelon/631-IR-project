im an old man now i cant do nothing
young folks dont pay me no mind
but in my day i sure was something
before i felt the heavy hand of time

verse 2
im an old man now im bound for glory
time to lay these burdens down
had enough of this old world of worry
gonna trade my troubles for a crown

chorus
i will make my way across the fields of cotton
and wade through muddy waters one last time
and in my dreams i come out clean
when i reach the other side
west of where the sun sets where rainbows never die

verse 3
ive got one last thing to do
one more mile before im through
casting off these earthly chains
going where theres no more pain

chorus
i will make my way across the fields of cotton
and wade through muddy waters one last time
and in my dreams i come out clean
when i reach the other side
west of where the sun sets where rainbows never die
