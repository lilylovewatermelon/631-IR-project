maybe you were right maybe i could have changed
sitting here alone tonight thinking bout a lot of things
whats a man to say when all the questions start
hell i know deep down inside my broken heart

chorus
couldve tried just a little bit harder
kissed you just a little bit sweeter
held on just a little bit longer
dug down just a little bit deeper
let the world revolve around you
and give you the stars above
loved you just enough to make you stay
and id lost you anyway

verse 2
i hate it when its like this baby its like that now
nothing i can say to you you even care to talk about
how you going to dress it up wrap it in a pretty bow
when its gone its gone for good baby at least i know

chorus
couldve tried just a little bit harder
kissed you just a little bit sweeter
held on just a little bit longer
dug down just a little bit deeper
let the world revolve around you
and give you the stars above
loved you just enough to make you stay
and id lost you anyway
you might also likeoutro
let the world revolve around you
and given you the stars above
loved you just enough to make you stay
and id lost you anywayembed"
