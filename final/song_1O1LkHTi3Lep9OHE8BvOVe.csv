your love is magical thats how i feel
but i have not the words here to explain
gone is the grace for expressions of passion
but there are worlds and worlds of ways to explain
to tell you how i feel but i am

chorus
speechless speechless
thats how you make me feel
though im with you
i am far away and nothing is for real

postchorus
when im with you i am lost for words
i dont know what to say
my heads spinning like a carousel
so silently i pray

verse 2
helpless and hopeless thats how i feel inside
nothings real but all is possible if god is on my side
when im with you im in the light where i can not be found
its as though i am standing in the place called hallowed ground

chorus
speechless speechless speechless speechless
thats how you make me feel
though im with you ooh
i am far away and nothing is for real
