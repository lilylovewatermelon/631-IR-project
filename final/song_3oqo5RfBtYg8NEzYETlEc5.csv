verse 1
i hate a jealous man one who doesnt understand
that im attractive so of course men wanna take my hand
and lead me off around the corner maybe to their place
but when they speak you get mad jumpin all up in my face
but on the other hand when women come and speak to you
you kiss and hug em like its somethin that you let me do
youre only jealous cause you know the ish you put me through
i might turn right around and do that ish to you
