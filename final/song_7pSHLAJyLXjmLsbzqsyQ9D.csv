she was raised up in jersey
i said oh lord have mercy
never seen a one light town till she moved down here
she said im so bored out of my mind
need a starbucks and a wifi
or a jet airliner to fly me anywhere
i said do you wanna take a drive in my truck
dont pay no mind to that 12 point buck
laid across my hood
you ever been to

chorus
rome georgia
picked peaches off the trees
climbed the water tower in paris tennessee
been to florence alabama
drank muscadine wine
just give me a chance to change your mind
so before you go and fly away girl
let me show you round a country boys world

verse 2
somewhere between there on a dirt road
when i rolled down my window
she smelled wildflowers on the summer wind
with just a bite of homemade ice cream
and a glass of mommas sweet tea
this ole hollers got a way of making friends
shed never seen a glowing field of fireflies
or the twinkle of a star in a southern sky
she fell in love
we went down to

just give me a chance to change your mind
says shell never fly away and shes my girl
its cause i showed her round a country boys world

oh now shes riding shotgun
saying baby lets run wild
and go down to

chorus
rome georgia
picked peaches off the trees
climbed the water tower in paris tennessee
been to florence alabama
drank muscadine wine
she gave me a chance and i made her mine
