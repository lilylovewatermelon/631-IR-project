verse 1
yeah yeah
and if by chance this is my grand finale
bury me in allegheny county its the
the most hated so faded that im bowlegged
dont bathe gross gang smell like old lo mein shit
the flow dangerous make you wanna do the wave
throw your bitch right off your lap and start a standing ovation
the most strangest master of the ceremonies
a fifth of stoli then itâ€™s only cher and moby karaoke
my bitch a shooter call her annie oakley
get you for a pair of kobes just got out on probation
and no famous friends for me just old faces
i only go places wasted like im joe namath
not a king im no david music im a crackhead
no hobbies and recreation dont even know my address
selfmedicate selfeducation
rick rubin showed me transcendental meditation

let us have a grand finale
the world will be just fine without me
the clown got a smile on his face
slow it down we goin out with a bang
are you ready for the fireworks
it was a silent night til the fireworks

verse 2
yeah okay i
i fear nothin on this odyssey of dark roads
god lives in my dogs soul the devil in his dog bowl
we are the prophets jesus was a poor sport
he booted nostradamus turned water into wine
but he loved the gin and tonic had skeletons in his closet
even god will one day be forgotten
and recently i been feelin i been feelin like
itd be really nice to get to sit with mickey weiss
shoot the shit bout life hed be pissed im sniffin white
never got to see me grow up how long it take to live a life
im a bit surprised that im even still alive
mixin uppers and downers practically suicide
my old jewish mind remember music youll be fine
and i make my own beats now if you behind
hallucinations how i use my mind
who am i

let us have a grand finale
