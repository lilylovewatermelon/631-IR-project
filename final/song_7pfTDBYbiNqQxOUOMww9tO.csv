member 2007 way before the misconception
back when aint nobody thought of me no different from the rest of em
all the kids who used to this yeah this shit how it is
shawties dyin mammas cryin this shit aint no way to live
i used to come up off that pack im talkin zati to the mids
and nowadays this shit ridiculous they thirsty for a bit
tell em free my main hitters all the street shit gang rigged
rats comin home cause they said what other niggas did
broski on the phone he just want another chance to live
but he on his own so long in the cell he say the crib
i was on my own thinkin bout that stupid shit i did
i got knocked for shit that i aint do but thats just how it is
put in pain we already up but still we tryna gain
light a flame see an opp we tryna penetrate his brain
you gon end up just like dummy if you try and take a chain
and if i ever contradict myself then tell me im a lame
im a real nigga try me i be quick to let it show
cause my hands work too but ill be quick to let it blow
and if you know what i be talkin bout it hit you if you know
on christmas eve i bet he wished that missile hit his toe
i be layin low still on go bentley for a show
stack my paper long so i aint takin any type of dough
this shit off the top know this aint a hit but ima flow
breathe let it go thats why my emotions never show
i been goin hard i been missin pop still the smelly block
solid to my roots you talk on eazy then you gettin dropped
said we kinda strange and thats the reason i dont mention
