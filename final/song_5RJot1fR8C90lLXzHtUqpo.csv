what would you do if i told you
you made me crazy
to see your pretty pics on sunset boulevard
and it makes me lazy
so i smoke cigarettes
just to understand the smog

prechorus
i love you lots like polka dots
youre killing me more
than coffee pots and instadots
with every drop i pour
and if i had to do it all again
i would because babe in the end
it brought me here to you

chorus
i left calabasas escaped all the ashes ran into the dark
and it made me wild wild wild at heart
the cameras have flashes they cause the car crashes
but im not a star
if you love me youll love me
cause im wild wild at heart
if they love me theyll love me
cause im wild wild at heart

what would you do if i wouldnt sing for them no more
like if you heard i was out in the bars drinkin jack and coke
going crazy for anyone who would listen to my stories babe
time after time i think about leaving
but you know that i never do just cause you keep me believin

prechorus
i love you lots despite the odds
youre killing me joe
and all these thoughts brought us apart
and thats okay too
cause even in the worst of times
you saw the best of me
and thats why i stay here with you

chorus
i left calabasas escaped all the ashes ran into the dark
and it made me wild wild wild at heart
the cameras have flashes they cause the car crashes
but im not a star
if you love me youll love me
cause im wild wild at heart
if you love me youll love me
cause im wild wild at heart
outro
cause baby im wild at heart
if you love me youll love me
cause im wild at heart
baby im wild wild at heart
if they love me theyll love me
cause im wild wild at heart
if they love me theyll love me
cause im wild wild at heart34embed"
