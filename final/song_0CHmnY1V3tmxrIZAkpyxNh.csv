ive got a really bad disease
its got me beggin on my hands and knees
so take me to emergency
cause somethin seems to be missin
somebody take the pain away
its like an ulcer bleedin in my brain
so send me to the pharmacy
so i can lose my memory

chorus
im elated medicated
lord knows i tried to find a way
to run away

verse 2
i think they found another cure
for broken hearts and feelin insecure
youd be surprised what i endure
what makes you feel so selfassured
i need to find a place to hide
you never know what could be waitin outside
the accidents that you could find
its like some kinda suicide

chorus
so what ails you is what impales you
i feel like ive been crucified
to be satisfied

im a victim of my symptom
i am my own worst enemy
youre a victim of your symptom
you are your own worst enemy
know your enemy

breakdown
im elated medicated
i am my own worst enemy
so what ails you is what impales you
you are your own worst enemy
youre a victim of the system
you are your own worst enemy
youre a victim of the system
you are your own worst enemy17embed"
