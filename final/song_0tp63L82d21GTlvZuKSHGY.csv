i love you in the morning when the blood runs to your cheeks
babe you are the first thing and the last thing that id see
i was just a boy striking matches upon your heart
i couldnt get no sparks
ask me to go faster put my foot down to the floor
standing at the edge i feel like i been here before
loved you in the darkness and i loved you in fluorescent light
if it dont feel right babe

refrain
you can run and hide babe
like a bird you can take flight
if ive been holding on too tight
if ive been holding on
mmm oooh
oooh oooh ooooh

verse 2
your mother always told us we should go out to the dance
you cant get struck by lightning if youre not standing in the rain
take it as the truth or you can take it with a grain of salt
if it dont work out
you were in the shower we were talking through the glass
packing up your suitcase you were humming to yourself
one day you were smiling i could tell by how you sounded on the phone
you said im coming home babe
see vance joy liveget tickets as low as 64you might also likerefrain
im thinking bout coming home babe
im thinking bout coming home babe
im thinking bout coming home babe
im thinking bout coming home
mmm
im thinking bout coming home babe
mmm
im thinking bout coming home11embed"
