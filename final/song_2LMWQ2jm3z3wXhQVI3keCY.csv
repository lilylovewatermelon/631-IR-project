as i love you each day yeah
i wonder if you listen to
the words i sing and what i say

they say that your first love never dies
you can put out the flame but not the fire
bottled up inside but cant come out

first love you were my first love
first love
first love

friends say you ask of me
and talk of how we used to be yeah
at times i wondered if id dare
ring and tell you how i care

they say that your first love never dies
you can put out the flame but not the fire
round and round i keep on going
like a spiral never slowing

first love you were my first love
first love
first love

first love you were my first
first love you were my first love
