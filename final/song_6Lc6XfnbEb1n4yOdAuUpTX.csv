we were two heartbeats away from wedding rings
and a pretty ballgown dress at the church off 40 west
and we were talkin bout our future on the steps
of your daddys screenedin porch that if id ask youd tell me yes

verse 2
well it only took a month or so to be someone you used to know
you didnt really have to go but you did
and ive never been a somber soul but part of me aint here no more
and ive been tryna find him ever since

chorus
so now i take my whiskey sour
sittin barside after hours
thinkin how can i get over
if the love was never ours
and i know you got my message
all my xs and my os
and it kills me by the hour
now i take my whiskey sours alone

verse 3
cause that one night under neon was the first time you ordered me one
and you told me that you loved me but was it ever true
cause your promises were empty now im drinkin one too many
drownin out the memory of you
see kane brown liveget tickets as low as 19you might also likechorus
so now i take my whiskey sour
sittin barside after hours
thinkin how can i get over
if the love was never ours
and i know you got my message
all my xs and my os
and it kills me by the hour
now i take my whiskey sours

bridge
and i dont know why i do it its supposed to help me through it
but its harder when it always tastes like you
and every time i hit rock bottom i dont know what i should do
should i call you up again or should i settle for round two

chorus
and just take my whiskey sour
sittin barside after hours
thinkin how can i get over
if the love was never ours
hell i know you got my message
all my xs and my os
and it kills me by the hour
now i take my whiskey sours alone
outro
and it kills me by the hour
now i take my whiskey sour alone1embed"
