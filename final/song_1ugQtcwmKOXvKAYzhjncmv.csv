i was wrong to say i loved her i was wrong to think im right
when i told her it was over well my darling i had lied
ive been running from my demons afraid to look behind
ive been running from myself afraid of what id find

chorus
but how am i supposed to love you when i dont love who i am
and how can i give you all of me when im only half a man
cause im a sinking ship thats burning so let go of my hand
oh how can i give you all of me when im only half a man

verse 2
and now im stuck in this hotel room by a cold neon light
and ive been waiting for an answer but it wont come tonight
and every bottle i had stolen lay shattered on the floor
whats broken cant be whole anymore

chorus
but how am i supposed to love you when i dont love who i am
and how can i give you all of me when im only half a man
cause im a sinking ship thats burning so let go of my hand
oh how can i give you all of me when im only half a man

bridge
and no one can ever hurt me like ive hurt myself
cause im made out of stone and im beyond help
dont give your heart to me

but how am i supposed to love you when i dont love who i am
and how can i give you all of me when im only half a man
cause im a sinking ship thats burning so let go of my hand
oh how can i give you all of me when im only half a man
