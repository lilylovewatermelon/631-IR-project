cause when its murda motherfucker
everybody gotta die

verse 1 tah murdah
money aint never been nothing
i hit the block if this shit get ugly
and it aint never been in my heart to let niggas thug me
hit the dealer and cop a drop if the eyes is buggy
and pull up in front of the spot cause the mommies love me
its gangsta yeah and aint no nigga gon match me
stocky chubby nigga voice real raspy
i see you real flashy but that aint gone last nigga
pop fire off shots and thats your ass nigga
its war now thats why i keep the four with long nozzle
sixhundred bad bitch on it holding down the throttle
and fuck that beef shit cause some beef wont die
and some niggas will say they gangsta but they wont ride
and while its hard for you to decide ill let it fly
forty shots hit your ride up hit the tropics and hide up
under palm trees to white sand
everything is a price man
you snipe when bullets are piping hot
when its your flesh it begin warming you
now die motherfucker die
cause im tired of warning you
see ja rule liveget tickets as low as 57you might also likeverse 2 black child
yeah we here now die motherfucker
dont get scared now die motherfucker
black child im off parole its murda now
in a hood near you about to burn it down
word to god it feels like im from every hood
cause when you ghetto your ghetto with gets you good
sell cracks if you could bust your gat when you should
its for my blacks from the bricks back to inglewood
we eat together nigga fuck the crossroads
in this world my flow is another lost soul
my shit sounds like shots from a four pound
for these bitch clowns its war now
its all about paper thats my issue
fuck peace you can have a piece of the pistol

chorus ja rule
everybody gonna die but nobody want dead
die motherfucker die its your life
everybody wanna live but they wanna live scared
die motherfucker die thats your life
everybody gonna die but nobody want dead
die motherfucker die its your life
everybody wanna live but they wanna live scared
die motherfucker die thats your life
verse 3 ja rule
niggas know the truth
rule raises the roof
cause i pop more shots than abdulrauf
and when the concludes i bring closure to the situ
come through squeeze eight out the stolen black pinto
niggas know my mental kill or be killed head for the hills
but dont never slide down it if you to high ground it puff puff
uhhh is how it sounded two shots thru and silent
and one nigga stripped of his talents
new fucking yiddy city the sex and violence
where first time offenders get floated to the island
and one time give a nigga one time
breathe wrong and a nigga have a blown mind
i blow lines like an addict
bust guns erratic shine blind like carats
rules above average me and this music make a marriage
so i thee wed til im either jailed or dead motherfuckers
feel me niggas

bridge black child
word to god
feel us nigga
we here again
its murda
chorus ja rule
everybody gonna die but nobody want dead
die motherfucker die its your life
everybody wanna live but they wanna live scared
die motherfucker die thats your life
everybody gonna die but nobody want dead
die motherfucker die its your life
everybody wanna live but they wanna live scared
die motherfucker die thats your life1embed"
