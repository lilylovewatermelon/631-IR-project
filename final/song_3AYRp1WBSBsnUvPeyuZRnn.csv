the unwritable girl
who sleeps in my hand
in this interstate world

who leaves me for dead
in my ghost town grey
and returns like color tv

and ive tried to run
my little miles
stumble over my sin
youll never find me out
its been just one dream
were living in
but youre still and youre bright and youre quiet
