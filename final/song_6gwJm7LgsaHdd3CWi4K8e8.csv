with her high heel against the wall
kind of dancing though not at all
she had stockings running up to her thigh
snaps her fingers to keep the time

from the back of the room i saw her there
i said she wants to be alone and i shouldnt dare
but then she noticed me glance at her
i had no choice but to dance with her

chorus
the lights that move sideways and up and down
the beat takes you over and spins you round
our hearts steadybeating the sweat turns to cold
were slaves to the dj and out of control

verse 2
i watched her feet move her hips they sway
does a hair flip then starts to say
oh my god its my favorite song
i pull her close and she sings along

we cant slow down even if we tried
if the record keeps spinning so will i
she likes disco and tastes like a tear
tells me dont stop dancing and shes pulling me near
you might also likechorus
the lights that move sideways and up and down
the beat takes you over and spins you round
our hearts steadybeating the sweat turns to cold
were slaves to the dj and out of control

bridge
weve got nowhere to go weve got nothing to prove
instead of dancing alone i should be dancing with you
this song is turning me on the beat is doing me in
or maybe its only you but either way lets begin

weve got nowhere to go weve got nothing to prove
instead of dancing alone i should be dancing with you
this song is turning me on the beat is doing me in
or maybe its only you but either way lets begin

weve got nowhere to go weve got nothing to prove
instead of dancing alone i should be dancing with you
this song is turning me on the beat is doing me in
or maybe its only you but either way lets begin

chorus
the lights that move sideways and up and down
the beat takes you over and spins you round
our hearts steadybeating the sweat turns to cold
were slaves to the dj and out of control
the lights that move sideways and up and down
the beat takes you over and spins you round
our hearts steadybeating the sweat turns to cold
were slaves to the dj and out of control4embed"
