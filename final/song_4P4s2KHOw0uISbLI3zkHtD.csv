seems like only yesterday life belonged to runaways
nothin here to see no lookin back
every sound monotone every color monochrome
life began to fade into the black
such a simple animal sterilized with alcohol
i could hardly feel me anymore
desperate meaningless all filled up with emptiness
felt like everythin was said and done

chorus
i lay there in the dark and i closed my eyes
you saved me the day you came alive

verse 2
still i tried to find my way spinnin hours into days
burnin like a flame behind my eyes
drown it out drink it in crown the king of sufferin
prisoner a slave to the disguise
disappeared the only thing bittersweet surrenderin
knew that it was time to say goodbye

chorus
and i lay there in the dark and i closed my eyes
you saved me the day you came alive
no reason left me to survive
you saved me the day you came alive

come alive come alive come alive come alive
come alive come alive come alive come alive
come alive come alive come alive come alive
come alive come alive come alive come alive

chorus
i lay there in the dark and i closed my eyes
you saved me the day you came alive

come alive come alive come alive come alive
come alive come alive come alive come alive
come alive come alive come alive come alive
come alive come alive come alive

bridge
nothin more to give
i can finally live come alive
your life into me
i can finally breathe come alive

chorus
i lay there in the dark open my eyes
you saved me the day you came alive
outro
come alive come alive come alive come alive
come alive come alive come alive come alive
come alive come alive come alive5embed"
