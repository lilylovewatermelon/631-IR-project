i mistook the warnings for wisdom
from socalled friends quick to advise
though your touch was telling me
otherwise

verse 2
somehow i saw you as a weakness
i thought i had to be strong
oh but i was just young i was scared
i was wrong

chorus
not a night goes by i dont dream of wandering
through the home that might have been
i listened to my pride when my heart cried out for you
now every day i wake again
in a house that might have been
a home

verse 3
guess i did what i did believing
that love is a dangerous thing
oh but that couldnt hurt anymore
than never knowing
you might also likechorus
not a night goes by i dont dream of wandering
through the home that might have been
i listened to my pride when my heart cried out for you
now every day i wake again
in a house that might have been
a home
a home

bridge
four walls a roof a door some windows
just a place to run when my workin day is through
they say home is where the heart is
if the exception proves the rule i guess thats true

chorus
not a night goes by i dont dream of wandering
through the home that might have been
i listened to my pride when my heart cried out for you
now every day i wake again
in a house that might have been
a home
a homeembed"
