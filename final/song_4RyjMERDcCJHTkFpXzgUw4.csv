when will i see you again
you left with no goodbye not a single word was said
no final kiss to seal any sins
i had no idea of the state we were in

prechorus
i know i have a fickle heart and a bitterness
and a wandering eye and a heaviness in my head

chorus
but dont you remember
dont you remember
the reason you loved me before
baby please remember me once more

verse 2
when was the last time that you thought of me
or have you completely erased me from your memory
i often think about where i went wrong
the more i do the less i know

prechorus
but i know i have a fickle heart and a bitterness
and a wandering eye and a heaviness in my head

but dont you remember
dont you remember
the reason you loved me before
baby please remember me once more

bridge
gave you the space so you could breathe
i kept my distance so you would be free
in hope that youd find the missing piece
to bring you back to me

chorus
why dont you remember
dont you remember
the reason you loved me before
baby please remember me once more

outro
when will i see you again31embed"
