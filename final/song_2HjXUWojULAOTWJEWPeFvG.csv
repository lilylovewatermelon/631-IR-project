pretty as a picture of a patient on a fresh iv
giddy as a gangbanger with a set of sutures where his magic johnson ought to be
yes ill tell you just the thing you need to be the next big thing
lets start in with a test of your intelligence
and zest for the counterproductive
up and down and roundabout and out the back
and keep your mouth shut tight
the lights are staying out but no sweat ive got aim like a mack truck
guess how many fingers ok guess how many more i can fit there
guess right get the toaster but you know miss guessing gets you nowhere

ive been baking cakes for the enemy
ive been dying to find out the hard way
ive been taking friends to the alleyway
two down now but whos counting anyway

yes i can do everything you need from out of my new suv
all my work is guaranteed to last the length of your recovery
put away those pliers honey trust me cause i know the options
how about a ninemonth long vacation and a twofoot coffin

ive been getting up close and intimate
some close calls but im getting into it
in some states they say you can burn for it
but ill burn that bridge when i get to it
you might also likeits not a bad thing
to get professional
its got a nice ring
mandy goes to med school

ive been taking tips from the government
ive been getting damn good at hiding it
fifty bucks a month ought to cover it
two down now but whos gonna notice it
and if you show up and i am unavailable
my partner brian would love to take care of you
he is a nice man
thoroughly reliable
hes in a rock band
and he goes to med schoolembed"
