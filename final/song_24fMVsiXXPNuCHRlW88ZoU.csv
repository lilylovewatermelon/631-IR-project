somethin is wrong with the sum of us
that i cant seem to erase
how can i be the only one
without a smile on my face well now

chorus
youre laughin out loud
at just the thought of bein alive
and i was wonderin
could i just be you tonight

verse 2
you show your pain like it really hurts
and i cant even start to feel mine
well im standin in place with my head first and i shake i shake
and i see your progress stretched out for miles and miles

chorus
youre laughin out loud
at just the thought of bein alive
and i was wonderin
could i just be you tonight

bridge
this is the sound that i make
these are the words i chose
somehow the right thing to say
just wont come out
just wont come out
