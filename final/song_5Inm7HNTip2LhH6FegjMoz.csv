drank in my cup blunt in my hand
hoes on my dick cause they know im the man
im in the vip cause im very important tant
unfortunately i see some niggas i cant stand i cant staind
so i stepped to them suckers and confronted em like i should
we can settle this now or we can settle this in the hood
uhh so what yall wanna do i got a hundred dudes
we got a hundred tools tryin to get on somethin new

im loyal to my soil i dont need no ultimatum
stop hatin i ride with my crimeys in crime
i grind with the gritty and grime lets go
im buyin my yola you gettin chronic you gettin chronic
im tryin to go out the park you tryin to bunt it you tryin to bunt it
so you know if i drop it then its a hit then its a hit
