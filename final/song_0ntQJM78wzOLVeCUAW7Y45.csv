lay where youre layin
dont make a sound
i know theyre watchin
theyre watchin
all the commotion
the kiddielike play
it has people talkin
talkin

chorus
you
your sex is on fire

verse 2
the dark of the alley
the breakin of day
head while im drivin
im drivin
soft lips are open
them knuckles are pale
feels like youre dyin
youre dyin

chorus
you
your sex is on fire
consumed
with whats to transpire

hot as a fever
rattlin bones
i could just taste it
taste it
if its not forever
if its just tonight
oh were still the greatest
the greatest the greatest

chorus
you
your sex is on fire
you
your sex is on fire ah
consumed
with whats to transpire
and you
your sex is on fire
consume
with whats to transpire61embed"
