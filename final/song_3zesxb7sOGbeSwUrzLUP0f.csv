my head is filled with ruins
most of them i built with you
now the dust no longer moves
dont disturb the ghost of you mmm
they are empty they are worn
tell me what we built this for
on my way to somethin more
youre that one i cant ignore mmm

chorus
im gonna miss you
i still care
sometimes i wish we never built this palace
but real love is never a waste of time mmm

verse 2
yeah i know just what youre sayin
and i regret ever complainin
bout this heart and all its breakin
it was beauty we were makin mmm
and i know well both move on
youll forgive what i did wrong
they will love the better you
but i still own the ghost of you mmm
