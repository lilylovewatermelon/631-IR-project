i dont want to move too fast but
cant resist your sexy ass
just spread spread for me
i cant i cant wait to get you home
dont want to come on too strong but
ill play in you all day long
just spread spread for me
i cant i cant wait to get you home

verse 1 andré 3000
i i cant read minds but i can read yours
i think she says that she wants to pour
your your yourself all over me
what you think i could be wrong but pupils dont lie
and if they do by god they must fry fry
you know like electric chair
the way you stare yeah im there
you committed a crime and im the victim

verse 2 andré 3000
ive got an eye out for she that cries out passionately
well do things backwardly forwardly horizontally
im too young to be settlin down
quick to change my mind tomorrow
so now can i borrow your timid torso
more so than your soul honest me gotta be how i roll
fuck the rhythm tuck the rhythm under your bosom
youre the prism shirley chisholm
was the first lets rehearse makin a baby
put in your order i want a baby daughter
dance on the tip of my tongue
shake the clouds until theres no more wetness in them
tell your homegirls that you will send them
a postcard from 3000 hard

dont want to make you feel strange but
dont let these words be in vain
so spread spread for me
i cant i cant wait to get you home
nature knows that i want you but
not unless you want me too
so spread spread for me
i cant i cant wait to get you home
