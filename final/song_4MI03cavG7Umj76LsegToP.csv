im a solitary man
nothing means more than my freedom
a few days ago i swear
i walked out of there believin
i could let you go

chorus
i know how freedom feels
ive heard that sound beneath my wheels
nothin or no one to slow me down
but since i told you goodbye
somethin just aint right
freedom feels like lonely tonight

verse 2
out on this open road
anywhere i wanna go is waitin
all i can think about
is turnin this ol truck around and takin
that road back to you

chorus
i know how freedom feels
ive heard that sound beneath my wheels
nothin or no one to slow me down
but since i told you goodbye
somethin just aint right
freedom feels like lonely tonight
