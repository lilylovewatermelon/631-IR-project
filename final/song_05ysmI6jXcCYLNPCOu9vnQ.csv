they couldnt believe i did it but i was so committed
my life was so restricted for you for you
i just dove inside it blind couldnt see what swam inside
thought thatd be romantic for you

verse 2
exchanged my vows and said it all on the ledge prepared to fall
even screaming damn it for you remember
my friends said you would play me but i just said theyre crazy
while i was crying frantic was it true

chorus
why should i be sad heaven knows
from the stupid freaking things that you do stupid freaking things
why should i get mad feel sad who knows
lets just take it all as a sign that were through goodbye

postchorus
its time for me to move along goodbye
its time for me to get it on okay
im tired of singing sad songs alright
its time for me britney lets go

verse 3
i sent you to vegas with a pocket full of paper
and with no ultimatums on you
i thought what could separate us but it just seemed that vegas
only brought the player outta you hey baby whats your name you think
