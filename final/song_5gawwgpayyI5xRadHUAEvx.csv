ive lost the plot again tell your friends to sharpen their teeth
theres a few quid to be made
and my souls a sorry state so come on down you empty lovers
worms come out of the woodwork and the snakes start to sing

verse 1
do you feel the chill clawing at the back of your neck
i start to spill did you really think that you could fix me
theyll sell your bones for another roll
well sharpen your teeth tell yourself that its just business

chorus
worms come out of the woodwork
leeches crawl from out of the dirt
rats come out of the holes they call home
i fall apart and the snakes start to sing

verse 2
dont say im better off dead
cause heavens full and hell wont have me
wont you make some room in your bed
well you could lock me up in your heart and throw away the key
wont you take me out of my head
im just a woulda been coulda been shoulda been
never was and never ever will be
well sharpen your teeth tell yourself that its just business
woulda been coulda been shoulda been
never was and never ever will be
worms come out of the woodwork and the snakes start to sing

worms come out of the woodwork
leeches crawl from out of the dirt
rats come out of the holes they call home
i fall apart and the snakes start to sing

instrumental break

outro
if you cant soar with the eagles then dont fly with the flock
are you still getting high
did you catch your own reflection in the knife my mother held
or the hell in my fathers eyes
if you cant soar with the eagles then dont fly with the flock
are you still getting by
was i your knight in shining armour the apple of your eye
or just a step to climb
if you cant soar with the eagles then dont fly with the flock
are you still getting high
did you catch your own reflection in the knife my mother held
or the hell in my fathers eyes
if you cant soar with the eagles then dont fly with the flock
are you still getting by
was i your knight in shining armour or the apple of your eye
or just a step a fucking step to climb42embed"
