when youre out with your friends in your new mercedesbenz
and youre on drugs
and you show up late for school cause you think youre really cool
when youre on drugs
and you put on your headphones and you step into the zone
when youre on drugs
but the world dont care if you are or are not there
cause youre on drugs

chorus
give it to me we are all on drugs yeah
never gettin enough never gettin enough
we are all on drugs yeah
give me some of that stuff whoo

verse 2
and you twitch in your seat cause you wanna hit the street
when youre on drugs
and you cause such a fuss cause theres no one you can trust
when youre on drugs
and the best of your days will all vanish in the haze
when youre on drugs
and you wish you could quit cause youre really sick of it
but youre on drugs
