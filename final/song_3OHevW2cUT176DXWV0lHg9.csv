drag him out your window
dragging out the dead
singing i miss you
snakes and ladders
flip the lid
out pops the cracker
smacks you in the head
knifes you in the neck
kicks you in the teeth
steel toe caps
takes all your credit cards
get up get the gunge
get the eggs
get the flan in the face
the flan in the face
the flan in the face
dance you fucker dance you fucker
dont you dare dont you dare
dont you flan in the face
take it with the love its given
take it with a pinch of salt
take it to the taxman
let me back let me back
i promise to be good
dont look in the mirror
at the face you dont recognize
help me call the doctor put me inside
put me inside put me inside
put me inside put me inside

i keep the wolf from the door but he calls me up
calls me on the phone tells me all the ways that hes gonna mess me up
steal all my children if i dont pay the ransom
and ill never see them again if i squeal to the cops

verse 2
walking like giant cranes and
with my xray eyes i strip you naked
in a tight little world and are you on the list
stepford wives who are we to complain
investments and dealers investments and dealers
cold wives and mistresses
cold wives and sunday papers
city boys in first class
dont know were born at all
just know someone else is gonna come and clean it up
born and raised for the job
someone always does
oh i wish youd get up
get over get up get over turn your tape off
chorus
i keep the wolf from the door but he calls me up
calls me on the phone tells me all the ways that hes gonna mess me up
steal all my children if i dont pay the ransom
and ill never see them again if i squeal to the cops
