she said lets change our luck
this night is all we got
drive fast until
we crash this deadend life
sweet dreams that wont come true
id leave it all for you
brick walls are closing in
lets make a run tonight

prechorus
blinded by the lights
hold you through forever
wont let you go

chorus
cause if you jump i will jump too
we will fall together from the buildings ledge
never looking back at what
weve done
well say it was love
cause i would die for you on skyway avenue

verse 2
she said dont change your mind
lets leave this town behind
well race right off the cliff
they will remember this
it all got so mundane
with you im back again
just take me by the hand
were close to the edge
you might also likeprechorus
blinded by the lights
hold you through forever
wont let you go

chorus
cause if you jump i will jump too
we will fall together from the buildings ledge
never looking back at what
weve done
well say it was love
cause i would die for you on skyway avenue

bridge
where are your guts to fly
soaring through through the night
and if you take that last step
ill follow you
leave the ledge and fly
were finally alive

chorus
cause if you jump i will jump too
we will fall together from the buildings ledge
never looking back at what weve done
well say it was love
cause i would die for you on skyway avenue
outro
so whats left to prove
we have made it through8embed"
