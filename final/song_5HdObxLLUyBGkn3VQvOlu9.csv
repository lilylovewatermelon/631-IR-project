i look around and all i see is evil
the walking dead disguised as real people
its kill or be killed cause life is not forever
it comes apart and then it falls together

prechorus
i am what you made me
till death do i part

chorus
its the world ive grown to know
unforgiving and so cold
take it away take it away
i dont want it
its a life im forced to live
ive got nothing more to give
take it away take it away
i dont want it anymore
were generation dead
were dead

verse 2
you see yourself as such a fucking shepherd
but you trip the blind and then you curse the leper
do you really want my true opinion
youve taken more than youve ever given

you are what you are
until death do you part

chorus
its the world ive grown to know
