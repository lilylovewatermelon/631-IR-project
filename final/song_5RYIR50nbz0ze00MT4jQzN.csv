found my way to the highway
i dont wanna tell you the state im in
ive had too much to smoke too much to drink where have i been
i feel like the stars are getting closer and the sky is closing in
and i dont know where to begin

prechorus
were all looking for something to take away the pain

chorus
me and you and my medication making the best of it
love is just a chemical creation will it be permanent
synthetic sensation
me you and my medication

verse 2
the way back to the right track maybe you can help me find the door
is it too much to ask too much too fast too much to ignore
it feels like your bodys getting closer but you seem so far away
medicine make it ok

prechorus
were all looking for someone to take away the pain

chorus
me and you and my medication making the best of it
love is just a chemical creation will it be permanent
synthetic sensation
me you and my medication
see boys like girls liveget tickets as low as 77you might also likebridge
so can you feel it
do you feel it coming down
you gotta get up
can you get up off the ground
can you hear it
can you hear me screaming
so can you feel it
do you feel it coming down
you gotta get up
can you get up off the ground
i wanna hear it
wanna hear you breathing

prechorus
were all addicted to something that takes away the pain

chorus
me and you and my medication making the best of it
love is just a chemical creation will it be permanent
synthetic sensation
me you and my medicationembed"
