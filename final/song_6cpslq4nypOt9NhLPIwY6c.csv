they changed so much you know what im saying
how did these two motherfuckers from new orleans
how did they change how did they change music

verse 1 ruby da cherry
yeah i was the wave but now i feel the tide pullin back
ocean flat often i lay in this coffin sleep on my back toss a couple of em back
my liver really startin to slack and i can feel myself decayin from the cigarette packs
i havent thought of uicide since i was livin in the back of blackouts pad my heart torn in half
now ive got everything i ever wanted but now i dont want it
it feels like im haunted it feels like im cursed hopefully soon ill return to the dirt
a material world with a virtual nerve yeah ill see what its worth throw me out on the curb
leave me behind walk a straight line to hell as yall swerve away lost in the choice not to sell
roll me up a blunt ayy i need to get lost ayy
all yall talkin bout sauce im wipin frozen cuts with frost
im slicin open guts and tossin frauds off to the side half of uicide
a couple million now were ready to fucking die

verse 2 lick loth
two cups and a bad bitch then i pop me a xanax quick
call shake when i need that fix call nick when i need that itch
call krez just to pop on phetamine max beck in the back pop seventeen
yung kurt cobain with the heroin lick love drugs over everything
shoot the stars up in my veins woah but look at your bankroll
so just spend it on more dope more woes fuck you care for
but lately i feel guilty i feel so badly
they say i made it and that should be satisfactory
lately i feel like i have nobody
all alone in an empty hotel lobby
see uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likerefrain lick loth
4 am praying can i get some rest
dreams of uicide and the need for death
4 am praying can i get some rest
dreams of uicide and the need for death
