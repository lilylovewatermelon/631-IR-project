ive been changing but youll never see me now
ive been changing but youll never see me
now im blaming you for everything

verse 1
no more holding it in
how many years can i pretend
and nothing ever goes the way it should
no more sitting in this place
hoping you might see it my way
cause i dont think you ever understood
that what im looking for are the answers
to why these questions never go away

chorus
im so far away
ive been changing but youll never see me now
im so far away
now im blaming you for everything

verse 2
no more waiting for the end
of every day that i will spend
wishing that i only had a choice
no more pushing it away
cause ill be busy watching things go my way
never looking back on this anymore
cause what im looking for are the answers
to why these questions never go away

verse 3
hey hey watch me wave
goodbye to yesterday
nothing left in my way
hey hey ive been saved
with sun shining on my pain
getting me through this day
hey hey watch me wave
goodbye to yesterday
nothing left in my way
feels so good to say

chorus
im so far away
ive been changing but youll never see me now
im so far away
now im blaming you
