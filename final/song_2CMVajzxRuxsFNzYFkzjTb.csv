verse 1
comme des garçons she say she like on me
flyer then a jet baby flyer than an eagle brr brr
can i take you out tonight go get somethin to eat
sit and ill tell you like things you dont know bout me
im like bae my grandma died i was at a sleepover
im like bae i could have died that night my whip had flipped over
young man take pride remember ridin and takin my grams to chemo
now i got grams like im frank matthews jewelry wеigh at least a kilo
now im back to you every timе that im in it like a pool she be wet inside
tryna hit it like i want but then i dont cause i be too high
feel its best if i let you decide cause this i dont wanna jeopardize
come lay me down every day im tired
fuck these hoes cause they be tellin lies
now i need a blueprint is you all in all all
i just gotta know gotta know
drugs got my mind clickin
on my kawasaki tryna do a heel clicker
down and out got me feeling suicidal oh

ima pull up thirty thousand dollar balmain jeans balmain jeans
pull up with that blicky and its tucked just like em beams
damn she dont like no dogs but hangin wit a snake
told her motherfuck the blogs just do what top say
is it real is it fake i dont know i cant tell
im just hopin time worth it im just hopin we dont fail
im just tryna hold on looks disguised cant prevail
insecure feel like i aint worth ya not enough for none of them
oohooh do you hear me calling right now full of indo
thirty minutes later probably be outside your window
throwin rocks until you turn your light on and say go home
dont know what the fuck is goin on were you expectin me to go
fuck it let me pack my clothes right back to that murder zone
fuck i miss my granddad home shouldnt have came up off the porch
feel that im gon die out here all alone and by myself

alive got breath on life support
alive got breath on life support
i said all my pain keep me goin your love keep me calm
they gon take it once they pull the cord
i call that life on life support ooh
they dont respect me no more they dont love me no more
they aint feelin my songs take my kids during the storm
they all gone they done took my life support

verse 2
im with the gang on the block in the trenches
i take you shoppin alone up in lenox
take you to shyne and flood your pendant
and spend straight dimes like fuck them pennies
shes a hypnotizin demonlover so satanic
i say black now i take that rock from metal
demonic so dynamic
straight from the block on that bitch in a foreign ima swerve
i aint worried i wont panic
yeah i was born and made it out so here i should lay down
a girl to make me settle down but i cant
i drop you off at moms house
while me and my cousins try to take rank bust brains
catch one lack hop out take aim
god forbid if them niggas shoot back and luckily just hit my brain
if i dont go in lord please have mercy know that she gon go insane
mistreat a nigga leave me then they act like im the one to blame
chorus
alive got breath on life support
alive got breath on life support
i said all my pain keep me goin your love keep me calm
they gon take it once they pull the cord
i call that life on life support
they dont respect me no more they dont love me no more
they aint feelin my songs take my kids during the storm
they all gone they done took my life support15embed"
