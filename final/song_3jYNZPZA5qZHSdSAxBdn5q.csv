bring the violence
its significant
to the life
if youve ever known anyone
bring the violence
its significant
to the life can you feel it

verse 1
how do you sleep
when you live with your lies
out of your mouth
up from your mind
that kind of thinking starts a chain reaction
you are a time bomb ticking away
you need to release
what youre feeling inside
let out the beast
that youre trying to hide
step right up and be a part of the action
get your game face on because
its time to play

prechorus
youre pushing and fighting your way
youre ripping it up

verse 2
how do you live
without playing the game
sit on the side
and expect to keep sane
step right up and be a part of the action
come get a piece of it before its too late
take a look around
you cant deny what you see
were living in a violent society
well my brother let me show you a better way
now get your game face on because
its time to play
