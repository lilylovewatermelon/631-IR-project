hold the line we aint done
dont give up this divine bond between us
the tide is high nothings lost
could turn over a new leaf for my love oh
a broken frame and i know
its pictures of jealousy
you dont believe me
when i show you often
were sacrificing some time
why all this in overdrive
with you beside me i become unraveled
and you can see right through me
no we cant go down like this
you are afraid to be fully open
though you can see all my cards
my hеart is in overdrive

chorus
my heart is racing
i cannot slow down and its bothеring me
how forward of me would it be to tell you to forward to me
you should be right here anyways
your energys calling for me
theres deeper places we can go
dont have to just party with me
i hope we can make it
i hope we can make it
i hope we can make it oh oh
i hope we can make it
i hope we can make it
i hope we can make it oh

hold the line we aint done
dont give up this divine bond between us
im hanging on but you dont see
its a phase well overcome my love oh
the tide is high and i know
its just waves of jealousy
me and you jealousy
you dont believe me
when i show you often
were sacrificing some time
why all this in overdrive
with you beside me i become unraveled
and you can see right through me
no we cant go down like this
you are afraid to be fully open
though you can see all my cards
my heart is in overdrive2embed"
