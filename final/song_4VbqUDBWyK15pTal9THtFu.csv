there is no greater love
than what i feel for you
no sweeter song no heart so true
there is no greater thrill
than what you bring to me
no sweeter song
than what you sing sing to me ooh
youre the sweetest thing
that ive ever known
and to think that you are mine you are mine alone
there is no greater love
in all the world its true
no greater love
