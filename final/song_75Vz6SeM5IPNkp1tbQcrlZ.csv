im sitting here reading the book of life
constantly asking myself why
why do babies have to die
n a mother gives up a price

can you see the man on the streets
doesnt even have enough to eat
n tell me when your walking by
can you see the tears in his eyes
somebody please tell me why

why
why does this world seem so cold seem so cold
just like a rich man
that wont give a pot a gold
oh no
why
before my life comes to an end
lets try to make amends and lets give it a chance
oh tell me why why

baby dont know her fathers name
n mothers confusedjust the same
shes saying that its alright
but she needs a father in her life
somebody please tell me why
you might also liken just like the sand on the beach
n just like the ocean runs so deep oh so deep
we all must take our part
n dig deep in our hearts
but i dont know where to start
