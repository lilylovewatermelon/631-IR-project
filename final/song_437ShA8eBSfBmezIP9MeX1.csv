im feeling mean today
not lost not blown away
just irritated and quite hated
selfcontrol breaks down
whys everything so tame
i like my life insane
im fabricating and debating
who im gonna kick around

chorus
right now cant find a way to get across the hate when i see you
right now i feel it scratch inside i wanna slash you and beat you
right now i rip apart the things inside that excite you
right now i cant control myself i fucking hate you

verse 2
im feeling cold today
not hurt just fucked away
im devastated and frustrated
god i feel so bound
so why do i feel the need
i think its time to bleed
im gonna cut myself
and watch the blood hit the ground
