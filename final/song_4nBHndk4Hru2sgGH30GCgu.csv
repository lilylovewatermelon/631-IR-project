chapter one we started happy
the second that you said you loved me
started questioning us
are we really in love
tryna figure out chapter three
but youre not giving me anything
if this is what we are then i gotta move on
you think this is everything but this is no book of love

chorus
you might think im crazy
that im lost and foolish leaving you behind
maybe youre right
you might think im crazy
that im lost and foolish leaving you behind
maybe youre right
maybe youre right

verse 2
here comes the part of you and me
arguing about nothing
you tell me its as good as it gets
yeah im real emotional
blame it on your mental jokes
how much did you think that i could take
so much for taking this too far
you cant blame me for who i am
its too late for us to try to be in love right now
