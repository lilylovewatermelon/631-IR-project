hello hello
and welcome to my show
yes im belting
well not melting
even though im made of snow
perhaps you may recall
i once needed my own flurry
but now you need not worry

chorus
who can handle this enormous candle
unmeltable me
whos not sweating this sweltering setting
unmeltable me

verse 2
yes elsas powers grew
and its a whole new situation
because of a relation
i now have selfrefrigeration

chorus
who is present but not liquescent
thats right i just learned to read
and i like the big words
unmeltable me
whos super cuddly and not all puddly
unmeltable me
whos inexhaustible undefrostable
humble and fun
its unmeltable

oh thank goodness youre here
grab a seat just about to bring it on home
