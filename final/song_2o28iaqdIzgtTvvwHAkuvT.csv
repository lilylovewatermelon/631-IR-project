verse 1
send away for a priceless gift
one not subtle one not on the list
send away for a perfect world
one not simply so absurd
cause in these times of doing what youre told
you keep these feelings that no one knows

prechorus
so whatever happened to the young mans heart
its swallowed by pain as he slowly fell apart

chorus
and im staring down the barrel of a 45
im swimming through the ashes of another life
theres no real reason to accept the way things have changed
staring down the barrel of a 45

verse 2
send a message to the unborn child
to keep your eyes open for a while
cause in a box high up on the shelf
thats left for you and no one else
theres a piece of a puzzle known as life
its wrapped in guilt and sealed up tight

so whatever happened to the young mans heart
its swallowed by pain as he slowly fell apart

chorus
and im staring down the barrel of a 45
im swimming through the ashes of another life
theres no real reason to accept the way things have changed
staring down the barrel of a 45

bridge
cause everyones pointing their fingers
youre always condemning me
well nobody knows what i believe
what i believe

chorus
and im staring down the barrel of a 45
im swimming through the ashes of another life
with no real reason to accept the way things have changed
staring down the barrel
and im staring down the barrel of a 45
and im swimming through the ashes of another life
there is no real reason to accept the way things have changed
staring down the barrel yeah of a 45

yeah of a 45
im staring down the barrel of a 45embed"
