may we all get to grow up in a red white and blue little town
get a wontstart handmedown ford to try to fix up
with some part time cash from driving a tractor
find a sweet little thang wears your ball cap backwards
kinda place you cant wait to leave but nobody does
cause you miss it too much

chorus florida georgia line
may we all know that nothing aint cool til you wear the new off
the sound of a quarter rollin down a jukebox
play the travis tritt right above the 2pac
fore you get lost down some road
slow rolling with the top off the back of a bronco
buy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto
shes smilin with her hair blowing out the window
where you bout to go
yeah you learn to fly and if you cant then you just freefall
may we all

verse 2 tim mcgraw
may we all get to see those fields of green turn gold
watch a marching band play with the harvest moon coming up
and know that fifteen minutes of famous
aint gonna be what makes us or breaks us but
well all be watching the tv the day that it comes

verse 3 both
may we all do a little bit better than the first time
learn a little something from the worst times
get a little stronger from the hurt times
may we all get to have a chance to ride the fast one
walk away wiser when we crashed one
keep hoping that the best one is the last one
