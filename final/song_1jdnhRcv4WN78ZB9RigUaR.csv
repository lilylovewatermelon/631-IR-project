we snuck in the back of that college town frat
cause they wouldnt let us in the front
threw their miller time keg in a chevrolet bed
and we let them horses run
cut a path through the grass yelling kiss my ass
with a middle finger in the wind
we laughed we drank every now and then i think
man id love to do that again

chorus
those were some good times
those were the best nights
thе freedom you feel when youre learning to fly
and thе song on the radio was singin our lives
i cant say that the moon in the sky
was shinin any brighter than it is tonight
but it looked on fire back then
it probably wasnt but it seemed a little better back when

verse 2
gravel lot spot by the porta johns
bout a quarter mile from the door
worked three weeks for a pair of cheap seats
to hear never wanted nothing more
we were feelin that buzz from a summertime love
and a bottle tucked in a boot
its crazy to think that looking back now
but back then we never knew

those were some good times
those were the best nights
the freedom you feel when youre learning to fly
and the song on the radio was singin our lives
i cant say that the moon in the sky
was shinin any brighter than it is tonight
but it looked on fire back then
it probably wasnt but it seemed a little better back when

bridge
i aint sayin that right now aint right where i wanna be
but i swear time adds a little shine to a longgone memory

chorus
those were some good times
those were the best nights
the freedom you feel when youre learning to fly
and the song on the radio was singin our lives
i cant say that the moon in the sky
was shinin any brighter than it is tonight
but it looked on fire back then
it probably wasnt but it seemed a little better back when

outro
yeah it seemed a little better back whenembed"
