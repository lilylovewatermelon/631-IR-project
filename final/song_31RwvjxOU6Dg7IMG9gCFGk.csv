grab that glock 9 soon as a nigga hit the dope
call up my nigga ask him do we still got that dope
he said damn right i said im gon be there at four
dont forget the oe and bring all them freaky hoes
sippin on that mothafuckin drank while im smokin dank
mothafuck what a hater thank bitch i need that bank
cause a nigga gotta survive out here in these hard times
crackers constantly fuckin lyin
and some of you niggas buyin it
fuck that i need that mothafuckin cash im on my own
bitch and i aint tryna dump no fuckin trash
niggas talk shit then we put em on they fuckin ass
niggas stop your bitchin and get to the fuckin cash
and niggas wanna rob till they get shot and thats sad
but aint no heart for a nigga tryin to take my cash
let off the clip merk the nigga then the nigga ran
seen the police jumpin out the mothafuckin van
hopped in the whip with my fuckin gun still in my hand
now im paranoid cause a nigga just killed the man
all for that love of that green cash in that vans
but a nigga gotta get it somethin they dont understand
damn

got away with this shit cause a nigga too smooth
but i thought i did till a nigga seen the damn news
but i cant turn myself in or im a damn fool
smokin on this reefer i dont know what the fuck to do
call my bitch up and said let me come chill with you
she said ok just bring a couple rubbers boo
but a nigga hot and i know the feds watchin too
gotta hide my face from them damn undercovers fool
but im like fuck it cause you know a nigga tryna bone
made it in time before the fuckboys tap my phone
knocked on the door cause she didnt answer the fuckin phone
went to the side and seen that the bitch was gone
still got my cash when i headed back to the front
then i see these crackers with they hand on they fuckin gun
now i cant do shit a nigga cant fuckin run
told me to get up on the ground then they took my funds
