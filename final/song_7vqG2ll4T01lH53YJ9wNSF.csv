verse 1 sebastian
broken promises broken wedding vows
if god is lookin down hoping that he crack a smile crack a smile
how can i support a child
last time i had a job its been awhile
the question that remains so freely
why does that have happen to me to me
to wash away the pain im drinkin
im thinkin

im waitin for the day that
together we can find another way back
with everything weve got at stake
lets worry about today and put tomorrow in a bottle
if theres some way that we can take back
the wrong that weve created we can change that
dont turn your head the other way
youre born to save today put tomorrow in a bottle

verse 2 timbaland
girl you aint right i apologize

hey hey every other day we fuss and fight
hey hey and i tell you two wrongs dont make a right

singin that same old song wondering why you mad at me me
now you understand my lingo we still gon be people

now we both dont know how to act
once i leave out the door nothin will bring me back

bridge timbaland
said i never thought that all that the love we had would go away
now theres nothin left that you can say sayayyy
thats the day shit gon be the same
because im backed against the wall
now the conclusion to the story is the same
verse 3 sebastian
i was your bread and butter like girl i put you on
now that i want that lovin back whys the relationship so gone
like we established the fact that you was wrong from the get
how am i sposed to fly in my ex from tallahasee and back
when a girl is scared of heights sanchez on top you seen them jets
why fuck her in the back when the first class got the latest snacks
people can blame my past people can kiss my ass
im at a loss for words chad gonna sing the rest

chorus chad kroeger
