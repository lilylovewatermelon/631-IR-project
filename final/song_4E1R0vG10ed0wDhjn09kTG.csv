you remind me of a former love
that i once knew
and you carry a little piece with you
we were holding hands walking through
the middle of the street its fine with me
im just taking in the scenery

chorus
you remind me of a few of my famous friends
well that all depends what you qualify as friends
you remind me of a few of my famous friends
well that all depends what you qualify as friends

verse 2
take a chance take your shoes off dance in the rain
yeah were splashing around
and the news spread all over town
im not complaining that its raining
im just saying that id like it a lot more than youd think
if the sun would come out and sing with me

chorus
you remind me of a few of my famous friends
well that all depends what you qualify as friends
you remind me of a few of my famous friends
well that all depends what you qualify as friends
