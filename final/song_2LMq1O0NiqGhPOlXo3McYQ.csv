ah icky thump whoda thunk
sitting drunk on a wagon to mexico
ahh well what a chump
well my head got a bump when i hit it on the radio
redhead señorita looking dead
came and said need a bed in español
i said gimme a drink of water
im gonna sing around the collar and i dont need a microphone
verse 2
icky thump with a lump in my throat
grabbed my coat and i was freaking i was ready to go
and i swear besides the hair she had one white eye
one blank stare looking up lying there
on the stand near her hand was a candy cane
black rum sugar cane dry ice and something strange
la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la
verse 3
white americans what nothing better to do
why dont you kick yourself out youre an immigrant too
whos using who what should we do
well you cant be a pimp and a prostitute too
icky thump handcuffed to a bunk
robbed blind looked around and there was nobody else
left alone i hit myself with a stone
went home and learned how to clean up after myselfyou might also like14embed"
