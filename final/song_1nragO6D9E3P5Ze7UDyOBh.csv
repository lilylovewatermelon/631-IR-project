when its low beams long stretch of highway
when the lonesome hits like a tidal wave
tossing and turning tangled with my demons
making me doubt everything i believe in

prechorus
there you are
like a stained glass sunday morning

chorus
baby you light it up
shot some faith on my darkest places
like a rising sun
filled my heart with a million amazing graces
your voice is like a choir
a match that starts a fire
deep down in my bones where only you can go
when my soul needs an angels touch
yeah you light it up

verse 2
i used to get no mona whiskey remedy
but then your spirit poured in like a symphony
and now i know that all i need is you girl
cause when i get lost in this crazy world

yeah you light it up
shot some faith on my darkest places
like a rising sun
filled my heart with a million amazing graces
baby you light it up
shot some faith on my darkest places
like a rising sun
filled my heart with a million amazing graces
your voice is like a choir
a match that starts a fire
deep down in my bones where only you can go
when my soul needs an angels touch
yeah you light it up

bridge
there you are
like a stained glass sunday morning
you bid the dark
with all your truth and all your glory

chorus
yeah you light it up
shot some faith on my darkest places
like a rising sun
filled my heart with a million amazing graces
baby you light it up
shot some faith on my darkest places
like a rising sun
filled my heart with a million amazing graces
your voice is like a choir
a match that starts a fire
deep down in my bones where only you can go
when my soul needs an angels touch
yeah you light it up1embed"
