step up

verse 1
fall back take a look at me and youll see im for real
i feel what only i can feel
and if that dont appeal to you let me know
and ill go cause i flow better when my colors show
and thats the way it has to be honestly
cause creativity could never bloom in my room
id throw it all away before i lie
so dont call me with a compromise
hang up the phone i got a backbone stronger than yours

prechorus
