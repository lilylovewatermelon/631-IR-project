shes a pick me up at 6
make ya wait ’til 8
country girl sticker on a chevrolet
shes clothes on an old pine down by the river bank
buzz from a cheap wine
first love on a tailgate

prechorus
a summer night in july
bottle rocket flying high
fire poppin
body rockin droppin’ under the moonlight

chorus
my baby’s a hands in the air
dont have a care when her songs on the radio
a little crazy with a blue jean tear
gets a ray ban stare just about everywhere we go
she likes to get down
sippin on coke and crown
jesus and gypsy soul
yeah thats how she rocks
and thats how she rolls

verse 2
shes a backwards hat
hey boys whats up
strawberry lip sip from a dixie cup
a quicksilver tan line
rocking shotgun in my truck
a charm with a peace sign round her neck for a little luck
see chase rice liveget tickets as low as 109you might also likechorus
my baby’s a hands in the air
dont have a care when her songs on the radio
a little crazy with a blue jean tear
gets a ray ban stare just about everywhere we go
she likes to get down
sippin on coke and crown
jesus and gypsy soul
yeah thats how she rocks
and thats how she rolls

bridge
yeah thats how she rolls
my baby’s a hands in the air
she dont have a care when her songs on the radio
a little crazy with a blue jean tear
gets a ray ban stare just about everywhere we go

chorus
my baby’s a hands in the air
dont have a care when her songs on the radio
a little crazy with a blue jean tear
gets a ray ban stare just about everywhere we go
she likes to get down
sippin on coke and crown
jesus and gypsy soul
yeah thats how she rocks
and thats how she rolls
outro
yeah thats how she rolls
yeah thats how she rollsembed"
