oohoohooh
oohoohoohooh

verse 1 gerard way
well now this could be the last of all the rides we take
so hold on tight and dont look back
we dont care about the message or the rules they make
ill find you when the sun goes black

chorus gerard way
and you only live forever in the lights you make
when we were young we used to say
that you only hear the music when your heart begins to break
now we are the kids from yesterday

postchorus gerard way
oohoohooh
ooh oohooh

verse 2 gerard way
all the cameras watch the accidents and stars you hate
they only care if you can bleed
does the television make you feel the pills you ate
or every person that you need to be
see my chemical romance liveget tickets as low as 425you might also likechorus gerard way
cause you only live forever in the lights you make
when we were young we used to say
that you only hear the music when your heart begins to break
now we are the kids from yesterday

bridge gerard way
today today
we are the kids from yesterday today today
here we are and we wont stop breathing today today
yell it out til your heart stops beating today
we are the kids from yesterday today

chorus gerard way
cause you only live forever in the lights you make
when we were young we used to say
that you only hear the music when your heart begins to break
now we are the kids from yesterday

outro gerard way
oohoohooh we are the kids from yesterday
oohoohooh we are the kids from yesterday
oohoohooh we are the kids from yesterday
oohoohooh today today16embed"
