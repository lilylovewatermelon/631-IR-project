asking for forgiveness so forgive me for my faults
and i hope you never get this but i sent it to your door
and i’ve crossed that mississippi at least three times before
oh no without your love i can’t go back there no more
said oh no without your love i can’t go back there no more

verse 2
locked up all your windows and bolted all your doors
and i’ve had some trouble listening my ears glued to the floor
and oh no you wont see me again least a year or more
said my bags are all packed and my shoes are by the back door
said my bags they are all packed and my shoes are by the back door

chorus
and you’ve stolen and wasted all my time
and youve stolen and wasted all my time
and youve stolen and wasted all my time time time
oh i hope you never get this for a long long while

verse 3
these days i’m a mountain man with no one to forgive
eating soul food out of tin cans is one way you can live
oh i let you get real close and then give you the slip
i’m just a little twig floatin down the big ole riv
said now i’m just a little twig floatin down the big ole riv

and you’ve stolen and wasted all my time
and youve stolen and wasted all my time
and youve stolen and wasted all my time time time
oh i hope you never get this for a long long while

bridge
now you stand in place
and watch those planes roll by on the tarmac
and i’ll lie to your face
and tell you i’ll be right back
and disappear

chorus
cause you’ve stolen and wasted all my time
and youve stolen and wasted all my time
said youve stolen and wasted all my time
said youve stolen and wasted all my time
said youve stolen and wasted all my time time time
oh i hope you never get this4embed"
