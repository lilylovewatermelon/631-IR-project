eye candy shakin on a dance floor sayin play me one more makin a scene
cowboy camped on a bar stool shootin double whiskey with a longneck back
and billy with a pool cue starring down an eight ball lookin at kelly with a rack

out in the country back roads and one horse towns
we saw fiddles play our guitars loud
we talk the talk and walk the walk
and do the honky tonk stomp

yeahpickups in the parking lot rockin like a juke box jumpin in the july air
cooler in the tool box drinkin every last dropwont let ya take it in there
whiskey high two dudes stumblin out the back door bouncers help em take it outside
through the fussin and the cussin  the shovin and the pushinwell it really aint much of a fight

out in the country back roads and one horse towns
we saw fiddles play our guitars loud
we talk the talk and walk the walk

out in the country back roads and one horse towns
we saw fiddles play our guitars loud
we talk the talk and walk the walksee brooks  dunn liveget tickets as low as 30you might also likeembed"
