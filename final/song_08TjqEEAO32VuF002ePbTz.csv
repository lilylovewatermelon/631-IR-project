can you see it now
the changing in the leaves
its all around us now
as foreign as it seems

prechorus
lets celebrate we never make the team
were in the real world now not junior varsity

chorus
can you feel that change
can you feel that change
coming around

verse 2
oh its the same old fish
swimming in a new sea
and times dont change
but they can surely leave
oh everything here
has pointed you this way
and i see it so clear
its the reason we were made

chorus
can you feel that change
can you feel that change
can you feel that change
can you feel that change
coming around
you might also likeoutro
can you feel that change
can you feel that change
coming around4embed"
