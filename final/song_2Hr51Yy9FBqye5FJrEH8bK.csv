poison oak some boyhood bravery
when our telephone was a tin can on a string
and i fell asleep with you still talking to me

prechorus
you said you werent afraid to die

verse 2
in polaroids you were dressed in womens clothes
were you made ashamed whyd you lock them in a drawer
well i dont think that i ever loved you more

chorus 1
than when you turned away when you slammed the door
when you stole a car and drove towards mexico
and you wrote bad checks just to fill your arm
i was young enough i still believed in war

verse 3
well let the poets cry themselves to sleep
and all their tearful words would turn back into steam

chorus 2
but me im a single cell on a serpents tongue
theres a muddy field where a garden was
and im glad you got away but im still stuck out here
my clothes are soaking wet from your brothers tears
you might also likebridge
and i never thought this life was possible
youre the yellow bird that ive been waiting for

chorus 3
the end of paralysis i was a statuette
now im drunk as hell on a piano bench
and when i press the keys it all gets reversed
the sound of loneliness makes me happier13embed"
