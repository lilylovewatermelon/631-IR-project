the earth is warm next to my ear
insect noise is all that i hear
a magic trick makes the world disappear
the skies are dark theyre dark but theyre clear

chorus 1
a distant motorcade and suddenly theres joy
the snowin tickertape blurs all my senses numb
its like the finish line where everything just ends
the crack of radio seems close enough to touch

verse 2
cold water cleaning my wounds
a sad parade with a single balloon
im done with this im countin to ten
bluest seas runnin to them

chorus 2
i feel like i am watchin everything from space
and in a minute ill hear my name and ill wake
i think the finish lines a good place we could start
take a deep breath take in all that you could want
