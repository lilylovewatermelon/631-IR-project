becky was a beauty from south alabama
her daddy had a heart like a ninepound hammer
think he even did a little time in the slammer
what was i thinking
she snuck out one night and met me by the front gate
her daddy came out waving that twelve gauge
we tore out the drive he peppered my tailgate
what was i thinking

prechorus
oh i knew thered be hell to pay
but that crossed my mind a little too late
cause i was

chorus
thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
there in the middle by me
i was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
going where the night might lead
i know what i was feeling
but what was i thinking what was i thinking

verse 2
by the county line the cops were nipping on our heels
pulled off the road and kicked it in fourwheel
shut off the lights and tore through the corn field
what was i thinking
out the other side she was hollering faster
took a dirt road and had the radio blasting
hit the honky tonk for a little close dancing
what was i thinking
see dierks bentley liveget tickets as low as 25you might also likeprechorus
oh i knew thered be hell to pay
but that crossed my mind a little too late
cause i was

chorus
thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
there in the middle by me
i was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
going where the night might lead
i know what i was feeling
but what was i thinking what was i thinking

verse 3
when a mountain of a man with a born to kill tattoo
tried to cut in i knocked out his front tooth
we ran outside hoodsliding like bo duke
what was i thinking
i finally got her home at a half past too late
her daddys in a lawn chair sitting on the driveway
put it in park as he started my way
what was i thinking oh what was i thinking oh what was i thinking
then she gave a comeandgetme grin
and like a bullet we were gone again cause i was

chorus
thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
there in the middle by me
i was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
going where the night might lead
i know what i was feeling
but what was i thinking what was i thinking2embed"
