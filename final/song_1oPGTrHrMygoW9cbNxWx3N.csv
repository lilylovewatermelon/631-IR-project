im gon get that freshfly fade and then im gon get laid
like some fingerwaves on pay day my lady you gon get paid
makin a early morning serenade for you to start your day
or the sound of a starter pistol fired close to where you lay
last call for alcohol make a fast call for the hay
the dirty don has informed me the drought has ended today
with no delay
and a fourpiece grizzle we on our way
for a brief stay in a sweet place for a petite face to lay ayy ayy ayy

verse 3 slimm calhoun
them boys so wild dont crack no smile
closet like the wild kingdom fox minks and crocodiles
popped tops on what we drink so sit back for a while
matter fact light that and ill be right back
they want a couple more bottles i got somethin for em to swallow
anybody ever told you you look like a model
you know the story she bit the hook line and follow
got my hooks in the back and ima grind until tomorrow
they call me mack rapalicious and when i bubble i blow trouble up in your ear
they call me mack rapalicious and when i bubble its trouble all up in you dear

hit the floor start shakin it all yes yall
