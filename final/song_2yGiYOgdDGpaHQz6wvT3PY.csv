midnight in the desert
so far away
its a fingernail moon
dancing through the milky way
stars down in dixie
look the same way here
and i got your picture
stuffed down in my battle gear

prechorus
i could sing that song
you know the one that drives you wild
and close my eyes and dream
that i can kiss my babys smile

chorus
even the man in the moon
is singing the blues
hope you still love me baby
im missing me some you

verse 2
when your head hits the pillow
to pray for my soul
thats when your little soldier
goes out on patrol
never thought when i kissed you
goodbye in tennessee
that id ever be lonely
but im about as lonely as one man can be
you might also likeprechorus
i could sing that song
you know the one that drives you wild
i could close my eyes and dream
that i can kiss my babys smile

chorus
even the man in the moon
is singing the blues
hope you still love me baby
im missing me some you
i miss you baby

prechorus
i could sing that song
you know the one that drives you wild
i can close my eyes and dream
i can kiss my babys smile

chorus
even the man in the moon
is singing the blues
hope you still love me baby
cause im missing me some you
oh i hope you still love me baby
cause im missing me some youembed"
