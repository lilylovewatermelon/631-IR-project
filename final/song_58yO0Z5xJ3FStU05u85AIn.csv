i must’ve used up all my wishes yesterday
cause the words we said in anger still echo in my brain
alone through the darkness in this cave
i wanna hear you whisper
hang on every word you say

prechorus
climb the mountain swim for shore
bring it back to how it was before

chorus
take it out blow it up
ignite the memory in between us
through the storm and all the dust
take it out of these walls with a cannonball
but don’t let it go don’t give up the ghost
while staring at the moon and the sun
just trying to remember where we came from

verse 2
i connect the stars to build a map to you
in the empty space we’re dreaming
will we still know the truth

prechorus
climb the mountain swim for shore
bring it back to how it was before

take it out blow it up
ignite the memory in between us
through the storm and all the dust
take it out of these walls with a cannonball
but don’t let it go don’t give up the ghost
while staring at the moon and the sun
just trying to remember where we came from

so climb the mountain swim for shore
bring it back to how it was before

chorus
take it out blow it up
ignite the memory in between us
through the storm and all the dust
take it out of these walls with a cannonball
but don’t let it go don’t give up the ghost no
while staring at the moon and the sun
just trying to remember where we came from
just trying to remember where we came from

outro
don’t let it go don’t give up the ghost
while staring at the moon and the sun
just trying to remember where we came fromembed"
