seems like everything thats good in life you gotta wait for
my canepole bobber dad set on a lake in tennessee
and its like sitting there real early just to watch a morning sunrise
all i know is what it does to me

chorus
its like friday night working on a three day weekend
theres something in a jar just made for sipping
its feeling like a feel good timebomb ticking
standing round waiting on beer can chicken
its the little things that make life worth living

verse 2
that old jam box playing in the background takes me somewhere
back to some old late night country highway radio
ive got all my friends hanging out sitting right here with me
when i get this old feeling i just know

chorus
its like friday night working on a three day weekend
theres something in a jar just made for sipping
its feeling like a feel good timebomb ticking
standing round waiting on beer can chicken
its the little things that make life worth living

would you look at this night that weve been given
its the little things that make life worth living
would you look at this night that weve been given
it makes life worth living

chorus
its like friday night working on a three day weekend
theres something in a jar just made for sipping
its feeling like a feel good timebomb ticking
standing round waiting on beer can chicken
its the little things that make life worth living

verse 4
turn it up lets go
pretty girl dancing barefoot by the sea shore
dirt track turn to four
pedal to the metal gonna show you what were here for
six strings good songs
old wooden bowl with a skull and crossbones
full moon thats right
green grass good luck just waiting on half time
and beer can chicken
just look at this life that weve been given1embed"
