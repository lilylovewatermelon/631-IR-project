thomas said stay home
get away from me
saying i was bad for you
he got his way
im gone for good
making up stories
keeping it secret
taking your word for truth
you were bad for me
so im gone for good

chorus luke spiller
i did all i could
so kiss this one more time
cause im gone for good
you misunderstood
so kiss this one last time
and im gone for good

verse 2 luke spiller
thomas said sorry
coming home crawling
didnt give a shit before
he stole from me
so im gone for good
getting back from this no second chances
another phone call ignored
you are back for me
but im gone for good
