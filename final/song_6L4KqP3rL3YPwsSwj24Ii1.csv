im a cool three pounds of cold blue steel
i shoot even better than the way i feel
made to fit right in your hand
why ill never understand

verse 2
i couldve been a hammer or a railroad spike
i couldve been a train rolling through the night
but they gave my voice such a terrible sound
that i wish theyd left me in the ground

chorus
im a peacemaker
dont know how i got my name
im a peacemaker
if i dont deserve the credit
why do i deserve the blame

verse 3
when the lion lays down with the lamb
then you wont find me in nobodys hand
till that time i will remain
till the sinners lay down with the saints

chorus x2
see the steeldrivers liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likeoutro
im a cool three pounds of cold blue steel
i shoot even deader than the way i feelembed"
