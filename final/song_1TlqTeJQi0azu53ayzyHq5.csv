nobody knows
nobody knows but me
that i sometimes cry
if i could pretend that im asleep
when my tears start to fall
i peek out from behind these walls
i think nobody knows
nobody knows no no

verse 2
nobody likes
nobody likes to lose that inner voice
the one i used to hear before my life
made a choice

prechorus
but i think nobody knows
no no
nobody knows
no

chorus
baby oh the secrets safe with me
theres nowhere else in the world that i could ever be
and baby dont it feel like im all alone
whos gonna be there after the last angel has flown
and ive lost my way back home
i think nobody knows no
i said nobody knows
see pnk liveget tickets as low as 53you might also likeverse 2
nobody cares
its win or lose not how you play the game
and the road to darkness has a way
of always knowing my name

prechorus
but i think nobody knows
no no
nobody knows
no no no no

chorus
baby oh the secrets safe with me
theres nowhere else in the world that i could ever be oh
and baby dont it feel like im all alone
whos gonna be there after the last angel has flown
and ive lost my way back home
and oh no no no no
nobody knows

tomorrow ill be there my friend
ill wake up and start all over again
when everybody else is gone

outro
nobody knows
nobody knows the rhythm of my heart
the way i do when im lying in the dark
and the world is asleep
i think nobody knows
nobody knows
nobody knows but me
