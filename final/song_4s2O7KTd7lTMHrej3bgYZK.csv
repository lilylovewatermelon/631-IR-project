its just my familys out of gas and around the corner and you know i just got off work and man if you could just give me like a couple bucks man i could mail it right back to you as soon as i get

verse 1 shaggy 2 dope
so there i was watchin sanford  son workin the graveyard shift
at a party store rollin a spliff
im behind the glass i see crackheads all night
but tonight the moon is red and shit aint feelin so right
my first sight was a basehead tryin to break into my car
in plain view too i ran out with a crowbar
hammered it across his cranium he fell over dead
but no blood only dust hes a fuckin basehead
here come another one jumpin out of a tree
but i aint even have to move he missed by like twenty feet
he slammed down on the pavement i quickly started kickin
beat him with the crowbar til he finally stopped twitchin stop it stop stop it
looked behind me seen another zombie in the register
im used to shooin em off get the fuck out of here from beggin from the customers
but now i gotta reach up under the seat and grab the handax
whipped it from there and stuck it into his back

chorus violent j  shaggy 2 dope
the attack of the baseheads they on a mission
they always on the hunt for somethin they always missin
the attack of the baseheads every city every town
they always on the hunt for somethin never to be found
and im like what the fuck
the attack of the baseheads they on a mission
they always on the hunt for somethin they always missin
the attack of the baseheads every city every town
they always on the hunt for somethin never to be found

goddammit its two more in the cooler once im back in the sto
pull my handax out that back and then attack him some mo
i charged but he busted me in the head with a pepsi
no effect i left him shakin on the floor like epilepsy
with they necks severed fuckin zombies for rocks
another jumped my back and we went through the glass into the parking lot
he tried to kill me he told me gimme some change
all diggin in my ear for it and shit deranged
i grabbed him by his head and tried to yank it to the left to break his neck
but his head spun all the way around and that was fuckin it
i was outta there i seen another comin out the grave
zombies beggin for change
im fuckin swingin at em knock they chin off their face
but they still comin at me hands out they wanna base
they must think my white eyeballs are giant crack rocks
i gotta slap em out they funkyass socks help me

chorus violent j  shaggy 2 dope
the attack of the baseheads they on a mission
they always on the hunt for somethin they always missin
the attack of the baseheads every city every town
they always on the hunt for somethin never to be found
the attack of the baseheads they on a mission
they always on the hunt for somethin they always missin
the attack of the baseheads every city every town
they always on the hunt for somethin never to be found
verse 3 violent j
they dont have a brain left behind they empty eyes
they want crack rocka coca and they buzzin like flies
you might pull they arm off you try to shake their hand
because their souls been gone its just a shell of a man
walkin around lookin for rock anyway they can get it
even if you got aids them dirty bitches let you hit it
and you still gettin something worse than you already got
i seen one catch one in the head not even know he got shot
it was crack smoke blowing out the side of his head
he put a champagne cork in the hole and that was it
basehead zombies millions of em and more
with the steamroller roll em over flat on the floor
theyre like deadass bodies walkin around without the ghost
with no clue where they fuckin headed but the rock roast
opportunities were given they let em all pass
now they themselves aint worth the shit out they ass

chorus violent j  shaggy 2 dope
the attack of the baseheads they on a mission
they always on the hunt for somethin they always missin
the attack of the baseheads every city every town
they always on the hunt for somethin never to be found
the attack of the baseheads they comin for your goods
simultaneously in fifty thousand neighborhoods
the attack of the baseheads they come out the dark
and they comin for you they wanna pull out your heart and smoke it
the attack of the baseheads they on a mission
they always on the hunt for somethin they always missin
fuckin baseheads
the attack of the baseheads every city every town
they always on the hunt for somethin never to be found
crack rocka coca
and im like what the fuck
the attack of the baseheads they on a mission
they always on the hunt for somethin they always missin
crack rocka coca
the attack of the baseheads every city every town
they always on the hunt for somethin never to be found
hold up i need change
