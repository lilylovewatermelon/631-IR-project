gave in again the bastard
cant keep refusing rights
so hell loan the cash but the sin
is on the hands of you you

prechorus
so to care or plead silence
weak hands are calling

verse 2
theres close enough and theres too far
it wont change an empty stare
but i cant seem to end these images
hauntingly looks like hell

prechorus
so to care or plead silence
weak hands are calling
to care or plead silence
weak hands are calling

chorus
come enter the foreign
face all thats shameful
cheat may the past find
out separating
see chevelle liveget tickets as low as 161you might also likebridge
to care or plead silence
weak hands are calling
to end this catastrophic scene
awake and breathe in

outro
to care or to care or
to care or to care or1embed"
