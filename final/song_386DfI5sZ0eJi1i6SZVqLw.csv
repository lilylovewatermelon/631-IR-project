hey baby its been a minute since
me and you got caught up in
a little wild and young kinda reckless love
that song that was playing when we first kissed
yeah you probably dont think i remember it
got it in the truck
i can dial it up

prechorus
every little scratch on that cd
made it skip along like my heartbeat did back then
baby hop in we can take it

chorus
way way back
find that noname road
cross those boxcar tracks
where we used to go
and lay it way way back
let the moon shine through
kissing you like yesterday
like it wasnt all that way way back

verse 2
baby dont try to hide that smile
i can see that memory in your mind
running all around we can chase it down
you look even better than you did back then
girl close your eyes and well be there in no time
and we can rewind it

way way back
find that noname road
cross those boxcar tracks
where we used to go
and lay it way way back
let the moonshine through
kissing you like yesterday
like it wasnt all that way way back

bridge
like an old school song
two of us just hanging on to the night
wouldnt you like to go there baby

prechorus
every little scratch on that cd
made it skip along like my heartbeat did back then
baby hop in we can take it

chorus
way way back
find that noname road
cross those boxcar tracks
where we used to go
and lay it way way back
let the moonshine through
kissing you like yesterday
like it wasnt all that way way back
way way back
like it wasnt all that way way back
way way back3embed"
