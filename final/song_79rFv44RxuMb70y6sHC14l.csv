i dont wanna stand beside you
i dont wanna try and feel the pain youre going through
till the death youll see this through
cold sweats hallucinations
i wanna scream to show
the hell im going through
the addictions taking you

prechorus
can you see me through bloodshot eyes through bloodshot eyes
should i fight for what is right or let it die
now im choking on force fed lies
do i fight or let it die

chorus
i will fight
one more fight
dont break down in front of me i will fight
will you fight
i am not the enemy
i will try one last time
are you listening to me i will fight
the last fight
i am not your enemy

everyone is sick of caring
no silver lining on the cloud that covers you
let it pour and soak you through
no hope just desperation
so sit and wait for death
and pray it takes you soon
the addictions taking you

prechorus
can you see me through bloodshot eyes through bloodshot eyes
should i fight for what is right or let it die
now im choking on force fed lies
do i fight or let it die

chorus
i will fight
one more fight
dont break down in front of me i will fight
will you fight
i am not the enemy
i will try one last time
are you listening to me i will fight
the last fight
i am not your enemy
guitar solo

prechorus
can you feel me through bloodshot eyes through bloodshot eyes
should i fight another night or let it die
now im choking on every lie
do i fight or let it die

chorus
i will fight
one more fight
dont break down in front of me i will fight
will you fight
i am not the enemy
i will try one last time
are you listening to me i will fight
the last fight
i am not your enemy

outro
i am not your not your enemy
i am not your enemyembed"
