now i could lie by your side
all serrated for you
down below cancer grows
weeping waits inside you too
now all our rage begs a stage
its a waste of time though
and your style seems worthwhile
but this lonely road has turned

prechorus 1
and you faded there
they pretend to care
vultures waiting
if you dont like me
certify me

chorus
yeah‚ i dont know yeah
yeah‚ i wont go yeah
yeah‚ save it im okay
okay

verse 2
and in the sun a loaded gun
makes for conversation
all the while in denial
its too late for me to change
see the offspring liveget tickets as low as 56you might also likeprechorus 2
and you were unchained
nothing more had changed
i could fake it
if you still hate me
confiscate me

chorus
yeah‚ i dont know yeah
yeah‚ i wont go yeah
yeah‚ save it im okay
okay
yeah‚ i wont play yeah
yeah‚ go away yeah
yeah‚ save it im okay
okay
