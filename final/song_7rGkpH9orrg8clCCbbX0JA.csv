cowboys dont cry and heroes dont die
good always wins again and again
and love is a sweet dream that always comes true
oh if life were like the movies id never be blue

chorus
but here in the real world its not that easy at all
cause when hearts get broken its real tears that fall
and darling its sad but true but the one thing ive learned from you
is how the boy dont always get the girl here in the real world

verse 2
i gave you my love but that wasnt enough
to hold your heart when times got rough
and tonight on that silver screen itll end like it should
two lovers will make it through like i hoped we would

chorus
but here in the real world its not that easy at all
cause when hearts get broken its real tears that fall
and darling its sad but true but the one thing ive learned from you
is how the boy dont always get the girl here in the real world
