i remember touch
pictures came with touch
a painter in my mind
tell me what you see
a tourist in a dream
a visitor it seems
a halfforgotten song
where do i belong 
tell me what you see
i need something more
kiss
suddenly alive
happiness arrive
hunger like a storm
how do i begin 
a room within a room
a door behind a door
touch where do you lead 
i need something more
tell me what you see
i need something more

hold on
if love is the answer youre home x8
touch
sweet touch
youve given me too much to feel
sweet touch
youve almost convinced me im real
i need something more
i need something moreembed"
