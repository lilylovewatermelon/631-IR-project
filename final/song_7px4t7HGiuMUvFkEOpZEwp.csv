right now we both know
were marina del rey
planeâ€™s gonna fly away
and youll be on it
and by this time tomorrow
ill be singing yesterday
the sunshines gonna fade
and we cant stop it
so before we turn in i cant make you love me

chorus
lets be brown eyed girl sweet caroline
freefallin small town saturday night
before you lose that loving feeling
lets go dancing on the ceiling
keep on living that teenage dream
paradise city where the grass is green
pretty soon ill be so lonesome i could cry
but thats a song for another time

verse 2
just for one more day what do you say
baby be my pretty woman
because we know sunday mornings coming down
lets take a drive you and i
down some old country road
talk about growing old in one of those pink houses
yeah we might be a candle in the wind
but lets pretend were
see old dominion liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likechorus
brown eyed girl sweet caroline
freefallin small town saturday night
before you lose that loving feeling
lets go dancing on the ceiling
keep on living that teenage dream
paradise city where the grass is green
pretty soon youll be always on my mind
but thats a song for another time

bridge
so before were singing i will always love you

chorus
lets sing brown eyed girl sweet caroline
freefallin small town saturday night
before you lose that loving feeling
lets go dancing on the ceiling
keep on living that teenage dream
paradise city where the grass is green
pretty soon ill be so lonesome i could cry
but thats a song for another time

outro
yeah thats a song for another time
brown eyed girl sweet caroline
yeah thats a song for another time
