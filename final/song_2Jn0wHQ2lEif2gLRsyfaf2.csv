skit samples
as luck would have it one of americas two most powerful villains of the next decade— has turned loose to strike terror into the hearts of men
grunting
to shock women into uncontrolled hysteria
woman shrieking
dont touch that

the villains themselves were ultimately responsible for much of the popularity audiences loved to hate
the importance of the villain was not overlooked of course one of the worst of all was madvillain
they had no code of ethics

whats the matter i was only tryin to have fun—
get to work on these boys anybody bring a gun for me
yeah heres one
not one but two— typical villain releases included

—i know they wanna kiss me but dont let anyone see me like that please doctor help me—
you might also likeand a sequel

master of all—

woman screaming

both the villains were to meet in—
your mother was the lightning

two historical figures outlaws and desperadoes if that the villainous pair of really nice boys who just happened to be on the wrong side of the law three hundred and sixty degrees in similar sequences could not be defeated villains who possess supernatural abilities— villains who were the personification of carnage

madvillain more accurately the dark side of our beings

perhaps it is due to this seminal connection that audiences can relate their experience in life with the villains and their dastardly doings15embed"
