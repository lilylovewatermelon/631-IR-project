verse 2 twista
its a party when i go up in the store
shopping while im zooted off the dro
rolling like a nigga that just came up on a mil
and i got em sweepin and pickin up tags off the floor
bag full of clothes i remember having rocks in the hall
on the corner with the glock by the balls
serving up a jab and workin security 6 to 6
then its straight from the block to the mall
buy whats on the wall go ahead and treat yourself
when you come up on some cheddar better pop that tag
like when i dip off in the prada then i go up to the lot
and lay the paper down to cop that jag
i got a closet full of ammunition and funds
mink rocawear and some guns pelle and a fresh pair of jordans
dro packs and bo jax and air maxes throwbacks and 1s
no max for none
when i go up in the store a nigga never get enough
im a baller if you want it come and get it now
nigga come to a race with a car you wont catch up
and the twista kinda wicked when i spit it now
i be chopping up cheddar with kanye
chop a little cheddar up with jay
chop it up with the otothekizzay
poppin big tags with the flow and the dough we gets busy

verse 3 killer mike
my throwback game is whifflewicked
saint pattys day green pinstripe
number 20 mark spitzn
jersey oohwee with the matching new era fitted
white boys say my style is bitchin
keeping coke in the kitchen
keep a glock thatll shock and bring the rest
tucked underneath my mitchell  ness
im scramblin handlin with a 45 cannon
its tucked in my marc buchanan
extra clips and shells in the lambskin
twodeep by pelle pelle
westside holla felli fel
more gs on me than a lateeighties gucci leather
worn by the great rakim himself
stitch my dapper dan
old man with the gun in hand i leave your blood squirtin
no offense ill put your face on the chest
of a sweatshirt drawn by shirt kings
i been fucking a hustle married to a racket
since the first air jordans and starter jackets
i slept with a package under mattress
i carry guns heavy speak easy
slight with the fighting words
ill put something hot through your motherfucking iceberg
got a project chica named rica
she keep a purse full of dro reefer
small babyblack gat tucked in her baby phat
i rock some roll chief sacks like daddy fat
chorus sleepy brown jayz  big boi

verse 4 big boi
pop tags in reverse youll be needin a nurse
leave you laying on your back in a cadillac hearse
now your mama in allblack with a matchin purse
i know you wanna blow up but a funeral hurts
whats worse you can hit the mall and ball til you fall
have to make a collect call cause your cell cut off
trot to the mailbox pecting a check but the mails run short
no more md dd ld
that means movie date dinner date lunch date help me
please my cheese is gone
long bread to the short bread word is bond
meticulously pimpously serve the song
act a damn donkey like the pilgrims
when they popped the tag on the indians home
drop top rago with the wind going
chillin bags in the trunk full of fao schwartz for the chilens
spent a few shillings
sip a few chickens lick a few kittens just kidding
a fresh bowl of milk is in the fridge and
can you pop the tags on the honeycombs
oh now you acting mad
cause the money done slowed down just a lil bit
dipped poked out did some shullbit
actin like a pitfall bullpit dead game is the pulpit
leave a motherpumper with his john doe toetag clipped
imperial classic a lyrical thrashin
a miracle happenin
jayz killer mike and big boi rappin and rhymin and snappin
pop that tag on some of this game
no politics swallow and keep the change

chorus sleepy brown  jayz
