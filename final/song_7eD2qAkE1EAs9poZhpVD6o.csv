its been a while since the two of us talked
about a week since the day that you walked
knowing things would never be the same
with your empty heart and mine full of pain
so explain to me how it came to this
take it back to the night we kissed
it was dublin city on a friday night
with vodkas and coke i was guinness all night

prechorus
we were sitting with our backs against the world
saying things that we thought but never heard
oh who would ever thought we would end up like this
where everything we talked about is gone
and the only chance we have of moving on
is try to take it back before it all went wrong

chorus
before the worst before we mend
before our hearts decide its time to love again
before too late before too long
lets try to take it back before it all went wrong

verse 2
there was a time when we stayed up all night
best friends yeah talking till the daylight
we took the joys alongside the pain
with not much to lose but so much to gain
are you hearing me cause i dont wanna miss
set you adrift on a memory bliss
it was grafton street on a rainy night
i was down on one knee and you were mine for life

we were thinking we would never be apart
with your name tattooed across my heart
oh who would ever thought we would end up like this
where everything we talked about is gone
and the only chance we have of moving on
is try to take it back before it all went wrong

chorus
before the worst before we mend
before our hearts decide its time to love again
before too late before too long
lets try to take it back before it all went wrong

bridge
if the clouds dont clear
well rise above it
well rise above it whoa
heavens gate is so near
come walk with me through
just like we used to
just like we used to

yeah
yeah
lets take it back before it all went wrong

chorus
before the worst before
before we mend before
before our hearts decide its time to love again
before too late
before too long
lets try to take it back before it all went wrong all wrong
