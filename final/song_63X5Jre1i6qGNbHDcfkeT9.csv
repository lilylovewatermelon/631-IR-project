i dont know about you but i aint tryna die young
i dont like to brag about the shit that i done
i took good care of the streets im an icon
i got snaked by some niggas took care of my son
i aint put that on they lawyer they got them title
the way you wrote that statement you a writer
told on em in the station gave em right up
dd did time with no lawyer its survival
ima cut your ass right off hang with my rivals
catch a case while you a felon ill say its my gun
they got my picture in the feds say im a disciple
they say i switched up cause i dont believe in the bible
first time on a hit i kept my eyes closed
only nigga im scared of is john doe
and no support ll make your time slow
just a real nigga without trying to

hard work and dedication
street niggas need to pray up

that shit so crazy what happened to law
when the streets took baby d it had came with a flaw

tryna smoke on some zaza just pass me the tops
the reason i cant trust yall you talkin to opps
that shit be strange when they say they love you
they say i changed when i got a hundred
you cant complain cause i been a hundred
wartime inside the trenches buyin different bullets
hop out a cutlass right into the bushes
run right on em while them niggas lookin
blood in my eyes they tryna get me
im the most wanted in my city
im the most hated in my city
gotta watch out for the niggas who gon envy
