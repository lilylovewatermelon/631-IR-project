live in my head for just one day
i see myself and look away
the road is showing now on my face
soon ill disappear with ill disappear without a fucking trace

chorus
faces that ive seen turn old and grey
ive lost too many friends along the way
memories i never thought would fade
well they fade and blow away

verse 2
i wish that i could disappear
unzip my skin and leave it here
so i could be no one again
and never let nobody id let nobody id let nobody in

chorus
faces that ive seen turn old and grey
ive lost too many friends along the way
memories i never thought would fade
they fade and blow away

verse 3
so now the walls are closing in
because in life you sink or swim
sometimes these shoes dont feel right in my head
feel like a book that cant be a book that cant be a book that cant be read
see staind liveget tickets as low as 42you might also likechorus
faces that ive seen turn old and grey
ive lost too many friends along the way
memories i never thought would fade
they fade and blow awayembed"
