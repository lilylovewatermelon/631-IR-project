verse 1 william
one tri— one tri—
one tribe one time one planet one race
its all one blood dont care about your face
color of your eye or the tone of your skin
dont care where ya are dont care where youve been
cause where we gonna go is where we wanna be
the place where the native language is unity
and the continent is called pangaea
and the main ideas are connected like a spear
no propaganda they tried to upper hand us
cause man im lovin this peace
maman im lovin this peace
maman im lovin this peace
i dont need no leader thats gonna force feeder
concept that make me think i need to
fear my brother and fear my sister
and shoot my neighbor with my big missile
if i had an enemy enemy
if i had an enemy enemy
if i had an enemy then my enemy
is gonna try to come and kill me ‘cause im his enemy

verse 2 william fergie
one tribe one tribe
one tribe one time one planet one race
race one love one people one and
too many things thats causing one to
to forget about the main cause
connecting uniting
but the evil is seeded and alive in us
so our weapons are colliding
and our peace is sinking like poseidon
but we know that the one one
the evil one is threatened by the sum sum
so he come and try and separate the sum
but he dumb he didnt know we had a way to overcome
rejuvenating by the beating of the drum
come together by the cipher of the hum
freedom when all become one one forever
