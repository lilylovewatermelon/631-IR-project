on a greyhound bus
lord im traveling this morning
im going to shreveport
and down to new orleans
been traveling these highways
been doing things my way
its been making me lonesome ornery and mean

verse 2
now her hair was jet black
and her name was codeine
she thought she was the cream
of the basin street queens
she got tired of that smoky wine dream
began to feel lonesome ornery and mean

bridge

verse 3
we got together
and we cashed in our sweeps
gave em to a beggar
who was mumblin through the streets
theres no escaping from his snowy white dreams
born lookin lonesome ornery and mean

now im down in this valley
where the wheels turn so low
at dawn i pray
to the lord of my soul
i say dear lord do right by me
you know im tired of being lonesome ornery and meanembed"
