i wanna hold your hand
and say the words he never said
ill make you promises you can believe

sharing the smiles and tears you cry

when youre down and you feel so lonely
turn around

cause i dont want nobody else
all of your secrets are safe with me
for the kind of love you can trust
for more than just a crush
