hurry up and wait
so close but so far away
everything
that youve always dreamed of
close enough for you to taste but you just cant touch

prechorus
you wanna show the world but no one knows your name yet
no one knows your name yet
wonder when and where and how youre gonna make it
you know you can if you get the chance
in your face and the door keeps slamming
now youre feeling more and more frustrated frustrated
and youre getting all kind of impatient impatient
waitin waitin

chorus
we live and we learn
to take one step at a time
theres no need to rush
its like learning to fly
or falling in love just falling in love
its gonna happen when its supposed to happen
then we find the reasons why
one step at a time
