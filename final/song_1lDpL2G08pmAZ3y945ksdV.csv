came to the cold just to see you
standing there in expectation
woolen coat and blue eyes staring
oh this vision does me good
in the city we dont know yet
across the bridges not yet burned
where the ice wont let us further
wind our way down through the woods
take me to the attic ladder
in the barn with broken floors
with your boots of spanish leather
and my hat knit out of yarn x2

chorus
you are in the seat beside me
you are in my dreams at night
you are in grandmothers wisdom
you are in grandfathers charm

verse 2
show me young trees in the orchard
with the music on their branches
keep them from the mouths of creatures
who intend for them no good
see the head and the heart liveget tickets as low as 63you might also liketake me out past the windbreak
speak the thing you could not utter
wind will howl and moon will cower
at the magic of the word

bridge

verse 3
darling this is when i met you
for the third time not the last
not the last time we are learning
who we are and all we were

chorusembed"
