i dont like cities but i like new york
other places make me feel like a dork
los angeles is for people who sleep
paris and london baby you can keep
baby you can keep baby you can keep
baby you can keep baby you can keep
baby you can keep baby you can keep
baby you can keep baby you can keep

chorus
other cities always make me mad
other places always make me sad
no other city ever made me glad except new york
i love new york
i love new york
i love new york

verse 2
if you dont like my attitude then you can f off
just go to texas isnt that where they golf
new york is not for little pussies who scream
if you cant stand the heat then get off my street
get off my street get off my street
get off my street get off my street
get off my street get off my street
get off my street get off my street
