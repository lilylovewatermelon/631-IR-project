windblown whispers wind naked down the corridor
thoughts leavin my head they twist through yours
what will become of these gestures that we made
ive given up my bible you moved out of state ohoh oh

wearily waitin on the wastin of his days
a sad sons smoldering soul
give you three bucks for your sympathy and another for a cigarette
the interaction feels so cold ohoh oh

chorus
oh the songs people will sing for home
and for the ones that have been gone for too long
but oh the things people will do for the ones that they love

verse 2
were only here to find the love that lingers after
the moment
so kiss me in the back room where the music plays
i know that its not over

chorus 2
but oh the songs people will sing for home
and for the ones that have been gone for too long
but oh the things people will do for the ones that they love
see the head and the heart liveget tickets as low as 58you might also likebridge
break down the corridors la dada da dada da da
break down the corridors la dada da dada da
messes that i havent tried to clean up in a while
oh oh oh

outro
youre in my soul now youve gotta waste away with me
my minds made up im stayin here with you
theres no use knowin which way the wind is blowin
my minds made up im doin this im doin this with you

theres no use knowin which way the wind is blowin
my minds made up im doin this im doin this
youre in my soul now youve gotta waste away with me1embed"
