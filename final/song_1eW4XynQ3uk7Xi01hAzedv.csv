honestly i’m embarrassed
i’ve been so fucking careless
caught in my fucking ways
you should not have to wait
i’ve been so fucking selfish
insecure ‘cause i’m jealous
i want nobody with ya
still got my sneaky link ups
i know i’m wrong for that
guess these are my confessions
i know i lied so many times that i believed my answers
i know i made you wait
you shouldn’t have to wait
used to beg me to stay
you shouldn’t have to stay
you went and found an athlete
now i hate fuckin’ athletes
i was too fuckin’ flashy
i couldn’t keep it classy
you found somebody wealthy
he gets more paper than me
honestly i’m embarrassed
booked a one way to paris

chorus
‘cause when it gets like this i need distance
i’m on a twelvehour flight with just my feelings
it can get like this in an instant
soon as i get into thinkin’ that nigga done fucked you like i did
like he sucked you like i did
does he touch you like i did like i did
nigga done fucked you like i did
like he sucked you like i did
does he touch you like i did like i did
you might also likepostchorus
now all of a sudden
you don’t owe me nothing to tell me whoever he is
fuck whoever he is
fuck whoever he is

verse 2
depression obsession is selfish
somehow just drownin in summer depression is helpin
it really ain’t helping no it ain’t helpin no it ain’t helping no
this shit ain’t healthy this shit ain’t healthy this isn’t healthy
booked you a flight to come out to me you didn’t take it
that was the moment i realized we wouldn’t make it
ego was hurt so i went to the port and i booked me a ticket
had to get missing i had to get distant

interude
it’s in my stomach this fuckin’ hurts fuck

chorus
‘cause when it gets like this i need distance
i’m on a twelvehour flight with just my feelings
it can get like this in an instant
soon as i get into thinkin’ that nigga done fucked you like i did
like he sucked you like i did
does he touch you like i did like i did
nigga done fucked you like i did
like he sucked you like i did
does he touch you like i did like i did
postchorus
now all of a sudden
you don’t owe me nothing to tell me whoever he is
fuck whoever he is
fuck whoever he is1embed"
