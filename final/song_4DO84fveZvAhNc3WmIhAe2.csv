oooh
he made it so hard to trust someone trust someone
he made it so hard to fall in love fall in love

verse 1
not tryna mess up this relationship thinking
cause the last man did me that way
you gon do the same things
i dont wanna be this way
but im hoping you can change the way that i feel ohh
you see i trusted him with everything
never held back anything
thought wed be together for the rest of our lives
so suddenly he took his love away
and made it hard to trust again oh

prechorus
i know ive been holding back but he really hurt me bad
i dont wanna take my past and put it all on you
im not tryna hold you back
really hope you understand
i dont know what im gonna do

chorus
when i think of what he did to me
it makes it hard to fall in love
when i think about just what i need
it makes it hard to trust someone
baby i gotta let go
dont wanna miss out on love this time
gotta leave those things behind

one disappointment one heartbreak
too many mistakes in love ive made
i cant come with all this baggage
thinking hes gon have it

faith and love is all it ever took
thats why i never gave up
and i never gave in
cause i know true love is waiting for me again
