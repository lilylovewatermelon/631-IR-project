if i were a boy
even just for a day
id roll out of bed in the morning
and throw on what i wanted then go
drink beer with the guys
and chase after girls
id kick it with who i wanted
and id never get confronted for it
cause theyd stick up for me

chorus
if i were a boy
i think i could understand
how it feels to love a girl
i swear id be a better man
id listen to her
cause i know how it hurts
when you lose the one you wanted
cause hes taken you for granted
and everything you had got destroyed

verse 2
if i were a boy
i would turn off my phone
tell everyone its broken
so theyd think that i was sleepin alone
id put myself first
and make the rules as i go
cause i know that shed be faithful
waitin for me to come home
to come home

its a little too late for you to come back
