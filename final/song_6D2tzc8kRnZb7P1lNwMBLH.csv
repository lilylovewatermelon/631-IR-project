nothing but a tear thats all for breakfast
watching you pretend youre unaffected
youre pulling our connections expecting me to let you go
but i wont

i know you dont need my protection
but im in love cant blame me for checking
i love in your direction hoping that the message goes

chorus
somewhere close to you
close to you
like so close if they hurt you you wouldnt find out
just say now im coming right now to be close to you

verse 2
said you let it go you kept it
working hard to perfect it
but now your fear is reckless and its out of your control
well just let it go
