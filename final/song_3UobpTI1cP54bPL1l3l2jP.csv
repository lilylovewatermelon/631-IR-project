you always do that too
i know i know i dont know why
hes always so sure about something
you have conviction and i appreciate that
sometimes conviction can lead to stubbornness

verse 1 jared leto
until you crash until you burn
until you lie until you learn
until you see until you believe

until you fight until you fall
until the end of everything at all
until you die until you are alive

chorus jared leto
dont save me dont save me
cause i dont care
dont save me dont save me
cause i dont care

verse 2 jared leto
until you give until youve used
until youve lost until you lose
until youve seen how could you believe
you might also likeuntil youve lived a thousand times
until youve seen the other side
this is my chance this is my chance

chorus jared leto
dont save me dont save me
cause i dont care
dont save me dont save me
cause i dont care

bridge jared leto
until the truth becomes a lie
until you change until you deny
until you believe

this is my chance this is my chance
ill take it now because i can
this is my chance i want it now

chorus jared leto
dont save me dont save me
cause i dont care
dont save me dont save me
cause i dont care

outro jared leto
save me save me i dont care
save me save me i dont care
save me save me i dont care
i dont care3embed"
