swingin in the backyard pull up in your fast car
whistlin my name
open up a beer and you say get over here
and play a video game
im in his favorite sundress watching me get undressed
take that body downtown
i say you the bestest lean in for a big kiss put his favorite perfume on
go play your video game

chorus
its you its you its all for you everything i do
i tell you all the time heaven is a place on earth with you
tell me all the things you wanna do
i heard that you like the bad girls honey is that true
its better than i ever even knew
they say that the world was built for two
only worth living if somebody is loving you
and baby now you do

postchorus

verse 2
singin in the old bars swinging with the old stars
livin for the fame
kissin in the blue dark playing pool and wild darts
video games
he holds me in his big arms drunk and i am seeing stars

watchin all our friends fall in and out of old pauls this is my idea of fun
