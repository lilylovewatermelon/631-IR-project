just when every ray of hope was gone
i should have known that you would come along
i cant believe i ever doubted you
my old friend the blues

another lonely night a nameless town
if sleep dont take me first youll come around
i know i can always count on you
my old friend the blues

lovers leave and friends will let you down
but youre the only sure thing that ive found
no matter what i do ill never lose
my old friend the blues
