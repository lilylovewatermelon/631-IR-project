find my back in the cold trapped in another soul they can hear me holler
im caught in it again see em all strapped in and cant move and im sinkin lower
heaven gonna help me cause i feel the world weighin on me heavy tryna keep it steady
ready for the mission god shine your love on me save me please
if im goin alone ive been gone for so long aint nobody you cant hear a word
perched in the night lookin out nowhere wheres home i done hit a nerve
pain in my eyes every time i find im stronger than i ever was
here we go again god shine your love on me save me please

everybody want world peace
til your niece get shot in the domepiece
then you go and buy your own piece
hopin itll help you find your own peace
bring light to what they dont see
auntie cryin on the concrete
talkin to dispatcher then the phone beep
on the other line was the homies
told her that you aint comin home see
when she heard the news it hurt her bonedeep
caught with the rifle with the long reach
just another cycle of the lonely
all growin up in environment
where doin crime the requirement
they send us off to prison for retirement
hopefully alice johnson will inspire men
