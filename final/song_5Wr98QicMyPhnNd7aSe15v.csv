i dont find it fair
but anyway
this little string keeps on pulling
so i gotta pull myself down some different path
inside my mind
needs out
i wanna trip myself away
but i better wait i better wait i better wait

i get the sense of a spark so i follow
i dont believe that she knows something i know
i tell myself as i stay in the shadow
i tell myself not to go but i go
needing to see
whichever way shes going

if theres any way
so far from here
theres little fear
her words could ever hurt me
i dont want to wait
dont want to wait
dont want to wait i

dont look dont talk dont yell
just close your eyes
this may or may not come
as some surprise
ive found obsessions
which to live and die by
dont look dont talk dont yell
just close your eyesyou might also likeembed"
