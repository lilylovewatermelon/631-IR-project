i never knew what i was gonna be
somebody saw what i couldnt see
and lifted me up now
i never thought i could be worthy of
loving under the sky above
dont let the wonderful
why does everybody have to fit in
yo should feel so damn comfortable in the skin
does that mean i am the
souvenir of sadness
method to the madness
hands up if you feel this
anyone who has this

chorus
stand up nobodys dying to save you
speak up nobodys waiting to see you
wake up nobodys working to pay you
let me make it clear youll have this
back then nobody knew in the schoolyard
now then you have grown up to be this hard
go then walk through this world with your heart scarred
youre the souvenir of sadness

verse 2
they never knew what i was gonna say
punch me and kick me and run away
you know who you are so
now look at me what do you have to say
never cared much for you anyway
you know who you are so
now look at me what do you have to say
never give up for you anyway
happy childhood backlash
souvenir of sadness
method to the madness
hands up if you feel this
anyone who has this
