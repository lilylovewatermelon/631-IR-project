whats wrong baby
dont they treat you like they should
did you take them for it
for every penny that you could
we once walked out on the beach and once i almost touched your hand
oh how i dreamed to finally say such things
then only to pretend

verse 2
dont you know im thinking know im thinking
driving 405 past midnight
you know i miss you dont you know that i miss you
ninth and ash on a tuesday night
i would write to you from museum mile
a toast to you your whisper your smile
up the stairs at weatherford
a ghost each place i hide

chorus

if you dont know why would you say so
wont you get your story straight
if you dont know honey whyd you just say so
cause i need this now more than i ever did
if you dont well honey then you dont

i left you waiting i know i left you waiting

theres so much ive felt i should say but
even if your heart would listen
i doubt i could explain

chorus
if you dont dont know whyd you say so
would you mean this please if it happens
if you dont know why would you say so
wont you get your story straight
if you dont know honey whyd you just say so

if you dont well honey then you dont
if you dont well honey then you dont

so here we are now
a sip of wine a sip of water
someday maybe

and im sorry that im such a mess
i drank all my money could get and
took everything you let me have
and then i never loved you back
chorus
if you dont dont know why would you say so
would you mean the please if it happens
if you dont know why would you say so
wont you get your story straight
if you dont know honey whyd you just say so
cause i need this now now need this need this
if you dont well honey then you dont
if you dont know honey then you dont
and if you dont well honey then you dont
