i loved her so
but she was too young to fall in love sixteen sixteen
and i was too young to know
wed laugh and wed sing and do the little things sixteen sixteen
that made my heart glow
but she was too young to fall in love sixteen sixteen
and i was too young to know

why did i give my heart so fast
it never will happen again
but i was a mere lad of sixteen
ive aged a year since then

she was only sixteen only sixteen sixteen sixteen
with eyes that would glow
but she was too young to fall in love sixteen sixteen
and i was too young to know

then why did you give your heart so fast
boy it never will happen again
but you were a mere lad of sixteen
ive aged a year since then

she was only sixteen only sixteen sixteen sixteen
with eyes that would glow
but she was too young to fall in love sixteen sixteen
and i was too young to know
but she was too young to fall in love sixteen sixteen
and i was too young to know
whoa she was too young to fall in love sixteen sixteen
