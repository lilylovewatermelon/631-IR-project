woke up in a cell where am i at
yeah its cold but i like that
what am i trapped
hearts beating out of my chest
doors locked but the keys are in my hands
hmm yeah thats where it doesnt make sense does it
i make songs i dont make friends judge me
might smile but it aint that funny
sing along to the pain they love it
lifes like a merrygoround
and im still tryna figure it out
i like space i dont fit in the crowds
my whole life ive been airin it out
oh im gettin into character now
feels wrong but it feels right
my feelings seal tight real nice
but i will fight anything to win
but im not mike tyson i wont bite ya
but i will tell you if i dont like you
i am not the norm
i got my own shoes i aint tryna fit in yours
i never been married but ive felt divorced
hi im nate have we met before
somebody told you i was wack check the source
somebody told you i was back yes of course
you got a problem with the fans theres the door
you lookin for the old me check the morgue agh
not a fortuneteller but i can see into the future better
aint no tellin whatll happen when i pick up the microphone get the fans together
same style but the songs are better
been a year and a half feels like its gone forever
aint no drink in my hand but you know the buzz is comin
big steps in the game yeah the hulk is runnin
my thoughts are funny it feels like im onto somethin yeah

im high off the music my heads in the clouds
i kinda like it up here i am not comin down
id rather be alone i am not good in crowds

i dont care what you think im just being myself
so i guess for now

verse 2
yeah i guess i dont fit the mold of rap
cause im respectin women
i heard your record i was laughin at it ha ha ha
maybe they would like me more if i got a little graphic with it
nah i dont wanna blend in with you little rappin idiots—id rather be the outcast
i aint never puttin out trash
i take a hundred and staple it right to my tongue
i always put the money where my mouths at agh
feels good to be here now
im a weird person with a weird crowd
what you dont like that
thats cool thats great thats fine okay you can leave now
got a weird smile but i like it though
i paint it on me and i walk up to the microphone
and put the caution tape around me like i did in intro 1 yeah
yeah they got me reminiscin now
yeah you done know im bout to go mad
never wanted somethin so bad
goosebumps through the whole track
aint no way im gonna hold back
got me thinkin that im cookin in a meth lab
i dont blow it up in front of my own eyes
you look a little lost you aint get that
comin from a town where nobody is a rapper
guess i never get the memo mustve missed that
wow
here i go in my feelings again i can feel it again
so i lay in my bed in my cell with the pen
and i dwell on my sins i keep wonderin when
time to open the the doors they dont know who i am
but i pick up the keys and i put on my timbs
and i stare at the locks and the tat on my skin
and i think to myself i dont wanna fit in
prechorus
im high off the music my heads in the clouds
i kinda like it up here i am not comin down
id rather be alone i am not good in crowds
which is kinda confusin i know—been that way since a child woo
they laugh and they tell me ill never get out
im just tryna be me i am nobody else
i dont care what you think im just being myself
so i guess for now

chorus
yeah ill just be the outcast lets go lets go lets go ayy
ill just be the outcast woo
yeah ill just be the outcast ayy oh
i guess ill be the outcast woo

verse 3
yeah tryna focus
take a knife to my head then i cut it open
take my brain put it on the floor—tryna figure out my motives
yall thought i was an issue when the door was locked
nah you should see me when the door opens
every night i can hear voices
put a camera in my face might turn joker like im mike posner
always been a little complex
difficult to process
some of yall wanna sit around and try to pick apart my bars
heres some lines you could dissect
if ima die ima die givin everything that i have
take a deep breath i dont need yalls respect
im a reject kid at recess playin games with his makebelieve friends
yeah i dont ever take a night off
lights off in the room and i write songs
i might fall into my thoughts once in a while when the mics off
you aint ever seen no drive like mine better hop outta my car
im about to unlock my doors
you aint got a seat belt on better find one
gettin sick of people tellin me to smile more
ts was a chapter ill never forget it was therapy for me
but its time to turn the page now
hey shut up im tryna tell em my story
im sorry i wasnt yellin at yall i was talkin to the voices
i rip out the drums of the industrys ears for tryna ignore me and playin while singin this chorus
chorus
ill just be the outcast lets go lets go lets go ayy
ill just be the outcast woo
yeah ill just be the outcast ayy oh
i guess ill be the outcast woo

chorus
ill just be the outcast lets go lets go lets go ayy
ill just be the outcast woo
yeah ill just be the outcast ayy oh
i guess ill be the outcast woo148embed"
