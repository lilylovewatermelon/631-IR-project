this futon i crashed on in college well it aint our bed
but  at least it dont smell like you
patron  up on the counter well it aint your red
and them long stems are long gone too
put that record on took your pictures off the shelf
oh  cause every little bit helps

chorus
might  not get me all the way over you
but every little bit gets me a little bit closer to
walkin  right out of your valley of the shadow of death
step by step im gettin
out from under that spell you put on me
i know you just left and i know i might only be
one  night in to your goodbye gone kinda hell
oh but every little bit helps

verse 2
and this fiver might only spin my tires to the other side of town
but at least im out of this house
and this dives tired the band man it ain’t my sound
but at least theyre playin it loud
two beers in and ill be long gone come 12
oh cause every little bit helps
see luke combs liveget tickets as low as 33you might also likechorus
might not get me all the way over you
but every little bit gets me a little bit closer to
walkin right out of your valley of the shadow of death
step by step im gettin
out from under that spell you put on me
i know you just left and i know i might only be
one night in to your goodbye gone kinda hell
oh but every little bit helps

bridge
every sip every drink
that girl and her wink
it aint much but i think
that every little bit helps

chorus
might not get me all the way over you
but every little bit gets me a little bit closer to
walkin right out of your valley of the shadow of death
step by step im gettin
out from under that spell you put on me
i know you just left and i know i might only be
one night in to your goodbye gone kinda hell
oh but every little bit helps
oh yeah every little bit helpsembed"
