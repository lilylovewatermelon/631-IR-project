the first to arrive switch their dials to swinging
the lights are dim to match the conversation
strangers grin that stoned expression
he looks so cool says a girl with a giggle
his handkerchief bulge slipping from the middle
strokes his chin as his eyes refocus
tonights victim smiles back

hes gettin so excited
theyre revving it up
hes getting so excited
excited

the musics dark begins to get blacker
people start to move towards each other
some hold back some peel off the layers
the atmosphere erupts with the drunken liberators
walls flare up with animated shadows
as dancers jump like emancipated jackals
it wont be long till the first couples clinches
she turns to him to say
id do anything for love but i wont do that
shes getting so excited
theyre trashing it up
shes getting so excited
excited
see bonnie tyler liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likethe smoke mist clears to reveal drunken jimmy
whose just turned up seen his woman getting friendly
with a charmer boy in a secondhand leather
lights go green theres gonna be danger with two great strides theres a push and scuffle
you cant make out through the naked muscle
a high pitched scream a broken bottle a ribbon of blood on the floor

theyre getting so excited
but i want some more
theyre getting so excited
down on the floor
theyre getting so excited
excited excited excited
theyre getting so excited
but im getting bored im just getting bored continue and fadeembed"
