alet em know  verse 1 jill scott  mos def
met him on a thursday uh huh uh huh sunny afternoon
cumulus clouds 84 degrees
he was brownuh huh uh huh
said he wanted to talk about my mission
listen to my past lives
word uh huh uh huh
took me on long walks to places where butterflies rest easy
talked about moses and mumia uh huh uh huh
reparations through colors memories of shelltops
oh yeah yeah he was fresh like summer peaches
sweet on my mind like block parties and penny candy —for the churro two for the—
uh huh uh huh
i felt like cayenne pepper red hot spicy
i felt dizzy and so near heaven

hahhah  verse 2
the rain was fallin
slowly and sweetly
and stinging my eyes
and i could not see that uh huh uh huh
he became my voodoo priest
and i his faithful concubine uh huh uh huh
wide open wide loose like bowels after collard greens
the mistake was made
love slipped from my lips uh huh uh huh
dripped down my chin and landed in his lap
and us became brand new new jill scott everybody cmon
now me nonclarivoyant and in love
made the coochie easy and the obvious invisible
the rain was falling
and i couldnt see the season changing
and the vibe slipping off its axis
our beautiful melody became wildly staccato
repeat 1 in background
the rain was falling and i could not see
that i was to be plowed and sowed and fertilized
and left to drown in his sunny afternoon
cumulus clouds 84 degrees melody

said its—  verse 3 mos def
i stretched my arms towards the sky like blades of tall grass
the sun beat between my shoulders like carnival drums
i sat still in hopes that it would help my wings grow
so then i could really be fly
and then she arrived
like day break inside a railway tunnel
like the new moon like a diamond in the mines
like high noon to a drunkard sudden
she made my heart beat in a nownow time signature
her skin a canvas for ultraviolet brushstrokes
she was the suns painting
she was a deep cognac color
her eyes sparkled like lights along the new city
her lips pursed as if her breath was too sweet
and full for her mouth to hold
i said you are the beautiful distress of mathematics
i said for you i would peel open the clouds like new fruit
and give you lightning and thunder as a dowry
i would make the sky shed all of its stars like rain
and i would clasp the constellations across your waist
and i would make the heavens your cape
and they would be pleased to cover you
they would be pleased to cover you
may i please cover you please
