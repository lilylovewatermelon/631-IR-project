she had a shiny little beamer with the ragtop down
sittin in the drive but she wouldnt get out
the dogs were all barkin and awaggin around
and i just laughed and said yall get in
she had on a new dress and shed curled her hair
she was lookin too good not to go somewhere
said what you want to do baby i dont care
we can go to the show or we can stay right here

chorus
and i can take you for a ride on my big green tractor
we can go slow or make it go faster
down through the woods and out to the pasture
long as im with you it really dont matter
climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
girl you know you got me to hold on to
we can go to town but baby if youd rather
ill take you for a ride on my big green tractor

verse 2
said we can fire it up and i can show you around
sit up on the hill and watch the sun go down
when the fireflies are dancin and the moon comes out
we can turn on the lights and head back to the house
