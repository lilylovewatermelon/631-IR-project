verse 1
came up outta that dirt pile now im ballin
and i dont need no church when im heavensent
hope god put loyalty in all my friends
cause lord knows i got they back to the end
right now im recordin with the mic sittin in my hand
i wish three was on my left where my styrofoam is
got up out of cypress went to the woodlands got a safe room in my crib
aint no tellin when ima have to use it we all know how i live
keepin my gun everywhere i go we all know im still here
question my girl but love her strong we all know how that is
payin for my daddy to come home pray he get a appeal
hope he come take me away keep me from off of these pills
and come get me from off of this drank before my kidneys they fail
tell my son he make me calm i dont know what im doin
tell my girl these hoes cant make me cum i only want her to do it
ten lines straight goin on ten days my body aint got no fluid
please oh please dont die tryin on the real
all alone stalks and the shottas are unjudgemental
it aint too far right by the am mart where they left my nigga
wont be that long yeah itll be a while
til my love life right again killas on side again
butterflies paradise them bullets left out the wind

verse 2
if i took the clean route bank accounts got cleaned out
well still be at war ridin with the mops tryna wipe the block down
50 rounds on the bottom of that glock standin in front moms house
steady screamin gang life know my time comin round

chorus
if i say how i feel would you really listen
