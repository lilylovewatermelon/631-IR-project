hes a greedy son of a bitch
hes making his way
from florida up to la
he left the tropicana
passed through louisiana
he laughs hard and carries on
but he can barely stand ya
all his physicist buddies
they all wear the snow white coats
and goggles to shield
the elements from their eyes
gregs companion andy
he lives his life
vicariously through his mathematics
if you wanna live the good life
well you better stay away from the limelight
times 2
they call him rollin james
hes got a heart thats made of brains
he fell in love once
and thought about it for a day
hey greg
whered you go last night
he says i dont know
but i woke up with a pocket full of loot
if you wanna live the good life
well you better stay away from the limelight
times 2
hey greg
whered one of your shoes go
he looked at me and said
thats not important
please
dont you point
your photon ray gun at me
if you wanna live the good life
well you better stay away from the limelight x4you might also likeembed"
