to the way that i felt it
it wasnt worth my time
and now its sad cause all i missed
wasnt that good to begin with
and now ive started you begging
saying things that you dont mean
it isnt worth my time
a lines a dime a million times
and im about to see all of them
chorus
goodbye to you goodbye to you
youre taking up my time
goodbye to you goodbye to you
youre taking up my time
goodbye to you goodbye to you
youre taking up my time
goodbye to you goodbye to you

you call my name when i wake up
to see things go your way
im coughing up my time
each drags a drop of blood a grain
a minute of my life
its all ive got just to stay down
why the fuck am i still down
im hoarding all thats mine
each time i let just one slip by
im wasting what is mine
