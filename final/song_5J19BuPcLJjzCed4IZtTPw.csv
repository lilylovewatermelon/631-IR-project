this song is called before i forget
here we fucking go man
new york
let me see you bitches jumpin come on

intro corey taylor
go
oh yeah

verse 1 corey taylor  crowd
stapled shut inside an outside world
and i’m sealed in tight bizarre but right at home
claustrophobic closing in and im catastrophic not again
im smeared across the page and doused in gasoline
i wear you like a stain yet i’m the one whos obscene
catch me up on all your sordid little insurrections
ive got no time to lose im just caught up in all the cattle

prechorus 1 corey taylor
locked in clutch
pushed in place
hold your breath
listen

chorus corey taylor  crowd
i am a world before i am a man
i was a creature before i could stand
i will remember before i forget
come on people
before i forget that
i am a world before i am a man
i was a creature before i could stand
i will remember before i forget
before i forget that
see slipknot liveget tickets as low as 88you might also likeverse 2 corey taylor
im ripped across the ditch and settled in the dirt
and i wear you like a stitch yet im the one whos hurt
pay attention to your sordid little insurrections
ive got no right to win i’m just caught up in all the battles

prechorus 2 corey taylor
pull the strings
throw the shapes
hold your breath
listen

chorus corey taylor  crowd
i am a world before i am a man
i was a creature before i could stand
i will remember before i forget
come on people
before i forget that
i am a world before i am a man
i was a creature before i could stand
i will remember before i forget
before i forget that

bridge corey taylor
make some fuckin’ noise
my end it justifies my means
all i ever do is delay
my every attempt to evade
the end of the road
and my end it justifies my means
all i ever do is delay
my every attempt to evade
the end of the road
chorus corey taylor  crowd
i am a world before i am a man
i was a creature before i could stand
i will remember before i forget
before i forget that
i am a world before i am a man
i was a creature before i could stand
i will remember before i forget
one more time
before i forget that
i am a world before i am a man
i was a creature before i could stand
i will remember before i forget
before i forget that
