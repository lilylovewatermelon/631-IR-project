monologue chelsea alden
were walking in the streets  or whats left of them
i take your hand and the city is slowly vanishing
theres no crowd anymore no cars no signals
but in the middle of the road a purple and mellow shape is floating
the shape of our mutual dream
stay calm hold me tight give it a chance to take us away

outro anthony gonzalez
we will live we will dream on the shadow of our world
we will live we will dream on the shadow of our world
we will live we will dream on the shadow of our worldyou might also like2embed"
