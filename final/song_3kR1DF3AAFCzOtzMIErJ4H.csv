she moved with shameless wonder
the perfect creature rarely seen
since some liar brought the thunder
when the land was godless and free
her eyes look sharp and steady
into the empty parts of me
still my heart is heavy
with the hate of some other mans beliefs

prechorus
always a welldressed fraud
who wouldnt spare the rod
never for me

chorus
screamin the name of a foreigners god
screamin the name of a foreigners god
screamin the name of a foreigners god
the purest expression of grief

verse 2
wonderin who i copy
musterin some tender charm
she feels no control of her body
she feels no safety in my arms
ive no language left to say it
but all i do is quake to her
breakin if i try conveying
the broken love i make to her

all that ive been taught
and every word ive got
is foreign to me

chorus
screamin the name of a foreigners god
screamin the name of a foreigners god
screamin the name of a foreigners god
the purest expression of grief

instrumental bridge

chorus
screamin the name of a foreigners god
screamin the name of a foreigners god
screamin the name of a foreigners god
the purest expression of grief
screamin the name of a foreigners god
screamin the name of a foreigners god
screamin the name of a foreigners god
the purest expression of grief21embed"
