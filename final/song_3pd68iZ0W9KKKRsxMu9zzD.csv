people standing in line to look at premade sandwiches
people standing in line to get high to bad bitches
people standing in line to smoke weed thats green tea
people standing in line for two rails of oxiclean
people standing in line to nuke themselves with ketamine
its artisan raw and gluten free
probiotic superfood antioxidant lowmsg
nongmo locally sourced quinoa and chia seeds
jojoba and baobab dog treats
hand made with wild goji berries
agave acai and activated whey protein
people standing in line to buy whatever the mcfuck
they might want to shove down their foodpipes tonight
new watch in black gold
new shirt that looks old
big dick and no soul
new pants with four holes
old phones in one drawer
five dry pens something from a kinder egg
and everything you didnt know you were looking for
people complaining cause their mum whines
people complaining about losing their minds
people complaining about standing in line
people standing in line and they dont even know why5embed"
