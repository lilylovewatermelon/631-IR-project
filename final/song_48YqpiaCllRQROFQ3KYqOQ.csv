if you want me to knock you out
and show what im about
then hear what i am saying
i know that youve been there before
you say you know the score
but thats not how im playing

prechorus livio
freedom is water for my leaves
and love is the sun
you wont see me beggin on my knees
but youre still the one

chorus all
let me come and let me go
cause i want you to know
that i will never leave you
if you never let me down
ill always be around
let me come and let me go

verse 2 joey livio
to keep your foot inside the door
and make me give you more
you got to learn to play me
baby dont cover up my eyes
and count on a surprise
thats not the way to tame me
