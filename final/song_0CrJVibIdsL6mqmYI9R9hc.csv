every seconds soaked in sadness
every weekend is a war
and im drowning in the déjà vu
weve seen it all before
i dont wanna do this by myself
i dont wanna live like a broken record
ive heard these lines a thousand times
and ive seen it all before

verse
are we close enough
there is something i must confide
i think weve lost our touch
theres no sparkle in those eyes
what an awful mess ive made
theres nothing left to say

chorus
every seconds soaked in sadness
every weekend is a war
and im drowning in the déjà vu
weve seen it all before
i dont wanna do this by myself
i dont wanna live like a broken record
ive heard these lines a thousand times
and ive seen it all before

theres nothing in the air tonight
nothing in the air tonight
theres nothing in the air tonight
theres nothing in the air tonight

chorus
every seconds soaked in sadness
every weekend is a war
and im drowning in the déjà vu
weve seen it all before
i dont wanna do this by myself
i dont wanna live like a broken record
ive heard these lines a thousand times
and ive seen it all before

outro
im sorry love
its not enough
we shouldnt feel the love so painfully
it hurts right to the touch
i know it stings
i know this cuts
and i wish i could agree with you
but fuck this love its not enough
its not enough
its not enough12embed"
