all i know is oohoohooh
we could go anywhere we could do
anything girl whatever the mood were in
all i know is oohoohooh
getting lost late at night under stars
finding love standing right where we are your lips
they pull me in the moment you and i alone and
people may be watching i dont mind
cause

chorus
anywhere with you feels right
anywhere with you feels like
paris in the rain
paris in the rain
we dont need a fancy town
or bottles that we cant pronounce
cause anywhere babe
is like paris in the rain
when im with you
when im with you
paris in the rain
paris in the rain

verse 2
i look at you now and i want this forever
i might not deserve it but theres nothing better
dont know how i ever did it all without you
my heart is about to about to jump out of my chest
feelings they come and they go that they do
feelings they come and they go not with you
the late nights and the street lights and the people
look at me girl and the whole world could stop
you might also likechorus
anywhere with you feels right
anywhere with you feels like
paris in the rain
paris in the rain
we dont need a fancy town
or bottles that we cant pronounce
cause anywhere babe
is like paris in the rain
when im with you ooh
when im with you ooh
paris in the rain
paris in the rain oh

bridge
girl when im not with you
all i do is miss you
so come and set the mood right
underneath the moonlight
days in paris nights in paris
paint you with my eyes closed
wonder where the time goes
yeah isnt it obvious isnt it obvious
so come and set the mood right
underneath the moonlight
outro
cause anywhere with you feels right
anywhere with you feels like
paris in the rain
paris in the rain
walking down an empty street
puddles underneath our feet40embed"
