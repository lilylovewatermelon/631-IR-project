ive been learning how to do it all the hard way
saving up burning up my yesterdays
trying so hard not to believe
take a bite of the lies that youve been feeding me

chorus
tell me something that i dont know leave me with those eyes
ill be right here waiting south of the city lights

verse 2
wish i wouldve listen to my brother when he told me
loving her is only gonna leave you lonely
dont believe in fate careful who you love
they dont care out there where youre coming from

chorus
tell me something that i dont know leave me with those eyes
ill be right here waiting south of the city lights

verse 3
its been a long time coming to finding out that i dont know it all
its always good when you get it dont take too long till you wanna go

verse 4
now ill just sit and stare at white walls all the time
wish you would somehow hear that i aint doing fine
ill never be the same ill never love again
ill never leave this mess that ive been living in
see parker mccollum liveget tickets as low as 15you might also likechorus
tell me something that i dont know leave me with those eyes
ill be waiting right here south of the city lights
south of the city lights south of the city lightsembed"
