to meet the widow
she gave me an apple
and it was red

i slept in her black arms
for a century
she wanted nothing in return
i gave her nothing in return

the ghost of her husband
beautiful as a horse
pulled up an apple cart
full of millions of red apples for us
full of millions of red apples for us

i went down to the river
to meet the widow
she gave me an apple
and it was red

i slept in her black arms
for a century
she wanted nothing in return
i gave her nothing in return
