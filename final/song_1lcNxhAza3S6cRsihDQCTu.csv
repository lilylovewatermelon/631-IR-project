im on the phone
you turn your back on me and
were all alone
why is this happening i
i never thought
i would be questioning the one i
one i love

verse 2
but here we are
rapped up in silence
can we
sound the alarm
most of it fighting i dont
know where to start
i keep colliding with the one i
one i love

prechorus
dont make it so hard for me to stay
you should know better than that

chorus
and before
you go on breaking my heart
and i fall
even deeper in love
and my lungs
screaming out can you hear me
you should know better than that
you might also likehere we are
here we are
whoa

verse 3
if i could leave
i would be leaving cuz i
cannot believe
what i am hearing tell me
how can it be
im secondguessing on the one i
one i love

prechorus

chorus

here we are
here we are
whoa
here we are
here we are
again

some forgive just to forget
ive not forgotten yet
i still believe in you
but theres a crack in our cement
this time its permanent
permanent

you should know better than that

chorus

and here we are
here we are
whoa
and here we are
here we are
again

again
