waking up to find another day
the moon got lost again last night
but now the sun has finally had its say
i guess i feel alright
but it hurts when i think
when i let it sink in its all over me
im lying here in the dark
watching you sleep it hurts a lot

chorus
and all i know is
youve got to give me everything give me everything
nothing less cause you know i give you all of me give you all of me
i give you everything that i am
im handin over everything that ive got
cause i wanna have a really true love
dont ever wanna have to go and give you up
stay up till four in the morning and the tears are pouring
and i wanna make it worth the fight
what have we been doing for all this time
baby if were gonna do it come on do it right

verse 2
all i wanted was to know im safe
dont wanna lose the love ive found
remember when you said that you would change
dont let me down
its not fair how you are
