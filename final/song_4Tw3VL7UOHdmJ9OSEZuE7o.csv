red cardinals in the white snow
they got too high to fly home
for the winter and i had a roommate once
he got so high couldnt go out at night
so he found love on the internet
and it is freezing in pennsylvania
and the rest of the birds are in turks and caicos
and it reads like a truth commercial
but we feel bad so we get stoned an do snow angels

verse 2
so we bought a broke down bus and painted it green
and we danced in the parking lot under the shadow of 95
and all of my favorite people they dont march to the beat of your drum
they just keep on keeping on
and whatever youre supposed to be
whatever thats supposed to mean
i just wanted you to know
that you dont have to come clean to me

bridge 1
yeah everythings exactly
everything is exactly where it needs to be
i just wanted you to know
that you dont have to come clean to me
yeah everythings exactly
yeah everythings exactly
everything is exactly where it needs to be

wolves are circling
black ties suit them
wolves are circling
black ties suit them
so we light one up cause its in our blood

wolves are circling
black ties suit them

black ties suit them
