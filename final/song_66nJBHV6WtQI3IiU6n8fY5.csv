i feel her filth in my bones
wash off my hands til its gone
the walls theyre closin in
with velvet curtains

verse 2
some love was made for the lights
some kiss your cheek and goodnight
lift up a red high heel
lock up your doors with steel

verse 3
theyre makin noise in my street
my blinds are drawn i cant see
smashed in my car window
didnt touch the stereo

chorus
slow it down angie come back to bed
rest your arms and rest your legs

verse 4
act like youve been here before
smile less and dress up some more
tie up your scarf real tight
these boys are out for blood tonight
you might also likechorus
slow it down angie come back to bed
rest your arms and rest your legs

verse 5
and when she stood she stood tall
shell make a fool of you all
dont ask for cigarettes
she aint got nothing left for you

verse 6
i never she never we never looked back
that wasnt what we were good at
and when it came to love
we were not good enough on

outro
slow it down angie come back to bed
rest your arms and rest your legs
dont you frown when youre feelin like that
only love can dig you out of this21embed"
