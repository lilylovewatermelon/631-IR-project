all my friends say that theyre happy that im moving on
first time that theyve seen me smile since you up and gone
but your memory wont let me go
pretty as a picture that youd hang up on a wall
but she just cant compare to you and it really aint her fault
i know that i should fall for her
believe me girl ive tried
but your memory wont let me

chorus
shes all good but youre the best i ever had
tell me how could she ever compete with that
ocean boulevard still has my heart
close my eyes and there we are
youre still the only place that feels like home
cause your memory wont let me go
no your memory wont let me

verse 2
sometimes when shes close to me i still smell your perfume
and every time im holding her im really holding you
and any man in his right mind would be all hers by now
but your memory wont let me

chorus
shes all good but youre the best i ever had
tell me how could she ever compete with that
ocean boulevard still has my heart
close my eyes and there we are
youre still the only place that feels like home
cause your memory wont let me go
oh your memory wont let me
