verse 1 lil wayne
yeah some say tragedys hard to get over
but sometime that tragedy means its over
soldier from the academy league of rollers
i deny being down though they seem to hold us
my shoulders are strong i prove em wrong
i aint doing nothing but moving on let the truth be known
but they talked that freedom at us
and didnt even leave a ladder damn

verse 2 robin thicke
i work at the corner store
we all got problems problems
no ones gonna fly down low
no ones gonna save us now
how you feel youre not alone
were all just jealous jealous
we dont reach the sky no more
we just cant overcome no
