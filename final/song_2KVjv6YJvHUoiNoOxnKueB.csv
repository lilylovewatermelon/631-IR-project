now mary
cant you find a way
to bring me down
im so sorry
that i had to go
and let you down

chorus
knowing you ill think things are gonna be fine
but then again youll probably change your mind

verse 2
im sorry mary but being your mate
means trying to find something that you arent going to hate
what a season
to be beautiful
without a reason

chorus
knowing you ill think things are gonna be fine
but then again youll probably change your mind
