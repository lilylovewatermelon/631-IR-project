theres a note on the table
said i aint coming back
til your sorry ass is gone
im tired of the cheating and running around
never saw the wrong in anything youve done

chorus
whiskeys gone but i aint leaving
theres got to be a bottle in the back
whiskeys gone but i aint leaving
got to get this devil off my

verse 2
well i stumbled my way down to my local bar
where i saw the devil in my glass
the bartender told me it was time to go
i told him that he could lick my sack

chorus
whiskeys gone but i aint leaving
there’s gotta be a way to get her back
whiskeys gone but i aint leaving
got to get this devil off my

interlude
oh
i can drive
i can drive
oh shit
see zac brown band liveget tickets as low as 60you might also likebridge
kentucky tennessee you better find whiskey
not leaving thats a fact
small batch sour mash
red nose red face going to wreck the whole place
looking through the bare glass
bald head chapped ass
gone gone gone gone gone gone
lord its a hard thing to overcome
wake up and find the whiskeys gone

chorus
whiskeys gone but i aint leaving
theres got to be a bottle of jim black
whiskeys gone but i aint leaving
got to get this devil off myembed"
