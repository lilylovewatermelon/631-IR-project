come back to me this is unconceivable
breaking apart the ones you love
hate runs deep for what youve done to us
left alone through suicide

posthook
suicide

verse 1
i just want to die take away my life
lay by your side

hook
come back to me this is unconceivable
breaking apart the ones you love
hate runs deep for what youve done to us
left alone through suicide

prechorus
look at my face you pierce with a blank stare
no dream could prepare a heart for a lifeless friend
hes gone nothing will take back time
i need him back but nothing will take back time

chorus
i can see just fine with you in my life
and there by my side as it starts to fade
i know this cant be right stuck in a dream
a nightmare full of sorrow
see avenged sevenfold liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likeverse 2
nightmare full of pain
nightmare full of pain

bridge 1
i look back and see the twisted road
best friends and despair took its toll
take away take away take away take away

guitar solo

bridge 2
you cant be replaced
im left alone with you
in spirit and the words
you wrote to me
sorrow sank deep inside my blood
all the ones around me i cared for
and most of all i loved
but i cant see myself that way
please dont forget me
or cry while im away

prechorus
look at my face you pierce with a blank stare
no dream could prepare a heart for a lifeless friend
hes gone nothing will take back time
i need him back but nothing will take back time
chorus
i can see just fine with you in my life
and there by my side as it starts to fade
i know this cant be right stuck in a dream
a nightmare full of sorrow

chorus
i can see just fine with you in my life
and there by my side as it starts to fade
i know this cant be right stuck in a dream
a nightmare full of sorrow2embed"
