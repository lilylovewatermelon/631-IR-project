verse 1 vory
hard to keep my focus on what matters
mandem hit my line like some  just got hit up on your block
you can rest assured its not us
cause we been out the wavе catchin waves
they say we aint seen you on thе block
cause i been out the way
chasin millions in my sleep i found the better way
somewhere on an island let me kick it this my getaway
i pour up a drink for all my  who aint see the day
tryna finish this with who i started with
way too many fallen soldiers no i cant forgot
hope they got headphones up in heaven
you can vibe out and just hear this 
its just certain  you cant forget

and they sunny like that and they comin right back
and when you on tour i bet you check in
cause my guys back to work its a monday like that
and when you text change the beginnin of every word
you will speak to me with only no cap
me and your big homie go back
and homie dont rap you dont know me like that
