where my mother said that i would be
wondering what kind of man i will be
maybe like my father back when he was young

so will you carry me to the delta where the water will touch my skin
and the oxygen will give me life
will you take me there my lover i dont think ill make it out
of the hell i created in my mind

maybe somewhere like virginia love
maybe somewhere like virginia babe
maybe one day ill be all alone in my sheets
but when i wake i pray that i see you
i see you one more time
my bloodshot eyes are blinding me
oh theyre only masking the feelings inside of me
boy on the river i see in front of me oh yeah
oh its never enough to fill my needs

so will you carry me home my dear
where i first felt love and fear
where i smoked a cigarette you coughed a lung
will you take me there my lover i dont think ill make it out
of the hell i created in my mind
you might also likemaybe somewhere like ohio love
maybe somewhere like ohio babe
and i i need some time
to breathe to escape my head

oh and the photos they hang
on my wall now baby
and i cant take them down cause theyre all i have now


maybe one day ill be all alone in my sheets
but when i wake i pray that i see you
one more time
and i been trying i been crying
i been dying just to see you
one more time
and i i i
