you could have anyone you want
why would you want to be with me
im nothing special
you could have anyone you want
why would you want to be with me
you know im nothing special

chorus
be with whoever you want
i dont care i dont care
i dont wanna know
dont tell me about your problems
if youre not trying to solve them
dont ask me for my help

verse
fix it yourself
she tried to call me yesterday
but i didnt pick up
cause i dont got time
i dont have time
i dont have time
i dont have time
i dont have time no
