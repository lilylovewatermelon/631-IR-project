let me hear you say somethin

verse 1 brendon urie
sorry to get sentimental tonight
that perfume lingers in your hair
its just that everything reminds me of things
i thought i shouldnt have to see again
see the thing is im so sorry to say
you need me dont you
someone still loves you still loves you
someone still loves you

chorus brendon urie  lyn collins
meet me meet me
at the overpass at the overpass
sketchy girls and lipstick boys
sketchy girls and lipstick boys
troubled love and high speed noise
i know you wanna meet me meet me
at the overpass at the overpass
sketchy girls and lipstick boys
sketchy girls and lipstick boys
troubled love and high speed noise
i know you wanna
let me hear you say somethin
you might also likeverse 2 brendon urie
i have a shirt that keeps your smell
that perfume lingers in your hair
you keep one too in parallel
you keep my long black leather
see the thing is im so sorry to say
you need me dont you
someone still loves you loves you
someone still loves you

bridge brendon urie
tiny bottles of shit wine
in a tin can that climbs
but i remember every time
everything about you is perfect
down to your blood type
but i remember every time

chorus brendon urie  lyn collins
meet me meet me
at the overpass at the overpass
sketchy girls and lipstick boys
sketchy girls and lipstick boys
troubled love and high speed noise
i know you wanna meet me meet me
at the overpass at the overpass
sketchy girls and lipstick boys
sketchy girls and lipstick boys
troubled love and high speed noise
i know you wanna
let me hear you say somethin17embed"
