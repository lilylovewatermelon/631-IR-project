verse
watchin movies on my phone whenever i want
i turn it as loud as it goes cause when nobodys home
im the king of everything make the rules up on my own
i can break em if i please cause i make up the police
and everybodys equal but not me cause im the king
i make all the other people tell me secrets in my dreams

chorus
i wake up when they tell us to
if not ill sleep with you
ill take my time to make you smile
cause i know just how you feel when youre alone

instrumental

bridge
and you dont need me no
ill take all your time
and i love the way it feels when you take the wheel
i know you dont

ill take all your time
ill take all your timesee dominic fike liveget tickets as low as 186you might also like16embed"
