i mean what can i say
three babies in the backseat singin’ to you
hey dj won’t you play that song for me
and my hom—and my homies all singing to it
3oh 3oh3

verse 1 sean foreman  nathaniel motte
i ain’t callin’ for a closeup
no clubs no cars
bitches with the nose jobs
no dubs no stars
i’ma do it how i always have
whiskey in a 40 bag
pissin’ in the alleyway
out back of where the party’s at
i’ma spend it on a new whip
new hat new kicks
bitches with the huge tits
new gat new slips
i’ma do it how i always do
sleep until the break of noon
wakin’ just to make it through
another night of shakin’ you

chorus sean foreman  nathaniel motte
i mean what can i say
three babies in the backseat singin’ to you
hey dj won’t you play that song for me
and turn it up on your radio
i got 200 seconds and im ready to go
i mean what can i say
three babies in the backseat singin to you
hey dj won’t you play that song for me
and turn it up on your radio
i got 200 seconds and i’m ready to go

i ain’t signing on a new lease
no cooks no keys
models with their nose bleeds
white lace gold beads
i’ma run it like a marathon
party ‘til i’m 50
wake up on my parent’s lawn
them cops still out to get me
and i ain’t sippin’ on a mixed drink
pinkie out lips pink
talking to a rich skank
filled up like a sperm bank
i’ma go where i always go
drinks are on the house
whiskey’s on the rocks
while your sister’s on my mouth

chorus sean foreman  nathaniel motte
i mean what can i say
three babies in the backseat singin’ to you
hey dj won’t you play that song for me
and turn it up on your radio
i got 200 seconds and im ready to go
i mean what can i say
three babies in the backseat singin to you
hey dj won’t you play that song for me
and turn it up on your radio
i got 200 seconds and i’m ready to go
bridge nathaniel motte
and if i was a rich man
i’d never been to sea
could i take you anyways
or would you come with me baby
and if i was a sick man
i’d never meant to be
would you love me anyways
or would you marry me

chorus sean foreman  nathaniel motte
i mean what can i say
three babies in the backseat singin’ to you
hey dj won’t you play that song for me
and turn it up on your radio
i got 200 seconds and im ready to go
i mean what can i say
three babies in the backseat singin to you
hey dj won’t you play that song for me
and turn it up on your radio
i got 200 seconds and i’m ready to go
i mean what can i say
three babies in the backseat singin’ to you
hey dj won’t you play that song for me
and turn it up on your radio
i got 200 seconds and im ready to go
i mean what can i say
three babies in the backseat singin to you
hey dj won’t you play that song for me
