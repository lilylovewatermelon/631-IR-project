midnight prevost heading down to alabam alabam
i got a threenight run we’re gonna kick it off in birmingham
headlights wide lines flying down 65
trying to catch a few hours’ sleep
tomorrow comes showtime that’s when i know i’m
livin that neon dream

chorus
oh i got the bus and the band and a onenight stand
waiting on us down the road we’re gonna
load it in crank it to ten whiskey shots till 2am
and off to another show and then it’s
back to my baby for a couple days
but i can only stay for so long
til that honkytonk highway’s calling me home

verse 2
rolling into mobile name on the marquee sign
waving at the women that are standing in the ticket line
point me to the stage i know that’s the only place i’m ever
smoky bars guitars breaking all the girls’ hearts
that’s the only life for me

chorus
oh i got the bus and the band and a onenight stand
waiting on us down the road we’re gonna
load it in crank it to ten whiskey shots till 2am
and off to another show and then it’s
back to my baby for a couple days
but i can only stay for so long
til that honkytonk highway’s calling me home

chorus
oh i got the bus and the band and a onenight stand
waiting on us down the road we’re gonna
load it in crank it to ten whiskey shots till 2am
and off to another show and then it’s
back to my baby for a couple days
but i can only stay for so long
til that honkytonk highway’s calling me home
til that honkytonk highway’s calling me homeembed"
