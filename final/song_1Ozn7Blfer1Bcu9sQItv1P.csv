i miss your house on the hill
the one with your room on the right
i miss your voice youre the only one with it
it reminds me of what used to be mine

verse 2
i miss you in chattanooga
i drive through there all the time
and i listen to you when i feel like crying
it reminds me of what used to be mine

verse 3
i miss your shirt that didnt fit right
ive worn it to sleep once or twice
i try not to go where i first met you
it reminds me of what used to be mine

verse 4
i only see you on occasion
some form of you not in real life
right now your pictures all over atlanta
no matter which way that i drive
it reminds me of what used to be mine
you remind me of what used to be minesee faye webster liveget tickets as low as 47you might also like3embed"
