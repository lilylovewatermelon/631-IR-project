people around you should really have nothing to say
me im just proud of the fact that youve done it your way
and the weekends here started it right
even if you only get part of it right
live for today plan for tomorrow
party tonight party tonight
dying to meet your girlfriends that you said you might bring
if theyre the ones that tell you that you do the right thing ooh

prechorus drake
houston girls love the way it goes down
atlanta girls love the way it goes down
vegas girls love the way it goes down

chorus drake
but i gotta say oh baby oh baby why is this so familiar
just met her already feel like i know the real her
you mustve done this before this cant be your first time
we mustve been here before its still fresh on my mind
you got that shit that somebody would look for but wont find
you mustve done this before this cant be your first time

verse 2 drake
they keep telling me dont save you
if i ignore all that advice then something isnt right
then who will i complain to
but the weekends here started it right
even if i only get part of it right
live for today plan for tomorrow
party tonight party tonight
you got your guards up i do too
theres things we might discover
cause you got a past and i do too
were perfect for each other

verse 3 lil wayne
cause to her im just a rapper and soon shell have met another
so if tonights an accident tomorrow well recover
and i know im not supposed to judge a book by its cover
i dont wan be in the blind but sometimes i stevie wonder
about her
and she with it if im with it and im with it
i know what makes her smile but i wan know what makes her different
or should i just be realistic lipstick on the glass
see i know this aint your first but its better than your last tunechi

chorus drake

we mustve been here before its still fresh on my mind
you got that shit that somebody would look for but wont find
you mustve done this before this cant be your first time woah
verse 4 andré 3000
shower her with dollar tips shawty went and bought a whip
guarantee the city remember your whole name you throw that ho a scholarship
all of them aint all equipped
and this saddens me i see the pecking order
quoteunquote bad bitches work the whole floor
those that get laughed at sit off in a corner
like a lab rat nobody want her
niggas that are married dont wanna go home
but we look up to them they wish they were us
they want some new trim we lust for some trust
now the both of us are colorblind cause the other side looks greener
which leaves your turf in a boise state
cant see a play or the team cause
everybody has an addiction mine happens to be you
and those who say they dont souls will later on say to them that aint true
all of them will have an opinion
but yall know what yall can do with them
but if you unsure ill take you on tour
to a place you can stick that in
well sitting here sad as hell
listening to adele i feel you baby
someone like you more like someone unlike you
or something thats familiar maybe
and i can tell that she wants a baby
and i can yell girl that youre crazy
oh what the hell nope cant be lazy
please be careful bitches got the rabies85embed"
