its like forgetting
the words to your favorite song
you cant believe it
you were always singing along
it was so easy
and the words so sweet
you cant remember
you try to feel the beat

chorus
eeeeeeeet eet eet
eeeeeeeet eet eet

verse 2
you spent half of your life
trying to fall behind
youre using your headphones
to drown out your mind
it was so easy
and the words so sweet
you cant remember
you try to move your feet

chorus
eeeeeeeet eet eet
eeeeeeeet eet eet

whether or not to steal

just to feel the chill
he hears that outside
a small boy just started to cry
cause its his turn
but his brother wont let him try

the words to your favorite song
you cant believe it
you were always singing along
it was so easy
and the words so sweet
you cant remember
you try to move your feet

and the words so sweet
you cant remember
you try to feel the beat6embed"
