verse 1 drake  gunna
i bring up money they change up the topic
i got a 19 and it fold in my pocket
she gave me her number now i gotta block it
im mixin the dirty bills in with the profit
clean that shit up and i give it right back to him
if i dont fuck with him then i cant rap with him
i wanna be there when somebody catches him
i want a witness to see that shit
man these folks these folks gotta goddamn hear this shit no cap
i bring up hits and they change up the topic
i got a 19 and it fold in my pocket
one hell of a year and a nigga still droppin
they wanted to stop it but they couldnt stop it
you told a story like shorty was feelin you
she told a story like she split the bill with you
look at my story man no one could write it
now i see a million i dont get excited
i might just ysl my shit the thugger way
aint no real sense in me goin the other way
cannot be seen in that shit from the other day
virgil just chefd me a whole different colorway
please dont be stupid its baby and gunna
and baby he wanted her so i just swung her
next time im in dallas ill look for another
you niggas fell off and youll never recover

painted all black the interior butter
i drip like a leak and thats word to my mother
yeah came out the street gotta sleep with a cutter
family a beast we gon eat us a supper
my dick in her mouth like she teethin or somethin
sound like it could be drip season this summer
aint no comparin cause we number one
in black and white chanel i look like a nun
the police in shock dont know who got a gun
dont got what i got cause i shop in milan
its winter i still took the top off the don
the kid was surprised that my trunk in the front
i know you a upset they dont shine in the sun
cuban link look like a box of crayons
im still at the lot tryna cop the cayenne
i told the judge fuck it im goin on the run
you want it my dawgsll look out for the bond

chorus lil baby
and im gettin by let em choose sides
we get ms in by the shoe size
i dont fuck with yall type of kind

and i swear to god i dont get tired
from the trenches now im goin
spend a whole hundred on a new wristwatch
verse 3 lil baby
dont gotta drip i can leave it to gunna
runnin this shit only been out two summers
that 4x4 truck i post 300
boy at whoever they know how im comin
aint got no feelings im here for the money
treat every club like a magic on monday
niggas aint rich for real they gettin fronted
gave her a dime told her fix up her stomach
by the time she get back ima switch up my number
cap to her friend like i been on her bumper
lately i been the topic of discussion
draco was foreign they shipped it from russia
bad vibes at my show like im usher
if she tell me no once i wont even touch it
all i do is get her out here abortion
act like ive been rich i used to have nothin
drizzy hit me up like he got another one
money aint even came in from the other one
fuck it im hot so i might as well double up
seem like everything i get on a number one
they tryna team up to beat me they huddlin up
ever catch me out in traffic im cuttin up
every city we go to it be lit as fuck
tryna put the police on us get rid of us
chorus lil baby
and im gettin by let em choose sides
we get ms in by the shoe size
i dont fuck with yall type of kind
i done seen all y’all dickride
bread winner like im kevin gates
and i swear to god i dont get tired
from the trenches now im goin
spend a whole hundred on a new wristwatch
