all her signals are getting lost in the ether
thats what she wanted
shes a landslide with a city beneath her
thats what she wanted
so take a good look so youll never forget it
thats what she wanted
take a deep breath i know im gonna regret it
thats what she wanted

chorus mark hoppus
hollys looking dry looking for an easy target
let her slit my throat give her ammo if shell use it
caution on the road lies lies and hidden danger
southern californias breeding mommys little monster

verse 2 tom delonge  mark hoppus
shes got a mission and im collateral damage
thats what she wanted
shes the flower that you place on my casket
thats what she wanted
savor the moment cause the memorys fleeting
take a photograph as the last train is leaving

chorus mark hoppus
hollys looking dry looking for an easy target
let her slit my throat give her ammo if shell use it
caution on the road lies lies and hidden danger
southern californias breeding mommys little monster

better run run run run run holly let me out
better run run run run run holly let me out
