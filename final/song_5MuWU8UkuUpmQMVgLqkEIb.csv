do you think
everything everyone is going mental
it seems to me were spiralling outta control and its inevitable
now dont you think
this time is yours this time is mine
its temperamental
it seems to me were on all fours
crawling on our knees someone help us please

refrain
oh jesus christ almighty
do i feel alright no not slightly
i wanna get a flat i know i cant afford it
its just the bureaucrats who wont give me a mortgage
its very funny cause i got your fucking money
and im never gonna get it just cause of my bad credit
oh well i guess i mustnt grumble
i suppose its just the way the cookie crumbles

chorus
oh yes im fine
everythings just wonderful
im having the time of my life

verse 2
dont you want something else
something new than what weve got here
and dont you feel its all the same
some sick game and its so insincere
i wish i could change the ways of the world
make it a nice place
until that day i guess we stay
doing what we do screwing who we screw

why cant i sleep at night
dont say its gonna be alright
i wanna be able to eat spaghetti bolognese
and not feel bad about it for days and days and days
in the magazines they talk about weight loss
if i buy those jeans i can look like kate moss
i know its not the life that i chose
but i guess thats the way that things go

chorus
oh yes im fine
everythings just wonderful
im having the time of my life
oh yes im fine
everythings just wonderful
im having the time of my life
