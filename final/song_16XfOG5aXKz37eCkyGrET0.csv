the determination of the disparagement claim at issue herein requires the following twostep analysiswhat is the meaning of the matter in question as it appears in the marks and as those marks are used in connection with the goods and services identified in the registrationsis the meaning of the marks one that may disparage native americansas confirmed by the parties at the oral hearing it is already established that 1 this disparagement claim only pertains to the term redskins and 2 as to “the meaning of the matter in question” “as used in connection with respondent’s services redskins clearly both refers to respondent’s professional football team and carries the allusion to native americans inherent in the original definition of that word”35 harjo v profootball inc 50 uspq2d at 1742 rev’d on other grounds profootball inc v harjo 68 uspq2d at 1249 moreover as to the second point the evidence overwhelmingly supports a determination that the term redskins as it appears in the marks retains the meaning native american two of the registrations include native american imagery registration no 0986668 top and registration no 0987127 bottom are shown belowthe image of a native american has appeared prominently as a logo on the helmets of respondent’s washington redskins’ team uniforms as demonstrated by the images below of its former players john riggins in super bowl xvii in 1983 left and doug williams in super bowl xxii in 1988 rightthe washington redskins marching band had worn native american headdresses as part of its uniforms between the 1960s and the 1990s as shown in the image below from the 1980sthe redskinettes also had appeared wearing costumes suggestive of native americans as shown in the 1962 photograph of them reproduced below which contained the title “dancing indians” and the caption “here are the redskinettes all decked out in their indian garb and carrying burgundy and gold pompoms”between 1967 and 1979 the annual washington redskin press guides shown below displayed american indian imagery on the cover pagerespondent has made continuous efforts to associate its football services with native american imagery

as confirmed by the district courtmean of the matter in question  this is not a case where through usage the word redskins has lost its meaning in the field of professional football as a reference to native americans in favor of an entirely independent meaning as the name of a professional football team rather when considered in relation to the other matter comprising at least two of the subject marks and as used in connection with respondents services redskins clearly both refers to respondents professional football team and carries the allusion to native americans inherent in the original definition of that word id based on the record before the ttab the court finds that this conclusion is supported by substantial evidence profootball inc vs hargo 68 uspq2d at 12481249 quoting harjo v profootball inc 50 uspq2d at 1742the term redskins in the registered marks when used in connection with professional football retains the meaning native americans thus the first prong of the test “what is the meaning of the matter” is established

the only issue left for decision is the second question in the disparagement test was the meaning of the marks at the times of the registrations one that may have disparaged native americans as it pertains to the term redskins

having narrowed the issue to be determined it is now necessary to understand what type of disparagement case the facts of this limited case present we must make our determination in the context of a respondent’s goods or services such context canturn an innocuous term into a disparaging one see in re lebanese arak corp 94 uspq2d 1215 1223 ttab 2010 likely meaning of khoran is the islamic holy text and use for wine disparages religion and beliefs of muslim americans see also doughboy industries inc v the reese chemical co 88 uspq 227 exm’r in chief 1951 doughboy refers to world war i american soldier as reinforced by picture of soldier on packaging and use on “a prophylactic preparation for the prevention of venereal diseases” disparages the soldiers orstrip the disparaging meaning from an otherwise disparaging term see squaw valley 80 uspq2d 1264 1267 squaw when used with skirelated goods means only the geographic location squaw valley ski resort and does not retain the meaning native american woman under the first part of the test and as such is not disparaging but as to nonskirelated goods and services the meaning remains native american woman ie the goods and services did not change the meaning and the evidence was sufficient to support the second prong of the test that the term is considered disparaging as the term is used in connection with the identified goods or services orhave no effect on a term’s disparaging meaning see heeb media 89 uspq2d 1071 1077 applicant’s good intent and inoffensive goods and services do not obviate finding that heeb is disparaging in context of the goods and services and disagreement within the referenced group does not erase the perception of those who find it disparaginghere petitioners assert that redskins is a racial slur thus the facts do not present the doughboy case because it is not allegedly an innocent term where the nature of the goods or services renders the mark disparaging the facts also do not fall within the part of the squaw valley case where the board reversed the refusal as to the skirelated gear because it did not pass the first prong of the test inasmuch as the word lost its allusion to native american women when used in the ski context due to the geographic location called “squaw valley” and the wellknown ski resort located there here it is conceded by the parties and established by the record that the term redskins retains its meaning “native american” even when used with respondent’s services

turning back then to the issue in this case namely whether the term redskins was disparaging at the time of registration the services do not have an effect on the meaning of the term ie the first prong the question is only as to the second prong whether the term is disparaging the facts of this case demonstrate the type of disparagement presented in heeb and the nonskirelated goods and services portion of squaw valley in other words respondent’s alleged honorable intent and manner of use of the term do not contribute to the determination of whether a substantial composite of the referenced group found redskins to be a disparaging term in the context of respondent’s services during the time period 19671990 because the services have not removed the native american meaning from the term and intent does not affect the second prong if it is found to be disparaging during the relevant time period then the trademark act mandates removal from the register

in presenting their case petitioners laid out two categories of evidence to prove that the term redskins even when considered solely as used with football and cheerleading services was disparaging during the relevant time periods 1 a general analysis of the word and 2 the specific views of the referenced group in some instances these two types of evidence intersect

as noted above the prior harjo case encompassed more issues as reflected by the pleadings and illustrated by the voluminous and wideranging record we only focus on the evidence that most directly reflects the sentiments of native americans in particular concerning the general analysis of the word we focus on the testimony and reports provided by the parties’ respective experts dictionary definitions and reference books for the specific views of native americans we focus on the national congress of american indians’ “ncai” 1993 resolution 9311 the deposition of ncai executive director ms joann chase the deposition of harold martin gross and various newspaper articles reports official records and letters

expert reports
dr geoffrey nunberg served as petitioners’ expert witness in linguistics specializing in lexical semantics “the study of the use of words and lexicography” dr ronald r butters served as respondent’s linguistic expert witness specifically tasked by respondent to research “the evolving history of the meaning of the term redskin in american english” david k barnhart was respondent’s expert witness in lexicography whom respondent asked to evaluate “the term redskins in the current american usage particularly in the context of sports” the record establishes that each of these witnesses is qualified to testify regarding the term “redskin” within the context of their specialties

we focus on those parts of the expert reports and testimony concerning the derivation of the word redskins dictionary usage labels and usage of the term “redskins” over the years in various media1 derivation of the word “redskins” as reference to native americansmr barnhart explains that “the original or core meaning of the word redskin identifies the race of people found by colonizing europeans in the 16th and 17th centuries” in his report mr barnhart confirms that “redskins” as an ethnic term refers to skin colorit is reasonable to expect people upon encountering something new to use a term which bears on its use size appearance or other characteristic feature the word red appears in a large number of terms in english it should be noted that there is another meaning for redskin descriptive of a variety of potato in the case of the potato it is because of its color in the case of the people living in north america upon the arrival of europeans it was likewise based upon appearance    in recent years the sensitivities of these people have caused some speakers of english to adjust their usage of some of these terms accordingly    the naturalness of the construction of the word redskin is underscored by the presence in the language of other terms with reference to color in describing the appearance of a person’s skin blue skin is a 19th century term used to describe blacks see for instance grose 1796 edition where he defines blue skin as “a person begotten of a black woman by a white man one of the blue squadron any one having a cross of the black breed or as it is termed a lick of the tar brush”    another example of this genre is darkskin for a black still other examples include yellowskin for an asian blackskinned and brownskinned for blacksin extrapolating on the concept of the use of skin color in language mr barnhart testifies as followsq do you know the word darky
a yes
q is that word natural in its construction insofar as it applies to
complexion
a yes
q is it offensive to africanamericans
a it can be
q is it derogatory
a depending on the context yes but i haven’t evaluated the
context of darky particularly so i would want to see some more
examples and evaluate what evidence i could accumulate yesthe record includes two works by irving lewis allen who dr butters testifies is a sociologist “who has given some thought to language” and is “certainly a respectable scholar” we particularly point to the following excerpt from his book unkind words ethnic labeling from redskin to wasp bergin  garvey 1990 p 18nearly half of all interracial slurs refer to real or imagined physical differences  most references to physical differences are to skin color which affirms what we have always known about the significance of color in human relations asian groups were called yellow this and that and native americans were called redskins red men and red devils2 dictionary usage labels for redskin entriesthe record includes several dictionary definitions submitted separately or within the contexts of the expert reports published during the relevant time frame of 1967 through 1990 a representative sample is set forth belowrandom house dictionary of the english language 1204 1967

redskin also redskin see red a 5c 1 a north american indian not the preferred termwe further note the earliest restrictive usage label in dictionary definitions in mr barnhart’s report dates back to 1966 from the random house unabridged first edition indicating redskin is “often offensive” from 1986 on all of the entries presented by mr barnhart include restrictive usage labels ranging from “not the preferred term” to “often disparaging and offensive”
all of the experts referenced either by testimony or in their expert reports the seminal work in lexicography dictionaries the art and craft of lexicography written by sydney i landau and first published in 1984 mr barnhart the lexicographer explained that usage labels are a “reflection of the opinion of the editor in chief … but some people that are in lexicography have been known to be less stalwart and have caved into suggestions from noneditorial sources” he explains that “unlabeled terms are standard and labeled terms are labeled for some particular character” mr barnhart explained that the “basic and longstanding practice in lexicography which deals with noteworthy ranges of usage of any given entry term is to label those instances of terms when the usage deviates from ‘standard english’” according to mr barnhart a term is generally “assumed to be ‘standard’ if it is unlabeled” however there are times when a word “is worthy of special attention a label usually in italic type is included in the entry”

mr barnhart explains that there is no standardized method in the field of lexicography regarding restrictive usage labelingthere are no agreed upon criteria for finding some usages vulgarly offensive or contemptuous or abusive there are few studies that shed any light on the degree of offensiveness of specified terms under specified conditionseach expert points to the influence of outside forces or “pressure groups” on the adoption of usage labels by dictionary editors for example dr butters testifies that sociologists historians and anthropologists applied “sociopolitical pressure” regarding the use of the term “redskin” on dictionary editors and “that any dictionary that labels redskin as a derogatory term is doing so at least indirectly as a result of at least in large part sociopolitical pressure” this phenomenon is also recognized in the reference works relied on by the experts

as part of his research mr barnhart reviewed dictionary entries for the term “redskin” between 1859 and 1992 he found no restrictive usage labels for the term “redskin” in any dictionaries prior to 1965 beginning in 1966 mr barnhart’s reviewed dictionary entries start to include usage labels indicating the term is offensive see random house unabridged 1st ed 1966 from that time on more publishers include such labels at an increasing rate by 1983 all of mr barnhart’s examples include a usage label indicating it is offensive mr barnhart’s conclusion only references labels that use the word disparagingsince 1966 the labeling of the term has been erratic at worst and inconsistent at best of the twentyeight dictionaries consulted which appeared between 1966 and 1992 ten editors reported the term as “standard english” only two dictionaries have identified the term redskin as “disparaging”however we consider the usage labels that employ the term “offensive” also to support the legal conclusion under section 2a that a term is “disparaging” therefore mr barnhart’s conclusion is based on too narrow a construction because he views the label “disparaging” as requiring intent as noted above for the purposes of our legal review intent does not figure into the equation more significantly we disagree that the labeling is erratic and inconsistent rather it shows a clear trend beginning in 1966 to label this term as offensive and by 1986 the dictionaries are unanimous

mr barnhart also found that among dictionary editors’ labels “there has been a sensitivity to how people react to that term redskin now” in his expert report mr barnhart made the following conclusion based on his evaluation of the term “redskin” as it appears in various dictionary entries during the relevant time framethe use of the term redskin in its core meaning and as recorded in dictionaries is usually recognized among lexicographers as ‘standard english’ which means that it is acceptable in both formal and informal speech or writing of educated peoplethis conclusion stands in contrast to the trend in usage labels during the relevant time period discussed above and the severe dropoff in usage discussed below it is also contradicted by his statement in the same report thatthe record of dictionary editors’ opinions as reflected in the labeling of usage for the term redskin suggests that during the latter third of this century there has developed some change in the perceived usage of the termwe further note mr barnhart is addressing usage by the general population and not from the viewpoint of native americans

in his expert report dr butters opined that “sporadic labeling of redskin as ‘offensive’ is of dubious value in assessing the tone and full meaning of redskins in past and present american culture” dr butter’s ultimate conclusion is of limited probative value in that it pertains to general “american culture” rather than to the native american viewpoint in 1996 dr butters testified as to the followingin the last 10 or 15 years one begins to see in dictionaries the—in some dictionaries the labeling of the term redskin as sometimes offensive one also begins to see in very recent years references to the use of the term redskin as a possibly offensive term so that there is this what i would say—my conclusion is a very recent incipient changethis statement recognizes the trend in usage labels during a portion of the relevant time period3 use of the term redskins in various mediathe record shows wide usage of the term in various media prior to the late sixties and very sporadic usage thereafter a few examples are set forth belowmerrit meets the enemy victory over our frontier foes thirty seven redskins sent to the happy hunting grounds the indian problem reaching a conclusion rocky mountain news october 8 1879and excited by firewater they dug up their rusty hatchets and prepared for blood and thunder ‘ugh’ said every greasy redskin …

dr nunberg reported that the database search results showed 136473 instances of “redskin” “redskins” and other words beginning with “redskin” such as “redskinnettes” with the “vast majority” involving references to the washington redskins dr nunberg then conducted a focused search filtering out terms such as “team” “sport” “redskin park” “football” “game” “fan” and “ticket” to yield results of those instances when the word “redskin” was used to refer to a native american person this search resulted in approximately 300 references although some of these still referred to the washington redskins potatoes and peaches

dr nunberg reviewed the focused search results by hand and found “71 distinct stories in which the word was used to refer to indians” according to dr nunberg none of these 71 occurrences demonstrated use of “redskin” as a standard term to refer to a native american indicating that “the word is not a ‘neutral synonym’ for indian” of those occurrences many examples use the term in the context of racial slurs or discrimination for exampleif mr liles went back in history to when the 13 colonies were being organized he would have seen that “redskin” was not used to convey respect adulation or honor

a man who resigned from the pulaski county sheriff’s office because of alleged harassment as an american indian has won 24727 in a race discrimination lawsuit    he said he was called “chief” “indian joe” and “redskin”98more significant than the relatively small number of uses as a reference to native americans and many of those in the context of racial slurs is the relative absence of use of the term to describe a person dr nunberg found it significant that this search yielded so few results showing the term “redskin” as a reference to a native americanthere were in this database over 74000 instances of the phrase ‘american indian’ or ‘american indians’ and over 73000 instances to the phrase ‘native americans’ a disproportion of about 2000 to 1 which suggests that the use of ‘redskin’ to refer to indian is extremely rare in this database which suggests some reason for avoiding the term since it is in fact a commonly used term for example in the cinema and historical sourcesrespondent objects to dr nunberg’s opinion as irrelevant because it is lacking in scientific basis however we do not rely on dr nunberg’s ultimate opinions and conclusions regarding the word “redskins” rather we look to the underlying data that is not in dispute which undeniably shows a dropoff in usage this is corroborated by respondent’s expert mr barnhart who conducted a similar electronic database search discussed infra as to the data respondent’s objection that the “uses that date from outside the pertinent time periods are irrelevant and are not reflective of native americans’ viewpoints” is overruled as noted above the search encompasses the relevant time period and is relevant in correlation to objection to use of this term by native americans

mr barnhart conducted a similar search using a nexis electronic database group file featuring major newspapers magazines and journals published between 1969 and 1996 he found that the term “redskin” or “redskins” appeared in 143920 articles at least once similar to dr nunberg’s initial search results mr barnhart reported that the results of his “redskin” database search were “overwhelming to be in the context of sports” with less than two percent of the results referring to native americans

mr barnhart would not draw any inferences about the infrequency in which the term “redskin” or “redskins” was used to refer to native americans he testified that it was not what he was asked to do and it would be a significantly greater project to determine whether there is any significance to the lack of occurrences however in his report he did in fact draw conclusions when he concluded that the term redskin “is acceptable in both formal and informal speech or writing of educated people” the conclusion he drew was that its absence from the database references somehow supports or at least does not refute his finding that the term is part of standard english and acceptable for formal and informal speech or writing such a conclusion stands in contradiction to the stark drop off in usage as shown by dr nunberg’s research and supported by mr barnhart’s own research which shows inter alia use of the term in many literary sources until 1969 where his search of the nexis database spanning the years 19691996 reveals only 2 percent of the appearances of “redskins” related to “amerindians” 96 percent referenced respondent’s team and 2 percent referenced miami university’s former team name and the addition of the usage labels in the dictionaries during the same time period mr barnhart confirms that for the last thirty years from 1967 to 1997 the date of the deposition “the overwhelming context in which the term redskins is used in general literature” is in a sports context to the extent respondent relies on this data to show that because it is printed in newspapers reporting on the professional football team by that name it is not disparaging in that context mr barnhart testified that his report is not based on native american response to the term in this context therefore we cannot rely on this data to make such a finding or to even raise doubt about other findings regarding the viewpoint of native americans

mr barnhart testifies that while the term “redskins” was not disparaging “as applied to american indian persons” in 19671985 it might have been offensive as noted above mr barnhart attaches intent of the speaker to the word disparaging and his view of offensive is more in line with the meaning of disparaging in the context of section 2a

ncai resolution

the executive council of the national congress of american indians “ncai” “the oldest and largest intertribal organization nationwide representative of and advocate for national regional and local tribal concerns” passed a resolution in 1993 entitled the “resolution in support of the petition for cancellation of the registered services marks of the washington redskins aka profootball inc” the resolution includes in pertinent part the followingncai is the oldest and largest intertribal organization nationwide representative of and advocate for national regional and local tribal concerns    
the term redskins is not and has never been one of honor or respect but instead it has always been and continues to be a pejorative derogatory denigrating offensive scandalous contemptuous disreputable disparaging and racist designation for native american’s sic and

the use of the registered service marks identified in exhibit b to this resolution by the washington redskins football organization has always been and continues to be offensive disparaging scandalous and damaging to native americansrespondent objects to the ncai resolution “as irrelevant to the extent that it dates from a time period not relevant to issues in this proceeding” respondent further asserts that the district court found it “irrelevant to the calculus” the full quote from the district court is set forth belowall of these resolutions were made after the relevant time frame with no explanation by the ttab as to how they ‘shed light’ on the relevant time period and thus are irrelevant to the calculus    and the ttab made no findings of fact about the strength of this evidenceprofootball inc v harjo 68 uspq2d at 1255

we begin by stating that there is no question as to the authenticity or identity of this document the stipulation by the parties is clear and unequivocal “all evidence admissible in harjo shall be admissible in this proceeding” and only objections as to relevance were preserved for the evidence covered under paragraph one of the stipulation the testimony by ms chase discussed infra regarding the procedures by which the ncai executive council passes its resolutions and as stated in the ncai bylaws and the other evidence of record showing ncai membership referenced infra in the findings of fact is sufficient to support the credibility reliability and trustworthiness of the resolution in addition ms chase’s testimony along with other evidence sets out the circumstances under which the resolution was passed ie that approximately 150 tribes were represented by ncai at that time and at least one third of the tribal members were present to pass the resolution

with regard to respondent’s relevancy objection any statement made after each registration issued is not a statement from the time of registration thus based on respondent’s logic even testimony taken from individuals in 19931996 ie during the harjo litigation would be statements about the witnesses’ opinions during the years 19671990 and as such would be irrelevant however the mere fact that an opinion is voiced in 1993 does not mean the opinion was not held by that group or individual in the 19671990 time period in harjo we note the opinions about views from 19671990 given by the individual plaintiffs through testimony were accepted by both the board and the district court here we have a claim that the registered marks disparaged native americans when registered we find that a resolution passed by an organization such as ncai which throughout the relevant time period represented approximately thirty percent of native americans setting forth the past and ongoing viewpoint of the native americans it represents is clearly probative of the views of native americans held at the referenced time period we accept individual testimony about views held in the past therefore we accept a group statement about views held in the past in particular here where the claim pertains to the views of a group and not individuals respondent’s objection on the basis of relevancy is overruled

deposition of joann chase
joann chase a native american became executive director of the national congress of american indians on april 1 1994 and provided testimony in 1996 about resolution 9311 respondent’s objection to ms chase’s testimony as being irrelevant because the ncai resolution dates from a time period not relevant to this proceeding is overruled her testimony relates to the ncai resolution that specifically addresses the time period with which we are concerned her testimony also provides contemporary and historical background on the organization

deposition of harold gross
in 1972 harold martin gross was the director of indian legal information development service a legislative oversight program the mission of the indian legal information development service was twofold 1 to provide career training to native americans in the fields of journalism law and public affairs in the legislative process and to provide legislative information to native american tribes through a monthly magazine the staff was comprised of native americans mr gross testified that they asked him to help them change the name of the washington redskins football team because “it was disparaging insulting and degrading to american indians” in january 1972 mr gross drafted a letter on behalf of his staff and sent it to edward bennett williams who was then partowner and president of the washington redskins football team that letter led to a march meeting with mr williams

the following people attended that meeting along with mr grossrichard lacourse a representative of the washington bureau of the american indian press associationleon cook president of the national congress of american indians ncairon aguilar district representative of the national indian youth councildennis banks district representative of the american indian movementhany geigomah assistant to the commissioner of indian affairs and the youth representative from the bureau of indian affairslaura wittstock legislative review editor of the indian legal information development service andladonna harris president of the americans for indian opportunityat the meeting the native american attendees expressed their “reasons for objecting to the name of the team and some of the trappings that went with it and to present the reasons why they thought it should be changed”

respondent objects to mr gross’ testimony and exhibits eg the letter to mr williams as irrelevant because “the organization he formerly represented comprised at most seven native american members and itself did not represent any native american tribe or organization” the objection is overruled the opinions of seven native americans expressed during the relevant time period are obviously relevant to the merits of the petition moreover we do not rely on the testimony for the viewpoint of the indian legal information development service the organization mr gross represented rather we rely on this testimony and evidence to show that ncai’s opposition to use of the word “redskins” with respondent’s services existed as early as 1972 well in advance of the 9311 resolution and during the relevant time period ncai’s president mr leon cook participated in that meeting and supported the position that respondent should cease use of the name “redskins” the “recommendations to the washington dc professional football team” from “leon f cook president national congress of american indians” et al include the followingthat the derogatory racial epithet “redskins” be withdrawn as a team nickname for the professional football team of washington dcin 1972 ncai represented approximately 30 percent of native americans an article published in the washington daily news on march 30 1972 discussing the meeting with edward bennett williams includes the following excerptafter petite’s fist shaking speech williams closed this first meeting with the american indians who claim his team nickname ‘redskins’ is a racial slur the eleven indian representatives included  leon cook president of the national congress of american indians which claims a membership of 300000 dennis j banks national chairman of the american indian movement129in addition an article published in the washington post on thursday march 30 1972 includes the followinga delegation of 11 people representing a variety of indian organizations  among the group  requesting that ‘the derogatory racial epithet ‘redskins’’ be banished from the washington sports scene were leon cook president of the national congress of american indians which claims a membership of 350000 indians according to the protesting group’s informal leader harold gross an attorney for another indian organization130harold gross testified that he worked for ncai in 1969 and would have firsthand knowledge as to the membership in that time period this evidence regarding ncai’s membership in the relevant time period as well as its participation in the 1972 meeting serves to corroborate the statement in the 9311 resolution that the term redskins as used by the washington redskins “has always been … offensive disparaging scandalous and damaging to native americans”

ncai’s decadeslong challenge to the term “redskins” is referenced in an article in the lakota times published september 16 1992the national congress of american indians has been battling against the racist use of indians as mascots for decades the battle has been uphill all the way because mainstream america does not see the term redskins as offensive – because they are not american indians … mr deloria who directed ncai in the 1960’s and spoke out on the mascot issue then  the grounds for cancellation of the federal registration include the term ‘redskin’ … is  disparagingother evidence provides information regarding ncai’s opposition to the name “redskins” for the football team and the number of native americans represented by ncai during the relevant time period the state of michigan issued a report addressing the use of indian names and mascots in october 1988 the purpose of this report was to examine the presence of native american stereotyping in michigan education institutions the commission surveyed colleges universities high schools and junior highmiddle schools in addition the commission contacted native american organizations in michigan to solicit feedback on stereotyping of native americans respondent apparently lodged several objections to this report it is included by bates numbers in the objections to documents referred to as “correspondence” however we only rely on the following reference in 1988 to ncai in this report and there is no objection to that informationthe national congress of american indians the oldest and largest national indian group in the us also supports this organization’s efforts to have the washington team’s name changedin april 1993 the miami university senate held meetings to determine whether or not to abandon their team name redskins which they ultimately did dr britton harwood made the following statementthe national congress of american indians representing approximately 150 tribal governments calls it redskin a racial slurthis number is further corroborated a june 3 1991 letter from dale pullen publisher of the us congress handbook to charlie drayton the vice president of communications for the washington redskins submitted by respondent to show native american support of the team139 in his letter mr pullen wrote the followingthe national american indian council representing 70 per cent of the

we further note that in addition to ncai the american indian movement aim was represented at the 1972 meeting aim was founded in 1968 as stated in the following letter from clyde h bellecourt national director of the aim and william a means president of international indian treaty council to jack kent cooke dated december 20 1991the american indian movement aim is the foremost advocacy organization representing and defending the spiritual cultural political and treaty rights of the indigenous indian peoples in all of north central and south america … the american indian movement which was reborn here in minneapolis minnesota in 1968 … the efforts by indian people to cleanse organized sports both within major league baseball the national football league and hockey as well high school and university athletic programs has been ongoing for years … we have received hundreds of calls and letters both national and international in support of our efforts to change these demeaning names ie washington redskins … by sports teams and athletic programsletters of protest
petitioners submitted 19 letters from individuals identifying themselves or family members as native americans from across the united states representing a geographic cross section south dakota virginia florida nebraska iowa idaho minnesota georgia illinois letters from three native american organizations one letter from the otoemissouria tribe in which they protested the use of the term “redskins” by respondent a representative sample of excerpts from individual letters is set forth belowsince you continue not to believe that the term “redskins” is not sic offensive to anyone let me make this clear the name “redskins” is very offensive to me and shows little human interest or taste i am a comanche indian from oklahoma indians are having enough trouble trying to erase misconceptions about themselves without having to be hit in the face with it every day in the form of a football team or baseball team if you think you are preserving our culture or your history then may i suggest a change to live up to your name your team would field only two men to the opponents eleven your player’s wives would be required to face the men of the opposing team after having lost every game in good faith you would be required to remain in rfk stadium’s end zone for the rest of your life living off what the other teams had left you which wouldn’t be much since you would probably find this as distasteful as 300000 indians do i would suggest a change in name in sticking to your ethnic theme i would suggest the washington niggers as a start … this would start a fantastic trend in the league we would soon be blessed with the san fransisco sic chinks new york jews dallas wetbacks houston greasers and the green bay crackers great huh mr williams these would be very offensive to many people just as redskins is offensive to myself and others you can take a stand that would show you and the team as true believers in civil rights or you can continue to carry a name that keeps alive a threatening stereotype to indian people people mr williams we don’t want the redskins
… i along with many other native americans have tried over many years to reduce the level of opprobrium and prejudice surrounding american attitutes sic toward native peoples i urge that you consider an immediate change of name for your team and that your new name reflect in no way unfavorably on any of our national or ethnic groups
… i must say that i am appalled at your jack kent cooke callous attitude and comments concerning this issue as a native american i can assure you that i find the term “redskin” offensive and derogatory i don’t mind telling you that i find the name of your team totally objectionable … i feel you’ve gotten off lightly with the concerns for this issue because the indian population is not as large or vocal as the other minorities of this country because we are not highly visible that does not mean you can count us out of the human race we deserve the right to be treated with equal respect and consideration that is entitled to any race … would you be offended if someone called you or a family member a derogatory racial nickname some of these nicknames are honkie wop kraut chink potato head and nigger when a native american is referred to as a “redskin” then you are in essence calling them a name that is just as bad as those above would you be offended by any of these names if so then please reconsider your position you people in washington take so much care not to offend the minorities in your city i don’t understand why this same care and consideration isn’t extended to other races in this country
i object to the use of “redskins” for a football team
i am an oglala sioux indian living here on the pine ridge indian reservation in south dakota i am writing this letter concerning a matter that i feel is very important i believe that the name “redskins” is very demeaning to my indian people … thank you for your kind attention to the matter
… as a member of the oneida tribe of indians of wisconsin i find the team name redskins very offensive and more of an ethnic slur which should have never been placed with the proud symbol of the team … i am a big fan of the team and it’s collection of extraordinary talent however i remain adamantly opposed to the organization sic keeping the current team name
the washington redskins must go no not the team but the name which is totally demeaning of native americans and reinforces a negative stereotype that is unjust and unwarranted the term “redskins” is out of a period when there was a bounty on the heads of indians and they were scalped eighty cents for a man’s skin 60 cents for a woman’s skin and 20 cents for a child’s skin it is a period in our history that every american should be ashamed of and the continued use of such a derogatory and offensive term is an abomination ben nighthorse campbell the only native american in the us senate says that “the name redskins carries the same negative connotation as some terms that blacks and whites find offensive the word brings to mind a negative image of uncivilized persons and has no positive meaning” therefore mr cooke despite your insistence to the contrary there is no pride or honor associated with the name the controversy is something that will not go away will not disappear until the term “redskin” is banished from our vocabulary … ps being of direct native american descent i find the name especially offensiveall but one of the letters were written at the end or just after the relevant time period but do evidence the opinion of individual native americans across the united states providing further corroboration that the viewpoint in the ncai resolution represents a crosssection of native americans we have not considered the at least letters from individuals other than native americans protesting the use of the name redskins inasmuch as our determination of the issue of disparagement concerns the views of native americans the 150 letters from nonnative americans have limited probative value while they may serve to indicate a broader consensus regarding the word which may add to the weight of the evidence we do not find it necessary to rely on this evidence

respondents evidence of support for the name
on january 16 1992 the chief of the modoc tribe of oklahoma sent the washington redskins a copy of the intertribal council comprising the miami ottawa modoc peoria and senecacayuga tribes of oklahoma “resolution supporting use of team name ‘redskins’ by the professional football team in washington dc” approving the name “as a positive image depicting native american culture and heritage”

in october 1991 the chairman of the tulalip tribes of washington stanley g jones sr sent a letter to senator john mccain thenvice chairman of the select committee on indian affairs stating that “many of us are proud that sport teams use us and our symbols to represent them    we are not offended by the washington football team being called the redskins”

the “tribal leader of the soboba band of indians located in san jacinto california” robert j salgado sent a letter to jack kent cooke in january 1992 stating that he had “been impressed by the manner in which the washington redskins have portrayed the american indian” and further stating his support for the team

the chief of the choctaw nation of oklahoma hollis e roberts sent a letter to the washington redskins communications department in january 1992 which covered the history of the choctaws and connected that history with the use of american indian names and images by sports teams chief roberts statedsports teams traditionally adopt a namesake and image which they perceive as noble and powerful the washington redskins is a team    that indian people can be proud to be identified withthe chief concluded by expressing his support “of the washington football team the ‘redskins’”

the principal chief of the seminole nation of oklahoma jerry g haney sent a letter to jack kent cooke in january 1992 expressing that the use of the “redskins” name by the washington football team is a source of pride

the vice president of the pimamaricopa indian community of salt river in scottsdale arizona merna l lewis sent a letter to ms jo walter regarding the use of the name “naperville redskins” by a high school in illinois ms lewis wrote that her native american community did not object to the naperville school using the name “redskins” so long as it was used with honor and respect

the principal chief of the eastern band of cherokee indians in north carolina jonathan l taylor also sent a letter to ms jo walter in july 1992 regarding the use of the name “naperville redskins” chief taylor wrote that the use of the name “redskins” by the school was a “great honor for all native americans”

a 1992 newspaper article reported that the mattaponi tribe did not object to the use of the name “redskins” by the washington football team the tribal chief of the mattaponi of king william county virginia webster “little eagle” custalow is quoted as saying that his tribe did not “disapprove of that name at all the only thing i’ve asked them to do is to wear the helmets proudly there’s an indian head dress on the helmet and i asked them to keep that helmet high and not rub it in the dirt”

the record also includes evidence regarding native americans using the word “redskins” in connection with their own sports teamsa sign at a navajo indian reservation school red mesa high school home of the redskins with the photograph taken in 1989 and sent by robert d kahn to jack kent cooke on november 4 1991

a tribal basketball tournamentrespondent also points out that its seventeenth draft pick in 1956 was eagle day who was part of the cherokee tribe169 day began his career with the washington redskins in 1959 as reported in this washington daily news articlewhen he arrived at training camp in july 1959 the washington daily news reported that “eagle day is an indian who has always wanted to be a redskin” quoting day as saying “i’m finally getting a chance to do what i wanted in the first place—play for the redskins”

based on our review of the record within the confines of this narrow case and taking into consideration the stipulations that all evidence deemed admissible in harjo is of record and all hearsay objections are waived to allow consideration of documents for the truth of the matter asserted we find the following facts in the two categories

findings of fact
general analysis of the wordthe word redskin on its face is and always has been a racial designationthe word redskins is a plural of the word redskinthe word redskin on its face refers to the real or imagined skin color of native americansracial slurs often refer to real or imagined physical differencesdictionary usage labels signal that a word is not part of standard vocabularybefore 1966 no dictionary in this record included a usage label for the term redskinbeginning in 1966 and continuing to 1990 usage labels in dictionaries indicating the term redskin to be offensive disparaging contemptuous or not preferred first appear and then grow in numberfrom 1983 on all dictionary entries in the barnhart report include a usage label indicating the term is offensive disparaging contemptuous or not preferredthe national congress of american indians ncai was founded in 1944the record shows that ncai began advocating against use of respondent’s name redskins in the 1960’sthe advocacy organization american indian movement aim was founded in 1968 and its effort to rid sports teams of indian names including respondent’s name redskins has been ongoing for decadesusage labels sometimes result from pressure groups trying to influence the lexicographerfrom the mid1960’s to 1996 the word ‘redskins’ has dropped out of written and most spoken language as a reference to native americansfrom at least the mid1960’s to 1996 the words ‘native american’ ‘indian’ and ‘american indian’ are used in spoken and written language to refer to native americansthe usage labels appear and the use of the word redskins disappears because it is increasingly recognized that the term is offensive and disparaging during the relevant time period as native americans raise awareness about the offensive nature of the term redskins

native american objection to use of the word redskins for football teamssince 1994 jo ann chase has been the executive director of the ncaithe membership of the ncai consists of native american tribes and individualsmember tribes through resolution designate a delegate for the purpose of representing them in ncai and voting on ncai resolutionsthe executive council of ncai consists of the official representative delegates of the member tribes of the organizationthe executive council is the decisionmaking entity for the organizationthe member tribes vote on resolutions by voice vote which are usually unanimousthe quorum for the executive council is one third of the member tribes of the organizationthe delegates attending the executive council vote on behalf of the tribesresolutions are read out before the membership prior to the voteresolutions are the policy of the ncaiin 1996 206 tribes were ncai membersapproximately 150 tribes were members in 1993on january 1819 1993 ncai passed resolution 9311 which reads in pertinent partncai is the oldest and largest intertribal organization nationwide representative of and advocate for national
regional and local tribal concerns …
the term redskins is not and has never been one of honor or respect but instead it has always been and continues to be a pejorative derogatory denigrating offensive scandalous contemptuous disreputable disparaging and racist designation for native american’s sic and
the use of the registered service marks identified in exhibit b to this resolution by the washington redskins football organization has always been and continues to be offensive disparaging scandalous and damaging to native americansthis resolution represents the view of the member tribes that the word redskins has always been disparaging as used for the name of a football team this includes 19671990the president of ncai is elected by the membershipin 1972 the president of ncai as a representative of ncai met with edward bennett williams then owner of the team requesting that the team cease use of the name redskins because it is disparagingin 1972 the president of ncai along with others requested that “the derogatory racial epithet “redskins” be withdrawn as a team nickname… ”in 1972 ncai represented approximately 300000 native americans out of approximately 792730ncai has been in existence since 1944 and between 1972 and 1993 a span of twenty years the record shows that ncai has represented approximately one third of native americans it is reasonable to infer that ncai represented approximately one third of native americans merely five years earlier in 1967ncai objected to respondent’s use of the word redskins in the late 1960’sncai objected to respondent’s use of the word redskins in 1972ncai objected to respondent’s use of the word redskins in 1988ncai objected to respondent’s use of the word redskins in 1992ncai objected to respondent’s use of the word redskins in 1993conclusions
as noted above as was found in the harjo case both by the board and the district court and conceded by respondent “the meaning of the matter in question” retains the core meaning native american when used as the name of respondent’s sports team more specifically the term “redskins” as used by respondent in its registered marks when used in connection with professional football retains the “likely meaning” native americans much of respondent’s evidence is directed to the first part of the test respondent’s argument regarding “secondary meaning” in the sense that it has “a secondary or alternate meaning” denoting a football team is not persuasive in that the “secondary meaning” has not stripped the word “redskins” of its “ethnic” meaning see squaw valley at 1282 emphasis added squaw valley ski resort meaning of squaw is “likely meaning” “rather than the meaning of native american woman or wife”

we turn then to the second question “was the meaning one that may have disparaged” a substantial composite which need not be a majority of native americans at the times of the registrations the crux of this case is whether or not this record supports petitioners’ contention that the answer to that question is yes respondent contends that it does not and characterizes the record as at most showing a handful of individuals the harjo petitioners the current petitioners the letter writers a few individuals from various organizations who have their own individual opinion such a characterization however ignores and is contradicted by the substantial evidence of record

ncai resolution 9311 represents the views of a substantial composite of native americans ncai consists of member tribes from across the united states and they voice their collective opinion through the executive council by resolutions a resolution from the oldest native american organization composed of tribes from across the united states and structured in a manner to represent the collective opinion of its membership through resolutions is strong evidence of the views of native americans the ncai members throughout the relevant time period represent approximately 30 percent of native americans

the statement about native americans’ past views of the word redskins in the 1993 resolution is corroborated by the meeting held with the former owner edward bennett williams in 1972 at the meeting the president of ncai at the time mr leon cook represented that native americans find the term redskins to be a racial slur respondent characterizes mr cook’s views as solely his own and opines that he merely represented himself at this meeting the president of ncai is elected by the membership to represent them it is unreasonable and illogical to characterize the views regarding something of importance to the members of an organization as only belonging to that individual president where he is attending in his capacity as the president of that organization it is equally unreasonable and illogical to reduce mr cook’s representative capacity in such a manner his attendance at this meeting was not surprisingly referenced as representing an indian organization both by the press and by mr williams himself

the trend in dictionary usage labels also corroborates the time frame of objections from native americans starting in the late sixties and continuing through the nineties as lexicographers begin and finally uniformly label the term as “offensive” or “disparaging” the recognition that this racial designation based on skin color is disparaging to native americans is also demonstrated by the near complete dropoff in usage of “redskins” as a reference to native americans beginning in the 1960’s

the record establishes that at a minimum approximately thirty percent of native americans found the term redskins used in connection with respondent’s services to be disparaging at all times including 1967 1972 1974 1978 and 1990 section 2a prohibits registration of matter that disparages a substantial composite which need not be a majority of the referenced group thirty percent is without doubt a substantial composite to determine otherwise means it is acceptable to subject to disparagement 1 out of every 3 individuals or as in this case approximately 626095 out of 1878285 in 1990 there is nothing in the trademark act which expressly prohibits registration of disparaging terms or in its legislative history to permit that level of disparagement of a group and therefore we find this showing of thirty percent to be more than substantial

respondent has introduced evidence that some in the native american community do not find the term “redskin” disparaging when it is used in connection with professional football while this may reveal differing opinions within the community it does not negate the opinions of those who find it disparaging the ultimate decision is based on whether the evidence shows that a substantial composite of the native american population found the term “redskins” to be disparaging when the respective registrations issued heeb media llc 89 uspq2d at 1077 therefore once a substantial composite has been found the mere existence of differing opinions cannot change the conclusion

in view of the above petitioners have shown by a preponderance of the evidence that a substantial composite of native americans found the term redskins to be disparaging in connection with respondent’s services during the relevant time frame of 19671990 accordingly the six registrations must be cancelled as required under sections 2a and 143 of the trademark act

laches defense
in harjo v pro football inc 30 uspq2d 1828 the board held that respondent’s laches defense was not applicable because there was a public policy interest at stake rather than just the petitioners’ personal interestthere exists a broader interest – an interest beyond the personal interest being asserted by the present petitioners – in preventing a party from receiving the benefits of registration where a trial might show that respondent’s marks hold a substantial segment of society up to public ridicule and we will not deny petitioner the right to attempt to make their case by allowing
respondent’s equitable defenses lachesid at 1831

on appeal however the us district court for the district of columbia reversed the board and held that the trademark act does not unequivocally bar respondent’s laches defense and permitted respondent to assert laches as an affirmative defense profootball inc v harjo 57 uspq2d at 1145 aff’d 75 uspq2d at 1527 nevertheless the district court noted that the applicability of laches “is dependent upon the equities of the factual scenarios within which it is raised” 57 uspq2d at 1145 in the order issued in this case on may 31 2011 the board stated that “because … this cancellation proceeding is essentially a relitigation of what transpired in the harjo case before the board we will follow the precedent of the dc circuit court of appeals in profootball inc v harjo 75 that petitioners maintain that laches does not provide a defense to a disparagement claim this issue is preserved for appeal”

the america invents act enacted in september 2011 changed the venue for appeals to district court from uspto inter partes proceedings to the us district court for the eastern district of virginia from the us district court of the district of columbia see pub l no 11229 § 9a 125 stat 284 2011 to be codified at 15 usc § 1071b4 accordingly subsequent judicial review of this dispute if any will occur either in the us district court for the eastern district of virginia in the fourth circuit or in the court of appeals for the federal circuit but not in the dc circuit in view thereof petitioners filed a motion to reconsider the legal standard for laches in light of the america invents act

although the board earlier ordered that “any motion or brief including a reargument of a previously decided issue in this proceeding will be deemed to be a nonconforming brief and will be given no consideration” and specified that the decision in the may 31 2011 order regarding laches was a final decision on the applicability of the defense we find that the passage of the america invents act sufficiently changes the circumstances in this case so as to justify revisiting the issue

we hold that laches does not apply to a disparagement claim where the disparagement pertains to a group of which the individual plaintiff or plaintiffs simply comprise one or more members first laches is an equitable defense ac aukerman co v r l chaides constr co 960 f2d 1020 22 uspq2d 1321 1328 fed cir 1992 en banc it is difficult to justify a balancing of equities where a registrant’s financial interest is weighed against human dignity to apply laches to this type of claim contemplates the retention on the register of a mark determined by the board to be a racial slur in blatant violation of the trademark act’s prohibition against registration of such matter merely because an individual plaintiff “unreasonably delayed” in filing a petition to cancel for example if reg no 217067 renewed in 1946 for twenty years ie until 1966 for the mark nigger baby brand for oranges and grapefruit were still active individual members of the group referenced by such matter would be barred from seeking cancellation if they “unreasonably delayed” in seeking such relief we add that the decision of the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit even though it countenanced application of laches in the harjo decision actually provides support for not applying the doctrine in cases such as this if plaintiffs are created every day as individual members of the referenced group mature to age 18 the laches defense will never yield the registrant of a racial slur the repose it seeks

second courts and the board have routinely held that where there is a broader public policy concern at issue the equitable defense of laches does not apply see ultrawhite co v johnson chem indus inc 465 f2d 891 175 uspq 166 167 ccpa 1972 public interest in preventing likelihood of confusion prevails over a laches defense linville v rivard 41 uspq2d 1731 1733 n 5 ttab 1997 aff’d on other grounds 133 f3d 1446 45 uspq 1374 fed cir 1998 laches is unavailable against abandonment bausch  lomb inc v leupold  stevens inc 1 uspq2d 1497 1499 ttab 1986 laches is not available against a claim of descriptiveness or fraud int’l assn of fire chiefs inc v h marvin ginn corp 225 uspq 940 947 ttab 1985 rev’d on other grounds 782 f2d 987 228 uspq 528 fed cir 1986 laches is not available where the petition to cancel is based on genericness of the registered matter because it would frustrate section 14c of the trademark act that a registered mark may be cancelled at any time on the ground that it is generic wd byron  sons inc v stein bros mfg co  146 uspq 313 316 ttab 1965 aff’d 377 f2d 1001 153 uspq 749 ccpa 1967 “laches is not available to a defendant in a proceeding wherein as here the adverse party is claiming in essence that the mark in question inherently cannot function as a trademark” because “it is within the public interest to have registrations which are void ab initio stricken from the register and this interest or concern cannot be waived by the inaction of a single person or concern no matter how long the delay persists” midwest plastic fabricators inc v underwriters laboratories inc 5 uspq2d 1067 1069 ttab 1987 laches does not apply against a claim that respondent does not control the use of a certification mark because of the public interest in making sure that certification marks are properly controlled compare bridgestonefirestone research inc v auto club 245 f3d 1359 58 uspq2d 1460 146364 fed cir 2001 laches may be an affirmative defense against a section 2a false suggestion of a connection claim because it is designed to protect a single person or institution from exploitation of their persona not to protect the public or a broader group

in this case it cannot be disputed that there exists a broader public interest than that of the individual petitioners in preventing respondent from receiving the benefits of registration because respondent’s marks may have disparaged a substantial composite of native americans at the time the fact that this claim falls within the category of claims that pertain to a broader public interest is made clear by the elements of the claim that plaintiffs must prove ie that a substantial composite of the referenced group find the term to be disparaging thus there is an overriding public interest in removing from the register marks that are disparaging to a segment of the population beyond the individual petitioners

while the fourth circuit has not addressed whether laches applies to a claim that a term disparages a substantial composite of an ethnic or cultural group the decisions of the fourth circuit prohibiting laches when confusion is inevitable suggest that the fourth circuit would prohibit the affirmative defense of laches in this case see sara lee corp v kayserroth corp 81 f3d 455 38 uspq2d 1449 1453 4th cir 1996 “in consideration of the public interest estoppel by laches may not be invoked to deny injunctive relief if it is apparent that the infringing use is likely to cause confusion” in sara lee the fourth circuit reversed the lower district court because “the court did not consider the public interest in avoiding confusion” id see lyons p’ship lp v morris costumes inc 243 f3d 789 58 uspq2d 1102 1108 4th cir 2001 resorts of pinehurst inc v pinehurst nat’l corp 148 f3d 417 47 uspq2d 1465 1469 4th cir 1998 “strong proof of likelihood of confusion—indeed actual confusion—trumps the defenses of laches and acquiescence”

however if it was held in any appeal from this decision that the doctrine were to apply to prevail on its laches defense respondent must prove that there was undue or unreasonable delay by each of the petitioners in filing the petition for cancellation and prejudice to respondent resulting from the delay bridgestonefirestone v auto club 58 uspq2d at 1462 see also ac aukerman co 22 uspq2d at 1328 there are two elements to laches i unreasonable and inexcusable delay and ii prejudice or injury to the defendant the application of laches depends on a balancing of the length of the delay and the seriousness of the prejudice with a focus on the reasonableness of the delay id at 1329

on this record we find that respondent has not shown 1 that any one of the plaintiffs has unreasonably delayed in bringing the petition to cancel in view of the pending harjo litigation because the pendency of that case in court excused inaction 2 that the 11 and 15 month delays by plaintiffs tsotigh and pappan were inexcusable or unreasonable or 3 that is has been prejudiced ie that there has been economic prejudice due to the delay

notwithstanding the pending harjo litigation pappan and tsotigh were young adults and were entitled to assess the situation and determine whether it was in their best interest to file the petition for cancellation and then act in accordance with that assessment respondent has shown nothing more than a minimal delay in seeking cancellation in this regard respondent has not cited nor have we found any cases supporting such a minimal delay as being sufficient to support laches see piper aircraft corp v wagaero inc 741 f2d 925 223 uspq 202 207 7th cir 1984 “we note that two years has rarely if ever been held to be a delay of sufficient length to establish laches”

as of 1999 when the board issued its decision in harjo to cancel the registrations the status of those registrations was in question up until at least the district court’s decision on remand in 2008 throughout this time as the record demonstrates respondent continued to invest and build its brand respondent’s evidence of purported economic prejudice covers the alleged delay period 200020067 which is concurrent with the pending harjo litigation thus it is impossible to distinguish the possible monetary or investment loss that might have accompanied ultimately losing the harjo case from losses that might be incurred as a result of ultimately losing the subsequent blackhorse case filed during the pendency of the harjo litigation clearly respondent was not deterred by harjo from investing in its brand and an adverse decision in the present litigation would not have prevented respondent’s loss of monetary investments had the current plaintiffs brought their suit earlier inasmuch as it still would of necessity have been after harjo began in order for them to reach the age of majority while specific evidence of reliance is not required to show prejudice there must be some nexus between a delay in filing the suit and the expenditures ac aukerman co v r l chaides construction co 22 uspq2d at 1329 there is nothing in the record to indicate that respondent’s business decisions regarding investment in its brand and marks has been influenced in any way by the pendency of this cancellation proceeding

in view of the above respondent’s invocation of the laches defense failsembed"
