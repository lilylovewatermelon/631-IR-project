theres only two types of people in the world
the ones that entertain and the ones that observe
well baby im a putonashow kinda girl
dont like the backseat gotta be first oh oh

im like the ringleader i call the shots call the shots
im like a firecracker i make it hot
when i put on a show

prechorus britney spears

im like a performer the dance floor is my stage
