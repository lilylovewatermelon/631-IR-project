yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

verse 1 lil baby
fresh like the first day of school on the weekend
i put this shit on today for no reason
got somethin to smile about i fixed up my teeth
straight from the lot call up herm get it geeked up
thousand horse power my car gotta keep up
act like im slow all the time but i peep stuff
what kinda guy let a bitch keep the beef up
i let em live for a while now the lease up
nail in the hammer i done built it from the ground up
brodie say he workin but the bricks them went down somethin
they handle the business i do not go around them
you can get a hundred if you want to we got pound spots
im the one thats really havin motion what they talkin bout
cars i done did that chains dont need no more
so many clothes startin to feel like a hobo
every milestone tryna buy me a new home
potholes keep on fuckin up the forgis take the rims off
the way she twist and suck it like she tryna take the skin off
bronem in a striker but it’s good we swapped the vins out
dont bark up this tree i make the chopper knock his limb off
thousand dollars after every road that’s what they hittin for
all i do is fuck her i done turned her to a nympho
fns blackouts gen5s gen4s
trippin for the family i don’t play about my kin folk

i took the guys to la for a business meetin
god watch my friends i can handle my enemies
fuck i look like havin smoke with my minimes
niggas gotta be jokin you kiddin me
yall real kids been smalltime ballin now its real big
i was standin in the bleachers on some cheerin shit
never been a hater i dont care enough
this shit aint gon stop until they bury us

verse 2 young thug
fresh off the jet i end up in the projects
see somethin i like no police ima cop it
don’t follow my page i post racks every day
for these niggas and bitches thats countin my pockets
ooh hurdle this bitch in huaraches
lambo ferrari bentleys i got options
i took the private jet out to nevada
4pf ced they got smoked like a rasta
trenches with me
somethin seem suspicious somethin seemin fishy
im four pockets full and look like biscuits
overprice us and we uppin uppin
fire fire fire fire that sound sound delicious
you cant use the dishes in the kitchen cookin
woo woo litty cant abort the mission bitch i got addictions
i dont do photo pictures keep it low and with me yee
chorus lil baby
i took the guys to la for a business meetin
god watch my friends i can handle my enemies
fuck i look like havin smoke with my minimes
niggas gotta be jokin you kiddin me
yall real kids been smalltime ballin now its real big
i was standin in the bleachers on some cheerin shit
never been a hater i dont care enough
this shit aint gon stop until they bury us2embed"
