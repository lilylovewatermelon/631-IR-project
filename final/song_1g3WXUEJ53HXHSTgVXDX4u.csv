i can’t fall for you can’t give my all to you
can’t let you think that ima let the game stall for you
gotta protect me you gotta sweat me
you said you thought you was ready and i said let’s see

cause what happens if i fall in love then you cut me loose
you just a heartbreaker won’t let you break mine
cause i’ll be smashin windows and cuttin them brake lines
