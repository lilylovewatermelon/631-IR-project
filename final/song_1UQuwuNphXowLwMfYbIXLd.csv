verse 1 yung carecrow
poppin em down with codeine in my cup
bitch im rollin the rillo and burnin the ounce
creep through the ground i dont hear a sound
burying bodies all over the town
the satanic killer the gripper of triggers that haunts all the rivers
the blood is my liquor
triple six marked on my grave
cynical 59 death we crave
sharpening the blade so the wrist can be shaved
enslaved to the minds of the fucking new wave
creep in the alley the valley of death
deep in the city of choppers and tecs
im deaf to the screams of the innocent fuck all the citizens
the fucking militant of the infinite punishment
i need a stimulant give me the coke im sniffing it
articulate my ignorance
carecrow walking round without his ligaments
see uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likechorus triggerman
drag him from the river throw him back in bugs yard
drag him from the river throw him back in bugs yard
drag him from the river throw him back in bugs yard
drag him from the river throw him back in bugs yard

verse 2 ruby da cherry
often i find myself staring into space
bitch im coughing i might as well air out the place
it is foggy my enemies taunt me
i am the worst version of myself no calling for help
angel of death please spread your wings
pacing myself before she takes me away
blood stains painted on the door frame
floor made of bones im collecting and im storing
all of my sins are burned in my mind
memory fading but i still remember the scythe
body separated from my soul
how it goes when youre always alone
no bitch no hoe solo no phone no home
just a grave that i dug with a blanket of bugs
bitch im naked full of drugs
fully faded pull the plug bitch i made it with a shrug
im aware that i dont give a fuck hoe37embed"
