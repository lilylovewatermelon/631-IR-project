verse 1 charles lee ray
turn this bitch into virginia tech ayy
got the chopper just to make em wet ayy
dynamite around my vest ayy
we them g59 terrorists ayy ayy
keep throwin threats and ill keep yawning
light my cigarette you just keep on talking
watch where you tread please watch where you walking
im from vietnam better known as new orleans
the smell of death is so so familiar
im that silhouette that all black figure
gravedigger grey killer lil cut throat
drag em to the river watch his fucking body float

bridge lana del rey

verse 2 raindrop walka
two empty pill bottles im fucking duckin
i cant call my plug no more oh no—but ill prolly say fuck it
oh how i love it really it aint for discussion
but the truth aint that far from it
i keep on buggin like fuck it ima say it
like fuck it ima fuck up
like fuck it im a fuck up and its fucked up
its just my dumb luck its just my dumb luck
youll never put me down more than i have
youd have been down and its more than i have
fake fucking smile with the knife in my back
fake fucking child bitch thats just how you act
