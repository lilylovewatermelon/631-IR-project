tell me how you feel tell me how you feel
i feel like the grass is green
and everything i do is unseen
but i know that’s just in my mind
i know everything is just in my mind
do you really wanna be famous
do you really wanna be a superstar
do you really wanna get dangerous
do you even know where the groupies are
bitches out here be shameless
and i really wonder where they parents are
look around everything changes
it feels like i been buried alive

verse 1
everything happens for a reason
happens for a reason
people only in your life for seasons

you could make it work but that still aint driven
give a lot but that still aint givin
