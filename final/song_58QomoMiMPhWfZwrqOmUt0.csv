desperado why dont you come to your senses
you been out riding fences for so long now
oh youre a hard one
but i know that youve got your reasons
these things that are pleasing you
can hurt you somehow

chorus 1
dont you draw the queen of diamonds boy
shell beat you if shes able
know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
now it seems to me some fine things
have been laid upon your table
but you only want the things that you cant get

verse 2
desperado oh you arent getting any younger
your pain and your hunger theyre driving you home
and freedom oh freedom
well thats just some people talking
your prison is walking
through this world all alone

chorus 2
and dont your feet get cold in the winter time
the sky wont snow the sun wont shine
its hard to tell the night time from the day
youre losing all your highs and lows
isnt it funny how the feeling
goes away
you might also likeverse 3
desperado why dont you come to your senses
come down from your fences and open the gate
it may be raining but theres a rainbow above you
you better let somebody love you
you better let somebody love you
you better let somebody love you
before its too late3embed"
