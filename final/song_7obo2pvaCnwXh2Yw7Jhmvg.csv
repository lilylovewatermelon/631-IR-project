verse 1
all this time weve been wastin baby
and youve been playin baby

so how bout you tell me what you wanna do
so i can give you all you want
if you just say it so say it baby

chorus
i can understand if youre not ready
if you need me to be patient
then im cool with waitin

verse 2
girl forgive me if i come across too forward baby
and if i offended you in any way baby

cuz being closer makes it better
when i get to know you baby

keep leadin me on and you keep pushin me away
when all along i know yes i do
