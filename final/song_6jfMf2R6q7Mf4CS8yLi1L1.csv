in the beginning i tried to warn you
you play with fire its going to burn you
and here we are now the same situation
you never listen i never listen

verse 1
now i am thinking of a way that i can make an escape
its got me caught up in a web and my hearts the prey
do you really want to throw your heart away away away

chorus
everybodys hurt somebody before
everybodys been wound by somebody before
you can change but youll always come back for more
its a game and we are all just victims of love

postchorus
dont try to fight it victims of love
you cant decide it victims of love
oh oh oh oh oh victims of love
oh oh oh oh oh

now youve back tracked
youre running away cause it just happened again and you just want it to end
trying your best to not let yourself go cold so cold
now you think about the things you thought you wanted to say
but when you open up your mouth it dont come out that way
are you really going to throw your heart away away away

chorus
everybodys hurt somebody before
everybodys been wound by somebody before
you can change but youll always come back for more
its a game and we are all just victims of love

postchorus
dont try to fight it victims of love
you cant decide it victims of love
oh oh oh oh oh victims of love
oh oh oh oh oh victims of love
