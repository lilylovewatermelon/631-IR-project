jackknife brake at the traffic stop
interstate looking like a parking lot
fat boy flying on a fat boy bike
weaving in and out and passing me by

bridge
i honked my horn and shot the bird at that crazy sob
yeah but deep down i was wishing it was me

chorus
but if i had one id have to say
id probably do the same dang thing
pull her to the shoulder and let that steel horse run
id be hell on wheels if i had one

verse 2
called my brother said how youve been
we aint been fishing since i dont know when
he said this graveyard shifts a graveyard grind
i got more bills than i got time

bridge
id love to weigh the line but my wife just stay on my case
i said i guess i know who wears the pants around your place
you might also likechorus
but if i had one id have to say
id probably do the same dang thing
pull her to the shoulder and let that steel horse run
id be hell on wheels if i had one

verse 3
sitting on a bar stool talking to a lady
shes running my tab up calling me baby
buy her a drink shell let you chase her
and watch her shake her money maker

verse 4
boy if i had one id have to say
id probably shake it the same damn way
hike it up high cause i could get it son
id never buy another beer if i had one
you know things would be different if i had one

verse 5
thats what id do if i had one of those
id do it just like that right there
things would be different if i had one too
but i dont but if i had one yeah buddy ooh buddyembed"
