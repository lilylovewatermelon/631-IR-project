indie cindy  the lofi lullabies
released her first lp
entitled moe is we
to the private public just the other day
through cindys very own label
acrobat unstable records

verse 2
but the only chart
that it even scratched
was in cindys heart
which would fall apart
cause it was barely attached
to anything other than
broken synthesizer keys
cassette tapes and burned cds

verse 3
indie cindy  the lofi lullabies
aint gettin very big
in fact her only gig
was pathetic even though she dreamed it up
in fact it was a nightmare
the sound just wasnt right there
bridge
and when she woke up
and when she woke up
that was when
indie cindy broke up
indie cindy broke up
she broke up
not for artistic differences
she just tore her studio down
threw her equipment around
in cyclonic displacement
til it looked like her basement again
