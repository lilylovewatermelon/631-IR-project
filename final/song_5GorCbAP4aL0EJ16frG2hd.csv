i walk a lonely road
the only one that i have ever known
dont know where it goes
but its home to me and i walk alone
i walk this empty street
on the boulevard of broken dreams
where the city sleeps
and im the only one and i walk alone

prechorus
i walk alone i walk alone
i walk alone i walk a—

chorus
my shadows the only one that walks beside me
my shallow hearts the only thing thats beatin
sometimes i wish someone out there will find me
til then i walk alone

postchorus
ahah ahah ahah ahah

verse 2
im walkin down the line
that divides me somewhere in my mind
on the borderline
of the edge and where i walk alone
read between the lines
whats fucked up and everythings all right
check my vital signs
to know im still alive and i walk alone
