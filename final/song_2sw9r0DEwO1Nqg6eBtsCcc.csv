i left my love at your place today uh
were too young for these incidents
wore my heart on my sleeve too long
goin through heartbreak wont be too long

and i dont know if i can handle it anymore oh no

im watchin from a distance
i dont want her to pass me by
look up its a full moon outside
theres things we both cant deny
leavin my love at your place today
so wrapped up tryna break away
kisses and hugs they just fade away
its the time we do our own thing
leavin my love at your place today
finding the feelings you chased away
realizin this couldve been the last
well if you are bound to stay yeah
