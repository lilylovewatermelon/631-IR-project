aw baby how you doin
you know im gonna cut right to the chase huh
some women were made but me myself
i like to think that i was created for a special purpose
and uh whats more special than you
you feel me

verse 1
its on baby lets get lost
you dont need to call in to work cause youre the boss
for real want you to show me how you feel
i consider myself lucky thats a big deal
why well you got the key to my heart
but you aint gonna need it id rather you open up my body
and show me secrets you didnt know was inside
no need for me to lie

he talk like this cause he can back it up

such a huge ego
i love his big ego its too much
he walk like this cause he can back it up haha

or maybe my eyes boy you a sight to see
