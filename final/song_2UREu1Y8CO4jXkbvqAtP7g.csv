the secret side of me
i never let you see
i keep it caged but i cant control it
so stay away from me
the beast is ugly
i feel the rage and i just cant hold it
its scratching on the walls
in the closet in the halls
it comes awake and i cant control it
hiding under the bed
in my body in my head
why wont somebody come and save me from this
make it end

chorus
i feel it deep within
its just beneath the skin
i must confess that i feel like a monster
i hate what ive become
the nightmares just begun
i must confess that i feel like a monster
i i feel like a monster
i i feel like a monster

verse 2
my secret side i keep
hid under lock and key
i keep it caged but i cant control it
cause if i let him out
hell tear me up break me down
why wont somebody come and save me from this
make it end

i feel it deep within
its just beneath the skin
i must confess that i feel like a monster
i hate what ive become
the nightmares just begun
i must confess that i feel like a monster
i feel it deep within
its just beneath the skin
i must confess that i feel like a monster
i i feel like a monster
i i feel like a monster

bridge
its hiding in the dark
its teeth are razorsharp
theres no escape for me it wants my soul it wants my heart
no one can hear me scream
maybe its just a dream
maybe its inside of me
stop this monster
i feel it deep within its just beneath the skin
i must confess that i feel like a monster

chorus
i hate what ive become
the nightmares just begun
i must confess that i feel like a monster
i feel it deep within
its just beneath the skin
i must confess that i feel like a monster
i’m gonna lose control
it’s something radical
i must confess that i feel like a monster
i i feel like a monster
i i feel like a monster
i i feel like a monster
i i feel like a monster71embed"
