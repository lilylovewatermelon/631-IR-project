verse 1 rick ross
i go to the grave before i be a bitch nigga
better behave you dealing with some rich niggas
we the lost symbols speak in cryptic codes
ancient wisdom valuable like gifts of gold
i embark on life my path is all math
i understand the codes these hackers can’t crack
i understand that folks expect me to fold
community control to violate parole no
i wont fail but a lot of men will
i’m iconic in the field like solomons seal woo
ugh it’s just the intro
allow my flow time to sink into the tempo
free mason what freelancer yeah

verse 2 jayz
niggas couldn’t do nothing with me they put the devil on me
id have preferred niggas to squeeze the metal on me
rumors of lucifer i don’t know who to trust
whole world want my demise—turn the music up
hear me clearly if y’all niggas fear me just say yall fear me
fuck all these fairytales
go to hell this is god engineering
this is a hail mary pass y’all interfering
he without sin shall cast the first stone
so yall look in the mirror doublecheck your appearance
bitch i said i was amazing
not that im a mason
it’s amazing that i made it through the maze that i was in
lord forgive me i never wouldve made it without sin
holy water my face in the basin
diamonds in my rosary shows he forgave him
bitch im redhot
im on my third six but a devil im not
my jesuspiece flooded
but thou shall not covet—keep your eyes off my cupboard
im a bad motherfucker its hov just say you love it
