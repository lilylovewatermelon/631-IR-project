all my life ive been searchin
all my life ive been uncertain
ive been abandoned and left alone
at fifteen i had to leave home
the black sheep the bad seed

prechorus
at a roadside bar in tennessee
i met an angel to rescue me
she rescued me

chorus
she wore blue jeans and a rosary
believed in god and believed in me
and all her friends think shes a little crazy
she wears a smile heart on her sleeve
i dont give a damn what the world thinks of me
she tells me its all good
shes happy with a bad seed
happy to be misunderstood

verse 2
two packs and a pint a day to hide the shame
and wash away the pain all the pain
every road was a deadend street
runnin from the law and running on empty
you couldnt shake the marks that were left on me
