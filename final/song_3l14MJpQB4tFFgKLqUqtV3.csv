3l14MJpQB4tFFgKLqUqtV3,The District Sleeps Alone Tonight - Remastered,The Postal Service,5MoaDbFw4nrm2P7Om1on3b,"4 contributorsthe history of the scp foundation lyricsway back in 07 x was an interesting place bursting with new ways to keep you up at night stuff like the oldish creepypastas were actually creepy instead of being something that made you wonder how it ever spooked anybody in the summer of that year what was intended as a oneoff creepypasta became something explosive scp173 the statue

it all started with scp173 it was a random oneoff creepypasta but it inspired a lot of people before long other entries started popping up and then one day someone made a wiki for it so they wouldnt all 404 eventually this was when x was still youngish and the holders ted the caver treedog and other oldschool x rubbish was still very new and decent drgears

the initial appearance of scp173 was something really different to the x community instead of being a basic story with a jump scare punchline or a thing that made you feel squicked and scared it was designed to make you wonder and draw fear from that you can imagine the reaction of many internet dwellers as they first scrolled down to see that thread

it was popular the original thread stuck around for a couple days as many people marveled at the creepiness of the writing and the implication that there were more things just like it somewhere else but as some were thinking of what could be out there others wanted to know how they could get their piece of the scp pie they became the very first entries to what was then known as the scp series its also when we got a few of our oldest and earliest shapers of the community such as drgears a fat ghost kain pathos crow fritzwillie and bijhan

with these writers we also got some of the oldest and most lovedor hated entries to the scp series able is pretty much the first you think of when it comes to this category he was a creation of kain but when he was first created he didnt look how he did today rather he was closer to being the guy what fights good many people now decry him as the concept of mobile task force omega7 was in full swing and the concept of using anomalous objects for the foundations benefit was the rule rather than the exception

drgears wrote many of his current 42 articles in the old x days some like the nowdeleted scp031 parasites generation did not last however quite a few gems have survived to this time scp682 was made in its original form ready to gnash and destroy all it could but it too has been significantly revised over time originally it didnt have the interview log and had a weaker description it received its change from an anonymous writer on the editthis wiki the dr gears character also came from this time from a prototype tale the tale in question was a note reprimanding some researcher for crosstesting two different scps which resulted in the creation of scp682 when it was posted to x it brought criticism for being far too emotional and unscientific as such drgears reshaped the character as a man who has no emotion deeply traumatized by the goingsons of the foundation

although many users embraced the scp series and used the idea well some were unsatisfied with the limits of merely posting in forum threads in addition many denizens of b and x were beginning to grow weary of repeated threads being created so on january 19th 2008 the scp series wiki was created on the editthis wikifarm most of the entries that were moved to the editthis wiki were the original works of the users on x and b with the creation of the scp series wiki the community began to post fewer and fewer threads on 4chan instead writing directly to the wiki as such x and b ceased to be the primary medium of these works with the threads slowly fading away

the scp wiki got its start on editthis a wikipedia clone it was unpolished a little bit sloppy and in retrospect probably not a great place to start out the entries were displayed on a big list similar to the one we have communication between different members of the community was difficult to accomplish since the discussion page as we know it did not exist and the pages where we could communicate were primitive this junction is also where we gained other influential members such as bright and eberstrom its still possible to see some of the old comments by using the wayback machine on editthis

eberstrom was definitely one of the most influential members of the old wiki yet has been buried in the dustbin of history looking through many of his posts on the old discussion pages it is obvious he was very influential and was well known by drgears kain and fritzwillie his 001 proposal was one of the first on the site and the oldest one to survive from editthisin arc form

the entries on editthis grew from less than 200 to many hundreds over the course of a couple months the scp001 proposals did not exist as the number 001 was initially held in abeyance with the label reserved until someone makes an entry worthy of scp001 several scp001 proposals were eventually created eberstroms proposalsite19 catalysts proposalalso site19 drgears proposalthe prototype jonathan balls proposalthe sheaf of papers and taisaijins proposala lost god only drgears and balls proposals still exist with eberstroms having been arcd and the rest deleted

joke articles date back from the editthis wiki where they consisted primarily of pop culture references and the like we had stuff from various books movies and comics with an entire series of objects based on the portal series when the wiki was ported to wikidot there was some discussion about deleting the joke entries altogether since at the time they occupied normal scp number slots they were eventually moved to their current section with the popculture entries purged during the mass edit

additional influential entries were made during this time exclusively on editthis josie the half cat was one of the first major entries to be posted on editthis and was popular enough that the first scp logo was based on her appearance you can see it here drgears also wrote a significant number of articles posting entry after entry to the scp series main page many of the broken god and mcd stuff as well as his classic articles1 were written at this time

it was during the editthis days that the scientific rigor we hold all articles to began to take shape prior to this many authors casually disregarded basic science and mathematics in order to make their entries as time went on and more additions were made to the series people began to make more and more unscientific articles people got sick of it and on march 23rd 2008 a user named aiden made this post on the scp series discussion
would anyone really object to me going through these over the course of the next week or two and truncating the overly precise measurements there are quite a few scps that say stuff like approximately 5723545445 cm theres no need to go down to nanometers when youre writing an executive summary it could probably even be reduced to a single significant digit in most cases ill probably round it off to tenths or hundredths of a unit if not whole units ill also be converting all measurements to si because thats what you use in a research report milespoundsetc may be included in parentheses if really necessary

im also seeing that a lot of reports are straying from the item object classscpdescription format some are just missing an object class and while im at it some having the wrong class imo and others are just cluttered whitespacewise im going to go ahead and make the sections classscpdesc bold and add some white space where needed to make them easier to read theres a couple that are pretty narrative and i wont touch those without some discussion

id also like to edit the imo overdoing of many of the scps and descriptions reduce the usage of the words terminated reduce the usage of all caps where it isnt needed editremove unexplainedexcessive procedures not ones that add to the experience i mean ones like burying an object in 10 tons of dirt and replacing the dirt every other day for no apparent reason or how every other scp involves very precise temperature ranges which would never occur in nature prior to containment etc i dont mean to intrude on anyones creativity here honest i just see an opportunity for improvement is all

the response from an anonymous user was

go ahead that sounds like a good idea conversion to si will really add to the scientific style removing oxymoronic expressions like the one you quoted is fine by me

the basic formatting for the creation of these articles differed greatly from what we have now for one thing anyone could edit any entry at any time and for any reason pop culture references were fairly commonplace with many of the discussion pages mentioning them instead of the current comment system we had discussion boards for each article articles were formatted in the same style as wikipedia and the general interface was primitive but there is still something charming about the whole thing it was just a group of anonymous x and b users getting together to create something they all thought was pretty cool reading through the old discussion pages brings a sense of hope for the future

the community on editthis was loose at best with most communication taking place on x or through the board discussion pages there were few guidelines with the only actual how to write an scp guide being at the bottom of the website and entirely optional to read there was no deletion process with many terrible entries being left on the mainlist a few of these entries2 would be left behind when the move to wikidot was enacted

despite the lack of quality control the first hazes of canon began emerging during this time secure facilities showed that the foundation had a reach beyond site19 and the o5 council gave the idea that the scp series had incharacter leadership concepts such as dclass were introduced then called variations on the name d personnel there were no senior staff author inserts and no such thing as foundation tales users would leave o5 notes at the end of articles leaving comments about the articles this led to a development to sillier and sillier notes which in turn resulted in several edit wars between users who appreciated the humor and those who did not

in the end editthis was never a viable home for the scp series the web host was running out of capital and was forcing many of his subscribers to either pay him or be deleted we didnt have the resources to pay which meant imminent deletion was looming there was some debate on the editthis wiki on where the series would go since editthis had no admins wed basically been an anarchic internet society with the editthis wiki no longer being a viable home for the scp series a new host was needed

i was on that site for a few weeks submitting with others when i found out the original creator had abandoned it at it was in danger of being canned by the hosting network so i migrated all the stores to wikidot by just copy and pasting everything over  fritzwilliethe administrator

fritzwillie decided to set up the wiki on wikidot and it went up on july 19th 2008 and from there was an uphill battle to bring content and writers over by july 25th 2008 the wikidot wiki was ready to go live this message was the first news update for the wiki posted by the administrator as he opened up the wiki for the first time

the forum is up
page rating is available
the website is going live today all permissions are open
welcome
however when he set it up there were actually two accounts opened up with his name in secret he set himself up both as the administrator to do administrative work and as fritzwillie to do writing work he told nobody about this and contributed mostly under the fritzwillie name while doing most admin work under the the administrator account

i guess a little like i said i admined as one and contributed as the other i didnt want people to upvote ones i submitted as the administrator just because i saved the site so most were submitted as fritzwillies  fritzwilliethe administrator

there was soon a flurry of activity as authors came in from the sinking editthis wiki to see the new one the first adminships were assigned to the administrator drgears fritzwillie and kain pathos crow while the first mods were lt masipag and kraito they got to work building the wiki as quickly as possible

the admin wrote a few nice articles but other than that i have no idea what he was like i dont even know who he was on the original wiki i just know he chose me as one of the big four because i was active all the time on the old wiki  kain pathos crow

i didnt want to play favorites or have people favorite mine just because i was the adminstrator  fritzwilliethe administrator

fritzwillie created the the administrator account because he didnt want the man who started the wikidot wiki to also be contributing stuff he thought it might result in nepotism upvotes he built the initial pages such as the series page assigned the moderators and administrators and worked diligently to bring folks in from editthis this is what established the wikidot wiki as the defacto home of the scp series and not just another option for the creepypasta series he contributed several articles that continue to bring acclaim today such as the coat of many arms and the living room he also created a word from the administrator

mankind in its present state has been around for a quarter of a million years yet only the last 4000 have been of any significance so what did we do for nearly 250000 years we huddled in caves and around small fires fearful of the things that we didnt understand it was more than explaining why the sun came up it was the mystery of enormous birds with heads of men and rocks that came to life so we called them gods and demons and begged them to spare us and prayed for salvation

in time their numbers dwindled and our numbers rose the world began to make more sense when there were less things to fear yet the unexplained can never truly go away as if the universe demands the absurd and impossible

mankind must not go back to hiding in fear no one else will protect us we must stand up for ourselves

while the rest of mankind dwell in the light we must stand in the darkness to combat it contain it and shield it from the eyes of the public so that others may live in a sane normal world

we secure we contain we protect
 a word from the administrator

fritzwillie was active for only a short time on the wikidot wiki but his contributions cannot be understated some of the most influential entries on the main list were created by him including cassie the creeping hungry sands of tule fernand and the ww2 molecular fission cannon he was also responsible for the cocreation of the wikis first guide where he would attempt to describe tone

well fritzwillie was intelligent with a good eye for military matters after that i dont know he disappeared soon after the foundation secondary website was established kain pathos crow
kraito was one of the first two moderators given moderative powers because of his numerous contributions to the series he disappeared shortly after the series was moved to wikidot over the years his contributions reached low scores and were deleted eventually his personnel file was also removed relegating him to the dustbin of history he resurfaced briefly in early 2014 and posted a new scp

lt masipagknown as unite 3012 on the editthis wiki was made a moderator at around the same time as kraito and was the first female member of senior staff unlike kraito masipag stuck around for awhile and contributed to the moderation of the wiki she contributed many of the important pages that still affect canon in major ways including the groups of interest page telekill alloy and moving articles over from the old wiki

scp001 was another point if a comparatively minor one the spot of scp001 was left open by the administrator to see what would happen masipag locked the page up and in the debate that followed claimed that she didnt think we ought to have any 001 proposals at all today we have ten scp001 proposals so she was correct at that time if thered been only one 001 proposal we wouldve never seen some of the wikis better pieces

the earliest effort on wikidot was moving the series entries over there were several hundred articles and only a few people able to move them but it had to be done the users who moved over most of the old stuff were far2 xthevilecorrupter3 and lt masipag masipag had a computer program to move them over while far2 and ecks did it manually

however not everyone was aware of the change many users of the editthis wiki would remain there for the following weeks unaware of the wikidot site the editthis wiki would continue to exist with a small community until its eventual deletion on september 6th 2008

the wikidot wiki was not the only one set up during this time fritzwillie used the the administrator account also set up the soap from corpses products society of skeptics and the paranormal and an application wiki these websites while an interesting idea were just not the right fit for a juststarting community the society and soap websites were never used with the only notable contribution being original art by far2

scp admin court of council was a pre05command admin site where the admins of the site would be able to discuss private matters there were only four members of the site being drgears fritzwillie kain pathos crow and the administrator many of the issues that affected the early wiki were discussed here such as the implementation of different object classes the haggar attacks and promotion of users the site was later replaced by 05 command in may of 2009

the earliest promotion thread can be found here where kondraki clef the fishmonger and far2 were promoted kain pathos crow and drgears were by far the most active administrators with the administrator himself posting a small but still significant number of times fritzwillie had the least amount of activity with only 3 posts probably due to him wanting the account used primarily for writing

one of the three earliest mods far24 was responsible for transferring a healthy number of articles to the new wiki with a current count of the articles he worked on being 52 interestingly he didnt begin writing entries of his own until july of 2008 when he posted scp235 which was later transferred into a tale he also contributed a great deal to wikidot coding of things creating the format for the threat classification modules and the threat level module he drew up a great deal of photoshopped images for various articles including josie the halfcat and the star eyed child

however far2s most long lasting and arguably most important contribution to the wiki was the creation of the scp logo in october of 2009 a forum post was made to propose the creation of an scp foundation logo several entries were made and were met with unenthusiastic reception however as it was winding down and being forgotten far2 made a post that would influence the wiki for years to come

thats not the original logo i did up the original is below i just ran it through photoshops photocopy filter i used that symbol to make it look like the shield or badge used by lawenforcement agencies and also because the arrows indicate moving inward  containing the threats
 far2

the imagewhich is no longer available was the original iteration of the scp logo while countless additional iterations and versions have been created and altered over the years the basic image of three arrows and a shield has remained intact due to personal life issues far2 left the wiki in late 2008early 2009 his final departure came after a long period of absentee administration

the fishmonger was another early mod known for his writing talent and his ability to write epic overarching stories for the wiki in his early years he was known for being a very rude sometimes outright cruel mod who also wrote most of the stories that the wiki was known for at that time his scp808 a technopath was used in his popular wanderlust stories

at this early junction fishmonger was an indispensable asset to the site as his stories attracted many new users and inspired new content his mod powers however were not utilized for moderation of the wiki instead being used to occasionally troll people or edit other works in order to have them fit in with his stories while this behavior would usually not be tolerated now it was put up with because of the high demand for his works

canon was something new to the wiki and we took great strides in creating what we now know as the foundation when the scp series was first moved over to wikidot there was conflict over what to call the scp series some thought that itd be better to leave it ambiguous while others wished to shape canon by creating an organization various names which were considered included organization foundation and collection5 on july 27th 2008 the name was canonized as foundation

wikidots scp foundation wiki was originally an open project where anon edits were commonplace during this time anyone could come in and edit anything they wanted in addition to making posts being a member was completely optional and frequently disregarded soon events would force this to be changed from anonymous edits being allowed to anonymous edits being completely removed

the haggar attacks took the wiki by complete surprise the first incident took place on october 18th when he created dozens of spam threads and attempted to delete many of the wikis pages they made the classic newbie mistake of sending the pages to the deleted category instead of deleting them properly snorlison and far2 were the primary forces fighting back against these attacks and were promoted for their efforts the second haggar attack on october 25th was successfully defeated by an active force of the new mods and admins the threads created by haggar and his minions were repelled it was after this attack that the anonymous edits were permanently revoked

administration followed the removal of anon edits with measures to keep the wiki safe with the most notable attempt being an application website where users wanting to join the foundation could apply the application wiki would test newcomers to the series they would have to join up then make two successful audition articles to join the wikidot site properly however this was another idea that was just too ambitious for its time the application wiki would be abandoned due to being overly complex then used as a sandbox for a time and eventually abandoned completely

the process for creating scps was also much more laid back users were encouraged to create sandbox pages in the practice area which was a section of the site used for drafting any user could create a sandbox there and many did there are still several sandbox remnants that can be found on the wiki usually underneath the sandbox tag prescp thoughts would usually boil down to finding a picture that looked cool and writing an article around it as a result there were many bland predictable cliche and otherwise negative articles

quality control in the early days of the wiki was not nearly as stringent as we now have it the process for deletion was informal at best with no written guideline for how staff should be able to move stuff for deletion as such there were a significant number of entries which were either trying to be able or were just plain dumb these articles had very low quality hanging around in the low negatives indefinitely

there were also various debates on how to change the structure primarily focusing on object classes the three primary object classes currently used by the wiki are safe euclid and keter there is debate about which object class means what and how theyre really supposed to be defined inuniverse but that debate is for another place for the purpose of this essay we will go by this authors interpretation of the locked box test safe means if you lock it in a box it stays put euclid is you put it in a box its unpredictable keter pops out of the box and eats your grandmother

however these arent the only object classes we can use weve had several evolve out of contests or old practices on the wiki which we no longer use explained articles came from contests to test out new object designations only a few were able to stick around but they do make for interesting tidbits at the time of this writing there are eight articles with the ex designation

decommissions will be discussed in greater depth later in this essay so here is a brief explanation decomms were created so that the wiki could be purged of the worse entries in the series after awhile they realized that it was counterproductive since for every marysue scp they got rid of they made the researcher characters more sueish so the decomms were left asis and today serve as examples of what not to do

there are also some designations which are no longer in use for example on the original x scp series there was the thaumiel designation which was basically the antiketer article series it fell out of use for some time before being used in rogets proposal and then scp2000 split object classes were in use for some time such as safeeuclid euclidketer and safeketer

in the beginning of the wikidot wiki there was discussion on subclasses and threat identifiers some wanted the implementation of subclassifications alpha beta gamma within each safe euclid and keter class—alpha being the least dangerous subclass gamma being the most for example

scp3110 the chestnut of doom — object class euclid  subclass alpha

the threat identifiers were basically images used to identify what the object could do on short notice they served a purpose thats almost similar to our current use of tags  identifying what properties the object had in addition to their object class

although there were many proposals to create new object class designations all attempts to implement one failed

the groups of interest was the creation of lt masipag one of the scp wikidot sites earliest moderators people had created several groups which reappeared through different articles such as the church of the broken god and the goc most of the first gois were created by kain pathos crow and drgears the original6 gois were ███████████ ███████ labs7 the chaos insurgency the church of the broken god the army of the guardians of the islamic revolution8 foo9 the global occult coalition goc the serpents hand marshall carter and dark ltd and the unusual incidents unit uiu

goc was inspired by a pasta that was roaming tg or x at the time about how nietsche was wrong god wasnt dead at least not when he wrote that the entity that called itself yhwh didnt die until the late 50s destroyed by the russian army

chaos insurgency was the around the idea of a badguy foil for the foundation

foo was just a random idea the sort of the men in black kind of character someone else named him foo possibly iceberg7 i think i had no name for the goi

i set up the very first gois the page and everything it was a little bit more brpd than one would expect but i blame hellboy for that

i also set up the tales page but i didnt write any for a long time i just instituted it because there were a lot of articles appearing that would have worked better as stories or people wanting to do stories about things there was also the stuff for incident reports experiment logs eyewitness accounts all that was set up by me i spent a good deal of time setting up the creepypasta library too but they removed that in recent times for some reason i have no idea why  kain pathos crow

there was also the creation of the active projects section with the first tasks being the scp cyoa game started by kain and the pdf project started by kondraki only the latter of which actually got anywhere the pdf project was created as a pdf archive of all scp articles created with a template10 which gave them an authentic look however many of the entries in the pdf project have since been deleted which was not a problem seen at the time due to the vagaries of deletion policy

there was very limited administrative action against the lower rated articles as evidenced by the small number of premass edit deletions the only active administrators were kain pathos crow and drgears with fritzwillie having left shortly after the establishment of the scp admin court of council due to health reasons so shortly after the move to wikidot he left site administration he had never been extremely active posting most of his stories on wikidot fresh blood in the form of moderation assisted somewhat but it was still an uphill process

following the departure of fritzwilliethe administrator a dual power system emerged most of the authority in the wiki was coming from kain and drgears who would go through the site proposing projects and helping people write new scp articles there was also the attempt at a choose your own adventure game a first person shooter game and a collectible card game all of these projects were eventually abandoned

as the site moved towards 2009 things were shifting and major changes were occurring in tone new users had entered the culture and had begun writing a whole series of new classic articles the new site administrative powers came in and began changing things more drastically than they had ever been changed before the little wiki had finally gotten its footing and was plowing ahead with its tiny but dedicated community

as the wiki continued large amounts of poorly written entries were created the discontent is expressed in this post by kain pathos crow

httpswebarchiveorgweb200806052256134chanarchiveorgbrchivedsplthreadphp5threadid70544932xspecialcontainmentprocedures11

this is where we began

these are our roots

there were no xmen no cliches no self inserts no glory hogging no drama

there was only one thing

the will to create

to create something that was beyond the norm but close enough to be intriguing something that was unbelievable but capable of causing that slightest hint of self doubt something that added to the vaguness of this mystery organisation rather than spell out its hidden means and aims

true we have become more structured more informed more thorough but at what cost

the foundation itself is no longer this great shadow that looms over the horizon too huge and far reaching to truly see it has become a pet something that allows itself to tamed and groomed

this is where we were born in that chaos where the ignorant were spurned the immature ignored the worthless cast aside and the great gave way to what mattered the post

but how do we reclaim this lost glory  kain pathos crow

in the beginning of 2009 drgears authored his response it carried with it the goals that the wiki would take with it to the next year by this time next year most if not all of these goals would have been achieved in some respect

that is the issue we have as we add we destroy with every entry it peels away the horror more and more some entries add and even enhance the feel of the first entry however many more tear it down

annihilation of the wiki and a return to the chans would work but to give up due to a wave of fail and retreat back to the primordial ooze of 4chan is a action i would like to postpone as long as possible

we strive for involvement for a openness to new ideas and it has worked well thus far multiple people working in the same shared universe will skew the initial vision but weve done tolerably well until now

however we seem to now be drifting much more drastically with a recent influx of new users weve had to constantly remind prod and threaten to try and maintain the initial vision of the scp the scp are made to be taken and placed into a game movie comic book or any other cool application they are creepypasta short fiction designed to unsettle and creep out readers any other application is secondary

my solution to the fail influx is simple and draconian

1 massive deletions  we have a ton of scp items and we could trim over 14 of them with no issue no decommission no please edit pleading just gone free the number for someone else

2 stricter edits  if people ask you again and again to edit your work and you do nothing be prepared to lose your article if you dont want to be productive we have other people who are if your only response is ok you fix it then then be prepared to lose your article to the editor if you made a steaming pile of crap and someone edited it into solid gold then they should get the credit not you

3 banning  if you are consistently a jerkuncooperativestupidhorrible at writing we do not want you if your scp keep getting downvoteddeleted maybe you should be doing something else instead of constantly cleaning up after bad users remove the source of the issue

in addition a major issue appears to be users who have no idea what they are doing i hate to use chan terms but lurk the hell more read entries go over the how to page read comments look over the highest and lowest rated take at least a couple weeks to get into things before you start trying to post dont dive in with a premade avatar twenty scp ideas a revolutionary image for the foundation and a new storyline

in short we need to start acting more like the foundation a soulless shadowy bureaucratic entity with zero tolerance for mistakes incompetence or insubordination one whos actions are carried out swiftly and without apology or explanation  drgears

this would be the new attitude of the wiki as we moved to a new era

as we moved into late 2008 close to 2009 the wiki was still experiencing a lot of sweeping changes the number of scp articles seemed to be growing at an everincreasing rate and we now had tales being added to the library section we had moved from having 4 admins and 5 mods to having 5 admins and 7 mods the members pages had grown to approximately 16 pages it was still small enough that one person could know everybody else while also large enough to cultivate an interesting and varied body of work

chat also began at this time it was founded by kondraki who created it as ic chat it wasnt very active in the words of pair of ducks

i became active in the community because of the chat it was actually kondraki that originally made site19 actually but chat was fairly ignored then only him myself snorlison and fritz yes fritz were ever on chat was also supposed to be incharacter back then

eventually site19 become completely forgotten … but i came back registered it and started really trying to get people in there for a while it was still mostly myself kondraki and snorlison on … i remember when gears came into the room one day it was like wed met a celebrity xd … but chat got big pretty quick soon we had iceberg rights and others popping in regularly  pair of ducksparadox

writers such as yellowdrakex rights name1 blastyoboots and eberstrom2 made their debut on the wikidot wiki these new writers would begin to fill the 001999 scp block with hundreds of entries some good some bad but all new and arguably original pieces

there was also the use of wikidot tools like the threat module mass orient canon and navigation bar created by ekzhentric lohner these tools allowed for an easier way to browse the scp wiki the threat modules were designed to supplement the object classes providing a small illustration that would better provide how the scp affected you cognitohazard memoryaffecting toxic memetic etc

the mass orient canon was a tool that allowed you to go on archive binges with a simple interface its basically a module that listed every page on the wiki with some preference settings the navigation bar was simpler a way to move from one page to another without having to navigate back to the main page lohner created these tools without permission and was thus subjected to angered admins who didnt like the tools and thought lohner was just messing with stuff however she kept a cool head throughout the process and eventually was looked on as someone who had the potential to be staff and would eventually become staff

a few of these users would also become the next generation of mods and admins by february of 2009 iceberg7 fat ghost bright and pair of ducks had become moderators and drkondraki had become an administrator with the new set of authority figures kain and gears began to become less central to site authority the balance of power would swing away from them and into the hands of drkondraki who would become the dominant administrator of the wacky hijinx era

two major different writing styles would begin to emerge with the new generation of producers there were those like hk016 who would attempt to ground their articles in heavy real world science that would act as the hook others like rights and drkondraki wrote entries that were very characterdriven trying to explore the foundation from the perspective of one researcher there were scp objects stored in offices handled only by specific researchers by february of 2009 the second style had become the dominant style of the wiki

with this shift in writing came a shift in tone tone of the site was rapidly shifting from stark horror and seriousness to a goofy sillier and much less serious style the wacky hijinx era as it is now known would be a time of loosened regulation what we now call lolfoundation came to be wherein the writers would try to be funny and cute instead of horrific or scary the keter duty addenda came to be during this time where users would add bits to their articles saying that misuse of the object would result in being assigned keter duty we also had many articles using nowunpopular writing tactics such as using data expunged repeatedly crossreferences and things that were knockoffs of older articles

in january a largescale scp review was attempted but never really got off the ground there were simply too many scp articles being posted too quickly for any sort of review to be effective staff at the time were unwilling or unable to lock down the wiki for a review and as such the idea passed without any major action being taken entries would continue coming in at the same pace

despite that we also came into what could be called a golden age of the wiki as some have called it there were many people producing lame content but also a lot of great content the site as a whole was developing an identity for itself and developing a more complex canon one of the major factors here was the stories of the fishmonger his first major story wanderlust was seen as an epic story3

unfortunately with the good came a lot of bad there were numerous terrible entries created in late 2008 to early 2009 although you had to make a wiki account to participate we still had numerous items that were either marysue power fantasies or something really dumbnot suited for an scp examples can be found on the decommissioned scp page this was in the wild yonder days before we went and purged the site with the mass edit4 so there wasnt a large process people could turn to by which we could delete a large number of these entries at once site administration noticed this and drclef in particular decided to take action a user named dantenson5 wrote scp239 the witch girl in november of 2008 drclef made this post on the discussion page

dr a clefs report my analysis of the situation has led me to the conclusion that scp239 is an unacceptable containment and security risk although several proposals have been made re using her for containing other scps the example of scp953 and others must serve as a stark reminder of the risks of underestimating the foundations ability to control scps with realityaltering powers

i would therefore like to make the following proposal a piercing implement will be constructed of scp148 capable of penetrating scp239s otherwise impenetrable skin this tool will be used to kill scp239 while she is asleep and her powers are neutralized because of the danger of scp239 awakening and resisting termination it is my recommendation that the selected operative carry scp668 as well in order to minimize complications

one of the dangers of this procedure is the possibility that scp239 will awaken and perceive the operative as a friend or good person thus changing reality to match it is for this reason that i would like to volunteer to carry out the procedure personally a review of my personnel file should indicate that my data expunged should allow me to carry out the operation even after a reality shift of this nature

 clef

following this post clef was contacted by drkondraki who said that if clef was going to attempt to destroy 239 then kondraki would be obligated to go against him this soon evolved into the story termination order also known as the war of the doctors which was brought to the wiki on december 4th 2008 in the course of the story many of the unpopular articles were decommissioned which resulted in the story being massively popular more decomms would follow in its wake

the system for decommissioning articles was similar to our current practice of deletion when staff members noticed an article approaching an exceptionally low rating and nobody wished towas able to save it they would call for a decomm if enough support was gathered a decommissioning story would be written and the article in question would be deleted a copy would then be preserved on the decommissioned scp section unfortunately the original discussion pages for these articles was also deleted however one article i have found still has a portion of the process remaining scp213 was called to be decommd before nekochris rewrote it and as such still has a discussion on whether or not it could be removed

decommissioning stories usually involved various senior staff author avatars using increasingly silly means to destroy bad scps it went from articles in which the destroyers used computer viruses to destroy them to large explosions to giant metal fists slamming into them they were also the first time we really saw senior staff author avatars being used in real stories we got the clefkondraki rivalry from this time as well as the dr bright professor crow the fishmonger6 dr rights agent streliknov dr light dr mann iceberg break and dr glass characters it was a time of character pieces fun stories in which interesting characters did cool things in unique places

there were other decommissioning stories that came after termination order each one trying to be more over the top then the previous one we had a giant steel fist annihilating ben the cyborg the noble warrior dyne putting himself on the chopping block and the chronokomodo being blasted to smithereens the nature of these stories kept getting more and more extreme culminating in the creation of what is widely regarded as the most ott decommissioning duke till dawn

duke till dawn served as a sort of wakeup call for the site administration the plot of dr kondraki riding scp682 causing enormous damage to a foundation facility and killing tons of people showed how far off the spectrum they had gone instead of destroying marysues they were making more of them drclef made this post in the scp history thread

at this point we get a little stupid we start decommissioning scps left and right people are competing for the funniest and most imaginative decoms and it all comes to a head with duke till dawn the most over the top decom report of all time and thats when it hits us weve become the monster

in our efforts to get rid of mary sue scps we only succeeded in created mary sue researchers

my history on the site since then has been devoted to trying to fix everything i fucked up i dont regret what happened the energy and excitement led to some of the best writing weve ever had but while we were roaring down the highway at 90 mph with the wind in our hair we didnt realize we were heading straight towards a cliff we managed to hit the brakes with two wheels hanging off the edge climb gingerly out of the car wrestle it back onto solid ground and now were doing 65 on a road running parallel to the cliff  drclef

as the wiki rolled into march some restraint was attempted in wiki business characters were toned down somewhat although not all characters were attempts were made to return to a more serious tone not everyone supported these changes most notably the popular site admin drkondraki he preferred to see the foundation in its old style and didnt appreciate the darker tone kondraki began to act out editing peoples pages and trolling many site users many people complained about this behavior but he was always let off the hook

the beginning of his downfall was an incident in late februaryearly march during which he deleted every article on the lowest rated pages list without consulting any other members of staff although he was chastised for the incident he didnt receive direct punishment this would be the beginning of many such power abuses where he would get angry and do something rash then calm down again

another incident in march was the first real influx of new users coming in from tvtropes the scp foundation page had been created over there drawing in the first real newbie surge the site had seen it was really only about a couple dozen people but this was a large increase considering how the wiki had operated in the past this brought about a change in how applications were done instead of being from a separate wiki or by just being a wikidot member youd have to answer a quiz of six site canon questions and provide information similar to the current app7

a lot of people would complain about the writers immigrating from tvtropes but it did boost site membership and produced some great writers it also created a large enough population to start some of the foundation side projects such as the rps foundation interest in rp has existed since at least the beginning of the wiki going to older threads it is possible to see bihjan kain and unconfirmed reptile making posts about organizing a foundation based rp however it wasnt ever organized and if it was organized it wasnt perpetuated this changed in april when kondraki founded the first organized foundation irc rp as we know it today fieldwork8

essentially fw was supposed to be the place of misfits it was site 17 dangerous scps all over and people were kind of loopy to keep from going insane the site was kind of run in the director is unseen but felt bright is the head of the site kondraki is the gestapo all of the field agents and doctors had their quirks it slowly went from this is a dangerous site and everyone should be pantsshittingly terrified while trying to keep sane into there are some really talented fucking people here no wonder they were at this site

there were tough ass characters there were noncombat characters there were funny scenes depressing scenes and terrifying scenes runs would range from something kinda stupid to an outbreak of 008 in which the result was the nuclear strike of the infected area

it was pretty much the place to be but some people didnt like the way it was ending up because they werent in the spotlight so much anymore imo even though they kinda were so they said this is too dumb we want something more serious and made active duty only ad was retardedly grimdark and not fun unless you were bright yoric or waxx or on occasion rights

as it went on it did get a little bit sillier and very much less serious there were blatantly stupid runs most run by lbd dr syx lurker and dr rights were in a relationship despite being 9 kinds of illegal but to be honest the people who were playing most of the time were having fun so it didnt matter it may have been intended to be a super srs scp rp but it ended up being a fun kind of little slice of life thing

not to mention gears ran the best fucking run ever the barge thing i cant remember what number i dont remember it entirely because i unfortunately had shit to do and couldnt participate but i heard that it was a mix of terrifying exciting and thinking oh my god is my character going to actually survive

really the end came because of the fact that a large chunk of people jumped ship to ad left fw kind of barren there werent really enough people online at the same time to do much of anything  an anonymous fw player

i wasnt really particularly active in ad but i effectively took charge of fw after ad started and players started moving there there were a lot of selfinsertions there  our characters were basically crafted from our personnel pages or ourselves if we didnt have personnel pagesand the senior staff stats were so very high above the regular players that they dominated play

what killed fieldwork was imbalance the start of active duty about the time that ad started and fw started declining i took charge of the game and i let lbd help me out worst decision ever  if there was a noose around the neck of the game to begin with my appointing him as a gm pulled the lever of the trap door i suppose i could have saved it but real life got in the way and thats when i essentially took off from all the scp sites in general from then to now

its simply a matter of activity  no one was interested in fw especially now that the much more balanced ad was starting and the only active fw gms let it die  myself and the other admins due to neglect lbd due to mismanagement  to be honest no one really wanted to play fw i guess it was more of a thing concerning lbd as a person as it was due to mismanagement he wasnt particularly popular  fifthman

with the popularity boom that allowed fieldwork to exist came an increase in bad scp entries and a larger community in general it was necessary that a better method of administrative communication be created so on may 1st 2009 drgears created 05command which had lasted to this time of writing as the administrative site of the scp foundation it was announced with this post marked for modsadmins

with the growth of the site…we really need a way to communicate as a administration staff with that in mind the link on the left now leads to the new admin site currently just a forum i plan on installing a chat module and creating project pages and other such things

if you are an admin or mod please go visit and apply to join hopefully this will make communication go a bit easier

http05commandwikidotcomstart  drgears

the efficiency of having an admin site to communicate immediately became apparent as staff members were able to communicate on issues such as bans promotions and wiki policy very easily one of the first actions taken with this new site was banning the user le blue dude who had long been an irritant to staff members for a period staff had been indulging his behavior since a lot of the time hed been persecuted by other site members

as time went on though it became more apparent that lbd was bringing it on himself many staff members postulated on this but there was a small derailment in the thread when fishmonger posted his modship had been restored after being previously revoked for site vandalism as far as this author has seen this is the only significant post fishmonger made on 05command

when the thread returned to the intended topic waxx made this post that basically summed up the feeling for lbd by site members and moderators of the chat

i feel bad for the kid but he just doesnt seem to get it honestly its to the point where its like we are dealing with a five year old

lbd put your shoes on
no
lbd put your fucking shoes on we are leaving
i dont wanna you are yelling at me and i am fine

i cant speak for what hes done on the wiki but i will say that from what i have seen in the chat he is completely hopeless a lost cause having dealt with many people like lbd in the past i can say with certainty that it is easier to just remove him than trying to rehabilitate him or teach him anything the effort is wasted on him it goes in one ear and out the other all of the chances to succeed that hes been given are completely meaningless to him because in his mind hes never done a damned thing wrong

in my experience when you have such a person its best to just cut your losses and send them on their way its harsh but ultimately it saves you from a lot of headaches  waxx

lbd was banned from the wiki and from the chat later evading the ban and being banned again this was the first time someone had been banned using 05command and it vastly streamlined the process soon though other problems would arise with deletion

since the decomm method had ended poorly and the large number of poor articles was too big for it anyways a new deletion policy was created previous to this official policy had been to only delete entries with 8 downvotes and no upvotes this had created the problem of people upvoting out of spite or entries with a dozen downvotes for one upvote as well as the issue where kondraki had deleted every lowest rated article the policy change came from drclef on may 20th 2009

lets make it simple

5 delete with approval of 3 mods and at least one admin

10 delete with approval of 3 mods

15 anyone can delete it  drclef

05command also allowed for the first official public promotion thread on may 15th 2009 drrights and ekzhentric lohner were made into moderators while drbright was made into an admin other users considered for promotion at the time9 were pooryoric breaketernal and heiden10 these new staff members widened the administrative pool making it so that we had enough staff to run the wiki without worrying whether or not it would die if 2 or 3 people left

by late june things with kondraki had come to a head hed taken it upon himself to edit the author pages deleting the content that he considered to be less than satisfactory this act combined with his previous juvenile behavior resulted in the decision to remove him from administrative authority and ban him for 24 hours11

one of the primary advocates for his removal was the former cowriter drclef who had grown tired of his infantile behavior and the aforementioned abuses of admin power other staff members who had been sympathetic to kondraki would soon be swayed by kondrakis repeated antics on june 24th the final decision was made to remove kondraki from his administrative position the following note was penned by drgears to kondraki

kondraki

as of today you are no longer an admin or mod of the scp foundation wiki no revocation or appeals on this reduction in rights will be heard for a period of no less then three months at which time you may request a review which will be based on your behavior during this time if you wish to discuss the particulars of this decision please reply to me with your questions

i truly regret having to do this however your cycles between good adminrogue admin are at a point where they can no longer be ignored i have no doubt whatsoever that your actions are almost always geared toward the greater good of the site however your tactics are often deplorable and immature during the last incident you were told that this was your last last chance and that further rogue action would end with this outcome reviewing the log of your review and editing of the member pages i am forced to judge that last chance violated

i would hope that you stay on with the site as a user and prove that you are capable of acting in a calm mature and rational fashion for a sustained period of time this was a decision i had hoped i would not have to make kondraki

with regrets

dr gears

he was a fun guy a good writer pretty funny spun a good game of dnd genuinely cared about the site and was a good friend but was a lot more of a hardass than bright and he took it much further than he did too there were periods when he was fine and then there were periods when he wasnt he particularly hated furries or at least the really vocal annoying ones but as time went on the crazy vendettas got worse and his periods of angry vehemence got longer eventually it got so bad that he basically chased a bad user to other places on the net and started harassing them there and that was where we had to call the line he still comes back occasionally but his visits tend to be very dependent on his moods  kain pathos crow

a flurry of activity would follow in the days after kondraki left in august wikidot implemented a new toolbar in the top of the site which had links to social network sites a shortcut to the join site page and a logo it was seen as an ugly and unnecessary addition and many site users wished to remove it however only the master admin of the site would be able to remove it and since fritzwilliethe administrator had disappeared staff had to message wikidot to change it

oh the ma switch…man that was ages ago…

ok what lead up to the change over was when wikidot started including the little toolbar doodad on top of the site everyone felt it was really distracting and jarring but the only way to get rid of it was to upgrade to a pro account of some type now the only way for this to work was for the actual site owner to do that and we hadnt heard from the administrator in quite some time we tried to contact him a few times via pm but didnt get any reply so…we waited and waited

so that went on a while and finally we decided to just try and get hold of wikidot directly which was pretty easy to do i just pmed one of the higherups and got a response quickly they messaged him got no response…and transferred ownership over to me i think we may have had one or two messages from him since them but he is either gone or lurking hard

incidentally i had to transfer ownership to mann for similar reasons the pro account ran out and he was able to pay for it which i was not so we shifted it over to him  drgears

when this action was being debated fritzwillie used the the administrator account to post a response this is the last message ever received from him

dr gears

i owe you and the other admins a huge apology for seemingly abandoning my position on the site i love the scp world and only had its best interest in mind by moving hosting to wikidot unfortunately the real world has been more demanding of my time than i have to enjoy this fiction

the good news is that im now the proud father of a healthy baby boy the bad news is that my wife has lost her job and im working twice as hard as ever to support my new family

im glad that the site has continued to expand without me and i will set up a pro account this week as youve requested i owe the rest of you that much i will peek in from time to time to enjoy myself but i leave the daily administration in your capable hands

thank you
the administrator

there had been a backlash against silly building ever since lolfoundation had started and with kondrakis fall it was catalyzed there was a massive backlash against the silly carefree tone of the earlier site people were tired of silly and wanted to return to a more serious tone this was encouraged by staff members such as drbright heiden a fat ghost and pooryoric who welcomed this change and were quick to embrace it

this backlash against the silly began to gain more and more momentum and by july it had become the new law of the land nothing better demonstrates the move to a more serious foundation then active duty the second scp rp founded by drbright and heiden active duty was about foundation personnel stationed at site 23 which was located in the australian outback after it started the membership quickly boomed taking most of fieldworks players and newfolk alike

active duty was the genesis of a huge portion of site canon with concepts like lombardi tamlin house and some peoples concept of overwatch command originating from here it quickly became so popular that the lines between what was rp canon and what was site canon began to blur articles which originated from active duty were put on the site using the scpxxxr designation it had a massive community more than any other scp rp and was marked by several overarching plots mostly perpetuated by bright one of them was the one in kenss image which involved the research director being pregnant with a baby that was also time and then janus was zombie12

active dutys influence on scp canon and culture cannot be understated it was the final nail in the coffin for lolfoundation and solidified the serious canon its where numerous influential community members such as echofourdelta dreverettmann drbright heiden and sophia light garnered much of their personal canon and interest in the wiki and where the community basis for almost every foundation rp since has come from

however not all staff members were comfortable with this new setting many of the early site members preferred a wiki more suited to their prior experiences of fun when this was combined with personal problems many of the wikis old guard would leave for a prolonged period of time in some cases for good the loss of old talent only exacerbated the bad scp influx issue which was quickly becoming too severe to ignore

the problem of too many shoddy entries still was not completely solved even with clefs suggestion there were simply too many hovering at 2 or 3 that nobody was able to move one way or the other the idea of a big scp review was brought up again and on september 4th 2009 the mass edit began creation of new scp articles was locked down so that the review wouldnt suffer the same fate as the last one

the mass edit was the major attempt to delete poor entries after the decommissioning idea fell out of favor the idea was to review every entry on the wiki and decide which could stay and which would be deleted every member on the wiki would be able to get their vote and it lasted from 6 sep 2009 to 6 dec 2009 the result of the mass edit was the deletion of a significant number of entries and a boost in wiki quality

the mass edit was performed by having staff members comb through every entry in one block ie 001099 100199 etc and placing entries up for review there was a time limit in which volunteers could edit or rewrite the article after which it could be saved or deleted depending on the response this was done manually for each entry and as one can imagine it took ages to get any of them done

it wasnt just scp articles which were affected by the mass edit almost every j article was deleted with the exception of scp014j scp4444j scp4445j scp1344j and a few others if youve ever heard of the old times where the j articles were all bad pop culture references this is the time where all those got deleted j entries had also been on the main list at this time and the remaining entry was removed after the rest were deleted and put with the j section a repository of what the main scp list looked like prior to the mass edit can be found on the scp classic wiki

the effects of the mass edit cannot be understated we gained a much more concise and better written wiki with a clear and strong goal of quality control with the stagnant entries deleted staff was better able to regulate the content coming onto the wiki without the mass edit the scp wiki may have gone the way of the holder series doomed from low quality control and endless repetitive entries

however not everybody was happy with the results there were many people who had every contribution theyd made on the wiki deleted and some who hadnt gotten the opportunity to save their entries because of time constraints some entries that were well liked got deleted for being dumbnot making sense however entries like that were in the minority most deleted entries were of extremely low quality

in november 2009 pair of ducks stepped down and allowed clef to become the new owner in addition to this clef and bright promoted mrunimport to moderation on november 12th with this change would come new policy and the final removal of one old member drkondraki had continued to reside in the irc and on the wiki despite the loss of his administrative powers on november 15th drbright brought this issue up on 05command

theres a user tyberniusty something furry admitted it in chat

kondraki stalked said kid to second life found out his specific and then preceded to trash on him in chat until the kid left

what had occurred was kondraki finding the users secondlife profile along with some embarrassing identification information site administration agreed that this was an extremely immature action and moved to discipline him for it however kondrakis behavior directly following the incident resulted in a permanent ban kondraki would then selfexile himself from the scp wiki and we would not see him again for a long long time

the wiki moving into 2010 was very different from the one wed come into during 2009 wed taken on a much darker tone and had a much larger userbase staff had shown they could knuckle down and work and effectively administrate the community wed removed the stagnant level of the older leadership and took ourselves more seriously

the beginning of 2010 was a very different time from the beginning of 2009 we were moving with a very different site tone and a very different moderationadministrative team with much more stringent protocols for membership and deletion all in all it was a much tighter ship than the one we started out with however that ship would be rocked by a massive blow to the canon that occurred very early in the year

january of 2010 started out as a fairly laidback affair with most people either scratching their heads about things that were deleted in the mass edit or working on various projects one of these projects was drgears attempt to improve the quality of x which was looked on by him as a fatherland of the scp wiki between january 13th and 16th he had attempted to organize a small section of scp users to post content to it it was an unsuccessful but fun experiment which only served to strengthen the community

at the end of january is when we got something new to the community the first contest the great short story contest started by rights on january 28th 2010 had the original theme of the postscpocalypse as time went on additional themes would be added such as scps at war the death of alto clef and rights birthday these contests were quite popular and helped build up the library area1

in early february another consequence of the mass edit had to be dealt with the mass edit had deleted a fair number of scp articles and many people who had members pages had been reduced to having fewer than the requisite 3 articles one of the newer staff members quikngruvn led a cleanup process wherein staff members would delete the members pages without any articles

however that would be overshadowed by other events taking place in early february on february 9th 2010 fishmonger posted a story which senior staff member pooryoric downvoted due to it not fitting with his view of the site fish responded with an angry acidic comment where he insulted yoric and his girlfriend crack lobster both on the wiki and in site19

in response to this and other acerbic comments made afterwards to other members of staff attempting to intervene fish was permanently stripped of his moderation powers and given a six week temporary ban from both the chat and site the only reason he wasnt permanently banned from the wiki was his writing history and the demand for his work by people both on and off the wiki the action is summed up by drgears here

i appear to be late to the party here and for that i apologize let me catch up as quickly as i can…

fish is a fowlmouthed wretched petty man who breathes cruelty and shits suffering that being said he is one of the best writers we have and therefore we have dealt with this rubbish continuously for some time much like a atomic scientist who insists on having hookers for assistants we have complied with his eccentricities due to the demand for his work

however this has gotten out of hand kondraki was slapped for less then this and at least pretended to be contrite at times fishmonger seems to be under the impression that his body of work exempts him from any and all rules but that is just not so yes his work is good…but this is not the old days the talent pool has deepened and like kondraki fishmonger is not as vital for our existence as he used to be

i support the proposed actions even knowing that fish will most likely not come back or not change in the slightest it pains me to see this happen but this has been in the wings for ages fish has had ample time to change or at least prepare he may be under the impression that he is vital to us but nothing he can do for this site excuses this nonsense throw the book at him if he barks tell him to come to me

again please forgive me the lateness on joining this topic  drgears

fishmonger would be absent in the month of february when the first dedicated sandbox wiki was created the old sandbox system had fallen out of use given that creating individual sandboxes for every user would flood the wiki so on february 19th 2010 pooryoric created the scp sandbox website it quickly replaced any other resource such as pastebin or old site sandboxes and became the principal drafting ground for articles

after the six weeks fish returned and appeared to be intent on behaving his behavior would not cause any trouble for a period following his ban many members of the wiki were inclined to be lenient towards fishmonger because of this especially members of the older guard that had seen him rise up through the years following his stories and how his works affected site canon as a whole fishmonger portrayed his character as an all powerful man within the foundation pulling all the strings from behind the scenes in addition his characters were widely used in many of the wikis major works

however the issue of the fishmonger was temporarily abated and march of 2010 was dedicated to smaller discussions of wiki canon in a thread which started in early february but continued well into march there was discussion on how mobile task forces operated within the foundation there was no centralized page to catalogue how mtfs worked and people used them in a variety of ways some would use them as soldiers in the field containing scps others claimed they would only guard sites and then another group treated them as a military element within the foundation

there was also discussion on the kevents which started in march and continued into april fishmonger had compiled a list of different k events and how they were used on the site a large number were used by him in his various stories examples of which can be found in this thread there was debate on whether k events were strictly religious or simply denominated anomalous apocalyptic events

drgears one of the more prolific writers on the site had begun slowing down at this point this was primarily due to his free time being taken by his three kids and at the time searching for a new home his activity by april 2010 while infrequent was not to the same degree as other absentee staff members ie kulzn the administrator  fritzwillie but it did mean that some staff members stepped in to take gearss responsibilities while he was busy

april marked the beginning of one scp sister site the wanderers library created by dreverettmann and pair of ducks it was designed to be a writing site based on the serpents hand pair of ducks said he wished to inspire more of a sense of wonder than the horror works put up on the scp wiki it received an initial splurge of users then settled into a low level of activity recently activity there has increased it can be found here httpwandererslibrarywikidotcom

on april 30th fishmonger returned and he resumed posting stories on the wiki many people hoped that the extended ban and the revocation of his mod powers would curb his behavior fishmonger himself claimed to be ignorant of having been banned saying that he had been taking an extended trip away from the wiki whatever the case may have been he was starting off with a fresh leaf and hope of improved behavior

by the end of may however this hope had left fishmonger made a post claiming that hed authored an scp under another name as an experiment the scp in question was the former scp877 the author of the page was authored by an account named sinclair which had only ever created the article in question and nothing else this was seen to be an act of sockpuppeting and worthy of a ban

there was some debate on whether or not it was a joke or if sinclair had been a sockpuppet at all but it was generally agreed that this was to be the last straw but due to the fact that there had been no official rule against sockpuppeting prior to this they were hesitant to ban him for it but it was soon apparent that fishs cavalier attitude was becoming too much to overlook fishmonger would call out members of staff who tried to discipline him because he was aware of how loath they were to remove him once and for all

so on june 1st 2010 clef permanently banned fishmonger from the scp wiki due to his impersonation of another user this post was made on the discussion page of the nowdeleted scp877 where the sockpuppet debate had been occurring

you know what you people are seeing this in completely the wrong light this isnt a sockpuppet issue this is a trolling issue fishmonger has by his own admission created a false account and made an scp article under false pretenses in order to elicit an emotional response from other users when called out on this he is behaving in an arrogant and rude manner towards the site staff

if sinclair is not his sockpuppet then he is falsely claiming to be another user and thats trolling too

finally a personal judgement fishmonger despite your admitted skill in writing you have a long history of causing friction with other users with your arrogant attitude and have made no effort to change that behavior at all honestly no matter how good your writing is its not worth putting up with your dramatics

under my current authority is an scp site admin i am permanently banning you from this wiki as well as your alleged sockpuppet sinclair you may choose to appeal this ban on the site chat  drclef

there wasnt much dissent among staff even with people who had liked fishmonger hed simply become too much of a burden to the wiki due to his consistently awful behavior and casual disrespect for staff authority and the wiki rules although there was some disagreement on the site as to whether or not the ban was viable it was hoped that the wiki would be able to move on from fish

but on june 2nd 2010 fishmonger responded to his ban his message threatened to take legal action against the wiki unless every one of his works and everything that had referenced it was taken down immediately the message also contained the threat to sue the wiki unless these works were removed the lawyer was an actual lawyer although it is not known whether or not fish was a real client his message is as follows

subject re ban

since the decision has been made that having my writing is not worth putting up with my dramatics then you shall have neither effective immediately i formally request that all original material i have submitted to the scp foundation wiki be permanently removed

if this material is not removed within two weeks i will not contact you further legal summons will be sent via my lawyer donald b spear to wikidot and their hosting server godaddy pursuant to section 512 to title 17 of the united states code  fishmonger

the wiki had maintained2 a policy of deleting works on author requests so while the nature of fishmongers request has dubious legality since the wiki uses the creative commons license defying it wouldve still caused legal problems with fishmongers attempt to file a suit it was also seen as playing into fishmongers hands

also you know he wants us to be like nooooooo  pair of ducks

attempts were made to dissuade fishmonger from his course of action with the rationale that the only person he was hurting was the wiki drgears attempted to mediate with fishmonger after learning of his actions this exchange of messages followed

in this case your sincere doubt is misplaced fish you and i both know you can be a egotistical ass you have admitted to this several times the last that i knew you were staying somewhat removed from the comment and discussion section of things and just producing work this seemed to be working…and then this blew up im just trying to put together the pieces and understand this blowup from each side if youd rather not cooperate in this i guess ill just have to deal with it

now as for the revocation of your work we will do this fish but let me be the first to say that this looks exceedingly petty still if you want to take a taking my toys and going home stance we will do all we can to accommodate we will begin immediate removal of all content that is identified as your work and will hopefully have all entries removed in a timely fashion if you do decide to retain legal counsel i would ask that you inform me of this action so that we may do the same

fishmonger id ask that you not do this it hurts nobody but the general public of the site but i can not make you do anything you dont wish to do i am exceptionally sad to see you go like this and disappointed at the course of action youve decided to take but if your mind is made up we will adapt

sincerest regrets

dr gears

fishmonger responded thus

it was the decision of your administration specifically clef that i have nothing more to do with the site okay fine im accepting that but with decisions come consequences the consequence of this decision is that i will have nothing more to do with the site as requested that includes all my material presently available which is my property to do with as i decide and which i have a perfectly legal right to control

you want to talk about petty okay lets talk about how nothing wrong was done here how no rules were broken and how the only reason i even bothered to tell anyone about this was to more rapidly facilitate the deletion of a page nobody liked lets talk about how clef has had it out for me from day one and has been looking for any excuse he can to get rid of me just like he did with kondraki believe me pal i can do petty and this aint it

dont take the moral high ground with me and dont insult my intelligence youve always been perfectly happy to play the good cop to clefs bad cop okay thats fine too what would my cooperation achieve in this matter exactly reinstatement on a site that has always considered me a threat to its molehill authority and will only look all the harder for a valid reason to remove me again theres no satisfaction to be had here from either party youd have to at least revoke clefs admin privileges for me to even begin to look at a diplomatic solution you willing to do that

no youre not and we both know it you know as well as i do that theres no common ground to be had here if diplomacy had any chance of working it would have resolved such issues far before now now clef has chosen extremes okay if thats whats written then thats whats written but dont sit there and feign surprise that im going to react to it in an extreme manner myself im offended that you would even consider such a laughably transparent ploy

the decisions have always been made by you now its time to make another decision specifically whether or not facilitating a clean break with me will require the removal of your site to the misery and scorn of hundreds of people you wanted to wear the big girl pants dont whine now that its time to grow up  fishmonger

gears authored one last reply to fish

…fishmonger im sorry youve decided to feel this way the site as always been very receptive to your submissions and has given you little but praise and encouragement for them it is your vile profane and abrasive personality that has been one of the few negative points against you however its always been a pretty big point

it seems youve decided to lay down the truth for me and dissolve my illusions of both my position and yours let me do the same you are a prima donna and a diva in the beginning we needed your voice your genius and could forgive and overlook your increasingly insane and combative behavior now however weve outgrown you your tantrums and your fuck yall attitude did you not see the writing on the wall during the whole kondraki mess did you not think that maybe just maybe going around shouting im so awesome nobody can touch me might eventually backfire

youre welcome to speak on things done wrong and misuse of power but before you pick up the holy banner of the wronged look to yourself a bit first tell me in perfect honesty you didnt misuse power that you never treated anybody with anything less then a fair and even tone we are removing your work as a favor in consideration of your work with the site in the past if we wanted to be dicks we could be you are not a martyr fish youre a jerk

also i have to laugh when you talk about growing up youre basically saying you guys are mean im taking my toy and going home what is the point of it even going to go and publish it some sweet movie deal youre doing this from spite pure and simple as for misery and scorn…i think well do alright without you honestly were a community fish not an audience here to masturbate your ego

forgive me if ive gotten overly dramatic during this but youve really ticked me off fish this only hurts your fans fish nobody else not me not clef not the site nobody it will be hard to get along without you but i assure you with total certainty that we will well have most everything down by monday i hope and then you are more then welcome to retire with your work and do…whatever it is youre going to do i hope you find a more accommodating site fish i honestly do but i pray you never do this kind of thing to anyone again ill be in touch regrading the deletion process

dr gears

so let me get this straight clef abusing his provisional site power and banning me over a nonviolation of nonexisting rules thats just doing your job but me exercising actual legal rights over my literary property — thats throwing a tantrum

youre not very good at this grown up game gears

ive never made any bones about being a surly asshole you ever known anyone who takes medicinal marijuana it works because getting high feels good pleasure counteracts pain im not a nice person thats why i write to make something intensely beautiful to counteract the intense ugliness you dont get one without the other and i dont get one without the other its a package deal for better or worse

you can judge all that however you like im not looking for sympathy or understanding your opinion of me is quite clear and likely unmovable thats not my concern ive been insulted by professionals and i dont see anything youre capable of offering doing me even superfluous damage similarly whether your site survives or not is irrelevant to me this is a matter of removing connections nothing more you dont want anything more to do with me how dare you feign surprise when i express the same do you honestly think id want to be associated with you now after all this have you so thoroughly deluded yourself into thinking youre doing me a privilege to allow my work to remain but not my person

again your administration made this decision again these are the consequences of that decision now get to work  fishmonger

the stress of the fishmonger incident had been weighing heavily on the site administration and on june 2nd drclef left his administrative position dealing with the fishmongers antics was just too much aggravation and stress he did not leave the wiki completely however remaining on site as a member of senior staff due to the surplus of inactive admins nobody was promoted to fill his slot the rest of the administrative team was left to deal with fish

also banning fish was the last thing i did as an administrator i was sick and tired of the burden tired of trying to herd cats and id just… had enough admittedly the reasons for banning fish were sketchy at best but that little sinclair stunt was    one straw too many on the dromedarys back if anyone else had done that then they would have gotten off with a reprimand but fish was basically openly going after all the admins  drclef

fishmongers works were deleted every story scp and reference fishmonger had ever created was deleted the notable works include wanderlust castling the stories involving the black queen any story involving the former goi foo scp228 and scp808 every reference to every one of these works was expunged from the wiki leaving a noticeably large hole in the site canon if you want an example imagine every reference to dr gears or dr clef was removed in the middle of 2010 and then nobody on the wiki was ever allowed to write stories about them again

this decision basically killed any support fishmonger had among the user base while previously he could have portrayed himself as a martyr wronged by staff he was now seen as a petty man who took his toys and went home instead of seeing he had a problem there was a lot of anger and fear of how the wiki would continue with such a large portion of its works removed

but there was a resolute determination to keep going there was an expectation to fall after fishmonger and his epic stories left but this was surpassed by the loyal core base people wanted to show they could go on without fishmonger that we didnt depend on the works of a single user with hindsight it seems inevitable that we would move on but at the time things were rocky by june 4th all references to fishmonger on the wiki had been removed things were moving on towards an uncertain future but future months would show that the community could bounce back

well to me he was always a nice guy i only ever got second hand reports of his misadventures and to be honest ive always liked the guy that said i also know for a fact he had one hell of a temper a foul mouth and was spiteful as all get out he also hated clef and yoric and could never get along with them even in the irc when one would show up the other would leave because theyd start getting into an argument and thatd be the end of it

there was something that crack lobster once said on one of his articles basically saying it wasnt that good and fish cursed her out of it accusing her sock puppeting her boyfriends yoric views on the article and on fish himself the pair of them rebuffed him saying it was her own choice and that fish was an overreactive asshole

his editing of other peoples pages isnt something i remember but what i do remember is that the final straw was that he was posting and writing underneath another name on the wiki yoric jumped on that saying he was impersonating another member or something i cant quite remember but all in all it was bad everyone else went with that but fish exploded at it and his reaction was pretty vicious and that was what finally turned the last people against him in the end for me it was like putting down old yeller

but the worst part was when he was banned like i said he was pretty goddamn spiteful and he threatened legal action if we didnt remove all of his writing from the wiki it was more an act of spite than an real threat and considering the legal parameters surrounding the site it probably wouldnt have help up in court but we did so anyway out of our own sense of integrity i was never more disappointed in him than i was then  kain pathos crow

the fishmonger debacle had a massive impact on wiki culture many attitudes on the wiki such as the you dont have to be nice if you make good work3 perished rules were enacted against sockpuppeting and excessive rudeness to other users the site shifted away from a large unified culture and steered closer to the there is no canon mindset of today it also marks the beginning of the age of bright with clef stepping down it left bright alone as the sole active administrator this would continue for the rest of 2010 and well into 2011

the rest of june was less dramatic compared to what had happened in the first week there were a few people banned from the chat which was now owned by the newly minted administrator waxx and a few minor issues on the wiki but nothing major it was an almost weird calm after all that had happened in just a few days people were just picking up the pieces

on june 20th the first alternate language translation project appeared scp foundation ru was founded to translate scp articles into russian

lt masipag reappeared briefly on july 6th 2010 shortly after her moderation powers had been revoked for inactivity she stuck around for a few days made two posts then vanished into the ether again she may or may not be lurking but that cannot be confirmed at this time4

august would be an interesting month which would shape the canon of the wiki in large ways a user named dr wilson made a post asking about a foundation ethics committee based on their treatment of dclass and attitude towards human life as a whole the post was initially met with condescension but users soon began to contemplate the ethical ramifications of the foundations activity it culminated in a post made by voct

how many people did i just kill

how many did you just save youre a smart man do the math itll help you sleep

— hank mccoy and steve rogers secret avengers 16

the foundation ethics committee is often thought of as an ineffectual rubberstamp laughingstock a bunch of seatfillers and they go to quite some lengths to sustain that impression the ethics committee is actually the secret power within the foundation the o5s decide what is and is not safe but the members of the ethics committee are the ones who advise the o5s about what is and is not acceptable

if it ever occurs to you to wonder whos really in control the overseers or the ethics committee then presumably youre smart enough to keep your mouth shut

the members of the ethics committee do a terrible job  and thats terrible as in terrible swift sword they are the ones who balance the moral costs of everything the foundation does — and in order to balance the costs they must first know the costs every detail that gets redacted or expunged or blackboxed they know it they know what scp4472 does when it comes in contact with dead bodies they know what procedure 110montauk is they should — they designed it

remember the foundation does not rule the world the foundation serves the world regardless of what the general population may think it wants the foundations actions are in that general populations best interests

remember the foundation is not evil we do not torture people just because we are against unnecessary cruelty the members of the ethics committee are the ones who decide when cruelty is necessary to serve the greater good you must be able to quantify and compare distinct goods this is what the ethics committee does

remember the p stands for protect the ethics committee judges what is and is not acceptable balancing evils so that on the whole and in the end evil is minimized

i did the right thing didnt i it all worked out in the end
in the end nothing ends adrian nothing ever ends

—adrian veidt and jon osterman watchmen 12

if there was irrefutable proof that the only way to save humanity was by eliminating the foundation the ethics committee would advocate that this be done and begin implementing plans to make it happen

you want happy endings fuck you youre alive to read it

another event in august was promotion drmann becoming a moderator and theraven being promoted to senior staff along with burns at the same time ekzhentric lohner and rights were placed from moderation down to senior staff primarily for inactivity

on september 20th 2010 drclef began his rewrite of scp076 able this had been one of the most controversial entries on the list with detractors calling it a marysue and supporters claiming it was a legitimate entry it was where mtfomega7 originated a team of scps being used by the foundation for various purposes a variety of humanoid articles were added to it with the only one remaining today being scp105

we had too many mary sues joining omega 7 omega 7 itself didnt fit the site culture any more able was fine mtf omega 7 had to go so i killed them all its honestly that simple i recall kain was fine with the change there was a lot of discussion about taking away ables spirit knife powers and such but i tried not to just to keep the feel of the old article only change how the foundation reacts to him  drclef

by the end of the year staff had gotten back on their feet and begun discussing new issues with the site on november 30th pooryoric noted that the rating modules had begun malfunctioning ratings would be inconsistent between the page display and the actual display under look who rated this page area although the issue was quickly fixed it was the first time we saw wikidots instability as a platform

late december specifically december 24th was marked by the creation of new policy related to voting a revised and improved set of deletion guidelines sophia light made a post pointing out that entries could be deleted prior to the author receiving good feedback since all it needed was 4 votes after it went low enough therefore it was proposed that a 24 hour grace period be imposed so the author could get as much feedback as possible it was approved unanimously

so as the wiki moved into 2011 things were definitely changing fast rapidly evolving policy membership and staff roster had rocked the stability of the community but it still held up steadfast bright would be very influential in the coming days with the advent of brights rise and another boom in membership

2011 can be defined as a period where the wiki grew up wed had enough time to build up a more experienced community of writers who could be counted on to produce quality content we had a disorganized and weaker administrative team with one strong admin amongst a group of weaker or absentee administrators kain pathos crow gears snorlison pair of ducks and waxx had all but divorced themselves from wiki affairs

bright was the most influential person on the wiki being one of the few active administrators able to effectively run things in many of the january 2011 forum posts he is the first one to say anything often being a voice of dissent in one thread proposing the creation of a minutes of a foundation meeting story he posted this is not a roleplaying site which is basically what you are suggesting as an admin my vote is not to do this thing

the issue of deletion had long been a difficult one staff members were always hounded by deletion policy with events like the mass edit being the direct result but by january 2011 we faced the opposite problem our deletion process had become too efficient with entries being deleted as soon as they hit 5 authors were not able to get feedback on their articles and it was becoming problematic

on 05 command sophia light proposed a new system instead of carrying out deletion as soon as possible there would be a 24 hour grace period in addition four staff votes would be required for deletion with the person carrying out the deletion not being the one who finished the vote for it the memory of deletioncrazed staff was not far behind in their memory and caution had to be taken

while a minor issue at the time this decision has come to be a major policy issue regarding rewrites and ownership in this case it was decided that rewrites could be reverted if it no longer showed the quality of the original work even if the original author had created the rewrite the effects of this decision will be elaborated on later in this essay

there were a lot of new staff issues that would be coming up in the next few months and a new generation of senior staffers was necessary on march 5th 2011 bright promoted troyl and dexanote to senior staff and promoted pooryoric to moderation

the work of the new staff started quickly instituting the modern application system began on march 10th when drbright proposed disabling all applications and making the site free to join this was due to a postulation that the application didnt do enough to stop undesirables from gaining access to the wiki within a day six awful entries had been posted by new authors while this doesnt seem like much today it was pretty severe for the time

so within days weve been crapflooded three deletions in 24 hours of some of the most terrible writing ive seen around here in ages with another three more in the tubes waiting for the flush all posted by newbie authors within eleven hours of joining the site you may consider this my official crawling on my knees begging for a restored application process post  pooryoric

the severity of the influx caused many staff members to consider removing the 24 hour grace period with drbright pooryoric theraven troyl metaphorphosis light and quikngruvn agreeing to it however not everyone posting on 05command agreed user sophosblitz posted against removing the grace period

maybe just open them up for deletion votes when they get too low the way i see it if theyre just immediatelyautomatically deleted once they hit the lower bound itll be hard to keep track of the new content coming in and out even if you check the wiki daily

plus given the size of the userbase and active voters on the wikichat the delete after this value policy would just circumvent the reasons the whole 24hour grace period was implemented in the first place it just moves from 5 to 15 or 20 or negative whatever and when the size of the active userbase goes up the lower bound will have to be lowered to accomodate for the voting trends etc

the bad scps are bad but its not like theyll slip through the cracks and stay around for too long but its not like you can expect every new addition of content to be good part of what a creative writing community does is offer criticism and let people understand how they can improve before throwing something into the trash i think if theyre up for display as this is how you do it wrong for at least a defined albeit short period itll help the general userbase figure out whats bad and whats not and shift the general trend of new scps away from the bad im not senior staff so…ignore this if you want

edit i also think 3 bad scps in the first couple of days of a trial period is an overreaction  sophosblitz

drbright supported him with this post

all right laying this down here the reason we have a 24 hour grace period is so a user can see what they did wrong unless an scp is an obvious trolling attempt such as the racist beans no matter how low it gets in that 24 hour period do not delete it until that point there is no harm to leaving it up the full 24 hours this is about people knowing what they fucked up so they can do better next time  drbright

there were also changes to the chat during this month when clef decided to step down as chat owner in the chat he gave owner to a user named malachai and told them to choose who the new owner would be while it came close to being mann it was decided that waxx would become the new owner

later in the month waxx created scp minecraft this was really the first link between gaming and the foundation previously there had been the cyoa game and bijhan attempting to make an fps but these had not amounted to anything this became a social area for wiki members drgears drkens bright and theraven were staff members who played it lasted for a short while but created the first prolonged interest in scp community members gaming together currently a different minecraft server for foundation members exists as well as an offsite minecraft mod using some scp articles as the basis for the models

april was another time for promotions to go down bright promoted sorts to senior staff on april 2nd this was well received and was seen as an about time type of action on the 15th drmann and drlight were both going mia with light going on a vacation and mann deploying to iraq so quikngruvn and theraven were both promoted to administration

new staff members came at a time when they were desperately needed the flood of new people had increased dramatically more people were on the wiki than wed ever had before and demographics began to shift articles which had been popular for long periods of time began to get downvoted and as fewer older members stuck around the culture changed in larger ways the standard by which articles were judged was changing some older users voted based on how theyd seen articles evolve and the way it tied into the universe newfolk would judge everything based on the first time they saw it and only by the way it was written to them

they had a lot of questions and tried to raise a lot of discussion such as talks on object classes where the foundation originated from and how technologically advanced the foundation was this frustrated a lot of older members who wished to keep the old canon the way it was and not let the newbies change things

the clashes between older and newer wiki members created a divide some older members despised the new users for changing site standards and bringing down older articles they were fond of they would pounce on newfolk whenever they could nitpicking and being rude on the other hand new users often had limited and poor understanding of site culture and how scps were written many of them believed that lolfoundation was still in use and that all articles had to be scary

it wasnt just new people coming to the foundation on may 24th 2011 drgears returned after an extended absence hed been unable to reach the wiki due to mounting financial and personal difficulties he was only able to access the wiki via a cellphone which made it difficult for him to communicate gearss activity for the remainder of the year would be extremely sparse and he was unable to access the irc

on june 13th 2011 light took a leave of absence from the wiki she had been experiencing difficulties in staying connected with wiki affairs and decided that a temporary leave would be good for everyone her leave was among several that happened around the same time with theraven leaving afterwards

this created a greater demand for new staff members and so bright promoted echofourdelta to senior staff this was not a promotion based on a vote by all staff members but a decision by bright to fiat his promotion the next month would bring about more democratic promotions but this got the ball rolling it was the last time a staff member was promoted in this way sabitsuki was promoted to senior staff on july 11th

on july 29th the first real effort to clean up the tagging system began page tags had always been a sort of grey loosely defined area people had basically tagged their pages however they wanted and there were a lot of tags that were inaccurate only used for one article or contradictory in short the system was a mess staff recognized this and put troyl on to begin cleaning it up

ive started the first phase of the tag update which includes tagging all author pages creepypasta guides and foundation tales the latter of which i have defined broadly as anything written by a member of the site and posted here that is not an scp guide of some sort or author page

the rest will be done much more slowly but im trying to get this part done in one large chunk since no new files have been posted in a little bit i posted and stickied a thread on the forum which explains what im doing and the current process as well as how to filter the tag updates out of recent changes i should be done with this part of the tagging sometime tonight or early tomorrow morning  troyl

however the tag update would be a mixed success initially the amount of articles needing to be retagged or which had been tagged incorrectly was overwhelming tales and creepypastas were tagged fairly quickly but the process of actually moving in and clearing the tags was extremely difficult eventually the project would be set aside to focus on other issues

there was also some staff opposition to the changing of page tags at all drbright did not like the tag system and stated that people should be able to tag pages in whatever way they liked this opposition is another reason why the project was set aside

there had long been discussion on dclass personnel and their use in the foundation there was issue of whether they were actually obtained from death row or if they were terminated at the end of the month this culminated in several extended discussions on the chat and an eventual forum post by drgears

after several discussions on this topic i felt it best to present my personal view on the subject…

people after examining the class d system invariably ask the question where do they all come from it then normally evolves in to a rejection of the presented policy and requests to editreview how the class d are handled however this skips over what i feel is a rather large point

examine this the class d are very bad people who get used against even worse things they may die but they are all horrible rapists murderers and child molesters so its hard to feel too bad about it then at the end of the month we clean out all the scum we have left and bring in a new batch all for the greater good of humanity

does this sound like foundation policy or something to help people deal

how many actual conversations are held with the class d besides posttest interviews has anyone actually seen the endofmonth terminations who can actually confirm with 100 certainty that they are all scumoftheearth inmates

someone once measured out the total amount of classd needed permonth and it was pretty damn high however…how many people vanish in a month i mean just drop off the planet never to be seen again how many people die in accidents so bad they cant be identified by family or have closedcasket funerals how many homeless or off the grid people are there in the world who could vanish with littleno notice

who to say that unused class d are not shuffled around between sites who knows what they are being told who is to say that the whole system isnt set up to help maintain emotional detachment this is horrible but they were going to die anyway so its ok

i think the actual mechanism behind the class d is something that is found out only after long time employment once youve gotten deep enough that a little thing like a shard of the truth wont hurt as much…

or its just a cheap trick to try and bump up the horror of entries and the bad people get used on bad things for the greater good
whatever helps you sleep nights  drgears

but these small issues would be overshadowed by the demotion of a widely liked site user over an issue that set the precedent for plagiarism bans and staff conduct

sabitsuki was a member of senior staff briefly with an unfortunately undocumented tenure during the research for this essay very few posts made by sabitsuki were found with the ones that were located and subsequently identified consisting primarily of chat snippets or replies to people referring to her she seems to have been promoted primarily for likability and affability in irc three tales and one scp article created by her still exist with a high quality of writing one of her stories has been featured on the front page of the wiki

in august of 2011 pooryoric called her out for claiming she had created artwork belonging to a different artist sabitsuki confessed and subsequently deleted her wikidot account it was agreed that she would be immediately removed from senior staff the first time a staff member was removed for reasons not relating directly to the wiki due to the fact that she had committed plagiarism it was decided that leaving her as staff would set a poor example

the reactions displayed by members of senior staff varied some were extremely angry that someone would plagiarize work like that while others sympathized with her and advocated for leniency the eventual decision was that she would be allowed into the wiki while being watched to ensure no further instances of this behavior occurred sabitsuki left the community permanently shortly after the demotion

at the beginning of october staff members were going through the maxim of crosslinking is bad and trying to decide official policy on the issue was there to be no crosslinking a limited amount or anyone being free to do anything they wished

most staff seemed to approve of the crosslinks as long as they were done with appropriate context they also agreed that most crosslinking done on the wiki was not done in an appropriate way most linked to articles like scp682 or 914 trying to piggyback on their popularity of the higher rated articles on the wiki

inspired by the discussion on crosslinks the next subject to be tackled was merchandising the wiki unfortunately this discussion was decidedly less civil there was an ugly split between the staff members who did support merchandise and those who thought it would destroy the wiki questions raised by this discussion such as incorporation of the wiki who would hold the money and what it would be used for are still being debated

on october 11th photosynthetic was promoted from senior staff to moderation coincidentally on the same day the main scp list numbers 001999 became full wed filled every one of the original slots and there was now only one slot left seeing an opportunity site administration started a contest write a mythological creature as an scp with one winner being given the coveted scp1000 slot there were numerous entries including the current scp1337 the hitchhiker scp1013 cockatrice and scp1111 the white dog

the winning entry was scp1000 bigfoot created by thedeadlymoose their entry received the most votes by far ending at 46 with the runner up scp1111 receiving 39 votes after the contest ended scp1000 was created and everyone began to fill in the new entries to the scp series 2

on the 18th it was discovered that a thread had been deleted from 05command the thread in question was a disciplinary action for a user whose initials were fc after some investigation it was discovered that fc had complained to wikidot because she had the same username on multiple websites she felt that a thread which discussed disciplinary action against her and which mentioned her username constituted harassment in response the wikidot admins deleted the thread this caused a big fuss as many members of administration were miffed that wikidot would go into their forum and delete a thread outright

bright attempted to open communications with the wikidot team while the rest of staff discussed the issue fc herself claimed that she had been bullied and that staff had violated wikidots terms of service agreement although these claims are dubious at best moderator pooryoric was extremely torqued by the proceedings he made several posts in the thread that made it difficult for staff to argue their point being very personal and angry remarks

this incident marked the beginning of staff distrust in wikidot before this all experiences with them had been positive such as the master admin switchover and with pro accounts after this staff members would start making attempts to move off wikidot and to an environment where they would have greater control of wiki affairs there was also a thought of branching out what the wiki could do

november brought a new effort to put foundation writers into the realm of published fiction drgears proposed the electronic shadows project made to bring creepypasta and nonfoundationexclusive writings into an ebook format and sell it through amazon there was a lot of excitement for the project and many writers offered to post their works even the longlurking far2 posted in the discussion thread offering to assist with the management of the project

however despite several stories being posted electronic shadows didnt get off the ground there wasnt enough organization among the organizers and there was conflict with whether we could even legally sell an ebook or make one at all in the end these questions and the lack of coordination would doom electronic shadows before december

on november 19th gnosis made a post on 05command asking if the word faggotry should be allowed in site19 since some people could be offended by it waxx the chat owner made it clear that it would be allowed and any op who disagreed could tender their resignation if it bothered them to that degree

staff members like metaphorphosis and quikngruvn argued that this amounted to censorship and that a writing community advocating censorship was not a very clever idea this eventually spiraled into several very very long posts made by mann pooryoric nusquam metaphorposis and quikngruvn this was eventually settled with the agreement that it would only be punished if it was used in the context of a slur and not in an inoffensive context

in late november gnosis left the wiki taking with him his chatbot grapewhistle grape had been the chatbot used in site19 for most of the year and had replaced other bots such as magic8ball and nala with the departure of grape nala 20 was brought in by raven mackenzie to replace it at this time of writing nala is still the bot in use

the start of december specifically december 3rd was marked by yet another round of promotions thedeadlymoose was promoted to senior staff they were noted as having a definite drive to improve the site and giving good feedback adam smascher was promoted at the same time also to senior staff the next week on december 13th dexanote was promoted to moderation

in middecember there was a small issue of returning author rights user daydreamin who had written scp213 antimatter parasite came out of the woodwork and began editing it under a different account staff noticed this and didnt initially realize who he was however when the explanation came out he was allowed to continue and the edits stood this was one of the first new cases of old author coming back an issue that would dog the wiki in the coming year

as the year wound down there was one last major issue to discuss drkens and quikngruvn began serious work on a new foundation website away from wikidot we wanted to leave wikidot for a number of reasons most prominent being the fc deletion incident having control of the wiki just displayed that arbitrarily shook staff trust in the wikidot team and was the primary catalyst for change originally the project was proposed by mann with discussion on the project starting on november 26th and being primarily discussed near the end of the year

the first issue brought over about the site was how things would be transferred how would the scp articles and tales be moved over would it be in order or in the order of the highest to lowest rated

no im highly against anything that involves having to choose articles to move either we move the whole site or none of it  theraven

we would be moving it all but prioritizing the higher rated stuff first  adam smaschernusquam

nope i say if were determining priority like that we shouldnt be moving if you need a way to order transfers do it numerically by page  theraven

there was also the issue of how discussion pages would be transferred over due to the limitations of wikidot there was no easy way to move things such as the forums discussion pages or even page ratings to the new site this caused some tension between staff members and sparked some long posts by pooryoric

im not sure moving the forum will ever be doable… page transfers are easy its just tedium that makes that step slow a team of three or four of us could probably have all page content copied within a week or so if we kept at it the forums though im afraid would be a write off the options that spring to mind are screen shots of the pages as they stand or simply copying every individual post neither of which seem worth the effort required at all

normally i would agree with bright in that the forums and discussion threads are a fairly important if not integral part of the site community however the issue with wikidot unilaterally deleting fcssic discussion thread has me antsy the ability for users to go over our heads like that is not a weapon i like the idea of some of our less responsible users having particularly in light of all the trolling weve had recently personally id really like to get us off of wikidot as soon as were able especially since mann is willing to hold the url for us and if that means losing the forums its an acceptable loss in order to make sure no offended new user starts having our content removed under false pretenses

now

theraven making declarations like if x that makes me unhappy is considered we should avoid this entire line of thinking is unnecessarily hyperbolic and starts stupid arguments that bog us down far more than they help at no point did anyone ever say were going to move a few articles and ditch the rest whats being discussed is whether or not we should prioritize getting certain articles up first to ensure that readers migrate to the new location as we go instead of just dumping a whole new site on everyone and losing readers due to the jarring transition see no matter what we do were going to have to move pages one at a time unless someones invented a copy website button while no one was looking when you do things one at a time you have to pick an order to do them in if as you say no article is a higher priority than any other then it doesnt matter what order we do them in does it we may as well start with the high rated ones if you must be too close minded to even consider that option please simply suggest an alternate method of transfer rather than exaggeratedly shit on the whole plan just to make a point making suggestions to replace points you disagree with is helpful declaring youre too cool to play with the group is not  pooryoric

the format of the new site was one of many other points of contention there was an idea to create a showcase site which would be designed to show articles in a more immersive format if you werent logged in there would be no discussion page rating nothing that wasnt inuniverse this was also where the first discussion of slush piles appeared as a way of filtering stories on the showcase site stories of a certain rating were to be submitted to senior staff who would vote on them and if the vote passed it would be added to the site

the idea of making a showcase style site was more to kind of block things out designwise and start getting the url out there while we get the wiki solution as well as helping to ensure that as many articles as possible are already preserved in case something happens before were ready its not intended as a permanent solution

and were going to lose the forum and the discussion pages were going to lose the current ratings well probably have to learn new wiki markup for a lot of the things we do and we may not have modules for the things we depend on like ratings though it may be possible to build our own thats unfortunate but theres no way that ive been able to find to let us keep that but as yoric said the alternative is losing the entire site down the line

wikidots software would be ideal but unfortunately they killed the project for making their software freely distributed theres a version available but its an earlier release and it may have security issues and lack features we use

kensgx67 is currently project lead insofar as hes been putting in work to figure out what we need in terms of hosting quik if you can find decent wiki software thatll suit our purposes that would be awesome  dreverettmann

there would be more debate on how a new host for the scp wiki could be found but these would be less pronounced in the beginning of the coming year there was a storm brewing and it was about to breach the floodgates

the fifth year of the wiki started off with some drama photosynthetic accidentally deleted the forums this caused a small bit of panic until it was restored by bright it was the fourth or fifth time it had happened according to mann

notably snorlison rose from inactivity to post about the forum deletion on 05command indicating that he had been too busy with life to be active on the site but still following current events

on january 8th troyl posted in the emergency section 05command about the use of deleted accounts to boost the rating on certain articles several people had apparently been known to have deleted their account after voting or posting only a few times thus he proposed a policy of not counting votes which had originated from deleted wikidot accounts in deletion votes this measure was adopted by staff

on january 20th theraven discovered a wikidot wiki based on a mcd theme set up by users from somethingawful additionally theraven posted being uncomfortable with a wiki run by these users since they had been critical of the site in the past however most other staff seemed to have no issue with it and troyl pointed out that since staff couldnt tell them not to do something they should just let them do it and keep an eye on them

troyl also began to run a sequel series to his wellliked series and then i died it was a collection of stories about scp articles killing people it lasted for several months before being shut down by troy partially due to difficulty in guessing the scp objects

on january 31st judgedead made a forum post showing the chinese scp foundation translation site the first time this site had been seen by the english scp foundation two days later on february 2nd echofourdelta and troyl reached out to the chinese giving them official recognition and linking them from the front page of the wiki

february brought about a change for the editing policy on old articles scp090 apocorubiks cube was rewritten by a user named gxs who claimed to be the original author this was an article that had been written on editthis so the original authorship could not be conclusively determined the decision was made by troyl pooryoric and photosynthetic to revert the change drgears made this post in the thread

agreed orginal author or not if you rewrite something and make it start dropping it should be reverted were here not for anyones ego ideally but to create a positive body of work normally im happy to let folks make their own mistakes but i think a revert in this was a good idea  drgears

later that month on february 13th theraven made an 05 post calling pooryoric out on behavior in the forums yoric had taken it upon himself to edit another users post and make disparaging remarks in the thread all because the user soullesshumannow soullesssingularity had claimed that the story was the first they had posted this was true in a way soulless had posted a creepypasta that had been deleted but never a tale they had received staff permission before going to call this tale their first

in any case yorics actions were seen as entirely inappropriate editing another users post because you disagreed with them or because you were upset at what they had done was an abuse of moderation power adam smascher put it this way in the 05 thread

calling soulless out whatever thats all well and good i couldnt care less using moderator rights to edit her post and call her a liar thats damn petty and completely unnecessary making it into an argument in the discussion thread dredging up a copy of her deleted creepypasta attempt and posting it with the context of an implicit threat issued in pms is frankly unacceptable to me  adam smascher

by the next day administration had decided that yorics behavior was severe enough to warrant demotion from moderator to senior staff member this decision was made by bright mann light and troyl

yoric posted in the thread shortly afterwards trying to defend himself explaining that a series of unfortunate events had caused him to be upset including mishearing about the death of a friend and having his girlfriends religious beliefs disparaged by other staff members in addition he made the claim that the thread had been made two days after the issue had been resolved

gears and troy pointed out that his sense of timing was off and that the thread had been created before he thought it had been and that hed been warned many times about these infractions

weve told you several times to leave soulless the hell alone weve told you several times to be more aware of what youre posting at that sometimes silence is the best statement youve been warned many times by me alone that youre not on terribly thick ice and that if there continue to be incidents action will have to be taken yes it hurts and it feels wrong im not sure how well id take it if i was bounced down but it should not be a total bolt from the blue  drgears

as yoric was being demoted another old demoted user resurfaced dr kondraki who had been stripped of his powers and taken a selfexile from the scp community several years prior contacted dexanote with this appeal

hello again

itll be three years this june three years since i was banned from the site19 chat and left the wiki since i caused the chaos that led to my eventual dismissal as an administrator while the majority of you werent there those who were still remember my mistakes

some of you might be expecting me to attempt to excuse these mistakes or attempt to defame those who brought charges against me in an attempt to ameliorate my own guilt i did not write this with either of those things in mind however because to do so would be dishonest i did those things and i was punished for them my goal however with this appeal is not to explain away my crimes but to simply ask for a second look upon the perpetrator

three years is a very long time when placed within the transition from high school to college from the easy wins and passing grades to a world where things now mattered and a lack of attention or seriousness could lend towards actual consequences simply put the me that you banned is gone lost to that moment in time that exists now only in the minds of those who remain resolute on maintaining my ban i can only imagine that you may still see me as that immature child who may cause the same problems that you banished me for in the first place but i ask you to simply take a second look

while i was never banned from the wiki i never posted again after being removed from the chat this was a simple decision for me one that hasnt changed since i first made it the reason is clear being part of the official chat is an integral part of the creative experience here i suggested a chat in the first place as a way to better communicate to more efficiently work together and to this day it serves this function so this appeal is not for my access to the wiki but to be given the right to once again speak freely amongst the community i once belonged to

so in conclusion i would like to state my purpose once more in clarity i wish to return to scp and one again provide content as i once did unlike some others who have also departed i left my work to your hands once i was gone knowing that it was part of something greater all i ask is a chance to once again be part of the ever evolving universe that i once so fervently contributed to

sincerely

dr kondraki — drkondraki

the decision was that since he had never been banned kondraki would be able to return to the site without incident although kondraki has resurfaced shortly several times since this proclamation he has not been a seriously involved member of the scp community since 2009

by the end of the month what had been the normal trickle of new site users rapidly exploded although the reason for the sudden population boom wasnt immediately apparent it still had to be dealt with numerous new scp articles were being posted every day and many of them were extremely poor staff was overwhelmed as they attempted to deal with this sudden user surge

just a random look and realization weve known that tons more people have been joining lately but this is crazy

site started in july 08

from july 08  july 09 we got about 450 new members

from july 09  july 10 we got about 530 new members

from july 10  july 11 we got about 625 new members

from july 11  present we have had over 2000 new members more than all the previous years combined  rhettsarlin

it would soon become apparent where this surge came from an scp game about scp087 the original game was buggy lowtech and very primitive it was also very popular gaining attention from gaming sites such as rock paper shotgun it drew thousands of new users into the scp foundation community this surge of new users dwarfed the previous booms seen when the foundation was featured on tvtropes and other websites as an example to how things were immediately changed the lowest pages usually reached prior to the scp087 game was between 7 and 10 after the game entries could get as low as 20 or even 30

but this would soon be overshadowed by the arrival of an even bigger game on march 6th 2012 site user djoric noted the development of a new scp foundation game called containment breach

the arrival of containment breach is the most powerful event to impact the wiki never before had one thing created such an influx of traffic recognition and new users it created the attention needed to inspire the minecraft mod and the traffic created by new users was the catalyst for moving to a better site the game itself is about a dclass who is chased by scp173 throughout site19 it also features several other scp articles including scp420j scp106 scp096 scp895 scp372 scp860 and scp079 it is being developed by a finnish man named regalis

this game combined with the other games inspired by it brought about a wave of unprecedented traffic to the wiki we went from having 50 applications in a month to having that many every day that number kept up every day and resulted in the number of new articles being posted increasing dramatically this would cause some great new content to be created but also caused a lot of headaches for mods and admins

one of the problems generated by the new traffic was causing wikidot to glitch and act erratically these have been everything from seeing other profiles when you log in constant page refreshing the website crashing in general to the forums being disabled and votes being counted multiple times

on march 23rd mackenzie launched the revamping of the sites tagging system previously users had been able to tag any article with more or less no oversight and as such the tag system had become incredibly bloated and unwieldy while until now staff had been content to let things stay in the status quo and there were still a few at this point who didnt believe it the change needed to occur

hundreds of useless or bloated tags were deleted simplified and standardized it was a monumental effort and one which users are reminded of every day when theyre actually able to use the site tags to find articles

the 3rd of april had more discussion of scp076 on 05command where adam smascher proposed the creation of a new rewrite on it this proposed rewrite wouldve updated able to a point where the foundation would terminate him following the end of omega7 although several staff members supported the change it was denied by others including kainthe original author and clefthe author of the current rewrite

the original scp foundation i wrote for is long gone we had things that were mere oddities here because they didnt work well with the laws of reality bad things and good things dangerous and beneficial granted im not saying we had the best of things or even decent things but for me it worked vaguely reminiscent of eerie indiana sure there was weird shit bad things happened but it was more about the panoply of the bizarre rather than only the hideous

now it seems that everything we have is some psychological horror from beyond the depths of time and space there is no good or even gray merely differing shades of black hope is a useless word and everything in this world is corrupted in some sort of way and while thats nice and all well… its tiring for me i dont deal well with that kind of thing i cant watch scary movies i can barely play horror games i have an innate sense for what makes people scared but thats just me listing what terrifies me

despite what people might think able wasnt a marysue for me i just thought it would be a nice thing to write at the time and it has been one of the most read most loved and most hated of anything ive ever written do i regret writing it no do i regret how its changed no do i regret the hate it pulls actually that makes me laugh more than anything why because they remembered it  kain pathos crow

in the end it was decided that the current rewrite of scp076 would be allowed to stand due to its satisfactory rating and mixed reception it had received from other senior staffers

on april 10th drgears made a forum post about a possible new way to structure project foundation

a long long time ago we were batting around ideas about the site direction and i had a thought basically it involves a twinsite concept basically the wiki remains more or less untouched but as a “factory floor” ideas are proposed worked out refined and posted stories written all of that however there is now a “showroom” site which holds the top entries the most creepy bizarre and generally wellreceived ones we have the entries almost anyone can point at and say “this is a good example” — drgears

drkens a staffer with experience in web design posted that doing a showroom website would be simple and not difficult to accomplish however adam smascher posted asking whether such a site would be pointless since most users wouldnt care about it and the function was just as easily done with the top rated page drgears posted that such a page would be helpful to immersion but not all agreed immersion was always good

im generally against the idea because wed end up with a lot more of them idjits going omg the scp is real and well the idea seems kind of exclusive  drbright

there was also discussion on what articles would make it into a showroom site and which would be left behind the general consensus was that all articles over 30 would be shown on this showroom site this applied to mainlist articles specifically leaving js out of the process it also had the potential to act as a backup forum in case wikidot went down

there were many other similar discussions on 05 about future migration such as terms of service slush pile policy membership money and legal stuff

senior staffer pooryoric made a return to the forums on april 24th his first major post since the incident in february explaining why he had been inactive since the soulless incident there had been a cavalcade of issues in his life which had prevented him from interacting with the community this was met with a favorable reaction in the thread where he was informed of new information and generally welcomed back

the eric character was removed from the goi list on april 22nd for being more of an injoke than a goi

the groups of interest page had long been a familiar board of organizations there had been occasional new entries such as dr wondertainment and alexylva university but these were few and far between this year however there were several new groups of interest including the fifth church gru division p a soviet anomaly collecting organization the horizon initiative a religious organization and the most popular are we cool yet

gru division p was created by vaelynx a fan of soviet history who had long wanted to make the soviet union have a greater narrative presence in the scp universe grup was made possible by him collaborating with a few articles creating enough content to justify being on the list

the horizon initiative primarily used by dmatix and djoric was added due to the massive amount of content amassed behind it including a 001 proposal it focused on a collection of abrahamic religions working together with anomalous elements the fifth church was a take on more modern religions such as scientology and evangelism

are we cool yets addition came after voct added the entry on april 14th 2012 the day after he rewrote scp1057 this was in addition to several other articles with the other notable being yorics 2011 coming soon from a gallery near you

on may 2nd 2012 troyl made a post on 05command regarding theravens conduct as an administrator of the scp wiki he provided evidence of theraven acting rashly and making kneejerk decisions when presented with problems evidence was provided in several chat logs which showed theraven reacting to several situations in a manner troyl postulated as not fit for an administrator

the logs showed theraven making hotheaded statements and generally not acting in the way expected of somebody with administrative capacity he was voted out of his position as administrator to regular user by a supermajority vote

adam smascher posted about the deletions guide on the 5th of may his proposals for changing the deletion threshold from 5 to 10 was accepted as was the new designation of the 25 early deletion point other things such as four votes with a staff member who isnt the fourth voter deleting were also added

rhettsarlin made a proposal which may sound familiar to modern readers when on may 9th he proposed the creation of technical staff while not being completely similar to the modern staff structure it is notable that this is the first time a different structure to staff was really proposed and discussed even if the discussion amounted to a rejection of the proposal

on may 19th adam smascher posted on the 05 emergency forums reporting the severe glitching and errors which had been coming off the site due to the wikidot infrastructure being unable to handle traffic coming to the wiki there were problems of posts being repeated multiple times lag when making a post or navigating to a new page and being taken to pages you werent trying to get to

there was a fear that if wikidot suddenly collapsed the community wouldnt be able to recover being scattered as different people tried to reorganize or recreate the community on their own the prospect of moving to a new site which had been somewhat dormant came back to the forefront on may 25th several staff members discussed the possibility of a site move with raven mackenzie which showed that she had been creating new code for a nextgeneration version of the foundation website this would become project foundation a nextgeneration project for the scp foundation wiki

on the 29th the deletion guide received a significant rewrite in light of new site standards and the influx of new users

sorts posted on june 4th regarding old test logs and how to edit them this is where the consensus of three staff members to revert came into being after some extraordinarily poor testing logs being added to scp447 and scp423

by the 11th the creation of any new guide was suspended due to an administrative review of the current guides it had been decided that there were too many guides to the point that a guide to guides was necessary in order to organize and explain them there were over 30 different guides on the wiki and it created an enormous obstacle for new people wishing to join

sorts posted to the wiki user section of 05command on june 27th after a wiki user named scroton had laid claim to scp579 and scp071 scroton claimed to be the original author from editthis and attempted to prove it by showing his original drafts created in an old notebook some staff members were pleased to see old authors returning however there was the issue of whether site policy allowed for old authors to reclaim and change works

im conflicted on this its something thats either one way or the other  either the author has total control over what theyve posted or they dont on the one hand stated wiki policy has been that if an author wants their work deleted this sounds tangential but theres a point i promise then it will be with no questions asked on the other hand precedent exists for the author not having absolute control — adam smascher

the precedent referred to is the scp090 rewrite which was reverted after the original author changed the article and resulted in it nearly being deleted this set a precedent for staff control over older articles and an ability to revert if old authors changed things in a way the community thought worsened its quality

the guide reform was completed on july 17th with new versions of the deletions tagging how to write an scp object classes and others being streamlined or moved to the new essay format

on the 22nd a user named squonk asked for permission to join the site he was fishmonger1 and he claimed to have penance for his actions years ago his message to the site was

hello gears its fish

two years ago i was a total jerk to you and a lot of other people i dont mean the separation from the site that was just the coup de grace of a long suffering period of asininity i would like to start off the message by sincerely apologizing to you and the rest of the site for my behavior and my flagrant and repeated transgressions against the scp community i was in short out of control and you and the other admins did what you had to do to effect control leading up to and including my expulsion from the site i do not hold that against you again i was a complete asshole and the punishments enacted against me were both fair and warranted

im approaching you about this subject now for two reasons one because events of the last two years have caused me to realize how much of a bastard ive been to many people and that i dont want to be that person anymore i have tried to make considerable changes in my behavior and my attitude over the past two years in order to better integrate with people in both my real life and on the internet ive been fortunate to have many people help me in that regard not the least of which is my domestic partner whose patience and determination has been greatly influential im frankly humbled that after causing so much misery in the world that there are still people who think i am worth the effort to try to help

the second reason is because i have as you tried to explain to me two years ago only hurt myself and the fans of my work by having you take down my submissions to the scp i dont propose that those should be reinstated too much history has occurred in the interim for that to be canonically practical and in any case i wouldnt suggest it anyway as i realize that would be arrogant but if it is acceptable to the administration i would like to request my reinstatement as an author i ask for no special privileges im willing to perform any atonement deemed necessary i will start from square one go through boot camp jump through whatever hoops are set before me to prove my desire is sincere indeed this is why i have started a new account rather than attempt to salvage the old one and have come to you openly rather than try to hide my identity i would only like the chance to add something again to the site and perhaps in some small way reverse the damage i have caused previously if it is ultimately decided that such a provision is not worth the risk that i will return to old habits and my plea for redemption is denied then i will also accept that judgment without complaint as fair and make no further attempt to sway you

thank you for your consideration — fishmonger

while there was initial positive reaction from newer staff members the older ones who had suffered through the fish debacle balked at the idea of allowing him to return to the site his appeal was declined2

in the 14th of august quikngruvn posted in the emergency section of 05command that drgears wikidot pro account had expired and as such no additional images could be uploaded immediately there was a scramble to contact drgears and to purchase another pro account

gears was not available due to pressing difficulties in his actual life in a discussion lasting until october 3rd it was decided that since any fundraising funds had been spent on the last pro account and for testing of a possible future site hosting and since drmann had controlled the account which paid for both of those that mann would be made the master administrator for the purpose of keeping the pro account active

most of the threads in the mostlyunused voting section of 05command were also added in august about membership submissions and the rules of voting there was also a later thread in november about having numbers in usernames

on september 12th murphyslaw drewbear djoric erich and roget were put up for senior staff promotion with soulless being placed up for moderation on the 29th all were given promotions by the end of the 16th except roget for whom it was decided more time was necessary there was one administrative promotion done which was the first to be done using the new system sorts was nominated by troyl after a series of discussions with other administrators

it was pointed out to me today that we did have someone wed talked about promoting to administrator a few times now and given his current level of work on the site i was remiss in not bringing it up from now on an individual thread will be made for each rank for all potential promotions if no people are up for promotion a thread will be made noting that fact as you might have noticed with the moderator thread that was just made

but we do have someone

to administration sorts  troyl

the promotion went through unanimously

necroposting came up in early october with a general consensus of it not being a big deal with general consensus saying six months was long enough time for an inactive thread to be locked down

on october 8th 2012 far2 made a return appearance in the forums posting a wikidot module which could serve as a backnext button this was followed by a brief period of activity as far2 began writing a story based on a post he had created in another thread about foundation energy sources when it was posted the story was met with a mediocre response and was subsequently deleted3 following this he resumed inactivity and has not posted since

on october 11th after an informal agreement in the staff chat dexanote removed the irg group of interest from the groups of interest page itd been decided that since the irg was a real organization it shouldnt really belong on the page however no note was made of this deletion on the page or on the admin site people quickly noticed and raised a fuss about it

wiki user gaffney volunteered to change the irg into a more palatable and fictional organization the office for the reclamation of islamic artifacts or oria most articles which were attached to the irg were switched over to the oria with the exceptions of bijhans personnel file and several archived articles which had been authored by bijhan

on october 19th the scp foundation forums became inaccessible to normal user access the issue lasted from 818 amest to 214 pmest it was caused by a bug on wikidot related to a new feature they had introduced shortly before the incident occurred and had affected numerous other sites

on november 26th sophia light retired from administration and took up a position as a moderator it was simply too much to try and keep up with the new pace of the site in addition to balancing real life business

this has been a while coming but ive found that now and in the likely future ive been unable to give the wiki the time or attention that it deserves as such im officially stepping down as administrator back to mod its been good run but i think this will suit me and the site best

cheers everyone — sophia light

on december 11th the second round of regular promotions began with staff and mod promotions being given roget dmatix silber and jekeled up for staff promotion after a 3 day period of voting roget dmatix and jekeled were promoted to senior staff silber received 54 of the vote which was deemed by administration to be insufficient to justify a senior staff promotion for moderation heiden drewbear and eskobar were nominated and each received a unanimous backing from all voters in the pool

later in december an scp foundation themed modification of the pc game minecraft had been created and was being distributed through the minecraft forums this in of itself was not an issue but the mod was another case of improper licensing and attribution the mod creators had claimed copyright over all the modifications resources which was invalid due to the creative commons license

senior staff members were able to contact the modders when an initial post on their forum was made by echofourdelta there was initial misunderstanding from the modding community that they were in some way being punished this was soon smoothed over and the modders were able to successfully apply the creative commons license to their product

with the minecraft mod adding to the overwhelming amount of improperly licensed or nonlicensed materials being produced administration decided that something had to be done about the situation prior to this an unofficial guide to the creative commons licence had been created by user syka but a more substantial and official document was needed to show the numerous license seekers how to obtain it so on december 12th the licensing guide was created

this guide was a brief but detailed explanation on how outside parties could create sell or otherwise distribute merchandise based on the scp foundation it went over how to properly attribute the works they were deriving the limits and restrictions placed on selling these items and a simplified but informative guide on the sharealike portion of creative commons

later in the month on december 24th the scpru site posted a guide of xkclass scenarios this page was eventually downvoted into deletion range due to the canon of the page being closer to the scpru site and using some fishmonger details

so this concludes our trip through the history of the scp foundation wiki at least for now after a not insignificant amount of time hopefully the end was worth the wait my goal is that by knowing our history we will be able to know the mistakes and triumphs of our past and be able to apply it to the future maybe well have more sweet contests or move to a new site or maybe something unexpected will happen that totally blows us all away i see a great future for this community and i look forward to experiencing it with you

thank you for reading1embed"
