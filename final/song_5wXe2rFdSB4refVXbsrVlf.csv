another night of being wasted
staring at your name staring at your name
i think youre hanging out somewhere downtown
i wonder who you dancing with now
are you doing the same are you doing the same

close my eyes and were still naked
but then i see that my clock is changing
its just another night on the other side
oh woah oh woah woah
its just another night on the other side
oh woah oh woah woah
its just another night on the other side
on the other side

hiding on the ground with the cool kids
i just choose to not wanna choose this
were living different lives were living different lives

theres gonna be a way between us
tearing down the walls of secrets
its just another night on the other side
oh woah oh woah woah
its just another night on the other side
oh woah oh woah woah
its just another night on the other side
on the other side

tearing down our walls of secrets
