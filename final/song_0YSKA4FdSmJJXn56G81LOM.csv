verse 1
just a few years ago
she was too young for me to know so i had to let her go
i cut off ties said my goodbyes
and it kinda hurt to make a young jawn cry
now just yesterday i saw her around the way
and we sparked up a little conversation
she be diggin on me like a gold miner
and since then she got a whole lot finer and

hook
im caught up with her im so caught up with her
im caught up with her im so caught up with her
im caught up with her im so caught up with her
im caught up with her im so caught up with her
