if you ask me im ready

verse 1 drake  alicia keys
ugh tez keeps tellin me he just turned 30
havin dreams of bein single forever hes gettin worried
and im scared too cause im in the same boat
good women are rare too none of them have came close
me i havent changed much you know how i play it
better safe than sorry
stead of searchin for substance at every single party
baby bein part of this life
i feel like im bound to end up with somebody thats been with everybody
i need you to rescue me from my destiny
im tryna live right and give you whatevers left of me yeah
cause you know life is what we make it
and a chance is like a picture itd be nice if you just take it
or let me take it for you im just down to ride
or we can roll around the city til you finally decide
ive got more than a thing for you tattoo and an ink for you
right over my heart girl ill do the unthinkable

verse 2 alicia keys  drake
moment of honesty
someones gotta take the lead tonight
whos it gonna be
im gonna sit right here and tell you all that comes to me
if you have somethin to say you should say it right now
you should say it right now
