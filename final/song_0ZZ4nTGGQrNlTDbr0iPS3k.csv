i know i vowed to never do this again but uh
i guess this seems to be the only thing im good at
got something that you need to know
be the realest shit i never wrote
cant hold it gotta let it go
know that i mean every note
yeah yeah listen baby

verse 1
let me start by saying that the way i feel for you has never once changed
and the games i played mistakes i made leave me sorrier than youll ever know
we got a problem baby i cant lie
cause lately i realize that i
never knew that we was on the same playing field
knew that it was wrong but we let it be
and i know you never knew when you said i do
that you would have to face all the pain you feel

chorus
and its killing me girl that you have to live with this
live with the lies i tell live with the pain you feel
knowing the man you love is fooling around
oh baby said its killing me girl
said i just dont understand why you wanna be with this kind of man oh oh
why would you love a fool with all the things i do
i know its hard for you hard for you to live with this

trade memories for moments trade love to be lonely
guess thats just the man in me blame it on celebrity
when the night time feel like the right time
and that spotlight feel like the right light
when its really just my fears and i still dont dry your tears
when i say she aint you and i really love you more
and you say if its true why you do it for
and i i really dont have no excuse
i break your heart make you cry i just wanna say goodbye

chorus
and its killing me girl that you have to live with this
live with the lies i tell live with the pain you feel
knowing the man you love is fooling around
oh baby said its killing me girl
said i just dont understand why you wanna be with this kind of man oh oh
why would you love a fool with all the things i do
i know its hard for you hard for you to live with this

bridge
what i feel i dont even gotta write it
its like poison in my body and theres no way to deny
that my heart is a time bomb with seconds left to explode
but i gotta let you know before it blows
that it aint on you its my fault
all the gossip and talk behind your back when you walk
by the time you will know before long you will see
that you deserve more you deserve more
you deserve so much more than what im offering
chorus
and its killing me girl that you have to live with this
live with the lies i tell live with the pain you feel
knowing the man you love is fooling around
oh baby said its killing me girl
said i just dont understand why you wanna be with this kind of man oh oh
why would you love a fool with all the things i do
i know its hard for you hard for you to live with this

outro
