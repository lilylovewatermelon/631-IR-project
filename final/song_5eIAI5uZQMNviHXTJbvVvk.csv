how long how long will i slide
well separate my side

verse 1
i heard your voice through a photograph
i thought it up it brought up the past
once you know you can never go back
i gotta take it on the otherside

well centuries are what it meant to me
a cemetery where i marry the sea
a stranger thing could never change my mind
i gotta take it on the otherside

take it on the otherside
take it on take it on
