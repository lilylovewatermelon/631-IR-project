hang your weary head you seem defeated
like the little girl youve been with cheated
and in the conversation had to go too far
now your dropped off drunk in the back of your heart

chorus
so dry your lily eyes dont be so cruel
using all you know its meant for fools

verse 2
see youre smoking up in the parking lot
shake your little butt show them what you got
 hot and the men all want and the chase is on 
now your flag is flying in the dark and cold

chorus

bridge
its in a celebration
theres something in the air
a little celebration
theres something in the air

verse 3
are you all giving up dont want to know now
and everybody sees everybody in your town
oh and the small town girl she went and got a bar
she going to shake it off she gonna give them what shes got

outro
this is a celebration
theres something in the air
a little celebration
theres something in the air
this is a celebration
theres something in the air
a little celebration
theres something in the air2embed"
