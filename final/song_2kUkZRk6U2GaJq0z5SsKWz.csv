i wonder if you’ll notice
if they lock me up and throw away the key
try to be open minded
you’ve got a lot to learn in the ways of me
you always got to say something
i’m none of your concern but you wont listen at all
you know i’d rather say nothing
and just be proud of myself for tearing down these walls

chorus
when you fall i’ll be the only one who looks away
when you call i’ll be the first to tell you i can’t stay
it’s all over i found a better way
to help keep you from me

postchorus
i’m better off this way woahoh woahohoh
im better off this way woahoh woahohoh

verse 2
you gotta keep this coming
tell it like you know it but you don’t know nothing
your call we can settle this like gentlemen
or meet me out the back to end it all and start again
my whole life’s spent waiting
ever since i can remember been anticipating your fall
and god let it be a long one
can’t let go of my grudge till i know you’re done
see a day to remember liveget tickets as low as 108you might also likechorus

you want it you’ve got it
you’ve always been such a waste of time
you want it you’ve got it
a friend of yours is no friend of mine
you want it you’ve got it
when will you act your age
you want it you’ve got it
you’re the reason things have to change

prechorus
woahoh woahohoh you’re the reason things have to change
woahoh woahohoh

when you call i’ll be the first to tell you i can’t stay
