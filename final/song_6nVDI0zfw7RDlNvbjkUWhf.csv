you think your days are uneventful
and no one ever thinks about you
she goes her own way
she goes her own way
you think your days are ordinary
and no one ever thinks about you
but were all the same
and she can hardly breathe without you

chorus
she says she has no time for you now
she says she has no time

verse 2
well think about the lonely people
or think about the day she found you
or lie to yourself
and see it all dissolve around you

chorus
she says she has no time for you now
she says she has no time for you now
she says she has no time

bridge
lonely people tumble downwards
and my heart opens up to you

when she says she has no time for you now
she says she has no time for you now
she says she has no time5embed"
