your mother came up to me
she wanted answers only she should know
only she should know
it wasnt easy to deal
with the tears that rolled down her face
i had no answers cause i didnt even know you

chorus
but these words they cant replace
the life you the life you waste

verse 2
how could you paint this picture
was life as bad as it should seem
that there were no more options for you
i cant explain how i feel
ive been there many times before
ive tasted the cold steel of my life crashing down before me

chorus
but these words they cant replace
the life you the life you waste

verse 3
did daddy not love you
or did he love you just too much
did he control you
did he live through you at your cost
did he leave no questions
for you to answer on your own
see staind liveget tickets as low as 41you might also likebridge
well fuck that and fuck her and fuck him and fuck you
for not having the strength in your heart to pull through
ive had doubts i have failed ive fucked up ive had plans
doesnt mean i should take my life with my own hands

chorus
but these words they cant replace
the life you the life you waste

outro
but these words they dont replace
the life you the life you waste2embed"
