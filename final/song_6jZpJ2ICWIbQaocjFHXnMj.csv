verse 1
they tried to tell me i wouldnt be shit
family doubted i couldnt believe
i had to focus and better myself
fightin anxiety smokin these trees
i got caught up tryna run up a juug
locked me up felt like im never gon leave ohoh
life is so rough you aint show me no love ohoh
time to be selfish and focus on me
niggas tried tell me i wasnt gon win oh
they tried to knock me up off of my grind no no no
aint motivated then get out my face oh
negative energy left it behind no no no
i made a promise my niggas gon ball no no no
