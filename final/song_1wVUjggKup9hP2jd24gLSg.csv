you spend your days counting the hours youre awake
and when night covers the sky you find yourself doing the same
its a burden youve been burying in spite of all your prayers
as the light turns off inside your heart can you remember
what its like to care
knees are weak hands are shaking i cant breathe

chorus
so give me the drug keep me alive
give me whats left of my life
dont let me go
pull this plug let me breath
on my own im finally free
dont let me go

verse 2
the trail of crumbs you left somehow got lost along the way
if you never meant to leave then you only had to stay
with the memories that haunt us i cherish just the same
as the ones that bring us closer to the sky no matter how grave
yet i fall through these clouds and shes screaming

chorus
so give me the drug keep me alive
give me whats left of my life
dont let me go
pull this plug let me breath
on my own im finally free
dont let me go

this grip loosens but it never breaks
we carry nothing but a name you will forsake
your words are always there to break my fall
and now i find the comfort to see through it all

bridge
guide me through uncharted waters
before we lose our way again
will you be my compass
until forever until forever ends
knees are weak hands are shaking i cant breathe

chorus
so give me the drug keep me alive
give me whats left of my life
dont let me go
pull this plug let me breath
on my own im finally free
dont let me go

outro
dont let me go6embed"
