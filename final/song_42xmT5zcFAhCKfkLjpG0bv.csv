thanks hannah thanks for coming back

verse 1
the citys so in style
all you see for miles are people spilling in and out of cars
man all of these bars are making a killin
everywhere i go looks like the place to be
i see people that i know but i feel like theres no one here but me

chorus
downtowns dead without you
girls walk by and friends say hi
but friday night it might as well be just another
tuesday night without you
as long as youre still in my head
there aint no way that i can paint a ghost town red
downtowns dead downtowns dead yeah

verse 2
theyre dancing in the strobes
out here in the throes of loud house music
everythings a blur
i dont hear the words but lips are moving
tried to get involved but ive bout had enough
people wall to the wall
and im just holdin it up cause
see sam hunt liveget tickets as low as 32you might also likechorus
downtowns dead without you
girls walk by and friends say hi
but friday night it might as well be just another
tuesday night without you
as long as youre still in my head
there aint no way that i can paint a ghost town red
downtowns dead downtowns dead

bridge
free drinks bright lights
what am i doing with my life
okay i quit ive had enough of this
cause people are losing their minds
cant get you out of my head
im calling it a night
im crawling back to your bed

chorus
downtowns dead without you
girls walk by and friends say hi
but friday night it might as well be just another
tuesday night without you
as long as youre still in my head
there aint no way that i can paint a ghost town red
downtowns dead downtowns dead
outro
