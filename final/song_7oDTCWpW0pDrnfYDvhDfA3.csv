its playin all my favorite memories
one by one they take me back
to the days when you were mine
and i cant stop this jukebox in my mind

i dont need no quarters dont need any dime
you filled it up forever
when you said goodbye
heaven knows i love old melodies
they were meant to ease the pain
but the kind thats playin on my mind
are drivin me insane

in the corner of my mind stands a jukebox
its playin all my favorite memories
one by one they take me back
to the days when you were mine
and i cant stop this jukebox in my mind

song by song those melodies
were meant to ease the pain
but the kind thats playin on my mind
are drivin me insane

in the corner of my mind stands a jukebox
its playin all my favorite memories
one by one they take me back
to the days when you were mine
and i cant stop this jukebox in my mindsee alabama liveget tickets as low as 58you might also likeembed"
