i am not throwing away my shot
i am not throwing away my shot
hey yo im just like my country
im young scrappy and hungry
and im not throwing away my shot
ima get a scholarship to kings college
i probly shouldnt brag but dag i amaze and astonish
the problem is i got a lot of brains but no polish
i gotta holler just to be heard
with every word i drop knowledge
im a diamond in the rough a shiny piece of coal
tryin to reach my goal my power of speech unimpeachable
only nineteen but my mind is older
these new york city streets get colder i shoulder
evry burden evry disadvantage
i have learned to manage i dont have a gun to brandish
i walk these streets famished
the plan is to fan this spark into a flame
but damn its getting dark so let me spell out the name
i am the—

a colony that runs independently
meanwhile britain keeps shittin on us endlessly
essentially they tax us relentlessly
then king george turns around runs a spending spree
he aint ever gonna set his descendants free
so there will be a revolution in this century

geniuses lower your voices
you keep out of trouble and you double your choices

youve got to be carefully taught

burr check what we got
mister lafayette hard rock like lancelot
i think your pants look hot
laurens i like you a lot
lets hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin the pot
what are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
poppin a squat on conventional wisdom like it or not
a bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists
give me a position show me where the ammunition is

oh am i talkin too loud
sometimes i get overexcited shoot off at the mouth
i never had a group of friends before
i promise that ill make yall proud

i imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
whens it gonna get me
in my sleep seven feet ahead of me
if i see it comin do i run or do i let it be
is it like a beat without a melody
see i never thought id live past twenty
where i come from some get half as many
ask anybody why we livin fast and we laugh reach for a flask
we have to make this moment last thats plenty
scratch that
this is not a moment its the movement
where all the hungriest brothers with
something to prove went
foes oppose us we take an honest stand
we roll like moses claimin our promised land
and if we win our independence
is that a guarantee of freedom for our descendants
or will the blood we shed begin an endless
cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants
i know the action in the street is excitin
but jesus between all the bleedin n fightin
ive been readin n writin
we need to handle our financial situation
are we a nation of states whats the state of our nation
im past patiently waitin
im passionately smashin every expectation
every actions an act of creation
im laughin in the face of casualties and sorrow
for the first time im thinkin past tomorrow
