you got starch in your flow i flow too many ways
got a arch in my flow all sorts of flow
rembrandt rilke i am art with the flow
even if im guilty you gotta pardon the flow
niggas takin it lightly had to darken the flow
way i put it together tear em apart with the flow
im too smart with the flow you just started to flow
stop it youngin you 106th  park with the flow
i am pro as you see im off the charts with the flow
actually im number one on the charts with the flow
in some places they say this i am god with the flow
like my office but theyre biased too involved with the flow
although i am the youth spirit i am yall with the flow
trouble man dare i say i am mar with the flow
i come up hard but i evolve with the flow
crossover slam dunk rucker park with the flow young
