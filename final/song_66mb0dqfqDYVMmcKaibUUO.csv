lets not let it
another day is gonna end
lets not let it
well that moon is gonna look down
on you and me with that old frown
wishin wed work this thing out
right here right now

lets not let something well probably laugh about tomorrow
take us to that place where so many who give up go
we could quit and we could try
love can live and love can die if we let it
so baby lets not let it

so we get far too mad
well who hasnt
and it wont be the last
in time it happens
girl weve gotta hang tough
lets find out what were made of
its gonna rain again girl
well so what
thats love

lets not let something well probably laugh about tomorrow
take us to that place where so many who give up go
we could quit and we could try
love can live and love can die if we let it
so baby lets not let it
lets not let it

love can live and love can die

lets not let something well probably laugh about tomorrow
take us to that place where so many who give up go

love can live and love can die if we let it
so baby lets not let it
