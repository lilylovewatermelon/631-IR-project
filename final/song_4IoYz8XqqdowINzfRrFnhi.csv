i found god
on the corner of first and amistad
where the west
was all but won
were all alone
smokin his last cigarette
i said where you been
he said ask anything
where were you
when everything was fallin apart
where all my days
were spent by a telephone
that never rang
and all i needed was a call
that never came
to the corner of first and amistad

chorus
lost and insecure
you found me you found me
lyin on the floor
surrounded surrounded
whyd you have to wait
where were you where were you
just a little late
you found me you found me

well in the end
everyone ends up alone
but losin her
the only one whos ever known
who i am
who im not and who i wanna be
no way to know
how long she will be next to me

chorus
lost and insecure
you found me you found me
lyin on the floor
surrounded surrounded
whyd you have to wait
where were you where were you
just a little late
you found me you found me

bridge
early mornin
the city breaks
but ive been callin
for years and years and years and years
and you never left me no messages
you never sent me no letters
you got some kinda nerve
takin all i want
chorus
lost and insecure
you found me you found me
lyin on the floor
where were you where were you
lost and insecure
you found me you found me
lyin on the floor
surrounded surrounded
whyd you have to wait
where were you where were you
just a little late
you found me you found me

outro
whyd you have to wait
to find me to find me45embed"
