ahoy everybody spongebob here
christmas means presents and mistletoe
sharing and caring
so during this most festive season
please dont be a jerk

verse 1
bring joy to the world its the thing to do
but the world does not revolve around you

chorus
dont be a jerk its christmas

verse 2
theres a sign above the line that says express
that means ten items or less

chorus
dont be a jerk dont be a jerk its christmas

bridge
be nice to babies and animals old folks too
cuz thats how youd like them to treat you
use turn signals dont screen my calls
dont you wreck the house when you deck the halls
you might also likeverse 3
spit your gum where it wont wind up on my shoe
squeeze toothpaste from the bottom of the tube

chorus
dont be a jerk dont be a jerk
its christmas its christmas

bridge
when others are talking never interrupt
dont put people down or leave the toilet seat up
its the time for family and holly and turkey
tis the season to be jolly not jerky jolly not jerky

verse 4
dont dig in the cereal box for goodness sakes
take the prize and leave me nothing but flakes

chorus
dont be a jerk dont be a jerk
its christmas its christmas

verse 5
santa brought nearly every gift on your list
why whine about the one that he missed
chorus
dont be a jerk dont be a jerk
its christmas its christmas
dont be a jerk dont be a jerk
its christmas its christmas
dont be a jerk dont be a jerk
its christmas its christmas1embed"
