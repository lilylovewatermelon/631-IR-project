how does a bastard orphan son of a whore and a
scotsman dropped in the middle of a forgotten
spot in the caribbean by providence impoverished in squalor
grow up to be a hero and a scholar

john laurens
the tendollar founding father without a father
got a lot farther by working a lot harder
by being a lot smarter
by being a selfstarter
by fourteen they placed him in charge of a trading charter
thomas jefferson
and every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted
away across the waves he struggled and kept his guard up
inside he was longing for something to be a part of
the brother was ready to beg steal borrow or barter

james madison
then a hurricane came and devastation reigned
our man saw his future drip dripping down the drain
put a pencil to his temple connected it to his brain
and he wrote his first refrain a testament to his pain

burr
well the word got around they said “this kid is insane man”
took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
“get your education dont forget from whence you came and
the worlds gonna know your name whats your name man”

left him with nothin but ruined pride something new inside
a voice saying
“alex you gotta fend for yourself”
he started retreatin and readin every treatise on the shelf

burr  company both
there would have been nothin left to do
for someone less astute
he woulda been dead or destitute
without a cent of restitution
started workin clerkin for his late mothers landlord
tradin sugar cane and rum and all the things he cant afford
scammin for every book he can get his hands on
