i might disintegrate into the thin air if youd like
im not the dark center of the universe like you thought
and i might disintegrate into the thin air if youd like
and im not the dark center of the universe like you thought

verse 1
well it took a lot of work to be the ass that i am
and im real damn sure that anyone can
equally easily fuck you over
well died said something but i didnt mean it
everyones life ends but no one ever completes it
dry or wet ice they both melt and were equally cheated
well it took a lot of work to be the ass that i am
and im real damn sure that anyone can
equally easily fuck you over
well an endless ocean landing on an endless desert
well its funny as hell but no one laughs when they get there
if you cant see the thin air then why the hell should you care
well it took a lot of work to be the ass that i am
and im real damn sure that anyone can
equally easily fuck you over
well im sure you tell me you got nothing to say
but our voices shook hands the other day
if you cant see the thin air then what the hell is in the way
see modest mouse liveget tickets as low as 76you might also likebridge
i might disintegrate into the thin air if youd like
and im not the dark center of the universe like you thought

verse 2
well it took a lot of work to be the ass that i am
and im real damn sure that anyone can
equally easily fuck you over
well an endless ocean landing on an endless desert
well its funny as hell but no one laughs when they get there
if you cant see the thin air then why the hell should you care
well it took a lot of work to be the ass that i am
and im real damn sure that anyone can
equally easily fuck you over
well died said something but i didnt mean it
everyones life ends but no one ever completes it
dry or wet ice they both melt and were equally cheated
well it took a lot of work to be the ass that i am
and im real damn sure that anyone can
equally easily fuck you over
well im sure you tell me you got nothing to say
