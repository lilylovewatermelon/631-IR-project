piercing words eyes are red
watched your tail lights in the rain
empty heart filled with regret
i know we were both to blame

prechorus carrie underwood
and im not sorry that its over
but for the way we let it end
so i said all i had to say
in letters that i threw away

chorus carrie underwood
and you should know please believe me
ive picked up the phone a thousand times
and tried to dial your number
but its been so long its never easy
its like trying to spin the world the other way
what can i say

verse 3 carrie underwood  ashley clark
i hate to think all you had of me

in letters that i threw away
and the mess that it turned into
