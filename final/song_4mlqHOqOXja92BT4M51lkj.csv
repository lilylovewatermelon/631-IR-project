i am scared to say i miss you
last time i had you i should have kissed you
these feelings fester up inside
but how could i deny these butterflies

i hope im not stuck on your waiting list
because i dream of you in colors that donâ€™t exist
and i think its high time for you to know

i like you i like you i like you
and i hope you like me too

verse 2
youve been there through all ive been through
kept me sane and held my hand too
the way you make me feel alright
so how could i deny your lips on mine

prechorus
i hope im not stuck on your waiting list
because i dream of you in colors that dont exist
and i think its high time for you to know
