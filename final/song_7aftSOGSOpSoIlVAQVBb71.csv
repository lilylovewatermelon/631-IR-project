i knew id see her around
id be at some party shed show up and id be walking out
or across some parking lot hiding behind her sister
id look up shed be at the red light beside me
in that white maxima with the sticker on the back
id act like i didnt see her
wed pay at the same pumps
flip through the same stations
and slow down for the same curves
run around with the same crowds
we just needed some time
she could get on with her life and id get on with mine
thought i would be fine heh but maybe not
i knew shed find a way to get over me
but id never thought that

chorus
she would get down with somebody i know
i guess thats just how it goes
when you break up in a small town
i see our friends and they put on a show
like they dont want me to know
so they give me the goaround
but theres only so many streets so many lights
i swear its like i cant even leave my house
i shouldve known all along
you gotta move or move on
when you break up in a small town
see sam hunt liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likeverse 2
for a while i guess they were keeping it lowkey
but now its like these county lines are closing in on me
i see em everywhere together
and its hitting a little too close to home
shes so far gone but she didnt go far
she was over me before the grass grew back where she used to park her car
shes leaving those same marks in someone elses yard
in someone elses arms right down the road
and i never thought that

chorus
she would get down with somebody i know
i guess thats just how it goes
when you break up in a small town
i see our friends and they put on a show
like they dont want me to know
so they give me the goaround
but theres only so many streets so many lights
i swear its like i cant even leave my house
i shouldve known all along
you gotta move or move on
when you break up in a small town

bridge
her mailbox is seven minutes from mine
and i drive into town sometimes i see you sittin there with him
and i wanna jump out
i wanna fight
i wanna say  that guy but i cant
its my fault i let her go
i never thought that
chorus
she would get down with somebody i know
i guess thats just how it goes
when you break up in a small town
i see our friends and they put on a show
they dont want me to know
so they give me the goaround
but theres only so many streets so many lights
i swear its like i cant even leave my house
i shouldve known all along
you gotta move or move on
when you break up in a small town38embed"
