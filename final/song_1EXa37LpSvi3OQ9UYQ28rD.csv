keep your helmet keep your life son
just a flesh wound heres your rifle
crawling up the beaches now
sir i think hes bleeding out
and some things you just cant speak about

chorus
with you i serve with you i fall down down
watch you breathe in watch you breathing out out

verse 2
something med school did not cover
someones daughter someones mother
holds your hand through plastic now
doc i think shes crashing out
and some things you just cant speak about

bridge
only twenty minutes to sleep
but you dream of some epiphany
just one single glimpse of relief
to make some sense of what youve seen

chorus
with you i serve with you i fall down down down
watch you breathe in watch you breathing out out
with you i serve with you i serve with you i fall down down down down
watch you breathe in watch you breathe in watch you breathing out out out out
