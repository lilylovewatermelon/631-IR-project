hey once upon a younger year
when all our shadows disappeared
the animals inside came out to play
hey when face to face with all our fears
learned our lessons through the tears
made memories we knew would never fade

prechorus
one day my father—he told me
son dont let it slip away
he took me in his arms i heard him say
when you get older
your wild heart will live for younger days
think of me if ever youre afraid

chorus
he said one day youll leave this world behind
so live a life you will remember
my father told me when i was just a child
these are the nights that never die
my father told me

verse 2
when thunder clouds start pouring down
light a fire they cant put out
carve your name into those shinning stars
he said go venture far beyond the shores
dont forsake this life of yours
ill guide you home no matter where you are

one day my father—he told me
son dont let it slip away
when i was just a kid i heard him say
when you get older
your wild heart will live for younger days
think of me if ever youre afraid

chorus
he said one day youll leave this world behind
so live a life you will remember
my father told me when i was just a child
these are the nights that never die
my father told me

outro
these are the nights that never die
my father told meembed"
