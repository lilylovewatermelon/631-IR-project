i should warn you
things youre feeling arent normal now
think you need me
its not easy let you go some how

prechorus
now were too far gone
hope is such a waste
every breath you take you give
me the burdens bitter taste

chorus 1
you promise that youd stay
you say you want to go
your lips provide a shelter for the
things that i dont know

chorus 2
speak slowly
my heart is learning
teach me heartache
stop this burning now

verse 2
wishful thinking
patience shrinking bliss is far away
north is calling
now im falling at your feet please stay

my heart is learning

my heart is learning asking why
teach me heartache
