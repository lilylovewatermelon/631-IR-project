you know the bed feels warmer
sleepin here alone sleepin here alone
you know i dream in color
and do the things i want do the things i want

prechorus
you think you got the best of me
think youve had the last laugh
bet you think that everything good is gone
think you left me broken down
think that ill come running back
baby you dont know me cause youre dead wrong

chorus
what doesnt kill you makes you stronger
stand a little taller
doesnt mean im lonely when im alone
what doesnt kill you makes a fighter
footsteps even lighter
doesnt mean im over cause youre gone
what doesnt kill you makes you stronger stronger
just me myself and i
what doesnt kill you makes you stronger
stand a little taller
doesnt mean im lonely when im alone
