hometown crowd friday night lights
second string quarterback coming off the sidelines
one last play hail mary prayer
holding their breath when he threw it in the air
now cups are raising flags are waving
hes on their shoulders famous

chorus
heres one for the underdogs
let em hear yall
well hell yeah they might get knocked down
but everybody loves how they dont stay down for long
pretty soon theyre ten feet tall
from odds stacked cant win to the comeback kid
yeah come on heres one for the underdogs

verse 2
granddads farm handed down
everybody said hed run it in the ground
spent four long years bailing that hay
little by little got the whole loan paid
hard works paying off you wouldnt believe
hes making small town history

chorus
heres one for the underdogs
let em hear yall
well hell yeah they might get knocked down
but everybody loves how they dont stay down for long
pretty soon theyre ten feet tall
from odds stacked cant win to the comeback kid
yeah come on heres one for the underdogs
