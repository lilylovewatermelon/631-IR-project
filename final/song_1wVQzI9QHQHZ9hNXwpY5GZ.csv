pilgrim how you journey
on the road you chose
to find out why the winds die
and where the stories go
all days come from one day
that much you must know
you cannot change whats over
but only where you go

verse 2
one way leads to diamonds
one way leads to gold
another leads you only
to everything youre told
in your heart you wonder
which of these is true
the road that leads to nowhere
the road that leads to you

bridge
will you find the answer
in all you say and do
will you find the answer
in you

each heart is a pilgrim
each one wants to know
the reason why the winds die
and where the stories go
pilgrim in your journey
you may travel far
for pilgrim its a long way
to find out who you are

outro
pilgrim its a long way
to find out who you are
pilgrim its a long way
to find out who you areembed"
