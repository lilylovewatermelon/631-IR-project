so i had to sleep on the floor in the front room
me and my cousins on the block tryna thug
nigga you a school boy nigga we was sellin drugs
i grew up in jonesboro it was straight wildin
i hang out with the older cats so it was straight violence
and the niggas i looked up to was hustling or robbin
so i hoped of the porch to n started getting it popping
started with a half of dolla till i got the whole thang
on the freeway to the millions but im in my own lane
nigga worried bout a bitch im worried about stacking change
ill probably rob im but i dont even want that fucking chain
i wake up every morning thinking about a dollar
so if you aint talking dollars i aint tryna holla
my heart cold cause i grew up without my father
but it really made me smarter and made me grind harder
who ever thought id make my dreams into a reality
my own family thought they were gon have to bury me
took my mama 9 months just for her to carry me
so i was brought to the world to live like yo majesty nigga
