over time ive been building my castle of love
just for two though you never knew you were my reason
ive gone much too far for you now to say
that ive got to throw my castle away
over dreams i have picked out a perfect come true
though you never knew it was of you ive been dreaming
the sandman has come from too far away
for you to say come back some other day

chorus
and though you dont believe that they do
they do come true
for did my dreams
come true when i looked at you
and maybe too if you would believe
you too might be
overjoyed over loved over me

verse 2
over hearts i have painfully turned every stone
just to find i had found what ive searched to discover
ive come much too far for me now to find
the love that ive sought can never be mine

chorus
and though you dont believe that they do
they do come true
for did my dreams
come true when i looked at you
and maybe too if you would believe
you too might be
overjoyed over loved over me
you might also likeoutro
and though the odds say improbable
what do they know
for in romance
all true love needs is a chance
and maybe with a chance you will find
you too like i
overjoyed over loved over you
over you10embed"
