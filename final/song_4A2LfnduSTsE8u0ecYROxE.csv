one look dark room meant just for you
time moved too fast you play it back
buttons on a coat lighthearted joke
no proof not much but you saw enough
small talk he drives coffee at midnight
the light reflects the chain on your neck
he says look up and your shoulders brush
no proof one touch but you felt enough

chorus
you can hear it in the silence silence silence silence you
you can feel it on the way home way home way home way home you
you can see it with the lights out lights out lights out lights out
you are in love true love
you are in love

verse 2
morning his place burnt toast sunday
you keep his shirt he keeps his word
and for once you let go of your fears and your ghosts
one step not much but it said enough
you kiss on sidewalks you fight and you talk
one night he wakes strange look on his face
pauses then says youre my best friend
and you knew what it was he is in love

you can hear it in the silence silence silence silence you
you can feel it on the way home way home way home way home you
you can see it with the lights out lights out lights out lights out
you are in love true love

bridge
and so it goes
you two are dancing in a snow globe round and round
and he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
and you understand now
why they lost their minds and fought the wars
and why ive spent my whole life trying to put it into words

breakdown
cause you can hear it in the silence
you can feel it on the way home
you can see it with the lights out
you are in love true love
you are in love

chorus
you can hear it in the silence silence silence silence you
you can feel it on the way home way home way home way home you
you can see it with the lights out lights out lights out lights out
you are in love true love
you are in love ah
you can hear it in the silence silence silence silence you ah
you can feel it on the way home way home way home way home you ah
you can see it with the lights out lights out lights out lights out
you are in love true love
