i stop but then i hesitate
whats the point of leaving if we cant even wait
shes thinking of what she could say

prechorus
fifteen days that i spent
finding out what you meant
now were dancing again
keeping time she keeps my eyes awake
what else is there to say

chorus
i knew that i wouldnt change
i thought that this was something different than before
now were changing shape inside your brain and starting to reform oh lord
now im speaking words without thinking before
i knew that i wouldnt change
i wanted to do what i said that id do
now im making things up and not thinking it through so true
it was so legit but its nothing new
i knew that i wouldnt change

verse 2
well now i dont know what to speak
writing a verse is worse than you think
im spitting out her listerine
