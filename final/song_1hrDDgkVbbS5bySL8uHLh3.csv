the whole world is my enemy and im a walking target
two times the devil with all the significance
dragged and raped for the love of a mob
i cant stay because i cant be stopped
eat motherfuckers alive who cross us
i know youre all tired of the same ol bosses
let me tell you how its gonna be
im gonna kill anyone who steps up in front of me

verse 2
welcome to the same ol fucking scam
same ol shit in a dead fad
everybody wants to be so hard
are you real or a secondrate sports card
they all lost their dad or their wife just died
they never got to go outside shut up
nobody gives a fuck
it doesnt change the fact that you suck

chorus
we are the anticancer
we are the only answer
stripped down we want you dead
but whats inside of me youll never know
we are bipolar gods
we are you know what we are
my life was always shit
and i dont think i need this anymore
see slipknot liveget tickets as low as 85you might also likeverse 3
now im not pretty and im not cool
but im fat and im ugly and proud so fuck you
standing out is the new pretension
streamline the sicness halfassed aggression
you gotta see it to believe it we all got conned
all the mediocre sacred cows we spawned
put your trust in the mission
we will not repent this is our religion

chorus
we are the anticancer
we are the only answer
stripped down we want you dead
but whats inside of me youll never know
we are bipolar gods
we are you know what we are
my life was always shit
and i dont think i need this anymore

bridge
i am hated
you are hated
we are hated
i am hated
verse 4
everything sucks and i can prove it
everybody dies shuffle on remove it
individuals indispensable
im the paradox deity vessel
the other side holds no secret
but this side is done i dont need it
before you go you should know youre breaking down
youll be rotten by the time youre underground

postverse
fuck you

chorus
we are the anticancer
we are the only answer
stripped down we want you dead
but whats inside of me youll never know
we are bipolar gods
we are you know what we are
my life was always shit
and i dont think i need this anymore

outro
we are the source of conscience
we are distorted sentients
theres only one thing left
and i cant leave until its sated
we are the absolute
we are controlling you
theyre closing in i cant escape
i am hated5embed"
