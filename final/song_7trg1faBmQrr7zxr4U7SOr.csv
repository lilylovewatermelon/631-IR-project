halfway around the world lies the one thing that you want
buried in the ground hundreds of miles down
the first thing that arises in your mind when you awake
is bending you til you break let me hold you now

chorus
baby close your eyes dont open til the morning light
baby dont forget we havent lost it all yet

verse 2
dont know what youre made of til the one thing that you want
is coming with the dawn and suddenly changes
the monday syndicate meets everyone the same
all weve lost to the flame listen to me now

chorus
baby close your eyes dont open til the morning light
dont ever forget we havent lost it all yet
all we know for sure is all that we are fighting for
baby dont forget we havent lost it all yet

bridge
someday when this is over
we may still have no answer
for now its when i hold her
we are closer we are closer
we are closer we are closer

baby close your eyes dont open til the morning light
dont ever forget we havent lost it all yet
all we know for sure is all that we are fighting for
baby dont forget we havent lost it all yet

outro
we are closer
we are closer
we havent lost it all yet
now we are closer
we havent lost it all yet
we are closer3embed"
