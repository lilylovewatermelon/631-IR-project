girl i hope you understand i wanted to hold your hand
but i cant wanted to be your man back then
and you knew i fell for you but you just broke my heart in two
i was sad mad and broken on my bed
hoping i get rid of all the voices in my head

verse 1
i was opening a packet of an undeveloped med
when i was met with a prescription of a bullet made of lead
and when i woke up in an hour in a pool of my own sweat
i said i swear to god ill never even try to sleep again
so instead i took my pen and started writing evidence
and whеn i started making sense i found that i had rеached the end
oh im upset i have no friends you wanna bet youre just pretend
youre just a pet confined within the lines of writing youre not shit
i thought i stopped my psychopathic ways i swear i did
i said id talk to people bout the problematic life i lived
they were my neighbors razor blades
and different flavored pills i hid
therefore im at surely my last straw
im so gassed stuck in the past i said that

chorus
girl i hope you understand i wanted to hold your hand
but i cant wanted to be your man back then
and so far i never held you with my arms
so its hard to be the one you arent with
instead filled with anxiety always was a part of me
guess im not cut out to be
see boywithuke liveget tickets as low as 37you might also likeverse 2
somebody cause its not me im not used to all the talking
was an introvert that had converted feelings into writing
used to cope with all my problems using notes and lots of rhyming
used to hope for better days whenever nights would have me crying
im not lying when i say that i would rather die than go back
to the times that i would try and be the guy the people know
as always fighting with the demons hiding far behind my eyelids
on an island full of violence in my head i had two pilots
oh the sun dont shine and skies turn grey
i feel it coursing through my veins
ive said before im not okay
but you dont listen anyway
you know i tried you turned away
you straightup lied right to my face
you fucked my life ruined my day
but you dont know so ill say

bridge
nothing can fill this silence no one can love like i did
you dont know so ill say
nobody cares you lied its not fair you still deny it
so ill say
nothing can fill this silence no one can love like i did
you dont know so ill say
nobody cares you lied its not fair you still deny it
so ill say
chorus
girl i hope you understand i wanted to hold your hand
but i cant wanted to be your man back then
and too bad i know i cant wake up because i lost my way
and you dont give a fuck about me this could be a dream
i cant see the things that you see so please oh

outro
girl i hope you understand i wanted to hold your hand
but i cant wanted to be your man back then
and you had known and played along
you were my home i wrote you songs
now youre dead to me effectively
remove yourself outside my dreams9embed"
