so familiar and overwhelmingly warm
this one this form i hold now
embracing you this reality here
this one this form i hold now so
wide eyed and hopeful
wide eyed and hopefully wild
we barely remember what came before this precious moment
choosing to be here right now
hold on stay inside
this body holding me
reminding me that i am not alone in
this body makes me feel eternal
all this pain is an illusionsee tool liveget tickets as low as 64you might also like24embed"
