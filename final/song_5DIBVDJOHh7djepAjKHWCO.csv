i never stay in one place too long
the dirt roads singin me a siren song

i need to spin my wheels
i gotta hankerin for four wide tires
and i cant help it its the way im wired
boy you get too close
boy you need to know

chorus
i got a heart like a truck
its been drug through the mud
runs on dreams and gasoline
and that old highway holds the key
its got a lead foot down when its leavin

a little bit of love is all that its needin
but its good as it is tough
i got a heart like a truck
