hes been trying with limited success
to get this girl to let him get into her dress
but every time he thinks hes getting close
she threatens death before he gets a chance

chorus 1
and thats the way it is in minnesota
and thats the way it is in oklahoma
thats the way its been since protozoa
first climbed onto the shores of california

verse 2
and shes been trying with limited success
to get him to turn out the lights and dance
cause like any girl all she really wants is
that fickle little bitch romance
that fickle little bitch romance

prechorus
and that is why a girl is called a tease
and that is why a guy is called a sleaze
and thats why god made escort agencies
one life to live and mace and ghb

chorus 2
and thats the way it is in minnesota
and thats the way it is in oklahomahoma
thats the way since the animals and noah
first climbed onto the shores of california

must not be too kind
stop thinking love is blind
clench your fists yeah write
“shes just not my type”

verse 3
why all these conflicting specifications
maybe to prevent overpopulation
all i know is that all around the nation
the girls are crying and the boys are masturbating
the girls are crying and the boys are masturbating

chorus 3
and thats the way it is in minnesota
and thats the way it is in oklahomahoma
thats the way aristophanes and homer
wrote the iliad and lysistrata
and thats the way it is in minnesota
and thats the way it is in oklahomahoma
thats the way its been since antiprotozoa
first climbed onto the shores of californiaembed"
