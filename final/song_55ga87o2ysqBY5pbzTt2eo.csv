my only lover
give out to give in
i search for the capsule i lost
drag me to hell in the valley of the dalles
like my mother
give wings to a stone
it’s only the shadow of a cross
i slept on my back in the shade of the meadowlark
like a champion
get drunk to get laid
i take one more hit when you depart
ill drive that stake through the center of my heart
lonely vampire
inhaling its fire
i’m chasing the dragon too far
there’s blood on that blade
fuck me im falling apart
my assassin
like casper the ghost
there’s no shade in the shadow of the crossyou might also like23embed"
