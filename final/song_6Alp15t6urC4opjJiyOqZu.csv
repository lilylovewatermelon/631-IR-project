one year ten thousand bad moments
but it was dressed up in heated emotion
and i tried to look for the best in the worst
but like fuck me that caused a commotion
youre lucky im a private person
ive quietly carried your burden
and everyone thinks youre an angel
but shit i would probably use different wordin

chorus
oh youre so vicious
love me then pretend you didnt
crush my heart and wreck my image
why you gotta be so vicious

verse 2
you like a certain type of woman
whos smart but neglects intuition
when youre insecure could be me could be her
you just run to whoever is winnin ah

prechorus
said that it was me and you for life
now youre kinda acting like i died
you might also likechorus
oh youre so vicious
love me then pretend you didnt
crush my heart and wreck my image
why you gotta be so so so
oh youre so vicious no
love me then pretend you didnt
half of me just cant resist it
why you gotta be so vicious

postchorus
oh no
why you gotta be so
oh oh
why you gotta be so vicious

bridge
you dont feel remorse you dont feel the effects
cause you dont think you hurt me if you wish me the best
i shoulda known all along i was only the next one
to take your love songs as a promise

outro
oh youre so vicious
i loved you but i wish i didnt
if youre out there somewhere listenin
why you gotta be so vicious19embed"
