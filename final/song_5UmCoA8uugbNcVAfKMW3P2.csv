this whiskey sure tastes fine right now
but it aint doin the trick no
yeah it aint gettin me gone enough
to make my mind forget
that one shot two shot three shot more
dont change the fact she aint in the picture anymore
this bar stool aint workin
but if anything can
itll be me on a dock pushin off of dry land

chorus
i need a lake a little bit of bait
id even take a creek
im tired of all these concrete streets
we were running down
yeah what i need right now
is some roddin and some reelin first catch feelin
praying to the man for some muddy water healin
dont need no sad song on my radio
burnin up some black smoke down a backroad
i need a boat
i need a boat

verse 2
dont care if its a pontoon
brand new been used
as long as itll fish
just wanna cast it out yonder
let my mind wander off to anything but this
im tired of runnin into all my friends
askin if im over her lovin
yeah but out there where the river lets in
them fish dont ask me nothin
