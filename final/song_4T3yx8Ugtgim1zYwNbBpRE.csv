we drained every dive in the lower east side
and you failed to catch the train back to queens
so you came to my room
and we did some things that we knew not to do
in the glow of the nights golden hue

chorus
youve got a tattered line of string
and you tie it round everything
that you want to call your own
but it never seems to hold

verse 2
and when we woke we agreed
that we would not ever speak of this night
to anyone that we both knew
and you said every time we kissed
i felt something that couldnt exist
and i confessed that i thought i felt it too

chorus
and ive got a tattered line of string
and i tie it round everything
that i want to call my own
but it never seems to hold
ive got a tattered line of string
and i tie it round everything
that i want to call my own
but it never seems to hold

everything
never seems to hold
never seems to hold

chorus
youve got a tattered line of string
and you tie it round everything
that you want to call your own
but it never seems to hold
ive got a tattered line of string
and i tie it round everything
that i want to call my own
but it never seems to hold
