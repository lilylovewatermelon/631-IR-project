confidence is a preference for the habitual voyeur of what is known as parklife
and morning soup can be avoided if you take a route straight through what is known as parklife
johns got brewers droop he gets intimidated by the dirty pigeons they love a bit of it parklife
whos that gut lord marching you should cut down on your pork life mate get some exercise

chorus damon albarn  phil daniels
all the people
so many people
and they all go hand in hand
hand in hand through their parklife
know what i mean

verse 2 phil daniels  graham coxon
i get up when i want except on wednesdays when i get rudely awakened by the dustmen parklife
i put my trousers on have a cup of tea and i think about leaving me house parklife
i feed the pigeons i sometimes feed the sparrows too it gives me a sense of enormous wellbeing parklife
and then im happy for the rest of the day safe in the knowledge there will always be a bit of my heart devoted to it

chorus damon albarn
all the people
so many people
and they all go hand in hand
hand in hand through their parklife

verse 3 phil daniels  graham coxon
