stitched you up put you together
with cotton and feather
gave you love put my heart inside you
oh what could i do

prechorus
when you started talkin in your sleep
saying the things youd do to me
i didnt care i wasnt scared
now im findin knives under the sheets
crumpled photographs of me
im in despair should i be scared

chorus
teddy bear you were my teddy bear
you were comforting and quiet
how did love become so violent
oh teddy bear you were my teddy bear
everything was so sweet until you tried to kill me
