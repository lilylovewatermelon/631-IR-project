you turn me off at the push of a button
and you pretend that i dont mean nothing
im not a saint thats easy to tell
but guess what honey you aint no angel
you like to scream use words as a weapon
well go ahead take your best shot woman
i want to leave you its easy to see
but guess what honey its not that easy

prechorus
we get so complicated complicated
this fingers for our memories

chorus
so rip my pictures from your wall
tear them down and burn them all
light the fire walk away
theres nothing left to say so
take the ashes from the floor
bury them to just make sure
that nothing more is left of me
just bittersweet memories
memories

verse 2
i want to run and escape from your prison
but when i leave i feel something is missing
im not afraid thats easy to tell
this cant be heaven it feels like im in hell
youre like a drug that i cant stop taking
i want more and i cant stop craving
i still want you its easy to see
but guess what honey youre not that good for me
