round one
i swear to god id do it for fun
just a dead man walkin
with a doublebarrel shotgun
aint a single fucker left to fear
see their lips movin
but i dont wanna hear

prechorus 1
showdown
i aint backin down from anybody
throwdown
if i dont get some space
lay down
not in this life or another
its a nightmare
and its not goin away

chorus
all i wanted was your honesty
something more than this
something more than me
more than me
death can take me if i cant be free
im not like you
im a dying breed

something you just dont wanna do
go dancin with the devil
unless youre wearing my shoes
you got nerve yeah ill give ya that
watch the world crumble
while you sit on your ass

prechorus 2
wake up
get your head together motherfucker
straight up
before its too late
stand up
nothing ever lasts forever
corrupt
and thats how its gonna stay

chorus
all i wanted was your honesty
something more than this
something more than me
more than me
death can take me if i cant be free
im not like you
im a dying breed
