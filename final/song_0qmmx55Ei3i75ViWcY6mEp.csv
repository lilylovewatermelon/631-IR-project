white walls surround us
no light will touch your face again
rain taps the window
as we sleep among the dead

prechorus
days go on forever
but i have not left your side
we can chase the dark together
if you go then so will i

chorus
there is nothing left of you
i can see it in your eyes
sing the anthem of the angels
and say the last goodbye

verse 2
cold light above us
hope fills the heart and fades away
skin white as winter
as the sky returns to grey

prechorus
days go on forever
but i have not left your side
we can chase the dark together
if you go then so will i
