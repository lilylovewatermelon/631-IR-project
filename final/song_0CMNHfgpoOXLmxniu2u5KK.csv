i have lost my voice i have no pride
haven’t been the same since grandma died
acting on an old impulse to hide

your perfume lingers in my bed
where you used to sleep and rest your head
memories awaken all the dead
fill my arms with heavy liquid

chorus
light your cigarette
breathe me in now
breathe me in

won’t you tell me why
i can’t sleep
projecting regret in my head

verse 2
i don’t want to hear a single thing
unless its from the heart
from the heart
i don’t want to feel a single thing
hands wrapped around my neck
and i can’t breathe
you might also likechorus
light your cigarette
breathe me in now
breathe me in

won’t you tell me why
i can’t sleep
projecting regret in my headembed"
