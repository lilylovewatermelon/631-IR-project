on my highway the yellow lines
have disappeared from time to time
and ive wound up on the wrong side of the road
on my highway ive gone too fast
afraid that i might finish last
i hugged the curve too hard and lost control
oh i never know which way its going to go

chorus
but what a feeling chasing the sun
living my life like its shot from a gun
laughing a little bit more with every mile
oh what a freedom racing the wind
dying to know whats around the next bend
and smiling as i watch the years roll by
im learning how to take it day by day on my highway

verse 2
on my highway i missed some signs
and left a damn good love behind
i see her in my rearview like a ghost
on my highway ive broken down
and cried when no one else was around
and prayed that god would take my soul
yeah ive paid a lot of heavy tolls
see jason aldean liveget tickets as low as 41you might also likechorus
but what a feeling chasing the sun
living my life like its shot from a gun
laughing a little bit more with every mile
oh what a freedom racing the wind
dying to know whats around the next bend
and smiling as i watch the years roll by
im learning how to take it day by day on my highway

yeah yeah
what a feeling out on the run
drinking up the rain soaking up the sun
laughing a little bit more with every mile
oh what a freedom like a sail in the wind
not looking back not forgetting where ive been
smiling as i watch the years roll by
and im moving on from my mistakes
and im learning how to take it day by day on my highway
