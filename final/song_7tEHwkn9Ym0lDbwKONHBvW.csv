we got a fucked up reason to live
who really gives a fuck
were gonna wake up hate
were gonna fuck you up

i wanna break everything
i wanna make it sting
were gonna wake up hate
were gonna wake it up

you gotta get it straight
were gonna give it up
were gonna wake up hate
were gonna fuck you up

i wanna break everything
i wanna make it sting
were gonna wake up hate
were gonna wake it up

verse 1
i am the burden of my everything
an open scar
ill be reborn in hatred
feeling i cant love no more
see korn liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likeive had to suffer
i cannot wait for more
no loving and no praying
all my hate is for the taking

chorus
we got a fucked up reason to live
who really gives a fuck
were gonna wake up hate
were gonna fuck you up

i wanna break everything
i wanna make it sting
were gonna wake up hate
were gonna wake it up

you gotta get it straight
were gonna give it up
were gonna wake up hate
were gonna fuck you up

i wanna break everything
i wanna make it sting
were gonna wake up hate
were gonna wake it up
verse 2
i am the falling of my happiness

stop loving im still hating
till i cannot hate no more

ive had to suffer
i cannot wait for more
no loving and no praying
all my hate is for the taking
