wanna take it all back to where it started
life of the party
right where my heart at
soon as what i want come in i say anything goes

verse 1
on the road cool ridin round with the top down
nowhere to go to decide that ill just ride round
she a drug abuser from a broken heart oh oh
got a bad addiction i been druggin hard all month long
im in that wraith i aint got nothin but some residue on me
im chasin a check to the morning
im in the trenches with smokers and steppers and loners
somethin more than one schedule ii on me
matter fact just a convicted felon im keepin my weapon
im pourin more blood on that money
owe it all to the youngin who feel that he owe the ones
put addiction fore hunger
i aint got no peak leave blood inside the streets
used to wash my clothes inside the sink now a young nigga walk on mink
takin care of my dawg made myself a boss they gon take one off he blink
fore a nigga had fame i was sittin in a cell young nigga takin off them links
she gon play with her nose all night
shoot three doses fore the night end
lipstick bottle full of white i know
told her that i like it i like it
these niggas they talk too much cant tell what i did i did
i always been there for you you dont even excite me

tryna take it all back to where it started
life of the party
right where my heart at
soon as what i want come in i say anything goes

verse 2
puttin you over them hoes my money gon grow
tell em its tax evasion
