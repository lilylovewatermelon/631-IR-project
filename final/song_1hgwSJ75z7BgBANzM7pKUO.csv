you said wake up
when the curtains are moving out and in
i said that might not be too far from the truth
anyways

prechorus
i’ll buy you breakfast i’ll buy you medicine
you’re calling me out you’re calling me in

chorus
little thoughts running
it’s not a problem
it’ll come back
i’ll get to hand shaking
when i wanna
i can’t be alone enough
i can’t be alone enough

verse 2

i could organize my head yeah
compartmentalizing it
starting out with our impediments

prechorus
i can’t have breakfast without you calling me
you’re calling me out you’re calling me in
you might also likechorus
little thoughts running
it’s not a problem
it’ll come back
i’ll get to hand shaking
when i wanna
i can’t be alone enough
i can’t be alone enough

refrain
go back to the safe side
go back to mather knoll
go back to the safe side
go back to mather knoll
go back to the safe side
go back to mather knoll
go back to the safe side
go back to mather knollembed"
