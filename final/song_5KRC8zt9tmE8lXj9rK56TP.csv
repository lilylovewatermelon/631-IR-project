and if thats wrong please dont blame me
cause where i live we have nothing
in the ghetto ghetto ghetto

verse 1 william
little kids growing up without no education
moms on drugs cause thats her only medication
nobodys home but they aint on a vacation
but they left the kids alone watching the tv station
whats wrong with the picture please someone give me the answers
they be wondering why the girls grow up to be dancers
then we wonder why the boys grow up to be dealers
and they be angry at the whole world ready to kill us
how do we start to resolve the whole problem
how we let our little children just turn into goblins
why we got them all killing and stealing and robbing
we need to plan a little seed to prevent the mobbing
why dont we teach them that science to reach for the stars
cause they can beat the fire with the future worst than odds
dont want them looking in the past and covering scars
they need a path out the ghetto ghetto hello

verse 2 william
little boy had a dream of being a ball player
cause little homie wanna grow to be a rhyme slayer
little missy wanna grow to be a model
while the momma at home just drinking out the bottle
how come they dont want to grow to be a councilman
senator a governor a major politician man
probably cause the politicians nearly keep on tricking em
promise that they fixing it but they aint really fixing it
thats why they want to be like me
like jigga like b and nicky and ree
every day in the ghetto is an emergency
but the power that be dont emerge in see
thats why you see killing thats why you see crimes
thats why you see homies in the prison doing time
thats why you see crack thats why you see blackstrap
but no access out the ghetto ghetto
chorus baby kaely
it is easy as 1 2 3
i wanna be whats on tv
and if thats wrong please dont blame me
cause where i live we have nothing
in the ghetto ghetto ghetto
in the ghetto ghetto ghetto
