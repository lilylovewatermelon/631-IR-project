this ones for you and me
livin out our dreams
were all right where we should be
lift my arms out wide i open my eyes
and now all i wanna see
is a sky full of lighters
a sky full of lighters
verse 1 eminem
by the time you hear this i will have already spiralled up
i would never do nothin to let you cowards fuck my world up
if i was you i would duck or get struck like lightnin
fighters keep fightin put your lighters up point em skyward uh
had a dream i was king i woke up still king
this rap games nipple is mine for the milking
til nobody else even fuckin feels me til it kills me
i swear to god ill be the fuckin illest in this music
there is or there ever will be disagree feel free
but from now on im refusing to ever give up
only thing i ever gave ups using no more excuses
excuse me if my head is too big for this building
and pardon me if im a cocky prick but you cocks are slick
poppin shit on how you flipped your life around crock of shit
who you dicks tryna kid flip dick you did opposite
you stayed the same cause cock backwards is still cock you pricks
i love it when i tell em shove it
‘cause it wasn’t that long ago when marshall sat flustered
lacked luster ‘cause he couldn’t cut mustard
muster up nothin brain fuzzy
‘cause he’s buzzin’ woke up from that buzz and
now you wonder why he does it how he does it
wasn’t ‘cause he had buzzards
circlin around his head waitin for him to drop dead was it
or was it ‘cause some bitches wrote him off
little hussyass scuzzes
fuck it guess it doesn’t matter now does it
what difference it make what’s it take
to get it through your thick skulls that this ain’t
some bullshit people don’t usually come back this way
from a place that was dark as i was in just to get to this place
now let these words be like a switchblade to a hater’s ribcage
and let it be known that from this day forward i wanna just say
thanks ‘cause your hate is what gave me the strength
so let them bics raise ‘cause i came with 59 but i feel like i’m 68

verse 2 royce da 59
by the time you hear this i’ll prolly already be outtie
i advance like goin from totin iron to goin and buyin’
four or five of the homies the iron man audi
my daddy told me slow down boy youre goin to blow it
and i aint gotta stop the beat a minute to tell shady i love him
the same way that he did dr dre on the chronic
tell him how real he is or how high i am
or how i would kill for him for him to know it
i cried plenty tears my daddy got a bad back
so its only right that i write til he can march right
into that post office and tell em to hang it up
now his careers lebrons jersey in twenty years
i stop when im at the very top
you shitted on me on your way up its bout to be a scary drop
‘cause what goes up must come down
you goin down on somethin you dont wanna see like a hairy box
every hour happy hour now life is wacky now
used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
now im just the cats meow oww outclass the count
always down for the catchweight like pacquiao
yall are doomed
i remember when tpain aint wanna work with me
my car starts itself parks itself and autotunes
‘cause now im in the aston i went from havin
my city locked up to gettin treated like kwame kilpatrick
and now im fantastic compare it to a weed high
and yall niggas thats gossipin like bitches
on the radio and tv see me we fly
yall buggin out like wendy williams starin at a beehive
and how real is that i remember signin my first deal
now im the second best i can deal with that
now bruno can show his ass without the mtv awards gag
bridge bruno mars
you and i know what its like
to be kicked down forced to fight
but tonight were all right
so hold up your lights
let it shine cause—

chorus bruno mars
this ones for you and me
livin out our dreams
we are right where we should be
with my arms out wide i open my eyes
and now all i wanna see
is a sky full of lighters
