the fire is running low
can you feel the flame her fading glow

you know
we are slowing down
i can hear your footsteps drowning up

were burning down
were burning down
were the ashes on the ground
were burning down
were burning down
were falling underground

you are
you singing now a song
but you heard it somewhere else i know

we are
were trying to belong
pick up the pieces left of us

were burning down
were burning down
were the ashes on the ground
were burning down
were burning down
were falling underground
see ludovico einaudi liveget tickets as low as 83you might also likeif you can see me running up to you
you know
ive been running in circles around you
if you could tell me i was back in time
you know
ive been running in circles for you

were burning up
were burning down
were the ashes on the ground
were burning up
were burning down
were falling underground

the lie has fallen from the stars
now your sinking through the night
out of sight were falling underground
pick up the pieces left of us

if you can see me running up to you
we know 
ive been running in circles around you

if you could tell me i was back in time
you know 
ive been running in circles for you
were burning up
were burning down
were the ashes on the ground
were burning up
were burning down
were falling underground

were burning up
were burning down
were the ashes on the ground
were burning up
were burning down
were falling underground

you know 
the fire is running low 2embed"
