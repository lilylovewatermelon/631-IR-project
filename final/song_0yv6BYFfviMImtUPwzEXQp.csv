things havent been the same
since you came into my life
you found a way to touch my soul
and im never ever ever gonna let it go

prechorus
happiness lies in your own hand
it took me much too long to understand how it could be
until you shared your secret with me

chorus
somethings comin over
mmmmmm somethings comin over
mmmmmm somethings comin over me
my babys got a secret

verse 2
you gave me back the paradise
that i thought i lost for good
you helped me find the reasons why
it took me by surprise that you understood
you knew all along what i never wanted to say
until i learned to love myself
i was never ever loving anybody else
