verse 1
told you from the get go i would never let go
you remain a turn on hope you know like i know
ima always love you when nobody else do
im be the shelter you can always run to
youre the one i run to when i need a shoulder
im the one you run to when you need a soldier
say that im the realest one you ever met
but girl this is the realest thing i ever said

prechorus
if you give me the world then it wont mean nothing
wont mean nothing wont mean nothing
cause if you leave my world then i wont have nothing
wont have nothing wont have nothing

chorus
and this is from my heart ay ay this is from my soul ay ay
lovers may come ay ay and lovers may go ay ay
but i dont worry about a thing cause as long as were together
babe i know i know i know i know i know i know that
no ones gonna love me better ay ay ay ay ay ayay ayay
no ones gonna love me better ay ay ay ay ay ayay
no ones gonna love me
