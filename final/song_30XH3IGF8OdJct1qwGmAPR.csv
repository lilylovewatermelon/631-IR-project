feed the cut and get in line
to live and burn is tugowar
raped

go back and forth until its learned
to suffer now or nothings gained
then wake within a freezing sweat
push and pull collecting doubt starting seeds

chorus
lost inspiration panic on the rise
a severed attempt ignored

verse 2
the reason never outweighs the truth
so backing up and lean against
the liars club cometh shame
wasting farther collecting doubt
starting seeds

chorus
lost inspiration panic on the rise
a severed attempt ignored

bridge
so hand it off dont care enough
cause ignorance is in blissful reach
lost inspiration panic on the rise
a severed attempt ignored
lost inspiration never played the game
a severed attempt ignored
