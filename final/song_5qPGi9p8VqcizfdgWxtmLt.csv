verse 1
lovers keep on the road youre on
runners until the race is run
soldiers youve got to soldier on
sometimes even the right is wrong

chorus
they are turnin my head out
to see what im all about
keepin my head down
to see what it feels like now
but i have no doubt
one day were gonna get out

verse 2
tonight maybe were gonna run
dreamin of the osaka sun
oh oh
dreamin of when the mornin comes

chorus
they are turnin my head out
to see what im all about
keepin my head down
to see what it feels like now
but i have no doubt
one day the sunll come out

verse 1
reign of love
i cant let go
to the sea i offer this heavy load
locust wind lift me up
im just a prisoner in a reign of love

bridge
locust wind here i stop
how i wish id spoken up to a reign of love

verse 2
reign of love
by the church were waitin
reign of love
on my knees go prayin
how i wish id spoken up
away get carried on a reign of love13embed"
