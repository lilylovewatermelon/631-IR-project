theres something about lightening up a marlboro red
that nicotine rush into my head
and a taste of southern comfort on my lips
tells me i aint ready to quit

verse 2
something about driving way to fast
switching gears and hammering on the gas
and the fact that they aint called me yet
tells me i aint ready to quit

chorus
dont start thinking im gonna stop
giving it all i got
if you think you seen love you aint seen nothing yet
how could i ever get tired
of waking up by your side
and the taste of your sweet kiss
tells me i aint ready to quit

verse 3
theres something about the way you say my name
that drives this old country boy insane
so baby dont dont stop loving me like this
cause i aint ready to quit
see jason aldean liveget tickets as low as 41you might also likechorus

chorus
dont start thinking im gonna stop
girl im giving it all i got
if you think you seen love you aint seen nothing yet
how could i ever get tired
of waking up by your side
and the taste of your sweet kiss
and the taste of your sweet kiss
tells me i aint ready to quitembed"
