and he wants to take your soul
theres a mad man with a mad plan
and hes dancing at your door oh
what to do oooh
what to do
when the walls are built to crumble
theres a mad man with a mad plan
and he waits for us to stumble

oooh but our eyes are open
yeah theyre really open

i say we rob from the rich
and blow down the door
on to the next
to dance with the poor
jump on my shoulders

we rob from the rich
and blow down the door
on to the next
to dance with the poor
jump on my shoulders
