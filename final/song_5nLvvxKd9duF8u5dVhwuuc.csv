how can i bear
to wake up and youre not there
what will i do
when i turn and reach for you

i lay my tears on the windowsill
ill only cry til i get over you
but how long will it take me
wont you save me

chorus
and stay
just a little bit longer
til im a little bit stronger
to take all this and
stay just a little more time
til i can find a way
please stay

verse 2
will i ever smile again
when losing love takes my best friend
to wonder where wonder how
wonder what youre doing
you might also likeone more night just before you break me
hold me safely

chorus
and stay please wont you stay with me
just a little bit longer
til im a little bit stronger
to take all this and
stay just a little more time til i can find
just a little more time
til i can find a way
please stay

bridge
so ill be a big girl and close my eyes
as you walk away dont say goodbye
god save me

please wont you

chorus
stay please wont you stay with me
just a little bit longer
til im a little bit stronger
take all this and
stay just a little more time til i can find
just a little more time
til i can find a way
wont you stay
just a little bit longerembed"
