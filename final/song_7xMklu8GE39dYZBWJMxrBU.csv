the gentlemans in the lane
spinning his hat on a cane
stepping out
out for change
good morning all its a beautiful day

the generals are winning a war
seemed suicidal before
you came along now
now ill protect you
long as you stay

chorus
la
morning had to come
id be walking in the sun
living in the day
but last night i was about to throw it all away

verse 2
if patience started a band
id be her biggest fan
look at me im talking to you
i dont want the lead in your play
you might also likethe stars just a part of the scene
the gentleman in green
paying off out on the street
i cant go home
its not on my way

chorus
la
things ive never done
cars parked in the sun
living in the day
but last night i was about to throw it all away
last night i was about to throw it all away
last night i was about to throw it all away
last night i was about to throw it all away1embed"
