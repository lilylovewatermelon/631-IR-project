i cant see how anyone could ignore ya
girl you got my mind going outta me
girl let me admit that i do adore ya
cause theres a lock box to my heart and youre the key
well look at her and its a fact why all the dogs chase the cat
cant help but to want a girl like that cause she be the one for me for me
every time you come up around me you give me this feeling
a feeling ive never experienced girl i dont know much about it
but im such a curious guy lets give love a try

chorus
so incredible the way i feel inside
no need to try and hide it
could it be your smile thats got me feeling
so invincible girl youre so incredible incredible

verse 2
i know you heard it all before
but believe me when i say most of these chicks are boring
compared to you there not the same
youre all i ever need more thats why i aint playing no games
throwing away my compass im done exploring
girl lets fly away search the globe and the seven seas
tryna find the joy that she brings
love is blind but truly i can see that shes the one for me
every time you come up around me you give me this feeling
a feeling ive never experienced and i dont know much about it
but im such a curious guy lets give love a try

bridge
cant stop thinking bout you baby
youre on my mind like every day
cause when im alone
it hits me that we were meant to be
see girl no ordinary guy
nothing more that i can say thats why i cant let you get away
girl youre so fly and only a fool would let a girl like you pass by
youre the missing link in my life so baby be mine mine
