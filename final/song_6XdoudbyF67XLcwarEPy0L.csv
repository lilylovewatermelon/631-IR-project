built an opera house for you in the deepest jungle
and i walked across its stage singing with my eyes closed
ive got a love for you i just cant escape
all of my love for you cuts me like barbed wire

chorus
ooh i was meant to love you
and always keep you in my life
ooh i was meant to love you
i knew i loved you at first sight

verse 2
if i abandoned love id be a man without dreams ooh
id rather be out there staring death right between its eyes now
and i can still hear the sound of you crying through the night
there in the opera house with no one else for miles

chorus
ooh i was meant to love you
and always keep you in my life
ooh i was meant to love you
i knew i loved you at first sight

outro
ooh i was meant to love you
and always keep you in my life
ooh i was meant to love you
i knew i loved you at first sightyou might also like5embed"
