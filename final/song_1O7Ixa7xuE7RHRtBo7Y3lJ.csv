they preach to the choir
always in the permanent daylight
they toss paper tigers from their
perfect porcelain skylines

chorus
listen for the sound for the sound for the sound
as it all comes crashing down crashing down comes crashing down
listen for the sound for the sound for the sound
as it all comes crashing down crashing down comes crashing

verse 2
they preach to the choir
always in the permanent daylight
they toss paper tigers from their
shatterproof spires

bridge
light the world on fire just to watch it burn
itll be their funeral pyre but they never seem to learn
light the world on fire just to watch it burn
itll be their funeral pyre but they never seem to learn

chorus
listen for the sound for the sound for the sound
as it all comes crashing down comes crashing down
listen for the sound for the sound for the sound
as it all comes crashing down comes crashing down
