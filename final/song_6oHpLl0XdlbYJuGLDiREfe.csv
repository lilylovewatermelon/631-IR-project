verse 1 jayz
rumor has it the blueprint classic
couldnt even be stopped by bin laden
so september 11th marks the era forever
of a revolutionary jay guevara
now its a whole museum of hov mcers
everybody dupin the flowâ€”you see em
everybody loopin up soul
its like they tryna make the blueprint 2 before hov
shout out to just bleezy and kanyeezy
see how we adjust to the game so easy
chicks belly dancin glancin every chance they get
like oh shit hes so handsome
still in demand in the longest run standing
kidnapped rap seven years no ransom
cant one nigga get it back no rap
young hovs going to canton ima land ya
