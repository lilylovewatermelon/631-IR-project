never be ashamed of where your from
theres nothin wrong with your last name
dont be lookin for people to blame

cause hard times they come and they go
most of the time theyre in the middle of the road
its the same pain in different ways
dont your know son when it pours it rains

chorus

hard times
in the middle of your road
hard times
creepin up on the good folks you know
hard times
you daddy wakes up and you lit the stove
hard times
from the california hills to the coverdale road

you got yours and i have mine
mostly good folks have tried and tried
to make a livin on your minimum wage
your coming up short nearly every day
see ryan bingham liveget tickets as low as 142you might also likeand whats enough and whats the cost
you cant stand up cause all is lost
you roll us up and your doors are locked
theres a poor boy livin on every block

chorus

hard times
in the middle of your road
hard times
creepin up on the good folks you know
hard times
youre livin down the rest of you knows
hard times
from the california hills to the coverdale road

when i was young my daddy said son
never be ashamed of where your from
theres nothin wrong with your last name
so dont be lookin for people to blame

cause hard times they come and they go
and most of the time theyre in the middle of your road
its the same pain different way
dont your know when it pours it rains
and itll always be around
followin you from town to town
but you can get up when it puts you down
cause everybodys got em if you look around

chorus

hard times
in the middle of your road
hard times
creepin up on the good folks you know
hard times
huddled around a wood burnin stove
