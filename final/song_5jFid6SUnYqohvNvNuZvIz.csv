well we grew up down by the railroad tracks
shootin bbs at old beer cans
chokin on the smoke from a lucky strike
somebody lifted off of his old man
we were football flunkies
southern rock junkies
crankin up the stereos
singin loud and proud to gimme three steps
simple man and curtis loew
we were good you know

verse 2
got some discount knowledge at the junior college
where we majored in beer and girls
it was all real funny til we ran out of money
and they threw us out into the world
yeah the kids that thought theyd run this town
aint runnin much of anything
just lovin and laughin
and bustin our asses
and we call it all livin the dream

chorus
and these are my people
this is where i come from
were givin this life everything weve got and then some
it aint always pretty
but its real
its the way we were made
wouldnt have it any other way
these are my people

well we take it all week on the chin with a grin
till we make it to a friday night
and its church league softball holler bout a bad call
preacher breakin up the fight
then later on at the green light tavern
well everybodys gatherin as friends
and the beers are pourin till monday mornin
and we start it all over again

chorus
and these are my people
this is where i come from
were givin this life everything weve got and then some
it aint always pretty
but its real
its the way we were made
wouldnt have it any other way
these are my people

bridge
we fall down and we get up
we walk proud and we talk tough
we got heart and we got nerve
even if we are a bit disturbed
chorus
and these are my people
this is where i come from
were givin this life everything weve got and then some
it aint always pretty
but its real
its the way we were made
wouldnt have it any other way
ah nah
these are my peopleembed"
