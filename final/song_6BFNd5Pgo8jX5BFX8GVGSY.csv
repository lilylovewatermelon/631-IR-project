stands out in a line
i could have been anyone shed seen
she waits another week to fall apart
she couldnt make another day
i wish it was anyone but me
i could have been anyone you see
she had something breakable just under her skin

american girls
all weather and noise
playing the changes for all of the boys
holding a candle up to my hand
making me feel so incredible

she comes out of closets every night
and then she locks herself away
where she could keep everything from me
i could have been anyone you see
shes nothing but porcelain underneath her skin

american girls
all weather  noise
playing the changes for all the of the boys
holding a candle up to my hand
making me feel so incredible
see counting crows liveget tickets as low as 170you might also likelittle shivers shaking me every day
but i could get this same thing anywhere
so if she goes away
well its alright and im ok

“hey” she said “come back again tonight”
i said “i might i might i might”
she said “well thats alright
if its alright with you
then its alright with me”

i waited for an hour last friday night
she never came around
she took almost everything from me
im going through my closets
trying on her clothes almost every day
i could have been anyone you see
i wish it was anyone but me
theres nothing but pills and ashes under my skin

american girls
all weather  noise
playing the changes for all the of the boys
holding a candle up to my hand
making me feel so incredible
if i made you cry
please tell me why
cause ill try again if you let me try
american girls
all feathers  cream
come into bed so edibleembed"
