i see the sunrise creepin in
everything changes like the desert wind
here she comes and then shes gone again and

chorus
im just a traveller on this earth
sure as my hearts behind the pocket of my shirt
ill just keep rollin til im in the dirt
cause im a traveller oh im a traveller
i couldnt tell you honey i dont know
where im goin but ive got to go
cause every turn reveals some other road
and im a traveller oh im a traveller

verse 2
my heartbeats rhythm is a lonesome sound
just like the rubber turnin on the ground
always lost and nowhere bound

chorus
im just a traveller on this earth
sure as my hearts behind the pocket of my shirt
ill just keep rollin til im in the dirt
cause im a traveller oh im a traveller
i couldnt tell you honey i dont know
where im goin but ive got to go
cause every turn reveals some other road
and im a traveller oh im a traveller
see chris stapleton liveget tickets as low as 36you might also likebridge
when im gone
somebody else will have to feel this wrong
somebody else will have to sing this song
somebody else will have to sing along
sing along

chorus
im just a traveller on this earth
sure as my hearts behind the pocket of my shirt
ill just keep rollin til im in the dirt
cause im a traveller oh im a traveller
i couldnt tell you honey i dont know
where im goin but ive got to go
cause every turn reveals some other road
and im a traveller oh im a traveller2embed"
