im still comin out dry dry
you can leave me in the jungle with bears and tigers
im comin out fly fly
ill take the stand for my brother
put my hand on the bible im still gon lie on god

all the money in the world wont stop no cry straight up
pain and the hunger made a savage savage
came from the bottom disadvantaged vantaged
then i started livin my dreams my dreams
that shit turned me to an addict an addict

shawty got a booty ima grab it ima grab it
in the fast lane tryna dodge traffic skrrt skrrt
