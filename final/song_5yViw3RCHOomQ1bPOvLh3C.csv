youre telling me nobodys there to dry up the flood
oh but thats just crazy
cause baby i told you im here for good

chorus
my loves like a star yeah
you cant always see me but you know that im always there
when you see one shining
take it as mine and remember im always near
if you see a comet baby im on it
making my way back home
just follow the glow yeah
it wont be long just know that youre not alone

verse 2
i try to build the walls to keep you safe when im not around
but as soon as im away from you you say they come tumbling down
but its not about the time that we dont get to spend together
oh its about how strong our love is
when im gone and it feels like forever

you cant always see me but you know that im always there
when you see one shining
