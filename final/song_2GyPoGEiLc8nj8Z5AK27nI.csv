verse 1 ludacris
now i been ridin up in my bentley coupe stuntin with the top down
fo 24inch rims so heavy they hold the block down
24 karat necklace so heavy it hurt my neck

you prostitute it but money i never let it ho
speakin of hoes oh yes we meet em and we g em dude
and we may see em but we wouldnt wanna be em dude

verse 3 lil fate
she likes the night lights bright lights big spendin
lil fate been big pimpin pimpin
so dont be mad at my raps and try and look at me funny
cause you know that most you ladies tradin sex for money
so if you comin out the pocket then you might get laid
thats how the rent car note and cell phone get paid
i bet the snakes all show once you cut that grass
and im a pimp so its time that i exploit they ass
you see its hoes after the party its hoes after the show
its hoes up in the lobby its hoes out on the stroll
hey ho heres some nodoze no dough no sleep
ho on your feet if you dont work you dont eat
