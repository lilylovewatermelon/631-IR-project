put your lips close to mine
as long as they dont touch
out of focus eye to eye
til the gravitys too much
and ill do anything you say
if you say it with your hands
and id be smart to walk away
but youre quicksand

chorus
this slope is treacherous
this path is reckless
this slope is treacherous
and iii like it

verse 2
i cant decide if its a choice
getting swept away
i hear the sound of my own voice
asking you to stay
and all we are is skin and bone
trained to get along
forever going with the flow
but youre friction

this slope is treacherous
this path is reckless
this slope is treacherous

bridge
two headlights shine through the sleepless night
and i will get you get you alone
your name has echoed through my mind
and i just think you should think you should know
that nothing safe is worth the drive
and i would follow you follow you home
ill follow you follow you home

chorus
this hope is treacherous
this daydream is dangerous
this hope is treacherous
