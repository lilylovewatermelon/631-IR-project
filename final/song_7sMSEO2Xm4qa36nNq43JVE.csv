your defenses were on high
your walls built deep inside
yeah im a selfish bastard
but at least im not alone

my intentions never change
what i want it stays the same
and i know what i should do
its time to set myself on fire

was it a dream was it a dream
is this the only evidence that proves it
a photograph of you and i

verse 2
your reflection ive erased
like a thousand burned out yesterdays
believe me when i say
goodbye forever is for good

chorus
was it a dream was it a dream
is this the only evidence that proves it
a photograph of you and i
