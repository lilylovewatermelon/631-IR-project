tell me whats the use
of a twentyfour inch waist
if you dont touch me
tell me whats the use again
of being on tv every day
if you dont watch me

prechorus
this house is full of emptiness
my closets full of dresses
that ill never wear
my life is full of people
but youre my only friend
my best friend

chorus
hope it isnt too late to say i love you
hope it isnt too late to say
that without you this place looks like london
it rains every day
dont you know it babe
im only half a body
without your embrace

verse 2
let me tell you why
my heart is an unfurnished room
any suggestions
dont have to tell you more than that
cause no one knows me like you do
without exception

this house is full of emptiness

my life is full of people
but youre my only friend
my best friend

chorus
hope it isnt too late to say i love you
hope it isnt too late to say
that without you this place looks like london
it rains every day
dont you know it babe
im only half a body
without your embrace
