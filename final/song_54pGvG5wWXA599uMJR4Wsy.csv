well i dont know what to say
because theres truth to what you say
i know it kills you im this way
theres something different every day

chorus
could it be that i never had the chance to grow inside
could it be that my habit is to find a place to hide
could it be that sometimes i say things just to disagree
could it be that im only being me

verse 2
not easy living in my mind
a little peace is hard to find
my every thought is undermined
by all the history inside

chorus
could it be that i never had the chance to grow inside
could it be that my habit is to find a place to hide
could it be that sometimes i say things just to disagree
could it be that im only being me

bridge
i know i hear the words you said over and over again
i just cant get them through my head theres just too many voices
must be like living with the dead waiting for me to begin
to do the things i have said and for this im sorry
see staind liveget tickets as low as 42you might also likeso theres some truth to what you say

chorus
could it be that i never had the chance to grow inside
could it be that my habit is to find a place to hide
could it be that sometimes i say things just to disagree
could it be that im only being meembed"
