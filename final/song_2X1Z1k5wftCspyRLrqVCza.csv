ohoh
no oh oh

verse 1
theres a place that i know
its not pretty there and few have ever gone
if i show it to you now
will it make you run away

verse 2
or will you stay even if it hurts
even if i try to push you out will you return
and remind me who i really am
please remind me who i really am

chorus
everybodys got a dark side
do you love me can you love mine
nobodys a picture perfect
but were worth it
you know that were worth it
will you love me
even with my dark side

verse 3
like a diamond from black dust
its hard to know what can become if you give up
so dont give up on me
please remind me who i really am
