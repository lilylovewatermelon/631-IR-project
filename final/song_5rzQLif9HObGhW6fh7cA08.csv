you stand before me
now we stare eye to eye
before another second clicks away one of us will die
you reach for your metal as i reach for mine
the sound of bullets flying through the air is followed by a cry
and theyre crying

chorus
what will we do what will we say
when it’s the end of this game that we play
will we crumble into the dust my friend
or will we start this game over again
its coming back to me

verse 2
the young man lies alone
but fastened into the ground
the sound of fleeing feet and the cryin eye
will be his last sound
but do we gain from all this
now was it worth a life no
we throw all of our hopes away
and set our dreams aside
now we’re crying
you might also likechorus
what will we do what will we say
when it’s the end of this game that we play
will we crumble into the dust my friend
or will we start this game over again
its coming back to me
it’s coming back to me
it’s coming back to me
what will we do what will we say
when it’s the end of this game that we play
will we crumble into the dust my friend
or will we start this game over again
its coming back to meembed"
