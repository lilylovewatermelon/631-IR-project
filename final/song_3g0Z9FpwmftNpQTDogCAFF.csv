since then i never feel helpless
recess this mess if you do
and i find that even time well spent
gets bent if you need it to we do
by now ive showed you how much
i believe in the here
and now and i wish that you knew

chorus
lay all you want on me
lay all you want on me
lay all you want on me
ill be your whipping boy

verse 2
you spilled your purse onto my bed
searching for something for your head
since then you never come clean
i mean you wish you only could

chorus
lay all you want on me
lay all you want on me
lay all you want on me
ill be your whipping boy
