if im at the beach
you know im with a bitch
if im in the 4
i gotta pop a swish
my girl hella thick
she snappin hella pics
she said she dont smoke
i said experiment
yes i got some gas
i hide it in my stash
she wanted some for free
i told her kiss my ass
i be there for sure
she was hella mad
then i smoked her out
and all we did was laugh

outro
all we did was laugh
all we did was laugh
