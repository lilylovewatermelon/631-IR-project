happiness is two different things
what you take and then what you bring
one is pleasure ones discipline
ones devotion ones just the ring

prechorus
desire and reward
long term and short term joy

chorus
dont waste your heart
dont waste your heart
one has nothing to do with the other
and the world is all cousins not brothers

ones an instant one takes some will
one gives life and one makes you kill
ones the means and ones for the end
