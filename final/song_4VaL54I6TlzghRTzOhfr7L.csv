whats your life about enlighten me
is you gon live on your knees or die on your feet
its fire in the street fire in my swisher
fire in between the two legs of your lil sister
just get a sip of this elixir
before they crop us out the picture
ive never seen a crop circle
but i seen cops circle the block
i puff squares but i swear one day ima stop
my nerves itch
on the brink of my career
while my peers struggle for employment
can you hear these screams
uncle sam aint no kin to me
one two three four grams and a fifth of hennessy
a bad bitch fuck the penitentiary
section 80s babies blame ronald reagan
we raising hell hell oh
lord forbid the homies got wet so we trying to soak it in
the president is black but you cant vote for skin
you vote for the better man
come to our show you could see the diversity
unify the people they gon peep it universally
we might not change the world
but we gon manipulate it i hope you participatin
ayo dot wont you let these cats know
we knew wed be here like back in 04
started hiiipower because our generation needed a generator
in a system meant to disintegrate us ooh
and all we do is assist them
were not victors were victims
the bigger picture isnt developed yet
like what if keisha was celibate
or what if tammy came across a real man
who didnt play games like children
my nigga cheated on his girlfriend
with his girlfriends girlfriend let the world end
and everybody tripping off 2012
and the extraterrestrial presence as well
odd futures aight but our future is not
that martial law shit drop we gon all get got
so keep that question mark on your face
eat your fast food use your fluoride toothpaste
hide your feelings from the public work your lil nine to five
dont forget to pay your tithes and thank god youre alive
hiiipower
and on another note
we focused like the hubble telescope
soul

verse 2 kendrick lamar  absoul
i wrote this because i was ordered to
people say i speak for generation y
why lie i do section80
your sonll play me if radio wont
daughters that just turn one til twentyone listen to kendrick
for instance
whats your life about enlighten me
is you gon live on your knees or die on your feet
take out that student loan and pay off your college degree
and do exactly what you see on tv
true story
hmm
can you repeat that for me soul
whats your life about enlighten me
is you gon live on your knees or die on your feet
is you gon plead the fifth or sound the horn
the time is now my child come on
see a lot of yall dont understand kendrick lamar
because you wonder how i could talk about money hoes clothes god and history all in the same sentence
you know what all them things have in common
only half of the truth if you tell it
see i spent twentythree years on this earth searching for answers
til one day i realized i had to come up with my own
im not on the outside looking in
im not on the inside looking out
im in the dead fucking center looking around
you ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man
thats an analogy for the way the world make me react
my innocence been dead
so the next time i talk about money hoes clothes god and history all in the same sentence
just know i meant it and you felt it
cause you too are searching for answers
im not the next pop star im not the next sociallyaware rapper
i am a human motherfuckin being over dopeass instrumentation
kendrick lamar
now fuck em up terrace
soul
instrumental solo terrace martin

outro kendrick lamar
i watch this fire that we’re gathered around
and see that it burns similar to the fire that’s inside you
section80
section80 babies
a generation of bliss and disobedience
no they cant control us
no they cant control you
no they cant control us
but we can control each other
we build our own world
if you dont leave with nothing else tonight
you will leave with knowing yourself
you will leave knowing that you represent something thats bigger than all of us
our family
heart honor and respect
this is you
this is me
and we are hiiipower52embed"
