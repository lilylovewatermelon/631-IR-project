all or nothing
it sometimes lies between whats undecided
and all for nothing
it seems im wasting my time
dont look down on me
like i dont know anything that ive been doing
you talk down to me
its time you take a better look inside

chorus
ill never be the same
im moving back onto my ways
im looking for changes
to better my way

verse 2
bow down to me
taking your pride and stuff it down inside
vows are ruined
losing my faith losing time
better off you than me
i just cant stand another day when youre in my way
a long time brewing
its time you kiss your ass goodbye

im moving back onto my ways
im looking for changes
