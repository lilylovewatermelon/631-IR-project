wolves by the road and a bike wheel spinning on a pawn shop wall
shell wring out her colored hair like a butterfly beaten in a summer rainfall
and then roll on the kitchen floor of some fucker with a pocketful of foreign change
the song of the shepherds dog
a ditch in the dark in the ear of the lamb whos gonna try to run away
whoever got that brave

verse 2
wolves in the middle of town and the chapel bell ringing through the windblown trees
shell wave to the butchers boy with the parking lot music everybody believes
and then dive like a dying bird at any dude with a dollar at the penny arcade
the song of the shepherds dog
the waiter and the check or the rooster on a rooftop waitin for day
and you know what hes going to say

verse 3
wolves at the end of the bed and a postcard hidden in her winter clothes
shell weep in the back of a truck to the traitors only trying to find her bullet hole
and then run down a canopy road to some mother and a baby with a cross to bear
the song of the shepherds dog
a little brown flea in the bottle of oil for your wooly wild hair
