hello hello hello

verse 1
im wakin up at the start of the end of the world
but its feelin just like every other mornin before
now i wonder what my life is gonna mean if its gone
the cars are movin like a half a mile an hour and i
started starin at the passengers wavin goodbye
can you tell me what was ever really special about me all this time

chorus
but i believe the world is burnin to the ground
oh well i guess were gonna find out
lets see how far weve come
lets see how far weve come
well i believe it all is comin to an end
oh well i guess were gonna pretend
lets see how far weve come
lets see how far weve come

verse 2
i think it turned ten oclock but i dont really know
then i cant remember carin for an hour or so
started cryin and i couldnt stop myself
i started runnin but theres no where to run to
i sat down on the street took a look at myself
said where you goin man you know the world is headed for hell
say your goodbyes if youve got someone you can say goodbye to

lets see how far weve come again

theres no one on the corner and theres no one at home
well it was cool cool it was just all cool
now its over for me and its over for you
