i want your silent parts the parts the birds love
i know theres such a place
i had my back turned you didnt realize
im lonely
you lack the things to which i relate
but i see no harm
come wait come wait come wait
its over
yeah one two three do me

prechorus 1
when im feeling lazy its probably because
im saving all my energy to pick up when you move into
my airspace
move into my airspace
and somethings coming over me i see you in the doorway
i cant control the part of me that swells up when you move into
my airspace
move into my airspace

chorus
but each night i bury my love around you
oh each night i bury my love around you
youre linked to my innocence

this is a concept this is a bracelet
this isnt no intervention
this is a concept this is a bracelet
this isnt no intervention

bridge
this isnt you yet
what you thought was such a conquest
your hair is so pretty and red
baby baby youre really the best

verse 2
can i get there this way yeah i think so
can i get there this way i think so
can i get there this way can i get there this way
can i get there this way can i get there this way

prechorus
we should take a trip now to see new places
im sick of this town i see my face has changed
each night i bury my love around you
we should take a trip now to see new places
im sick of this town i see my face has changed
