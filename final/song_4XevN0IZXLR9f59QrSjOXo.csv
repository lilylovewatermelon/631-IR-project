im an alien
cause im not of this world
i have a name but ive been changed
and now i cant stay the same
and im a loser if that means ive been lost before
but now i found it im surrounded
cause you can hear the way it sounded

prechorus
like angels singing with a million voices

the end is where we begin
its crawling back when
we run away run away
cause the end is where we begin
where broken hearts mend
and start to beat again
the end is where we begin

verse 2
im a monster if that means im misunderstood
cause its alive and i cant hide it
the energy is rising
and im a traitor if that means ive turned on myself
i cant deny it its like a riot
and i cant keep it quiet
