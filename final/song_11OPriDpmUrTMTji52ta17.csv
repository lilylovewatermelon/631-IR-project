oh my god whats happening thought i was fine
i told you i dont need your love like three four thousand times
but thats a lie no i cant look you in the eye
oh i oh i
so i did everything to push you all away
and finally you left and now im missing you like crazy
and i cry no i cant sleep alone at night
oh i oh i

chorus
look what youve done
look what youve done to me
i got everything i wanted
but youre everything youre everything i want
look what youve done to me
didnt know i was alone
til i was running to your running to your heart
like magnets
oh my god whats happening
look what youve done
look what youve done to me
i got everything i wanted
but youre everything youre everything i need

verse 2
i wanna tell you things and show you all the rest
broadcast my emotions on the radio and take em off my chest
i hope youre listening
are you are you
and i been spinning round in circles spinning round in circles
writing in my journal bout you
wonder if its over i aint getting closer
think its time i told you the truth
hey wait a minute ugh
