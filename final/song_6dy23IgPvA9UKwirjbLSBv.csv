somethings up with jack
somethings up with jack
dont know if were ever
going to get him back

werewolf
hes all alone up there
locked away inside

corpse mother
never says a word

corpse kid
hope he hasnt died

citizens of halloween
somethings up with jack
somethings up with jack

jack
christmas time is buzzing in my skull
will it let me be i cannot tell
there are so many things i cannot grasp
when i think ive got it and then at last
through my bony fingers it does slip
like a snowflake in a fiery grip
you might also likesomethings here im not quite getting
though i try i keep forgetting
like a memory long since past
here in an instant gone in a flash
what does it mean
what does it mean

in these little bricabrac
a secrets waiting to be cracked
these dolls and toys confuse me so
confound it all i love it though

simple objects nothing more
but somethings hidden through a door
though i do not have the key
somethings there i cannot see
what does it mean
what does it mean

what does it mean hmm

ive read these christmas books so many times
i know the stories and i know the rhymes
i know the christmas carols all by heart
my skulls so full its tearing me apart
as often as ive read them somethings wrong
so hard to put my bony finger on
or perhaps its really not as deep
as ive been led to think
am i trying much too hard
of course ive been too close to see
the answers right in front of me
right in front of me

its simple really very clear
like music drifting in the air
invisible but everywhere
just because i cannot see it
doesnt mean i cant believe it
you know i think this christmas thing
its not as tricky as it seems
and why should they have all the fun
it should belong to anyone

not anyone in fact but me
why i could make a christmas tree
and theres no reason i can find
i couldnt handle christmas time

i bet i could improve it too
and thats exactly what ill do
hee hee hee hee eureka ive got it this year christmas will be ours1embed"
