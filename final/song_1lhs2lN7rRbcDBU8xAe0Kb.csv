im usually strong keep love far away
a wall around my heart so it wont have to break
but you take me some place that ive never been
now dont know if ill find my way back again

chorus
cause youve got me right where i want you
and theres not a thing i can do
completely consumed all about you
youve got me right where i want you

verse 2
when i close my eyes youre looking at me
you wake me at night walking around in my dreams
the wind blows the smell of the roses in bloom
and all i can think of is last nights perfume

chorus
cause youve got me right where i want you
and theres not a thing i can do
completely consumed all about you
youve got me right where i want you

bridge
and i never thought that i would get caught
but here i am wrapped up in you
see alan jackson liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likeoutro
cause youve got me right where i want you
and theres not a thing i can do
completely consumed all about you
youve got me right where youve got me right where
youve got me right where i want youembed"
