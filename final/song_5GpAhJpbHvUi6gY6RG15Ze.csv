chorus
i aint foldin under pressure i aint switchin for no ho
i aint talkin to no cop and i aint tellin on my bros
aint no killer but dont push me fingers itchin on that pole
niggas plottin on my comeup gotta watch they on my nose
long nights i sold drugs just to hit the studio
now im eatin steak and shrimp bitch i aint eatin sloppy joe
look into the mirror flex and now a nigga in his glow
bust off like a smith  wesson welcome to the rodeo

verse 1
shawty wanna fuck me cause a nigga wearin gold
i came up and made it happen i was trappin by the store
big dope inside this backwood case this nigga want smoke
do me dirty ima find you lay your ass out on the floor
nineteen with a bag i got rich by myself
rather do this shit alone i wasnt askin for no help
they keep askin how im winnin with the card that i was dealt
boy i worked hard for this seat and i aint bucklin my belt
call my brother on the phone he said broski you a star
i said brother hold it down soon well all be livin large
and its crazy how last year was sellin coke out my garage
now im in a good position for this life cant sabotage

verse 2
i got tattoos on my face i use that shit as motivation phew phew
i could never get a job so for my dream im dedicated
for a second lost myself i was too busy gettin faded
now they see me out in public and be knowin what my name is
all these rappers want the clout and the life of bein famous
i just wanna be stable tell my family we made it
i was comin for my spot a young nigga had to be patient
now im runnin up these bands can hit the island for vacation
ive been shittin on my haters you could say im constipated
five racks on this fit just to stunt while im in vegas
narcotic on my body shout out to my nigga caleb gang
young niggas got the cake up now these bitches wanna date us gang gang gang
