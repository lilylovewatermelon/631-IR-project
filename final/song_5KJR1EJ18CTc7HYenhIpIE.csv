verse 1
i can remember gotta remember way back when
since a small small kid i didnt ever have no friends
member daddy went to prison uncle derek took me in
then uncle derek went to prison thats when my troubles began
mama went off and found her some happiness she got married
missin my daddy badly i turned my back on the family
and that left me looking for love in all the wrong places
now my heart that was so full of love is full of hate
everybody that i invested trust turned to be snakes
everybody that i invested trust turned to be fake
i know youre frustrated you want me to open more
but it takes a strong strong heart to heal a broken soul

verse 2
now heres a toxic trait that i have
i beg for distance when im mad but bein distant we wont last
and if its best for you then go be free
but if you plan on comin back then baby you shouldnt leave
cause by the time that you get back ill be gone
too scared of bein alone and where i lay my hats my home
and i know that youre frustrated you want me to open more
but it takes a strong strong heart to heal my broken soul
