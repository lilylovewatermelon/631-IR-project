as i slide the key into the ignition of this ol truck and fire it up
im struck hard by the heaviness of this situation
my eyes are fixed on the small silver half heart keychain you gave me dangling in the dashboard light
i read the word forever over and over again i wanna cry

verse 2
i turn off my radio as i turn off your county road
to pick you up just like ive done at least a thousand times
the gravel underneath these tires
half mile stretch of ol barbed wire
drops of rain fallin from the sky seem to know my pain
know that im about to

chorus
reach out and hold your hand in mine
feel your love baby one more time
press against your lips and hold you tight
i know the next kiss is a kiss goodbye
i could put it off for another day
act like everythings gonna be okay
its gonna break my heart to see you cry
i know the next kiss is a kiss goodbye

verse 3
see its not that what i got to do is more important than you
its its just what i gotta do
and i know you dont understand
hell i dont understand myself
see cody johnson liveget tickets as low as 15you might also likeverse 4
as i pull up to your house i feel my head spinnin around
just thinkin about how everything is about to change
every step i take towards your door
im a little less certain than the step before
oh but i know i know i know what i gotta do

chorus
i gotta reach out and hold your hand in mine
feel your love baby one more time
press against your lips and hold you tight
i know the next kiss is a kiss goodbye
i could put it off for another day
act like everythings gonna be okay
its gonna break my heart to see you cry
i know the next kiss is a kiss goodbye

chorus
reach out and hold your hand in mine
feel your love baby one more time
press against your lips and hold you tight
yeah i could put it off for another day
act like everythings gonna be okay
its gonna break my heart to see you cry
i know the next kiss is a kiss goodbye
goodbyeembed"
