desperate but not hopeless
i feel so useless in the murder city
desperate but not helpless
the clock strikes midnight in the murder city

verse 1
im wide awake after the riots
this demonstration of our anguish
this empty laughter has no reason
like a bottle of your favorite poison
we are the last call and were so pathetic

chorus
desperate but not hopeless
i feel so useless in the murder city
desperate but not helpless
the clock strikes midnight in the murder city

guitar solo

verse 2
christians cryin in the bathroom
and i just want to bum a cigarette
weve come so far weve been so wasted
its written all over our faces
we are the last call and were so pathetic

i feel so useless in the murder city
desperate but not helpless
