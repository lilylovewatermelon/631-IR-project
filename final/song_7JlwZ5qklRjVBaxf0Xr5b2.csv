yeah

verse 1
im ethereal
my children are legion serial
they stick to my skin like beloved cysts
i tear away with my nails and teeth and fists
touch the hands of inverted saints
follow my heart through the threaded pain
callow man is a sentinel screaming
i see the future the future is bleeding

verse 2
sores
every goddamn minute i can feel em now
like a virus you will never kill me now
going underground coming on like hepatitis
were out and you cant reshape us
another bug in the construct
tearing up the main bus b
zeros and ones are everything execute me

chorus
everywhere you look its like they know
their fingerprints are hidden by control
this is where the line is drawn see
you cant take my soul away from me
see slipknot liveget tickets as low as 85you might also likeverse 3
what do you need to see you feel the impact
gotta retract everybody get back
what is this its like a big conspiracy
fields of dejected morbid progeny
they always say that its always our fault
but everything we say is taken with a grain of salt
man its always the same if we talk or complain
we only wanna upset the balance
hows it feel to be the new abortion
the only generation to suffer extortion

chorus
everywhere you look its like they know
their fingerprints are hidden by control
this is where the line is drawn see

bridge
you cant take my soul away from me
you cant take my soul away from me
you cant take my soul away from me
you cant take my soul away from me
you cant take my soul away from me
you cant take my soul away from me

chorus
everywhere you look its like they know
their fingerprints are hidden by control
this is where the line is drawn see
you cant take my soul away from me
everywhere you look its like they know
their fingerprints are hidden by control
this is where the line is drawn see
you cant take my soul away from me
outro
you cant take my soul away from me
fuck youembed"
