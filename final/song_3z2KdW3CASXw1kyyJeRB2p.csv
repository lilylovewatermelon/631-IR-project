theres still marks on the pantry door of that little house
where mama used to measure us
im proud to say thats my home where i was raised
but that aint where i grew up

chorus
see i gained a little on father time
the summer my granddaddy died
the first time i saw mama cry
and man that sure was tough
felt like id put on a few years
watching daddy wipe her tears
in my little coat and tie standing in that cemetery mud
thats where i grew up

verse 2
senior year a case of beer out on the riverbank
getting a head start on twentyone
thats the place that made me feel just like a man
but that aint where i grew up no

chorus
see i gained a little on father time
that night i crossed that center line
i bet i rolled a dozen times
next thing i knew i was
waking up upsidedown
praying god just get me out
then i hit my knees beside what was left of my truck
hey thats where i grew up
see kenny chesney liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likebridge
you learn as you go
thats how you grow

chorus
see i gained a little on father time
when me and her had our first big fight
i said some things i made her cry
she packed all her stuff
the boy in me said let her go
the man in me said pull her close
it was time to find out which one i was
standing in a doorway holding on to love
thats where i grew up

outro
oh thats where i grew upembed"
