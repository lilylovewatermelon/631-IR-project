keri talk

verse 1 keri hilson
im startin to think i need space
now every time i go out you all in my face
soon as i hit the door why you gotta be actin so insecure
where i been who i was with
boy you stressin me out with this watch this
our relationship was supposed to revolve around trust right
but lets take it back a few months like
what about the other chick that you was kickin it with
man im gettin sick of it
damn it its a shame a sin
you about to get a dose of your medicine
you couldnt even handle me
if the shoe was on the other foot now
see keri hilson liveget tickets as low as 121you might also likebridge 1
so what you gonna do when i dont give you that last chance
and how you gonna act when you see me in the back with a new man
and whats it gonna be when you could see me and him holdin hands
i bet youd give a damn then

chorus
you could keep on feelin yourself ima be with somebody else
gotta keep it real with yourself before you end up by yourself
gotta keep it real with yourself before you end up by yourself
how does it feel

verse 2
now you threatin to leave me so
but ordinarily i would be biting my tongue
but you couldnt picture me gone
thought i be sittin at home while you was doing me wrong
you know its messin with my head thoughts of her up in my bed
and if i did what you did to me how would it be
if the shoe was on the other foot now

bridge 2
i could wild out take the knuckle route but i got class
so what you gonna do when i pimp out ive got a new romance
then what you have turns into what you had
i bet youd give a damn then
chorus
you could keep on feelin yourself ima be with somebody else
gotta keep it real with yourself before you end up by yourself
you could keep on feelin yourself ima be with somebody else
gotta keep it real with yourself before you end up by yourself

breakdown
baby do you know what i gone through how does it feel
sittin up waiting for you how does it feel
how does it feel
if that was you youd be gone baby youre slippin on me how does it feel

chorus
you could keep on feelin yourself ima be with somebody else
gotta keep it real with yourself before you end up by yourself
you could keep on feelin yourself ima be with somebody else
gotta keep it real with yourself before you end up by yourself
how does it feel

outro

oh how does it feel
