time shakes found you at the water
at first you were my father
now i love you like a brother
earthquakes shake the dust behind you
this world at times will blind you
still i know ill see you there

chorus
come a little closer then youll see
come on come on come on
things arent always what they seem to be
come on come on come on
do you understand the things that youve been seein
come on come on come on
do you understand the things that youve been dreamin
come a little closer then youll see

verse 2
heartbreaks the heavy worlds upon your shoulders
will we burn on or just smolder
somehow i know ill find you there
ooh you wanna see if you can change it change it
still i know ill see you there

chorus
come a little closer then youll see
come on come on come on
things arent always what they seem to be
do you understand the things that youve been seein
come on come on come on
do you understand the things that youve been dreamin
come a little closer then youll see
come a little closer then youll see

ten thousand people stand alone now
and in the evening the sun sank
tomorrow it will rise
time flies by they all sang along
time flies by they all sang along
time flies by they all sang along
time flies by by

come a little closer then youll see55embed"
