i did not come here from nothin
i need a whole lot of money
crossing these hoes out to fade away
putting your bitches on layaway
niggas they know me from stuntin yeah
all of my whips is push button
feeling like phil when i make the play
i light the streets where you are
i only need to hit it one time
keep on them red bottom louboutins
play with that pussy on the 101
i light the streets where you are
i got a bad bitch thats 21
i make her do the things shes never done
feeling like phil when i make the play
everything will be aokay

verse
now i think about it man as long as i keep doing me and you keep doing you
i aint gotta worry about nobodys paper long as mines just coming and its blue
turn the yacht into noahs arch im getting bitches and they come in by the two
only nigga in here asking questions see only real question nigga who is you
i aint worried bout it now im on a roll
i dont hear nobody tryna be myself
i made it here it aint no miracle
