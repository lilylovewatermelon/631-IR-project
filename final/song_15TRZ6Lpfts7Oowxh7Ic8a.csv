dont worry
everybody in the room notices you
sit back and relax
the night is early
youre about to overdo it
so come and tell me something that youve already told me
because everybodys heard all of your stories
i hope that some of them are true

verse 1
ive been losing lots of keys lately
i dont know what that means
but maybe id be better off with things that cant be locked at all
ive been feeling kind of sea sick lately
see you reaching to me going to save me
you or me i would much rather take the fall

prechorus
the world has its ways
to quiet us down
the world has its ways
to quiet us down comes the rain

chorus
down comes our spirits again
but down comes the strength
to lift us up and then

been going up when now
for too long
forget how
to let go
seems too hard
too late now
to turn around

prechorus
the world has its ways
to quiet us down
the world has its ways
to quiet us down comes the rain

chorus
down goes our spirits again
but down comes the strength
to lift us up and then1embed"
