its late in the evening
glass on the side
ive been sat with you
for most of the night
ignorin everybody here
we wish they would disappear
so maybe we could get down now
i dont wanna know
if youre gettin ahead of the program
i want you to be mine lady
to hold your body close
take another step into the nomans land
and for the longest time lady

prechorus
i need you darling
come on set the tone
if you feel youre fallin
wont you let me know
ohoh oohooh
ohoh oohooh
if you love me
come on get involved
feel it rushin through you
from your head to toe
ohoh oohooh
ohoh oohooh

verse 2
this love is ablaze i saw flames from the side of the stage
and the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
until then we got nothin to say and nothin to know
but somethin to drink and maybe somethin to smoke
let it go until our roads are changed
singin we found love in a local rave
no i dont really know what im supposed to say
but i can just figure it out then hope and pray
i told her my name then said its nice to meet you
then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
i already know if shes a keeper
just from this one small act of kindness im in
deep  if anybody finds out
i meant to drive home but i drunk all of it now
not soberin up we just sit on the couch
one thing led to another now shes kissin my mouth
prechorus
i need you darling
come on set the tone
if you feel youre fallin
wont you let me know
ohoh oohooh
ohoh oohooh
if you love me
come on get involved
feel it rushin through you
from your head to toe
ohoh oohooh
ohoh oohooh
