so bold and fine
ive known you for some time
whole life changed while
bones like yours and mine
go dance in the woods and
down we go down down
oh boy youre mine
do you remember old times

chorus mø
oh dear boy i wanna follow you
youre a wild boy i am a wild girl too
oh dear boy its so hollow without you
in a world with everything but it wont do
oh dear boy i wanna follow you
youre a wild boy i am a wild girl too
oh dear boy so shallow in the blue
its a time for everything and i call you

sweet love of mine
destruction aint a crime
for those who find
love as a game like you and i
go dance in the waters
of all the tears we have cried
oh boy were fine
do you remember our time
