its not you its the glow of the party
the way that youve got me lit up inside
its the song that theyre playin the words that youre sayin
its never felt so right

prechorus
and im the kind of person who starts getting kinda nervous
when im having the time of my life

chorus
is there a word for the way that im feeling tonight
happy and sad at the same time
you got me smiling with tears in my eyes
i never felt so high
no ive never been this far off of the ground
and they say everything that goes up must come down
but i dont wanna come down

verse 2
so is there a way to stop all this thinkin just keep on drinkin
cause i dont wanna wake up
when theyre turnin the lights on and it turns out the jokes on me
cause it feels so right

prechorus
and im the kind of person who starts getting kinda nervous

i dont mind at all no im used to fallin

but when everything is perfect i start hidin
cause i know that rain is comin my way my way
