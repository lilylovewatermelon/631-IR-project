you the it girl hey hey my inspiration
my compass spinnin baby its the right destination
come on come on tell me what i came for
i got treasure to hide so lets keep it from the strangers
your waves they wash all over me
your tides they pull me back to sea
when you bite on my lip
and hold my hand and moan again ima hold that ass
when you kiss on my lips
and hold my hand and moan again ima hold that ass
