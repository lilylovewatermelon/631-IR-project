what is perfect not me
ive been overworkin for weeks
i go home then purchase some things
that i know will not fill my needs
have a dose of what ive achieved
then get lonesome and i critique
who i am and what i believe
make up standards too high to reach
untrained animal off the leash
im in panic but yet relieved
brought your hammock to hang with me
grab a hatchet cut down your tree
like a mannequin that can speak
what i have in store is unique
i just mop the floors with mcs
i cant stop until things are clean
im an amateurs what you think
so you stand there in disbelief
til i dislocate both your feet
thats what happens you step to me
not too graphic but not pg
lots of action in every scene
im kidnapping all of your dreams
hold em hostage and watch em scream ahh
rap aside i am what i advertise
dont matter how you put it we live then we have to die
you might hate it but you cant deny
see everything that ive been doing got me lookin like a mastermind
its so vain but i vandalize that i do what you fantasizin
took a vision of my dreams
and then found a better way that i can make it
ive been looking think im really bout to maximize it agh
these bullets form in my mind and come out my mouth and pow pow pow
for anyone out there doubting or acting mouthy watch watch watch
forget what you heard about me ive been astounding got got got
something for you thinking you might run circles round me
yeah aint this all i ever wanted
thats a fact no thats a lie no
im confused yeah i got problems
whats the use yeah lets be honest
screws are loose i need em tightened
not amused yeah look what i did
brought you something hope you like it
so precise the flow the nicest
so productive stop your whining
back in style like i was vinyl
i make songs and they go viral
somethings off if i go idle
been so long yeah okay i know
take your shoes off youre in my home
you got fans but not like i do yeah i do i do
thankful i try to be cant contain whats inside of me
they dont like this side of me cause i lack in compliancy
i question what i can see if youre not playing my cd
no expiring ill decide when i think its my time to leave woo
yeah cause they wont retire me it inspires me to be inspiring
when im low i feel like im spiraling
pushin forward look i cant ignore it
there aint no i in team but drop the t and a
sometimes if im bein honest feels like its only me
no defeat notably better have it right if youre quoting me
write my name on your hit list it might be the last time you wrote something
rip that cocky smile right off your face for thinking youre close to me
grab a can of gasoline light it all over your selfesteem
selfishly watching yall helplessly pretend youre on my planet
shoot you out of the sky like youre punchlines you are not landin
gun jammin reach in your mouth and rip out your tongue after tongue
lashings i hand em out like pamphlets in church pastor
show up to my funeral wearin all black and whats happenin
i look around and wonder where my fans at
oh lord they know me so well they know im not in that casket
trash bag is prolly buried somewhere full of my ashes
my musics superb playin with words play with my nerves
they gon have a list of issues long as my shirts
very absurd very disturbed
stare at the earth like this is not the place i was birthed
im generic you sure
oh they think im very reserved
til i open up on the beat like on my therapy work
i dont care what you heard real scary carry the verse
while im wearin my merch stompin on your arrogant turf
sit back and observe nah i like to actually work
this lifes so unpredictable it just keeps pitching me curves
i take a swing i hate the things that make me feel like im dirt
ive patiently been waitin please i think its time for my turn
my expertise are melodies they talk to me when im hurt
just let me be eventually someday theyll see what im worth
i cross my is and dot my ts it makes no sense but ive learned
normal to you is not to me the outcast finally returns returns returnssee nf liveget tickets as low as 65you might also like73embed"
