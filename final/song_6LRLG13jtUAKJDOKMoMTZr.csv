see real niggas come first cause we men of respect
and do what we want in these streets
and dope boys come second
cause money make the motherfucking world go round
and fly niggas come third cause he might ain’t got no money
but he still can pull the baddest bitch in the building
we killing these streets nigga
treat the motherfucking ghost like a grand marquis
walk up with at least 20 deep and we order a feast

verse 1
i come straight from the ghetto im ballin hard as i wanna
and im thankful as ever that we aint all on the corner
dodgin death and the system yeah the refs with the whistles
cause these suckas is foul they disrespect us we hit em
niggas claiming they real they wrist and neck aint official
they got me out in the field a nigga back on his gristle
going hard with them hammers my niggas all in the slammer
niggas want catch me slippin but i dont walk on bananas
im out here strappeder than velcro and no i dont sell dough
but i spit that raw shit its like i sell coke
put one in your head nigga like right where the shell go
got one in the chamber yea we on point like an elbow
bulletproof range when i pull it shoot thangs
hit em close range let him feel the blue flame
every month i buy a new car a new chain
and i dont never fuck no bummy hoes that count they loose change

real nigga come first first and dope boy come second second
fly nigga come third and i keep birds all in my words in my words
i keep birds all in my words and them people tapping my line man that shit bad for my nerves
real bitches come first first bad bitches come second second
freak bitches come third and i keep birds all in my words
i got percs all in my system and apple juice in my syrup
and these suckers talkin this money shit y’all niggas got some nerve

verse 2
i try to keep my bitches all on lay away lay away
and if you fuck me good you getting paid today paid today
this aude on my wrist it cost me 80k
and i ain’t got no ice in it rollin out the light tinted
so these niggas see me see me sway em like graffiti fiti
i get what i wanna wanna like i own a genie genie
niggas hating on me on me
know they wanna be me at the table with my niggas eatin lobster  linguine
and that pussy smell like fiji
boy i’ll just go swimming
everything foreign from the porsches to the women
i’m early in the morning with the coca trying to flip it
nigas say they want the money but they don’t wanna go and get it
that’s why real nigga come first first dope boy come second second
fly nigga come third and i was out there on that curb
with mailbox so close with me i’m picture word that i’m worth
talkin late nights you don’t play right that kitchen wearin that work
go
