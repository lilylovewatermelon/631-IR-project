slowly surely i walk away from
that old desperate and tainted love
caught up in the maze of love
the crazy craze of love
thought it was good
thought it was real
thought it was
but it wasnt love

verse
i just dont know where i should go
so slowly surely i walk away
from selfserving undeserving
constantly hurting me love
deserting me love
you said
i said
we said but

hook
slowly surely i walk away from
confusing love misusing love abusing love
this cant be
slowly surely i walk away from
selfserving undeserving
constantly hurting me love
