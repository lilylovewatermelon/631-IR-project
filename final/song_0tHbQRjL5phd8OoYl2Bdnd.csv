you and me are the same
we dont know or care whos to blame
but we know that whoever holds the reins
nothing will change our cause has gone insane

chorus 1
and these wars they cant be won
and these wars they cant be won
and do you want them to go on and on and on
why split these states when there can be only one
and must we do as were told
must we do as were told

verse 2
you and me fall in line
to be punished for unproven crimes
and we know that theres no one we can trust
our ancient heroes they are turning to dust

chorus 2
and these wars they cant be won
does anyone know or care how they begun
they just promise to go on and on and on
but soon we will see there can be only one
