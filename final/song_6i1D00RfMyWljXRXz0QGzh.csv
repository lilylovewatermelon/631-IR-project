i know a man with nothing in his hands
nothing but a rolling stone
he told me about when his house burnt down
and he lost everything he owned
he lay asleep for six whole weeks
they were gonna ask his mother to choose
when he woke up with nothing
he said i’ll tell you something
when you’ve got nothing you’ve got nothing to lose

chorus 1
now i’ve got a hole in my pocket a hole in my shirt
a whole lot of trouble he said
but now the money’s gone life carries on
and i miss it like a hole in the head
woah now now

verse 2
i know a woman with kids around her ankles
and a baby on her lap
she said one day her husband went to get a paper
and the motherfucker never came back
mortgage to pay and four kids to raise
but keeping the wolf from the door
she said the wolf’s just a puppy and the door’s double locked
so why you gotta worry me for

now he left a hole in my heart a hole in a promise
a hole on the side of my bed
oh but now that he’s gone well life carries on
and i miss him like a hole in the head

bridge
well sometimes you can’t change and you can’t choose
and sometimes it seems you gain less than you lose
now we’ve got holes in our hearts
yeah we’ve got holes in our lives
well we’ve got holes
we’ve got holes but we carry on

well we’ve got holes in our hearts
yeah we’ve got holes in our lives
well we’ve got holes
we’ve got holes but we carry on
said we’ve got holes in our hearts
yeah we’ve got holes in our lives
well we’ve got holes
we’ve got holes but we carry on
said we’ve got holes in our hearts
we’ve got holes in our lives
we’ve got holes
we’ve got holes but we carry on
said we’ve got holes in our hearts
we’ve got holes in our lives
we’ve got holes
we’ve got holes but we carry on
said we’ve got holes in our hearts
yeah we’ve got holes in our lives
well we’ve got holes
we’ve got holes but we carry on14embed"
