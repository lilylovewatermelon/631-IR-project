in and out and out and in
and up and down and all around
were going through it
nothing to it
all youve got to do is do it
going through the motions  1234
i go you go you go me go
everywhere that we go well be
going through the motions  1234
12

going through the motions
going through the motions

i dont really care
cause youre going nowhere
youve got nothing but fear in your eyes
youre leading me on
but you can be anyone
cause i know youll be gone when i rise

and were going through the motions
going through the motions
going through the motions
going through the motions
see bonnie tyler liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likestaying with you
gave us something to do
i always thought it was true for a while
your loving your lies
youre so thinly disguised
you couldnt tell right from wrong if you tried

and were going through the motions
going through the motions
going through the motions
going through the motions

to thee ill dedicate this photograph
ill even sign it love to you again
and when its faded and forgotten in some book
youll sometimes look
youll sometimes look
youll sometimes look

its a game its a game
no lets call it a shame
cause theres no one to blame
its a pain
you were a friend for a day
so dont cry if i say
that you got what you want its ok
going through the motions
going through the motions

repeat chantembed"
