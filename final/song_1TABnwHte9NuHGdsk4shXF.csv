this time shes gonna fix her heart and make it bullet proof
he says hes gonna take a bite from the forbidden fruit
she says never never bite more than you can chew
but this time hes not gonna be another couldve been
this time shes gonna get real love the skin shes in
she says a winner never quits quitters never win
she said this time that she is built to face anything
this time hes gonna stand for who he is
this time shes gonna live to work shes not working to live
he says just because you say its true it dont mean it is
she says it seems too good to be true well then it probably is
this time hes hell bent yeah hes heaven bound
this time shes gonna pick herself up no more breaking down
he says hes gonna turn the wheel turn this shit around
she says if hes looking for love then she dont want to be found

when you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow
its so hard to keep yourself on the straight and narrow
when you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow
you fall of course
yeah when you hit the ground
its hard to get to heaven when your falling hell bound

this time hes gonna make it to the aftermath
this time shes gonna raise her head choose the righteous path
he said one day we will look back and it will make us laugh
she said better to have and not need than to need and not have
no matter what the cause its better to have loved and lost
have you ever met a man who never loved at all
yeah the higher they are the bigger they fall
you have to choose something cuz you cant have it all
no hes not gonna be the last to the finish line
she said even losers get lucky sometimes
he says its gonna get better like a fine wine
she says its harder to smell the roses when the sun dont shine
this time hes gonna find another way
this time shes gonna take you to the good oldays with no gracing
only warm embraces with the two little sweet angels with dirty faces
see the script liveget tickets as low as 119you might also likewhen you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow
its so hard to keep yourself on the straight and narrow
when you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow
you fall of course
yeah when you hit the ground
its hard to get to heaven when your falling hell bound

every break every burn every toss every turn every sin anything youve learned its all programmed all programmed
every break every burn every toss every turn every sin everything weve learned its all programmed all programmed

when you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow
its so hard to keep yourself on the straight and narrow
when you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow
you fall of course
yeah when you hit the ground
its hard to get to heaven when youre born hell bound8embed"
