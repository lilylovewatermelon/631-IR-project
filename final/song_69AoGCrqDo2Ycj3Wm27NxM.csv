verse 1
faded but i still stopped
when i saw you on my way out
i roll all my sleeves up
you may be a situation

prechorus
say you want my heart its a silly thing to start
i can tell you know what it takes to make me fall apart

chorus
so here we are its going down
such a sweet talker turning me around
you aint gotta look like a movie star
cause boy you sound so sweet you can have it all
talk about a teachers pet
baby you look cute when you make my bed
you just keep singing those lullabies
sweet talk me all night honey pie
