never twentyone when everyones a sailor
coming up strong at the animal bar
ever loving mug of mr norman mailer
turn another page at the animal bar
and it wont be long
no it wont be long
no it wont be long
because it cant be long

prechorus anthony kiedis  john frusciante
i i i— the cry of isolation
i i i— the high of meditation
i i i— for sweet precipitation
i i i— the high of deprivation
and it wont be long
no it wont be long
no it wont be long
because it cant be long

chorus anthony kiedis john frusciante
rain on my frustration bahparapa
bahparapa stake my claim now break this
wash me down my station bahparapa
bahparapa makes more rain forsaken
in between the sky and every piece of the earth bahparapa
bahparapa bahparapa one two three— lets break this
runnin through the mud i gotta feeling of worth bahparapa
bahparapa one two three— forsake this

all aboard the ship cause youre gonna need an ark
when the wet comes down youll be swimming like a shark
mopping up the pain and im a little older
right as rain at the animal bar
and it wont be long
no it wont be long
no it wont be long
because it cant be long

prechorus anthony kiedis with john frusciante
i i i— the cry of isolation

i i i— for sweet precipitation
i i i— the high of deprivation
and it wont be long
no it wont be long
no it wont be long
because it cant be long

bridge anthony kiedis with john frusciante
raindrops will fall from the sky
stealing their shape from your eye
now we can all get some sleep
the water the water
the water saving us from the heat
some things will die in their place
others will leave little trace
and fire will come find its day
the water the water
the water washing it all away

chorus anthony kiedis john frusciante
rain on my frustration bahparapa
bahparapa stake my claim now break this
wash me down my station bahparapa
bahparapa makes more rain forsaken
in between the sky and every piece of the earth bahparapa
bahparapa one two three— lets make this
in between the sky and every piece of the earth bahparapa
bahparapa one two three— forsake this
in between the sky and every piece of the earth bahparapa
bahparapa one two three— lets make this
in between the sky and every piece of the earth bahparapa
bahparapa one two three— forsake this
