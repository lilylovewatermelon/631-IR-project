eventually fading into night
these two are opening now
as we lie i touch you under fuller light
girl if youre a seascape im a listing boat
for the thing carries every hope
i invest in a single light
the choice is yours to be loved
come away from an emptier boat
cause when the dead moon rises again
weve no time to start a protocol to hem us in
and when the dog slides underneath the train
theres no cry no use to searching for the mutts remains
throw all consequence aside
in a cheerless pyre we will set alight
of all the intersecting lines in the sand
i routed a labyrinth to your lap
i never used a map sliding off the land
on an incidental tide
and along the way you know they try they try
and we got sea legs and were off tonight
can ive that to which theyve no right
you belong to a simpler time
im a victim to the impact of these words
and this rhyme
you might also likecause when that dead moon rises again
weve no time to start a protocol to hem us in
darling when the dog slides open the door and whered she go
theres no time no use to searching for the mutts remains
throw all consequence aside
in a cheerless pyre that we will set alight2embed"
