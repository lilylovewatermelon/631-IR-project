trouble travels fast
when youre specially designed for crash testing
or wearing wool sunglasses in the afternoon
come on and tell us what youre trying to prove
because its a battle when you dabble in war
you store it up unleash it then you piece it together
whether the storm drain running rampant just stamp it
and send it to somebody whos pretending to care
just cash in your blanks for little toy tanks
learn how to use them
then abuse them and choose them over conversations
relationships are overrated
i hated everyone said the sun
and so i will cook all your books
youre too good looking and mistaken
you could watch it instead
from the comfort of your burning beds
or you can sleep through the static

chorus
who needs sleep when weve got love
who needs keys when weve got clubs
who needs please when weve got guns
who needs peace when weve gone above
but beyond where we should have gone
we went beyond where we should have gone

stuck between channels my thoughts all quit
i thought about them too much allowed them to touch
the feelings that rained down on the plains all dried and cracked
waiting for things that never came
shock and awful thing to make somebody think
that they have to choose pushing for peace supporting the troops
and either youre weak or youll use brute forcefeed the truth
the truth is we say not as we do
we say anytime anywhere just show your teeth and strike the fear
of god wears camouflage cries at night and drives a dodge
pick up the beat and stop hogging the feast
thats no way to treat an enemy
well mighty mighty appetite
we just eat them up and keep on driving
freedom can be freezing take a picture from the pretty side
mind your manners wave your banners
what a wonderful world that this angle can see
