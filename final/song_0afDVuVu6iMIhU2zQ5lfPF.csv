i could paint a picture with a pen
but a song will only scratch the skin
and there are still places i havent been
because i know whats in there is already in the air
oh yeah theres a storm on the way
theres a storm on the way alright
theres a storm on the way uh huh
and its comin no matter what i say
and i come i come i come i come

verse 1
hey hey hey
theres truth in the thunder love in the lightning
the feeling is frightening yet isnt it exciting
im something like stormy weather if i werent we would never
huddle together do i have to tell you
that im also the sunlight that shines shortly after
i just rain cause i have to on to a new chapter
i wish you lots of laughter til the next time you see me
just remember you need me im the storm coming

refrain
and i come i come i come i come
oh come on
and i come i come i come i come
come on

run towards the hills to avoid the high flood
i can do a dance thatll make the sky cry blood
skills provoke and seals will be broken open
all thats left to do is try my love
woo

verse 2
when i sing its a cyclone
im writing a raging sea
searching for a sign of the times
is it safe to say its me
listen to our lives
the wind will whisper the way it is
i am going to happen
what a lovely day it is

outro
dont ask why
just live and die4embed"
