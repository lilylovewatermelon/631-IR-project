dancin on the edge of the love youre a beautiful sight
so whyre you still standin there in the half moonlight

come on baby give me a little more you

youre battin those baby blues and honey i swear
the way you got me needing you girl it just aint fair
youve given me a little bit yeah but dont stop there

come on baby give me a little more you

im here fallin for you my hearts callin for you
i know i never can get enough
dont hold back one bit of your love
strong and steady for you im all ready
come on baby give me a little more you

youre teasin me with a touch and the whole world shakes
keep holdin that river back and the levee may break
theres only so much that this ol boy can take
