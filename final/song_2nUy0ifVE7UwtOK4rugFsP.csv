seek me call me
ill be waiting
seek me call me
ill be waiting

verse 1
this distance this dissolution
i cling to memories while falling
sleep brings release and the hope of a new day
waking the misery of being without you
surrender i give in
another moment is another eternity

chorus
seek me for comfort call me for solace
ill be waiting for the end of my broken heart
seek me completion call me ill be waiting
ill be waiting for the end of my broken heart

verse 2
you know me you know me all too well
my only desire  to bridge our division
in sorrow i speak your name
and my voice mirrors mirrors my torment

my strength fails me
your picture a bitter memory

seek me for comfort call me for solace
ill be waiting for the end of my broken heart9embed"
