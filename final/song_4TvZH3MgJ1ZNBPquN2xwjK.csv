i dont know where to look
dont know where to walk
dont know how ive been acting lately
absent minded kind of crazy
talking to my room
singing for the moon
watch the hours melt away
i sit and dream all night and day

chorus
lately ive been in a haze
running late cant think straight
the world feels smaller
yet the trees look taller
theres enchantment in the air
i know i sound stupid i do
thats what love will do to you

verse 2
read the same old book
for the hundredth time
at least i know of how it ends
in real life it just all depends
losing my mind
drunk on jazz and wine
basking in the blinding bliss
of flushed out cheeks a good night kiss
see laufey liveget tickets as low as 53you might also likechorus
latеly ive been in a haze
running late cant think straight
thе world feels smaller
yet the trees look taller
theres enchantment in the air
i know i sound stupid i do
thats what love will do to youembed"
