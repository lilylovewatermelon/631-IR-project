so here we are back to the start again
trying hard to wait ‘til morning
hey rise and shine and open up your eyes
to give this world some color
shine on diamond eyes
separate the space between love and lies

chorus jt woodruff with casey calvert
and as days go by the memories remain
ill wait for you
and as days go by the memories remain
i wont let go

postchorus jt woodruff with casey calvert
these days remain the same
pictures fade away

verse 2 jt woodruff
please dont ever change
please dont change your mind
no matter what they say ill always wait

chorus jt woodruff with casey calvert
and as days go by the memories remain
ill wait for you
and as days go by the memories remain
i wont let go
