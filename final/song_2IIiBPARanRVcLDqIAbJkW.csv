come on everybody throw your hands up

we ride with gangsters and the pimpings easy

verse 1 charlie scene  jdog
when i ride with jdog
its like okay basically
we get shitfaced and crazy
were screaming fuck the police
jjust like eazy lets smoke these
with old e and charlie
we mix it over a hard beat
and roll with the undead army
and you dont need to see the best of me

i keep on blowing up
my head keeps getting fatter every day baby

cause you know theyll play me
in the club you in the corner
while my shit go crazy
and i got my soldiers in the back
so you dont wanna face me
and when your girl look up at me im looking right down
and all that yapping you know it gon get you smacked down
i stick around to keep it mad while the crowds loud
in the city of la thats my hometown
