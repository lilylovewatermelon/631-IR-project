folks are irrational
kids are all animals
truths only shadows from fire cast onto walls
listen to what mama say
only truth in early may
problem with invertebrate cant trust what theyll articulate

chorus
smile ol kid
youve got to keep it hid
youve got to laugh it off
no matter what they said
and all the people say
whats it matter anyway
cause in the end well all evaporate

verse 2
went too far today
knife felt far too great
hacksawed slackjawed dogma gang
with her face in the honey
her moon in the rain
her back to the wind she felt just great

chorus
smile ol kid
youve got to keep it hid
youve got to laugh it off
no matter what they said
and all the people say
whats it matter anyway
cause in the end well all evaporateyou might also like1embed"
