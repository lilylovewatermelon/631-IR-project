verse 1
we were at the table by the window with the view
casting shadows the sun was pushing through
spoke a lot of words i dont know if i spoke the truth

prechorus
got so much to lose
got so much to prove
god dont let me lose my mind

chorus
trouble on my left trouble on my right
ive been facing trouble almost all my life
my sweet love wont you pull me through
everywhere i look i catch a glimpse of you
i said it was love and i did it for life didnt do it for you
