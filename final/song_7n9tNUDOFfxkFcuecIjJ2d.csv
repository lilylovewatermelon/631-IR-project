the whole truth and nothing but the truth
stop me if youve heard this one before
the whole truth is nothing but a good excuse
so long as you dont torture me with my past
lets be honest a secret silenced is a secret safe

well every hour on the hour
every hour on the hour

whoever i was then
i cant ever be again

verse 2
reminders they are not reluctant
so stop me if youve heard this one before
sideways blinders
i cant find a way around a way around
a way around
