i can see it your eyes youre hurting
but pain is part of learning who you are
all these truths can sometimes be deceiving
when your whole world comes crashing to the ground

chorus 1
tell me everything you need now anything at all
and i will be the one whos waiting anytime you fall

chorus 2
yeah when you come undone
when you come undone

verse 2
you know i cant be like everybody
cause i cant tell you what you want to hear
i dont know if i can make it better
all i know is i will be around

chorus 1
tell me everything you need now anything at all
and i will be the one whos waiting anytime you fall

chorus 2
yeah when you come undone
when you come undone

when all your plans are made out lying on the floor
and all your dreams are turning into nothing more
when all your hope has left you know youre not alone
just hold on
hold on

chorus 1
tell me everything you need now anything at all
and i will be the one whos waiting anytime you fall

chorus 2
yeah when you come undone
when you come undone1embed"
