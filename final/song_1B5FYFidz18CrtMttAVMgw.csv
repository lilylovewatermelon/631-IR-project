yea hollywood boulevard
looking down seeing stars
90210 rodeo is rodeo
glad i hit it glad i did it and id do it again
yea and hang with my friends

with them red maseratis and them tuned up bodies
and everybody going to be the next somebody
yea this place is a trip
hey but meanwhile back in the sticks

chorus
somebodys having a small town big time night
somebodys rocking the main street with red tail lights
somebodys cranking it up or falling in love
or keeping the buzz sipping on a little moonlight

verse 2
yea they know how to rock
out in the boondocks
cause believe me ive been there
somebodys having a small town big time night somewhere

yea two lane town squares
cotton queens county fairs
with a water tank
got 100 girls names under the paint
see blake shelton liveget tickets as low as 49you might also likeglad i hit it glad i did it and id do it again
yea i miss my friends

with them pick them up trucks and them dirt road ruts
and all them country girls get to strutting their stuff
east west north or south
yea you better believe that right about now

chorus
somebodys having a small town big time night
somebodys rocking the main street with red tail lights
somebodys cranking it up or falling in love
or lighting it up with a kc spotlight

verse 3
yea they all got the swerve
down back in their hometown
i wish that i was there
somebodys having a small town big time night somewhere

chorus
somebodys having a small town big time night
somebodys rocking the main street with red tail lights
somebodys cranking it up or falling in love
and twisting it up and dodging them blue lights
verse 4
yea they know how to kick it
way out past the limits
cause baby ive been there
somebodys having a small town big time night somewhere

yea somebodys having a small town big time night somewhere
i wish that i was there
yea i wish that i was there1embed"
