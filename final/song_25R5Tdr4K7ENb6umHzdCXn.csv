i was born in a thunderstorm
i grew up overnight
i played alone i played on my own
i survived
hey i wanted everything i never had
like the love that comes with light
i wore envy and i hated that
but i survived

prechorus
i had a oneway ticket to a place where all the demons go
where the wind dont change
and nothing in the ground can ever grow
no hope just lies
and youre taught to cry in your pillow
but i survived

chorus
im still breathing im still breathing
im still breathing im still breathing
im alive im alive
im alive im alive

verse 2
i found solace in the strangest place
way in the back of my mind
i saw my life in a strangers face
and it was mine

bridge 1
i have made every single mistake
that you could ever possibly make
i took and i took and i took what you gave
but you never noticed that i was in pain
i knew what i wanted i went out and got it
i did all the things that you said that i wouldnt
i told you that i would never be forgotten
and all in spite of you
chorus
and im still breathing im still breathing
im still breathing im still breathing
im alive
