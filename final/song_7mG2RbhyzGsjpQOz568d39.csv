tell me where our time went
and if it was time well spent
just dont let me fall asleep
feeling empty again

prechorus
cause i fear i might break
and i fear i cant take it
tonight ill lie awake
feeling empty

chorus
i can feel the pressure
its getting closer now
were better off without you
i can feel the pressure
its getting closer now
were better off without you

verse 2
now that im losing hope
and theres nothing else to show
for all of the days that we spent
carried away from home

i can feel the pressure
its getting closer now
were better off without you
i can feel the pressure
its getting closer now
were better off without you

some things ill never know
and i had to let them go
some things ill never know
and i had to let them go

feeling empty

chorus
