in demon days its cold inside
you dont get nobody people sigh
its so bad lasting far but love yourself
hiding in a hole in there
all the glasses are far too big
bring it back got to hold it back
to let you do that yet you dont want me back
before it fall down falling down falling down
falling down to go far from the sun
chorus the london community gospel choir
in these demon days were so cold inside
its so hard for a good soul to survive
you cant even trust the air you breathe
cause mother earth want us all to leave
when lies become reality
you numb yourself with drugs and tv
pick yourself up its a brand new day
so turn yourself round
dont burn yourself turn yourself
turn yourself around to the sun
in these demon days were so cold inside
its so hard for a good soul to survive
you cant even trust the air you breathe
cause mother earth wants us all to leave
when lies become reality
you numb yourself with drugs and tv
pick yourself up its a brand new day
so turn yourself round
dont burn yourself turn yourself
turn yourself around into the sun
