til the need seeps in
you low animal
collect your novel petals for the stem

and glow glow
melt and flow
eviscerate your fragile frame
and spill it out in the ragged floor
a thousand different versions of yourself

and if the old guard still offend
they got nothing left on which you depend
so enlist every ounce
of your bright blood
and off with their heads

jump from the hook
youre not obliged to swallow anything you despise
see those unrepenting buzzards want your life
and they got no right
as sure as you have eyes
they got no right
just put yourself in my new shoes
and see that i do what i do
because the old guard still offend
their pudgy hearts and shiny heads
theyve got nothing left on which we depend
so enlist every ounce
of your bright blood
and off with their heads
jump from the hook
youre not obliged to swallow anything you despise
that you despiseyou might also like12embed"
