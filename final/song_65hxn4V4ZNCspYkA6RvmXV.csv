waiting in the security line
i was mad as hell that i might miss my plane
ive been on the road for weeks
cheap hotels and i aint had no sleep in days
thats when i heard the lady behind me crying
mascara running from her eyes
shed just got the news
this morning her husband died in a head on wreck
i turned around to her and said maam is there anything i can do

chorus
she said just thank god
for everything youve got
i felt so stupid being mad
after seeing her so sad
i need to check my heart
i need to watch my mouth
have a little more faith
a little less doubt it aint that hard to figure out

verse 2
i got more than a man can need
a job a house a family alive and well
friends that call me all the time
looking at my life seeing her crying all by herself
see lee brice liveget tickets as low as 88you might also likechorus

outro
waiting in the security line
i was mad as hell that i might miss my planeembed"
