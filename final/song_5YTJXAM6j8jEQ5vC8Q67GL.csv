georgia georgia i love your son
and when he gets older he might be the one oh
he might be the one
georgia georgia he has beautiful bones
and he never lies or picks up his phone

prechorus
and sometimes in the pouring rain
hell fall in the mud and get back up again

chorus
and if you find me will you know me
will you take me or will you fall fall

postchorus

verse 2
here is my day plan heres my new machine
hes a fine new addition so young and so clean
so young and so clean
he came up through the water without a sound
with my back to the shoreline i dreamt that he drowned
i dreamt that he drowned oh
you might also likeprechorus
and sometimes when he looks at me
i know he needs you youre all that he sees

chorus
and if i breathe you will it kill me
will you have me or watch me fall fall
if i fix you will you hate me
and would you fuck this and let us fall fall fall
