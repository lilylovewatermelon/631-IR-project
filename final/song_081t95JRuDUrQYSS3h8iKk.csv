i feel terrible sunlights hurting my eyes
so i pull the shades and i make my place as black as night
i feel miserable and im missing you and me
nother sunday morning all alone underneath these sheets

chorus chris young and vince gill
no im not hungover its true but im still not over you
all messed up all strung out
i was sitting at home breaking down
not out there getting high underneath some neon lights
aint no whiskey strong enough to make things right
im just getting over another sober saturday night

verse 2 chris young
besides the pain i dont feel a thing
when my buddies call me up i just let it ring

chorus chris young and vince gill
no im not hungover its true but im still not over you
all messed up all strung out
i was sitting at home breaking down
not out there getting high underneath some neon lights
aint no whiskey strong enough to make things right
im just getting over another sober saturday night
