sorry that ive been livin in my head
holdin onto words i aint said yet
im bitter sorry i just cant see
you with someone that isnt me
you should know ive been tryna find my peace
i know its difficult being with me
but i just wanna love you this way
and you just make it so hard for me

chorus
but you cant help me
you cant help me

verse 2
sorry that ive been yelling in your face
i know you hate when i speak to you this way
i lost my patience losing control
turned into someone i dont know
i know i got my shit and you got yours too
and all my problems i try to put on you
im singing cause im done screaming out
i cant blame you for all my doubts

chorus
you cant help me
you cant help me
you cant help me
cant help me
