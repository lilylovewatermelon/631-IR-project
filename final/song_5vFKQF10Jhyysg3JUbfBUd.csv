squeaky swings and tall grass
the longest shadows ever cast
the waters warm and children swim
and we frolicked about in our summer skin
i dont recall a single care
just greenery and humid air
then labor day came and went
and we shed what was left of our summer skin

instrumental break

verse 2
on the night you left i came over
and we peeled the freckles from our shoulders
our brand new coats were so flushed and pink
and i knew your heart i couldnt win

outro
cause the seasons change was a conduit
and wed left our love in our summer skinsee death cab for cutie liveget tickets as low as 147you might also like3embed"
