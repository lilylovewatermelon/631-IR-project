when the world has turned paralyzed and wrong
coldblooded claws never offered anything at all
past the point of love shattered and untied
waiting to pick up the pieces that make it all alright

chorus 1
but pieces of what
pieces of what
pieces of what
doesnt matter anymore

verse 2
moonlight on my floor shinin through the roof
they got the city surrounded as if i needed proof
i forgot my fear feelings on the rise
buried by all of the pieces fallin from the sky

chorus 2
but pieces of what
pieces of what
pieces of what
we used to call home
pieces of what
we used to call home

lay my dragons teeth and shallow water steel
at the belgian gates i waited for my meal13embed"
