oh gotta see gotta know right now
whats that riding on your everything
it isnt anything at all

verse 2
oh gotta see gotta know right now
whats that writing on your shelf
in the bathrooms and the bad motels
no one really cared for it at all
not the gravity plan

prechorus
early early in the morning
it pulls all on down my sore feet
i wanna go back to sleep

chorus
in the motions and the things that you say
it all will fall fall right into place
as fruit drops flesh it sags
everything will fall right into place
when we die some sink and some lay
but at least i dont see you float away
and all the spilt milk sex and weight
it all will fall fall right into place

prechorus
early early in the morning
