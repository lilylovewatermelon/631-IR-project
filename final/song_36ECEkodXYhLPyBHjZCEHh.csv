even a well lit place can hide salvation
a map to a one man maze that never sees the sun
where the lost are the heroes
and the thieves are left to drown
but everyone knows by now
fairytales are not found
they are written in the walls

chorus
as we walk in a straight line
down in the dirt with a landslide approaching
but nothing could ever stop us
from stealing our own place in the sun
we will face the odds against us
and run into the fear we run from ah ah
it has begun

verse 2
into the dark below
evading shadows
blind in a rabbits hole
we fall beneath the earth
and watch the shell come unraveled
as the seed begins to rise
embracing a starlit fate as we wait in the night
its written in the walls

as we walk in a straight line
down in the dirt with a landslide approaching
but nothing could ever stop us
from stealing our own place in the sun
we will face the odds against us
and run into the fear we run from ah ah
