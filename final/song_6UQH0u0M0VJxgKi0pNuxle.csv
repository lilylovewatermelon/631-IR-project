why is it all or nothin everywhere
you got your life and i got mine
whys our relationship hangin on the line
i dont want to own you
i just want to know you
i just want to love you
more than words can say

baby take another look at your heart
and tell me you dont want me
baby tell me youre not comin apart
i can hold out til you break
baby take another look at your heart
youre breakin up thats no surprise
so much invested in our socalled love lives
give it up heart over mind
you cant explain away
the tears you been cryin
i dont want to own you
i just want to know you
i just want to love you
