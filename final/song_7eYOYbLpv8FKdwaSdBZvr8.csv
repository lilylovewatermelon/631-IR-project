she slams the front door cause she knows that i cant stand it
gives me the finger cause she knows im wrapped around it
she calls me sweetheart cause she knows it makes me weak
she stepped in dog poo and im still kissing her feet

chorus
can you believe how this girl treats me like a king
she took more than she gave to me
i gave my love i got an std
and if she comes home
i hope that shell marry me
i want to tell her that its over now
hey look im arguing with myself
i think that my girlfriend is bad for my mental health
and now im scaring myself

verse 2
the roller coaster makes me sick and she knows it
thats why she always insists that i go on it
she told her friends that i need therapy yeah
i need a selfhelp group or a lobotomy

chorus
can you believe how this girl treats me like a king
she took more than she gave to me
i gave my love i got an std
and if she comes home
i hope that shell marry me
i want to tell her that its over now
hey look im arguing with myself
i think that my girlfriend is bad for my mental health
and now im scaring myself
