verse 1 shaggy 2 dope  violent j
the witch jumped on my back last night
i couldnt breathe in its clutch i was frozen with fright
it went on for what seemed like hours of terror
to see the witchs face stare in the dark at the mirror
the witch told me my girlfriend was a demon
and all this fallin in love shit im dreamin
and its pain to the angels if i dont deliver
i sealed her off in a barrel and rolled her in the river
the witch told me my left arm is possessed
so i broke it at first and then i went and confessed
but they put me in a home the arm still wouldnt leave me alone
finally had to chew it off at the bone daeh dereves
the witch told me to crawl under my house and just wait
dont panic if i suffocate
i bit the tail off a possum down there at one point
its so boring and its dark but the witch is my life

chorus violent j  shaggy 2 dope
something is standing in between me and my sanity
they say my witch is just a dream morbid fantasy
i say wake the dead wake the dead wake em
wake the dead wake the dead wake em
i say wake the dead wake the dead wake em
wake the dead wake the dead wake em

the witch told me i gotta murder this one kid
kay well maybe the witch didnt then but i did
with a ninja suit crept through like a black widow
with a crossbow stuck him in the neck like ditto

out of the neck and what particular veins

the witch told me to put my feet in the fire and hold on
until everything below the knees gone
now im in a wheelchair with only an arm but dont care
