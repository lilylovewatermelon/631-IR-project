verse 1
remember make believe in you
all the things i said id do
i wouldnt hurt you like the world did me
keep you safe id keep you sweet
everything that i went through
im grateful you wont have to do
i know that you will have to fall
i cant hide you from it all

and then you know no matter what
before you walk away you know you can

love so hard and play life loud
its the only thing to give a damn about
