pure as we begin
pure as we come in
pure as we begin
move by will alone

verse 2
pure as we begin
here we have a stone
gather place and raise so
shelter turns to home

verse 3
pure as we begin
here we have a stone
throw to stay the stranger
swore to crush his bones

chorus
move by will alone

flame becomes a fire
light the way or warm this

spark becomes a flame
flame becomes a fire
forge a blade to slay the stranger
take whatever we desire

move by will alone
pure as we begin

pure as we begin
move by will alone
leave as we come in
