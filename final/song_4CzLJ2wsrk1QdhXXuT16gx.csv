hey i fall in love with you
i dont know where i am
youre runnin through my mind
and then you show me love
in my room in my room
uh
hey you went away to save
yourself from all the rain
and then i picked you up
and then i showed you love
and then we talked
let our guards down down down
i say you you took me all around
then treat me like a dog
and make me walk for miles
and then you held me up
i will never not love you
not love you uh
