step right up everyone
whether youre good or bad happy or sad
whether youre an emotional wreck
or a blissful speck in this black hole of an existence we call life
step right up and witness something youll be soon to never forget
feast your ears on the most ferociously
soothing ways of sonic communication to ever be created
built for you by the master

built for you by the ma
hey shut up already what is it

uh yeah dog what is it
what is it
