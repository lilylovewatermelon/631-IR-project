girl youre so fly so fly
you really blow my mind my mind
lets not waste any more time
ill just meet you overseas
we can do it on the plane
i just wanna be with you
i wanna meet you in brazil
take you to a place that you never been before
we can just lay on the beach
and just fall asleep or maybe meet up in japan
maybe we can just hold hands
lets go get drunk in golden gai
maybe meet up in russia

i dont really care who sees
lets join the mile high club
