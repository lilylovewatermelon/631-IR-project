she left about three weeks ago
a single man is a new thing
but ive been here before
and ive been drinking ive been smoking
ive been looking around
i need a stranger to break some new ground

chorus
and maybe ill get lucky tonight
find me a girl take my heartache away
set sail blues
ill see you another day wouldnt that be so fine
maybe ill get lucky tonight

verse 2
i dance on to the song
a melody pulling at my heartstrings
bout a love gone wrong
and ive been doing everything i can
trying to move on

chorus
and maybe ill get lucky tonight
find me a girl take my heartache away
set sail blues
ill see you another day wouldnt that be so fine
maybe ill get lucky tonight

fade away with the party lights
whiskey on ice makes you feel real nice
its how you doin
girl how you been baby
maybe ill get lucky tonight

chorus
and maybe ill get lucky tonight
find me a girl take my heartache away
set sail blues
ill see you another day wouldnt that be so fine
maybe ill get lucky tonight
take me take me take me away
take me take me take me away
wouldnt that be so fineembed"
