somehow everythings gonna fall right into place
if we only had a way to make it all fall faster every day
if only time flew like a dove
well god make it fly faster than im falling in love

chorus
this time were not giving up
lets make it last forever
screaming hallelujah
well make it last forever

verse 2
holding on to patience wearing thin
i cant force these eyes to see the end
if only time flew like a dove
well we could watch it fly and just keep looking up

chorus
this time were not giving up
lets make it last forever
screaming hallelujah
well make it last forever

bridge
and weve got time on our hands
weve got time got nothing but time on our hands
got nothing but got nothing but
weve got time got nothing but time on our hands
