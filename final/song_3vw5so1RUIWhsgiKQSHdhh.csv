i wish id been born in a different day
with cowboys like old gus mccrae
id just saddle up and ride away
i wish id been born in a different day

verse 2
well i wish i couldve lived in a different time
when willie and waylon walked the line
its an era long gone and it seems a crime
i wish i couldve lived in a different time

chorus
well im stuck out here in no mans land
just an ace of spades in a diamond flush hand
i still do the best i can to fit in
but time it aint ever really been my friend

verse 3
well i wish you couldve seen me in a different light
i wish i couldve been your shining knight
but ill always be a friend in your eyes
well i wish you couldve seen me in a different light

chorus
and now im stuck out here in no mans land
im just an ace of spades in a diamond flush hand
i still do the best i can to fit in
but time it aint ever really been my friend

i wish id been born in a different dayembed"
