i love that one
four three one two three four

verse 1
got a whiskeydrinkin fever that i cannot shake
and those girls downtown are more than i can take
highwaisted rockies and the sailors mouths
and the boys in the back of the bar scream loud

refrain
oh whiskey river take me home

verse 2
and i smell like cologne and cigarettes
but i aint found a lady or a bar fight yet
ill wait around just to stir shit up
that whiskey river flowin aint ever enough

refrain
oh whiskey river take me home

verse 3
cause im a heavydrinkin hardhittin good ol boy
there aint a man in this county that can keep me employed
cant stay sober past 11 am
my breath smells like my regrets again
see zach bryan liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likerefrain
oh whiskey river take me home

verse 4
i had a woman in wisconsin and a woman in maine
but they told me that theyd never love a man so insane
i head to oklahoma with the flask and a comb
do my best to find another place i can roam

refrain
oh whiskey river take me home

verse 5
there was no one in town that would give me a ride
so i waited for my heavy drunkenness to subside
stole a pickup truck from a gas station pump
i pray to the lord for a run of good luck

refrain
oh whiskey river take me home

instrumental break

interlude
yeah
verse 6
and i was four hundred miles down highway 10
all of a sudden i was arrested again
they told me eight years in the county pen
or eight years in the army killin evil men

refrain
oh whiskey river take me home

bridge
now theres sand in my boots sand in my eyes
sand everywhere that sand can hide
how i miss those downtown girls
and that whiskey river that ruined my world
oh uncle sam i wanna go home

verse 1
i had a whiskeydrinkin fever that i could not shake
and those girls downtown were more than i could take
the highwaisted rockies and the sailors mouths
boys in the back of the bar screamin loud

outro
oh whiskey river take me home
oh whiskey river i wanna go home
that take ripped
that take fuckin ripped dude1embed"
