i dont even know why i fuck with you

bitch whatever is comfortable
shit this the type of shit couples do
shoulda thought about cuffin you bitch
nigga you dirty and you broke
ho you goofy and gullible fuck you talkin bout
mm the insecurities you got wont mindfuck me
womanizer got no affection from yo mama i see
dont speak on my mama the fuck is yo problem
that bitch dont like me anyways
bitch she gave you the honda fuck
and used that shit to throw it in my face man hol on bro
find it funny you just cant apologize this bitch dawg
egotistic narcissistic love your own lies bro
see you the reason why strong women fucked up
why they say its a mans world see you the reason for trump
you crying bro
you the reason we overlooked underpaid underbooked under shame
if you look i dont speak then im called on my name hah
i am flawed i am pained never yours i remained come on bro
you the reason bitches start fuckin with bitches when they change
you the reason bitches start callin yall bitches cause yall useless
you the reason harvey weinstein had to see his conclusion
you the reason r kelly cant recognize that hes abusive
man shut the fuck up we all know you still playin his music
said im tired of these emotionalass ungratefulass bitches
fake innocent fake feminist stop pretendin
yall sentiments aint realer than what you defendin
here he go shut the fuck up
its a split decision broads like you and real victims look at you look at you
lets talk the truth okay women in general just cant get along explain nigga
hmm when tash got a man you didnt pick up the phone explain nigga
uhuh when nate got a job you said you stayin home explain
oh why rb bitches dont feature on each other songs then
what the fuck is you talkin bout
never mind bitch im walkin out
whatever nigga im off you now
yo evil ass kept me well in doubt
pussy nigga best watch your mouth
pussy and mouth is all you got
lay this pussy back on the couch
doggie style then you get on top
interlude taylour paige  kendrick lamar
