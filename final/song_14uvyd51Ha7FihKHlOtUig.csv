if i retreat
words wars and symphonies
make room were taking over here
and youre the galantine
cold and alone it suits you well
wont find me perching here again

verse 2
may your feet serve you well
and the rest be sent to hell
where they always have belonged
cold hearts brew colder songs
fate will play us out
with a song of pure romance
so stomp your feet and clap your hands

chorus
lets kill tonight kill tonight
show them all youre not the ordinary type
lets kill tonight kill tonight
show them all youre not the ordinary type
lets kill tonight

verse 3
may your feet serve you well
and the rest be sent to hell
where they always have belonged
cold hearts brew colder songs
fate will play us out
with a song of pure romance
so stomp your feet and clap your hands
