few days before he turned 80
he was sitting out back in a rocker
he said what you been up to lately
i told him chasing a dollar
and in between sips of coffee
he poured this wisdom out
said if you want my two cents on making a dollar count

chorus jordan davis
buy dirt
find the one you cant live without
get a ring let your knee hit the ground
do what you love but call it work
and throw a little money in the plate at church
send your prayers up and your roots down deep
add a few limbs to your family tree
and watch their pencils marks and the grass in the yard
all grow up
cause the truth about it is it all goes by real quick
you cant buy happiness
but you can buy dirt

verse 2 luke bryan
before you get caught on that ladder
let me tell you what its all about
find you a few things that matter
that you can put a fence around
and then he laid it out

and add a few limbs to your family tree
and watch their pencils marks and the grass in the yard

and thank the good lord for it
cause he aint makin any more of it

chorus jordan davis luke bryan both 
so buy dirt
find the one you cant live without
get a ring let your knee hit the ground
do what you love but call it work
and throw a little money in the plate at church
send your prayers up and your roots down deep
add a few limbs to your family tree
and watch their pencils marks and the grass in the yard
all grow up
cause the truth about it is it all goes by real quick
you cant buy happiness
but you can buy dirt6embed"
