verse 1
yeah woah yeah
and i wrote licks i hit on my ones when i didnt have no friends to ride
sticks on my dawgs and i cant even lie to you
got too much pride for you
gotta stay safe in these streets
streets dont play favorites though
im not afraid of it though
god is okay with me so
life of that shade that you throw
ive seen you take it low
limbo right under that ho
fuck out my face

verse 2
once is a lot of things
twice is a decision
told me a lot of things
forced into submission got you mercedеsbenz

friendship and loyalty thats not what its giving
given that why would i keep you around
