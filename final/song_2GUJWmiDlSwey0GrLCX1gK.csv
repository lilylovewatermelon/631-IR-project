i dont do this for no thangs
i dont do this for no chains
i dont do this for no change i love yall
i dont do it for no rings
i just do this shit cause i can
yeah
henny gon fill me up i need some dope when i drink

verse
i dont care who you is
i dont care what you did
i dont care where you live
fuck outta here
niggas know what it is
pussy niggas on the fence
i know niggas that hit
dirty money cant rinse
see your bitch i bought her
your bitch get caught up
life gon get you caught up
thats why i tat up my body
thats what i cant trust nobody
my niggas the wildest
we used to fuck up they parties
girls gave me that sloppy
late night in that dungeon
you might also likehook
but ill be true
if you promise that youll defend me
ill be true to you
and what you are can lay here firmly
ill do the worrying baby
i aint saying i aint crazy

chorus
dont put me down
if you can be honest then
teach these babies how to love they wont know how to hate if you show em something different
ill do anything
ill go all the way
ill jump off a plane
target on my chest for you
oh if you can
if you can be honest then
ill do anything
ill go all the way
ill jump off a plane
target on my chest for you4embed"
