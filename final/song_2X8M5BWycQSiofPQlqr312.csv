shell probably leave me for some college fool
and i know thats just the way it goes

in funny old place under the street light
face to face here on our last night
you should know one thing before you go

i tell her weve gone too far to give up now
and like a bomb it all comes out
i like the way that

she looks at me like nobody else
like nobodys ever done
she makes me feel like nobody else
like nobodys ever done

by the twentyseventh shes been gone for weeks
im terrified she wont remember me
and i know thats just the way it goes

i stare at her picture stuck up on the fridge
face to face with the one i miss
im alone and reaching for the phone

to tell her weve gone too far to give up now
and like a bomb it all comes out
i like the way that
you might also likeshe looks at me like nobody else
like nobodys ever done
she makes me feel like nobody else
like nobodys ever done

and i wanna make her feel like nobody else
like nobodys ever done
and i wanna make her feel like nobody else
like nobodys ever done
back from the city standing in the rain
asked if shed be going back again
she said no this time im staying home

she looks at me like nobody else
like nobodys ever done
she makes me feel like nobody else
like nobodys ever done

and i wanna make her feel like nobody else
like nobodys ever done
and i wanna make her feel like nobody else
like nobodys ever done

like nobody i
like nobody i
love somebody like
like nobody else
like nobody i
like nobody i
love somebody like
like nobody elseembed"
