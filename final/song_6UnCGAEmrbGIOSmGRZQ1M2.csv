would you believe me now if i told you i got caught up in a wave
almost gave it away
would you hear me out if i told you i was terrified for days
thought i was gonna break

prechorus 1
oh i couldnt stop it
tried to slow it all down
crying in the bathroom
had to figure it out
with everyone around me saying
you must be so happy now

chorus
oh if you keep reaching out
then ill keep coming back
and if youre gone for good
then im okay with that
if you leave the light on
then ill leave the light on light on light on light on
and i am finding out
theres just no other way
that im still dancing at the end of the day
if you leave the light on
then ill leave the light on light on light on light on
