verse 1
disenchanted lullabies
sing me yours ill sing you mine
sing with me now whats a boy to do
whats a boy to do
sing along for yesterday
sing along my soul to take
sing along another song for you
whats a boy to do

chorus
i may be scattered
a little shattered
what does it matter
no one has a fit like i do
i may be scattered
a little shattered
what does it matter
no one has a fit like i do
im the only one that fits you

verse 2
whisper with me pass the time
whisper for the days gone by
whisper with the voice inside of you
with this ring you will be mine
with this ring i multiply
with this ring surrendering to you
whats a boy to do
see foo fighters liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likechorus
i may be scattered
a little shattered
what does it matter
no one has a fit like i do
i may be scattered
a little shattered
what does it matter
no one has a fit like i do
im the only one that fits you

no one has a fit like i do
im the only one that fits you1embed"
