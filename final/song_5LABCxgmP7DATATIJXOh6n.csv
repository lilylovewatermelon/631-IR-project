tell me something tell me something
you dont know nothing just pretend you do
i need something tell me something new
choose your words cause theres no antidote
for this curse oh whats it waiting for
must this hurt you just before you go

chorus
oh tell me something i dont already know
oh tell me something i dont already know

verse 2
brooklyn saw me empty at the news
theres no water inside this swimming pool
almost over had enough from you
and ive been praying i never did before
understand im talking to the walls
ive been praying ever since new york

chorus
oh tell me something i dont already know
oh tell me something i dont already know
oh tell me something i dont already know
oh tell me something i dont already know
