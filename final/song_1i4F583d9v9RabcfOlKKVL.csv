its been a while since we been alone
to turn off the world and the telephone
i need to tell you youre beautiful
cause its been a while and i apologize
i just get caught up in the rat race im runnin
chasin a moment im hoping is comin
if i stopped and took a look around
its in front of my eyes eyes

prechorus
baby lets slow down time
maybe just press rewind
darlin that dress reminds
me of the first time

chorus
and i wanna love tonight
one on one by the candlelight
over and over we spend our lives
livin fast forward but not tonight
love in slow motion

verse 2
its been a while since it was you and me
too many friends too many evening drinks
yeah we commit to so many things
but not to ourselves and i apologize
sometimes youre sad and you tell me its nothin
and i brush it off because theres always somethin
but i need to change my perspective
and prioritiseise

can be restored with your lips
it only takes one kiss
