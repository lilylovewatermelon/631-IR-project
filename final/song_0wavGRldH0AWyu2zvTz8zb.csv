i spy with my little tired eye
tiny as a firefly
a pebble that we picked up last july
down deep inside your pocket
we almost forgot it
does it ever miss wicklow sometimes
ooh ooh

chorus
they said the end is comin
everyone’s up to somethin
i find myself runnin home to your sweet nothings
outside they’re push and shovin
youre in the kitchen hummin
all that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin

verse 2
on the way home
i wrote a poem
you say what a mind
this happens all the time
ooh ooh

chorus
causе they said the end is comin
evеryones up to somethin’
i find myself runnin’ home to your sweet nothings
outside theyre push and shovin’
youre in the kitchen hummin
all that you ever wanted from me was nothin

industry disruptors and soul deconstructors
and smoothtalking hucksters out gladhanding each other
and the voices that implore you should be doing more
to you i can admit that i’m just too soft for all of it
ooh

chorus
they said the end is comin
everyones up to somethin
i find myself runnin home to your sweet nothings
outside theyre push and shovin
youre in the kitchen hummin
all that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin
they said the end is comin they said the end is comin
everyones up to somethin everyones up to somethin
i find myself runnin home to your sweet nothings
outside theyre push and shovin outside theyre push and shovin
youre in the kitchen hummin youre in the kitchen hummin
