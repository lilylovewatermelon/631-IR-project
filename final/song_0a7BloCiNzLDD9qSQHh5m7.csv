she says shes no good
with words but im worse
barely stuttered out a joke of a romantic
stuck to my tongue
weighed down with words too
overdramatic
tonight its it cant get much worse
versus no one should ever feel like

prechorus
im two quarters and a heart down
and i dont want to forget how your voice sounds
these words are all i have so i write them
so you need them just to get by emal si namhort eoj

chorus
dance dance were falling apart to halftime
dance dance and these are the lives you love to lead
dance this is the way theyd love
if they knew how misery loved me

verse 2

before youre found out
drink up its last call last resort
but only the first mistake and i

im two quarters and a heart down
and i dont want to forget how your voice sounds

i only want sympathy in the form of you
crawling into bed with me
