yeah a smalltown girl oughta know better
than to ride through town on a friday night
go haulin round stuff that belongs to another
and leanin on over at a red light
thats right
yeah a smalltown girl oughta grow up knowing
that round here you cant be a liar
one little spark gonna wind up smoking
and gonna spread like a wildfire

chorus
like the roots running through southern ground
word gets out when you get around
if i was you id be on the lookout
cause its a small town
its a small town girl

verse 2
yeah a smalltown boy shoulda learned from his mama
hell has no fury like a woman scorned
theres a big backlash on backroad drama
cause girls like you aint nothing more

chorus
than the roots running through southern ground
word gets out when you get around
if i was you id be on the lookout
cause its a small town
its a small town girl

bridge
theres one walmart one church one bar
i know these roads i know your car
you can run and you can hide
but its just a mile wide
the truth catches up in a small town
oh yes it does

chorus
like the roots running through southern ground
word gets out when you get around
if i was you id be on the lookout
cause its a small town
like a train traveling south bound
word gets out by word of mouth
if i was you id be on the lookout
cause its a small town
its a small town girl
