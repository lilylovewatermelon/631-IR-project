we were stayin in paris
to get away from your parents
and i thought wow
if i could take this in a shot right now
i dont think that we could work this out
out on the terrace
i dont know if its fair but i thought how
could i let you fall by yourself
while im wasted with someone else

chorus andrew taggart
if we go down then we go down together
theyll say you could do anything
theyll say that i was clever
if we go down then we go down together
well get away with everything
lets show them we are better

refrain andrew taggart
lets show them we are better
lets show them we are better

verse 2 andrew taggart
we were stayin in paris
to get away from your parents
you look so proud
standing there with a frown and a cigarette
postin pictures of yourself on the internet
out on the terrace
we breathe in the air of this small town
on our own cuttin class for the thrill of it
gettin drunk on the past we were livin in
