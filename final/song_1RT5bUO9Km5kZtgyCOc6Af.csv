verse 1 violent j  shaggy 2 dope
i like to suffocate people and bite their necks
they got me in a place that aint like the rest
and all you gotta do is try to go for the neck
and its sedatives sedatives like that
slow down color smear all around
weird sounds you in the mind of a clown
and a wicked one somehow spinnin around
wheel me down the hallway arms strapped down
with sedatives hangin all out the neck from the iv
sedatives for the lively
study me ask me no answer
im cuttin your neck first chance sir
white walls white floor small rooms
after sedatives they become ballrooms
crows fly by my window slow
headed that way but lookin at me though

chorus violent j  shaggy 2 dope
sedatives sedatives
lookin at me sedatives sedatives
lookin at me sedatives sedatives
sedatives sedatives
see insane clown posse liveget tickets as low as 205you might also likeverse 2 violent j  shaggy 2 dope
im an accident human malfunction at best
and im lookin at a scalpel diggin into your chest
if i could only move but them sedatives
you know they saving your life them sedatives
some of these other patients are strong as hell
suffocating one creep took me long as hell
but i took his sedatives well i thought they were sedatives
but they were only medatives
i fake pain call em over and play dead
and yank a fistful of hair out the nurse ladys head
high on sedatives again put me in a tiny place
chin strap muzzle over my face
i threw a guy off the roof first day they admitted me
i was sedated and thats when it hit me
the only time im at peace is when i aint even there
god tell me why the fuck am i here

chorus violent j  shaggy 2 dope
sedatives no shock haa
sedatives no shock on haa
sedatives no shock rekcuf rehtom uoy

verse 3 violent j  shaggy 2 dope
i want a lobotomy no shock therapy
come clean me nurse take care of me
i suffocated the last two they sent in alone
they had to stick me in the chest with a shot of methadone
recreation time wheel me to the courtyard
four guards in white and they might be important
and the sky is blue and i can watch trees grow
watch leaves flow enjoy the sedative show
well i even have my very own room these days
white straight jacket padded walls and pjs
but theres so many ways and every stunt i pull
i even slammed my own mouth down on the toilet bowl
for attention maybe not to mention a sedative
heard one guy say why even let it live
theres probably no sedatives in hell
and thats the only reason im alive still
the witch is everywhere and i can see that yall
stabbed one nurse in the neck with a straw
a plastic straw yeah its flimsy and weak
but if you cork it with your thumb and hold it right freeeek
outro shaggy 2 dope
