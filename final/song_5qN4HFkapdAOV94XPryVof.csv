why i go easy
know why i go easy
wait

verse 1
king of my city king of my country king of my homeland
king of the filthy king of the fallen we livin again
king of the shooters looters boosters and ghettos poppin
king of the past present future my ancestors watchin
king of the culture king of the soldiers king of the bloodshed
king of the wisdom king of the ocean king of the respect
king of the optimistics and dreamers that go and get it
king of the winners district and geniuses with conviction

bridge
king of the fighters king of the fathers king of the belated
king of the answer king of the problem king of the forsaken
king of the empathy your resentment king of remorse
king of my enemies may they fall defeat i rejoice
king of the skyscrapers dodgin haters broke religion
nine faces go against em i erased em with precision
i embrace them with collision kings did it
kings vision black panther king kendrick all hail the king

verse 2
i dropped a million tears
i know several responsibilities put me here
i dont pedal backwards but i live oldfashioned
the lens that im lookin through
wont prescribe me the right glasses masses are now free
ashes im dumpin out bout to spread all cross seas
sisters and brothers in unison not because of me
because we dont glue with the opposition we glue with peace
but stilld fuck up your organization if any beef
see kendrick lamar liveget tickets as low as 246you might also likeoutro
what do you stand for
are you a activist what are your city plans for
are you a accident are you just in the way
your native tongue contradictin what your body language say
are you a king or you jokin are you a king or you posin
are you a king or you smokin bowl rocks to keep you open
because the king dont cry king dont die
king dont lie king give all king get by king dont fall
kingdom come when i come you know why
king king king king king
i am tchalla44embed"
