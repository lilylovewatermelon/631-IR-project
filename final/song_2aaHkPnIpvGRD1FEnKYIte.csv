goodbye to my santa monica dream
fifteen kids in the backyard drinking wine
you tell me stories of the sea
and the ones you left behind
goodbye to the roses on your street
goodbye to the paintings on the wall
goodbye to the children well never meet
and the ones we left behind
and the ones we left behind

chorus angus  julia stone
im somewhere youre somewhere
im nowhere youre nowhere
youre somewhere youre somewhere
i could go there but i dont

verse 2 julia angus  julia
robs in the kitchen making pizza
somewhere down in battery park
im singing songs about the future
wondering where you are
