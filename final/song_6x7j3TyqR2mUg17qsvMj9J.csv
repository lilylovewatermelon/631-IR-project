i was raised on beans and rice
and if you shot up my crib i wouldnt be surprised
mama used to trip cuz i fed the mice
im the one they sent home cuz my head had lice
im the kid that lost my sanity
im the kid that had the toys with no batteries
mama sat me down for some serious talks
on how to keep the rats out the cereal box

spm
i feel you homie nigga i lived that shit nigga i felt that shit
we never felt so rich those were the good ass days bro
sure we was broke but we was bb guns havin hella fun on natural dope
when you started to smoke thats when you changed
the weed hit the brain and the man thought he came
it was joint after joint after joint after joint
in one month your fuckin brain was destroyed
now you got children and a beautiful wife
the kinda money that you make nigga you set for life
enjoy your self man you only live once
take your family vacation and relax for a month

los
imma smoke till i croak nigga fuck bein broke nigga
i need seven bedrooms and my boat nigga
watchin rats with eighty seven new gats
the penitantarys the only place when i can relax
i want some hoes in they heads they pushin me to the edge
the only thing imma miss is my beautiful kids
im just sippin patron i handle shit on my own
i got a camera
for every fuckin inch of my home
its in my blood to be a drunk and not give a fuck
i do a driveby in my grandmas truck
a g since daddy left me at the age of three
now every south side crackhead pagin me

chill homie cut dad some slack
sure he left our ass but that was way the fuck back
you all cot up hearin blastin on dub
we was only seven when our house got shot up
mom was all bloody i saw that shit
it was just blast from the mirror its alright kid
you blessed by god man you cant give up
and run around town not givin a fuck
yeah of course they jealous and pullin ho shit
its hard to be that mexican that came up so quick
you made it look easy but its just an illusion
you did the impossible and took over houston

losin thousands and thousands on a half ass crew
talkin down on you but you got nothing to prove
let em run they mouth all the fuck they want to

los
