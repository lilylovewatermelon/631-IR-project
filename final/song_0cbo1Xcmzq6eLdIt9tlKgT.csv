ima start with telling king of the dot hes not welcomed
cause when it come to putting on for oakland he aint helping
i been here since july every place i stepped inside
i asked about pass and he is not recognized
first off i got a question why you even battle rap
you travel a hundred miles round alcatraz you might you might
find two niggas that give a fuck about battle rap
most of these bay area niggas got their happyass cali swag relax and back
cause marijuana damn near legal
so they got a bag of grass of the best weed youve ever seen
add to that the weather been in 70 degree average
and most of the bitches ass spanish
so its nothin to get you some little red bone hoe with an ass thats fat
you cant be mad at that
but you from one of them good neighborhoods
where the convenience stores only sell organic snacks
any savage act in your character not indigenous to your habitat
save the raps like you some gangster cat you aint made for that
the place you say you bang and scrap the place i vacation at
i take you through that real oakland where weapon gripping is recommended
niggas say hella and blood twice in every sentence
fuck a pass or passwurdz ill pass you to the pastor
then pastures grass dirt in a flash turning bad worse
you thought i was boxing to share how the jab work
no two arms body this square just like a plaid shirt
i put you somewhere they cant search
think you a standup nigga
ill sit you down so fast itll make your ass hurt
fuck a pass the way i let you review my history
its two timberlands to the head reboot your memory
a shot to the nogging will rock your consciousness
as quick as a album  thats common senses
back bad if your posture missing posthumous
how you want it lots of stitches or doctor visits
so they could find you in a bay by a dock of fishes
fuck if we in your pot is pissing or not you tripping and get you dropped
but witness he dont do shit cause dude sterilize still realize whats not for kidding
see the entendre in it dude sterilized dude still realized
i son him like a father but treat him worse than some foster children
you aint got no kind of lyrics
you gon say some moderate hitting line and say papa
cause you say potna in it
fresh coast you rep wrong as crooked politicians
lots of gimmicks but when it come to this community you nonexistent
my kind is business so it make my grind crucial
i take the time to make the lines that they rewind on youtube
so i hate to find these lazy writers makin rhymes how you do
but since you the passpast im truly glad they dont make them like they used to
you might also likeround 1 pass
remyd please forgive me g
but i gotta use this line that i said against uh
one of these other wack niggas
but this applies to you as well so ill recycle that damn scripture
bruh bruh the only fucking reason any human being
should be nicknamed after a brand of liquor
is if youre a hood rat turf derp bitch or a goddamned stripper
now remy think he can come to the town and catch this win right
thats funny cause no you fucking not
now i know you buy off that humble rock
cause i already killed a belvedere its remys turn so thats a double shot
now give me some space before we make everyone in this vicinity shake
my niggas clap give them that men in black its memory finna erase
my memory and my energy great
so tell me why half the niggas in this wackass battle rap industry fake
no tell me why half the niggas from st louis got feminine traits
let him do some slick shit and try to dip
yall finna see remy get chased
but im sick in the head
my only remedy is hennessy straight
but its 420 i dare this square to step in my session
ima approach him like whats up nigga
know somebody here speak up nigga
oh you want a smoke
oh cool fuck nigga do i look like i give a fuck nigga
we in oakland home the i got five on it so what nigga
you a fucking punk nigga
we gon make you throw fifty on it to catch a contact
you cant even touch a fucking blunt nigga
and i keep hash in my weed stash but you keep trash
you know he bout to roll up some wheat grass
my folks already gave me cash saying please keep the peace pass
so you know he gon call the police fast if you run up and beat his weak ass
lushll be yelling free pass before i give you a free pass
now this battle already done pissed me off but im about to push through
you wanna get funny i show you how you should do it
you look like kid cudi but without the good music
you got a weirdlooking ass face always got some bags on your eyes
and you got a longass face like you sad all the time
now i said fuck that its nothing see this rap shit easy
but to my trapping niggas trapping easy
theyll clap you easy for acting greasy
have his beanie leaning to the side of his head like adebisi
easy nigga round 1
round 2 remyd
this nigga said i look like kid cudi i know he dont want nothing
cause he look like a low budget joe budden
that rapping vulgar gon get you turned to a snack for vultures
that results in you planted lower than agriculture
i have the focus and composure of a captain soldier
fit to wear you out if we take this outdoors that patagonia
thats just the jab i threw i grab the toaster strapped from holster
you better have a chauffeur smash the gas on the fastest motor
nonstop shots when im blasting fo ya
you wont finish the fire until its like you mixed with hawaiian my nigga half samoan
retire you light you up sammy sosa
have you twisted up stretched out same time like you practice yoga
pass gas bad aromas nasty odors
that man trash like bags of broke stuff on an alley sofa
you aint active at your home that much i know because i asked
i roamed the aves and the corners of international role plus i traveled the zones to san alejandro
and drove back on a path to go to straight to san jose
to a santa clara camp and supposed a question
does pass or passwurdz have any fans near oakland
and i had no luck
plex rock actually get more love
mad cats say that they know lush
but pass past dont so much as fam has my condolence
you dont put in work you pudding perfect for tapioca
bitch made my switchbladell steal your heart casanova
the switchblades still as sharp as a dagger so it cant get grosser
if im walkin around lookin for larynx donors
thats the throat pass you know what
lush gave me to test the culture
you a average flower who cant match up close to my status quota
your type style is the dwight howard looking nehhh for california
look at me and see the wiz whiz kid without amber roses carriage stroller
cancel your plans and hopes to blow up after going at opponents
of my class that have voted to bypass pass
or for folk who know him as alex be mad they havent told ya
outcome is you flat as posters
how come its cause that im supposed to
if i got the hood watching me squeeze the life out you
its like im half a boa and a cobra
but if remyd destroy with the leroy match and glow
what that is sho nuff
round 2 pass
i love when niggas say shit like pass is alright but hes overrated
see them sort of things just lets me know im approaching greatness
if i wasnt kicking the coldest game and going ape shit wouldnt no one say shit
and you know them same folks that make them bogus statements is mostly vacant
basic vultures craving a hold of place
and the place them hoes afraid to show they face in
no mistake so i came here with a new definition
so this should probably help
cause when they say youre overrated
what they really mean is that youre rated over everybody else
and fuck all that shit let me get on this niggas helmet quick
so lush dont tell me shit like you know
hes tryna get his name out there
and a buzz for himself and shit
then you should help him shit shit youre welcome bitch
you got nothin but wackass battles and all a sudden
now you wanna fuck around
you just another up and comer comin up so i can shut him down
you rep innuendo so thats a battle rap crew
you know how weird and corny that shit sound
is that how i niggas get down
you got folks from canada california new york uh midwest
and you gon tell me all of your folks been down
bro thats not a gang yall some motherfucking pen pals
and every time you niggas battle somebody its like yeah im innuendo at your front door or im in your window
but if you say that to another man thats a gay innuendo
so fuck your innuendo
you think thats the beginning but this is the end you in though
i offend you and your kid what i wrote with this pen and pencil and hit your mental
its not a game when the things is running up in your temple
you get beat no instrumental
im 25 been top 4 since 01 ekay i been official
get it 401k beneficial
see we mobb deep you a quiet storm
fuck that you white catholic choir calm
so kick back like a firearm and get fired on
your turf hop from the midwest to the big west
now its a fresh coast style that you riding on
its why youre the fence you cant decide which side you on
no i said thats why its wire on defense
you cant decide which side you on
see this is allaround sickness ima let the crowd witness
young proud gifted you a thumb down tripping
your slogan is team business bitch this town business

round 3 remyd
now in that first round i outlined him i gave outlines that outline
how im bout mine and everything he shout lies
second round i outrhymed him
stylewise i lyrically outclimbed him how high
hm cloud sky mileswide
third round i can skate out fine
he way outshined but it wouldnt be remyd if i aint give yall that breakdown time
so you just be the passenger kay ill drive
this taxi confessions
and as we travel this direction ima ask you some questions
like pass where ya headed
i dont mean the place on the map where you destined
im trying to see if your dumbass could locate where your actual head is
cause as of latest like your brain been off track for a second
you was passwurdz at first
then you asked them adjust it to just call you pass word
you went malcolm and xd it
well if past serves me correct and you in a battling session
as the nigga who no longer has wurdz you dont have any weapons
is your plan to beat me down by having me beat down a man thats just helpless
or do we call you pass cause you pass on a matches selected
you been in the ring since the 05 calendar edit
with only 12 battles captured on record that is pathetic
especially since lush one is your family brethren
you actually connected to the top promoter in the battling profession
but you slack halfstepping his story is how past isnt present misguided passed in deception but lets put pass in perspective
you from oakland the land of black panters protected
i expected you to captured that message passed
on the essence
but after reflecting on your lack of progression
and the name that you requested
i have the impression pass is your preference cause you passiveaggressive
cant be respected doesnt examine well
so hes not passing in testin intestine like bad indigestion
see thats where were separate which i gotta see
this here aint conscious versus comedy its a promise versus a probably
see you the type of nigga thatll sit back and wait on that day to come
i saw my city aint have a buzz so me and some niggas created one
shoutout to aye verb holla and iii for the url achievements they got
but im the only nigga from st louis on king of the dot

round 3 pass
remy said pass youre like one of the only niggas that i respect in this shit
well shit i guess its just cause i keep it solid dont do hella extra and shit
a young black intelligent specimen bringing back intellect when he spit
a professional with professional wit
now who here you finna convince that you better than this
look down on the ground check on your kicks
nigga you done stepped in some shit
now i dont know why you would consider this is a winning option
but you wanted to get it popping so fuck it lets get it popping
trust me you can get demolished
while your friends and your bitches watching
you aint famous but a pound in front of you will make your name a trending topic
you wanna build a buzz from the ground up i cinderblock it
after your funds like capital one whats in your wallet
im in the deep east slapping oldschool keek the sneak
my niggas mobbing being punished trigger finger itching to chicka bloc him
i gotta watch him cause this cats from the projects
do what they got to do to stack up them profits
well my niggas is actual prophets
you just a bitch talking with no facts to back up your logic
you act like you got it but i cant tell if you actually got it
dont tell me you trappin quit yapping nigga you trapped in a closet
who on the fucking block would be shook of you
nigga look at you
this is what happens when faggotass yung iii is the nigga that you look up to
fuck your st louis cardinal ill expose your whole cardinal
in the city you from you on the bottom of the heirarchy dawg
but if i knock the bottom piece out the structure the whole st louis archll fall
this feels weird its supposed to be like im face to face with the enemy
but lately you been trying to recreate my energy
its like youre tryna make it seem like youre the same as me
its plain to see you probably even say youre symmetry
so i take this remedy break the entity down into different compounds
thats basic chemistry
aint no way you killing me
this hate you giving me is a waste of energy
like the way you came from st louis
so a nigga from oakland can put you back into a state of miserymissouri
aint no pistols bursting i can be the bigger person
but if ill pull that blade on him
then its really curtains
and butterflies on his stomach like hes feeling nervous
i know you moved out here so dont trip
i dont need to let that chrome click to make his dome split
i have some dirty niggas stomp you out in air force ones
if you feeling homesickembed"
