you gotta let go when they get that old
you gotta let go
cause if you hold on theyll puncture your lungs
and separate your spine from your skull
you gotta let em go

verse 2
you gotta let go when they get that old
you gotta let go
cause if you hold on theyll bite your fingers off
and tear you limb from limb
its second nature to them

verse 3
you gotta let go when they get that old
you gotta let go
cause if you hold on theyll tear your stomach open
and rip your guts out with they teeth
you gotta just release
