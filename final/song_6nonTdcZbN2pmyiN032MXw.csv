yeah im back did anyone miss me
they said the second record can be tricky
well thats kind of funny cause i am not trippin
my fansâ€”they know what it is and they with me
yeah i aint the type thats gon ride with the semi
i came from a town with three lights and no city
ive been doing shows for nothin but pennies
when i leave the stage they never forget me
mansion was a glimpse of my life
i let you see what its like to be in my head
people ask me what i think i think id be doin
if it wasnt music id rather be dead agh
you heard what i said that was like me at a three
you dont wanna see me at ten
or maybe you do
i promise if that is the case then that is what yall gonna get
if youre looking for music with watered down lyrics
i promise that you need to go somewhere else
and if you want somebody to tell you everything
that you wanna hear i wont be any help
this flow is familiar i think i heard it before
yeah i made it myself
i left the door open to come in my mansion
but i never said its a beautiful house
some of yall sat on the porch
looked at my windows and stared at my door
they ask me if im gonna kill it this record
i laugh in their face and i ask em do you see the blood on the floors
hes at it again
nf is crazy hes bad for the kids
he never talks about nothing but him
and my friends say hes kind of a diva
well you need to get some new friends
im as chill as it gets
til i get on the stage and flip on the switch
and i go to a place where nobody is
if you bring up my name in a song thats something that you will regret
learned a lot in a year
i remember the shows when no one was there
i remember the shows when nobody cared
some people in front of me laughing like he isnt going nowhere
its funny now isnt it
this type of life isnt how i envisioned it
this type of life it just aint how i pictured it
im in the back of the tour bus
tryin to facetime my family its different
not what you think it is
write a review tell me what you think of this
give me three stars and call me an idiot
but to be honest it dont make a difference
i know some people dont get it
but you have now entered a therapy session
if you dont like music thats personal
i have no clue what you people are doin here might as well throw out the record
i pull up a chair i talk to my music like nobodys there
only person i judge is the one in the mirror
and lately he aint doin well
i dont need yall in my ear
im tired of hearin it
you call it music i call her my therapist
she keep on telling me i have been carryin
way too much baggage i need to take care of it
i know shes right but man its embarrassing
music has raised me more than my parent did
take out a picture of us and i stare at it
who am i kiddin you probably aint hearin this
show me an artist you wanna compare me with
you put us both on a track ima bury em
give me the shovel its bout to get scarier
none of you want it with rap who you staring at
i see you got beats but where is the lyrics at
nf is the logo you know ive been wearin that
dont come to my show and be sittin that very back
i call you out in the crowd like there he is
thought id be happy it feels like im cursed
its hard to be clean when you play in the dirt
you gave me this place to go when im hurtin
i thought itd get better but its getting worse
and i got nobody to blame when i work
like 247 i aint been to church
and satan keep callin me he tryna flirt
i hang up the phone these are more than just words
i drive on that highway and listen to mansion
i look up to god like when did this happen
yellin with all of my fans to wake up
but feel like i havent
i get emotional i didnt plan this
im doing things i never imagined
im sorry but i gotta leave
i dont wanna be late for my therapy session aghsee nf liveget tickets as low as 65you might also like57embed"
