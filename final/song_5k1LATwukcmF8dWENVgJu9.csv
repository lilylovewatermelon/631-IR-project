something is about to give
i can feel it coming
i think i know what it is
im not afraid to die
im not afraid to live
and when im flat on my back
i hope to feel like i did
and hardness it sets in
you need some protection
the thinner the skin

bridge
i want you to know
that you dont need me anymore
i want you to know
you dont need anyone anything at all

chorus
whos to say where the wind will take you
whos to say what it is will break you
i dont know which way the wind will blow
whos to know when the time has come around
dont wanna see you cry
i know that this is not goodbye

in summer i can taste the salt in the sea
theres a kite blowing out of control on a breeze
i wonder whats gonna happen to you
you wonder what has happened to me

prechorus
im a man
im not a child
a man who sees
the shadow behind your eyes

chorus
whos to say where the wind will take you
whos to say what it is will break you
i dont know where the wind will blow
whos to know when the time has come around
i dont wanna see you cry
i know that this is not goodbye

verse 3
did i waste it
not so much i couldnt taste it
life should be fragrant
roof top to the basement
the last of the rock stars
when hip hop drove the big cars
in the time when new media
was the big idea
that was the big idea1embed"
