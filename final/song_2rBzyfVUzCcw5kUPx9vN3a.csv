verse 1
im paranoid im sick im not myself
i bottled up and drank the pain but it wouldnt stay down
now ive got nothing to give nothing to say for myself
im nothing more than worm food six feet under the ground fuck

verse 2
i dont believe in salvation but i believe in demons
and ill let you meet mine if you really wanna see them
once you go mad and slip through the cracks
the path is too dark to see the tracks
i was consumed by the dark consumed by the black
i made a deal with the devil i cant take back

its eating away at me this disgusting disease
im fucking sick my stomachs starting to bleed
its eating away at me i dont know what to do
im fucking sick ill never be like you

bridge
whats the point whats the fucking point in any of this
if when we make it to the grave everyone just forgets
whats the point whats the fucking point in any of this
if when we make it to the grave no one gives a shit

prechorus
