until our veins run dry
now we have to take this thorn
and tear it from our side
agitated at the fault line
still agreed to disagree
youre connected to the heart
but tonight well set you free

so swallow the knife
carve the way for your pride
now our hands are tied
the problems lie within
so we pray for night
to start over again

even now as i write this down
all pretensions disappear
now our impulses will bite
at the ankles of our fear

so swallow the knife
carve the way for your pride
now our hands are tied
the problems lie within
so we pray for night
to start over again
now our hands are tied
the problems lie within
so we pray for night
to start over again
you might also likewords are spoken
words are broken down
so lets make this night be our best mistake
so lets take the time to wipe the blood away

now our hands are tied
and our world is caving in
now our hands are tied
the problems lie within
so we pray for night
to start over again
now our hands are tied
and the problems lie within

words are spoken
words are broken
broken downembed"
