chorus
its all up to me its all up to me hey
first time touchin’ a mil life never felt so real real
they tryna be my twizzy you already know aint no deal whole lotta cash
you sipping on lil stretched wock bitch im just cracking the seal
gotta pay for a good ass lawyer we ain’t sittin in no cell
i was just out in la jolla i was just shipping some bails
diamonds on big boy water got these bitches straight out the well
ive tried replacing the x with the percs but bitch you dont know how that feel

verse
i just try keeping it real but im always gon keep it a hundred
my bitch did a brand new favor she just bе drinking my nut
i always gotta dodge all the hate i gotta dodgе the assumptions
how you gon turn to a snitch yeah how you talk shit but you runnin
i used to be eating noodleoodles sittin in the basement with the roaches in it
they used to not fuck with the kid now im going up everybody in my business
said you cant trust me lil bitch im a snake go behind your back and stab it
you know its not shit to go pull out the wraith bring it out in automatic
i od on the pills so much i hired a fulltime medic
pull up on my bitch and she eat me like lunch said i got rid of her headache
