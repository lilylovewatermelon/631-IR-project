i didnt think id ever want this yet
when we had first met in fall
guess its something you learn to accept
when ive been a mess its not your fault

prechorus
but i keep forgetting its what we do

chorus
i missed the train again
i called your name
as if youd drive it back
i swear youre in my head
throughout the day
i can say that for a fact
know we had better days
but to keep me sane
i guess that this is just another love song about you
just another love song about you

postchorus

im running over sentences at times
id better quit dreaming just so i could write
yet the words to describe you
arent so hard to find
like a good quote from a book that ive memorized

prechorus
but i keep forgetting just what to do

chorus
i missed the train again
i called your name
as if youd drive it back
i swear youre in my head
throughout the day
i can say that for a fact
know we had better days
but to keep me sane
i guess that this is just another love song about you
just another love song about you
