hes a phone call to his parents
hes a bible by the bed
hes the tshirt that im wearing
hes the song stuck in my head
hes solid and hes steady
like the allegheny runs
he knows just where hes going
and hes proud of where hes from

prechorus
one of the good ones
hes one of the good ones

chorus
a love me like he should one
like he wrote the book one
the kind you find when you dont even look one
anybody can be good once
but hes good all the time
hes one of the good ones
and hes all mine
hes one of the good ones

verse 2
youll know him when you see him
by the way he looks at me
youd say he hung the moon
id say he hung the galaxy
nobody does it better
oh the way he pulls me in
ive known a couple bad ones
but they all led me to him

chorus
a love me like he should one
like he wrote the book one

and hes all mine
