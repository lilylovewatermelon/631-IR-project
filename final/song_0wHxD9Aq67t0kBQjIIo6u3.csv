we fight every day and night
you want me to make the time
you always get mad and say what you coulda had
and that you want me to make it right uh
i couldnt do that to save my life
you always tell me you aint surprised
you said its the last time i guess that you were right
cause im not the one with you tonight

chorus
and now im so sick of these love songs so sad and slow
and im so sick of wishin i had you on my own
and oh baby ive been fucked up ever since youve been gone
i cant bring myself to even pick up my phone
i need you the most i need you the most
i need you the most i need you the most i need you the most

verse 2
i aint gon lie oh baby ive been fucked up
i said i was sorry for all of the times i fucked up
