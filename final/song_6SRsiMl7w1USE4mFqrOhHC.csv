i want it to be like messy

verse 1
im so insecure i think
that ill die before i drink
and im so caught up in the news
of who likes me and who hates you
and im so tired that i might
quit my job start a new life
and theyd all be so disappointed
cause who am i if not exploited
and im so sick of seventeen
wheres my fucking teenage dream
if someone tells me one more time
enjoy your youth im gonna cry
and i dont stick up for myself
im anxious and nothing can help
and i wish id done this before
and i wish people liked me more

chorus
all i did was try my best
this the kinda thanks i get
unrelentlessly upset ahahah
they say these are the golden years
but i wish i could disappear
ego crush is so severe
god its brutal out here

verse 2
i feel like no one wants me
and i hate the way im perceived
i only have two real friends
and lately im a nervous wreck
cause i love people i dont like
and i hate every song i write
and im not cool and im not smart
and i cant even parallel park

chorus
all i did was try my best
this the kinda thanks i get
unrelentlessly upset ahahah
they say these are the golden years
but i wish i could disappear
ego crush is so severe
god its brutal out here
