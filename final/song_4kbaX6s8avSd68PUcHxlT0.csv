better find a pretty woman before the sun goes down
if you need a place to lay your head
find a pretty little woman in a pretty big bed

you make like a fool you stumble around
better find you a woman before you buy another round
in like a lamb and out like a lion
one minute your laughin the next youre cryin

chorus
its hard to tell hard to tell
you gotta get a woman its hard to tell
cant be sure cant be sure
is she gonna be your pretty little girl
your pretty little girl

better cut your hair comb that mop
shine them shoes wear tails and top
trim that stache dont be slow
you gonna need it where you got to go

hit that trail ride that roan
and buck that limb when you get her back home
buckle up boys dont think twice
and love that woman with all your might

its hard to tell hard to tell
you gotta get a woman its hard to tell
cant be sure cant be sure
is she gonna be your pretty little girl
your pretty little girl

now she dont call and she dont write
youre home with your mother every saturday night
you see her on the town she dont see you
you oughta quit courtin and take up booze

you gotta make it look like a big fortune
got callico shorts and alligator shoes
there aint no woman gonna waste her time
waiting for a poor boy to drag her down

chorus
its hard to tell hard to tell
you gotta get a woman its hard to tell
cant be sure cant be sure
is she gonna be your pretty little girl
your pretty little girlembed"
