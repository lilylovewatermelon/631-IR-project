567 hamdan filed petitions for writs of habeas corpus and mandamus to challenge the executive branchs intended means of prosecuting this charge he concedes that a courtmartial constituted in accordance with the uniform code of military justice ucmj 10 u s c § 801 et seq 2000 ed and supp iii would have authority to try him his objection is that the military commission the president has convened lacks such authority for two principal reasons first neither congressional act nor the common law of war supports trial by this commission for the crime of conspiracy— an offense that hamdan says is not a violation of the law of war second hamdan contends the procedures that the president has adopted to try him violate the most basic tenets of military and international law including the principle that a defendant must be permitted to see and hear the evidence against him

the district court granted hamdans request for a writ of habeas corpus 344 f supp 2d 152 dc 2004 the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit reversed 415 f 3d 33 2005 recognizing as we did over a half century ago that trial by military commission is an extraordinary measure raising important questions about the balance of powers in our constitutional structure ex parte quirin 317 u s 1 19 1942 we granted certiorari 546 u s 1002 2005

for the reasons that follow we conclude that the military commission convened to try hamdan lacks power to proceed because its structure and procedures violate both the ucmj and the geneva conventions four of us also conclude see part v infra that the offense with which hamdan has been charged is not an offense that by    the law of war may be tried by military commissions 10 u s c § 821ion september 11 2001 agents of the al qaeda terrorist organization hijacked commercial airplanes and attacked the 568 world trade center in new york city and the national headquarters of the department of defense in arlington virginia americans will never forget the devastation wrought by these acts nearly 3000 civilians were killed

congress responded by adopting a joint resolution authorizing the president to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations organizations or persons he determines planned authorized committed or aided the terrorist attacks    in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the united states by such nations organizations or persons authorization for use of military force aumf 115 stat 224 note following 50 u s c § 1541 2000 ed supp iii acting pursuant to the aumf and having determined that the taliban regime had supported al qaeda the president ordered the armed forces of the united states to invade afghanistan in the ensuing hostilities hundreds of individuals hamdan among them were captured and eventually detained at guantanamo bay

on november 13 2001 while the united states was still engaged in active combat with the taliban the president issued a comprehensive military order intended to govern the detention treatment and trial of certain noncitizens in the war against terrorism 66 fed reg 57833 hereinafter november 13 order or order those subject to the november 13 order include any noncitizen for whom the president determines there is reason to believe that he or she 1 is or was a member of al qaeda or 2 has engaged or participated in terrorist activities aimed at or harmful to the united states id at 57834 any such individual shall when tried be tried by military commission for any and all offenses triable by military commission that such individual is alleged to have committed and may be punished in accordance with the penalties provided under applicable law including life imprisonment or death ibid the november 569 13 order vested in the secretary of defense the power to appoint military commissions to try individuals subject to the order but that power has since been delegated to john d altenburg jr a retired army major general and longtime military lawyer who has been designated appointing authority for military commissions

on july 3 2003 the president announced his determination that hamdan and five other detainees at guantanamo bay were subject to the november 13 order and thus triable by military commission in december 2003 military counsel was appointed to represent hamdan two months later counsel filed demands for charges and for a speedy trial pursuant to article 10 of the ucmj 10 u s c § 810 on february 23 2004 the legal adviser to the appointing authority denied the applications ruling that hamdan was not entitled to any of the protections of the ucmj not until july 13 2004 after hamdan had commenced this action in the united states district court for the western district of washington did the government finally charge him with the offense for which a year earlier he had been deemed eligible for trial by military commission

the charging document which is unsigned contains 13 numbered paragraphs the first two paragraphs recite the asserted bases for the military commissions jurisdiction— namely the november 13 order and the presidents july 3 2003 declaration that hamdan is eligible for trial by military commission the next nine paragraphs collectively entitled general allegations describe al qaedas activities from its inception in 1989 through 2001 and identify usama bin laden as the groups leader hamdan is not mentioned in these paragraphs

only the final two paragraphs entitled charge conspiracy contain allegations against hamdan paragraph 12 charges that from on or about february 1996 to on or about november 24 2001 hamdan willfully and knowingly 570 joined an enterprise of persons who shared a common criminal purpose and conspired and agreed with named members of al qaeda to commit the following offenses triable by military commission attacking civilians attacking civilian objects murder by an unprivileged belligerent and terrorism app to pet for cert 65a there is no allegation that hamdan had any command responsibilities played a leadership role or participated in the planning of any activity

paragraph 13 lists four overt acts that hamdan is alleged to have committed sometime between 1996 and november 2001 in furtherance of the enterprise and conspiracy 1 he acted as usama bin ladens bodyguard and personal driver believing all the while that bin laden and his associates were involved in terrorist acts prior to and including the attacks of september 11 2001 2 he arranged for transportation of and actually transported weapons used by al qaeda members and by bin ladens bodyguards hamdan among them 3 he drove or accompanied usama bin laden to various al qaidasponsored training camps press conferences or lectures at which bin laden encouraged attacks against americans and 4 he received weapons training at al qaedasponsored camps id at 65a67a

after this formal charge was filed the united states district court for the western district of washington transferred hamdans habeas and mandamus petitions to the united states district court for the district of columbia meanwhile a combatant status review tribunal csrt convened pursuant to a military order issued on july 7 2004 decided that hamdans continued detention at guantanamo bay was warranted because he was an enemy combatant1 571 separately proceedings before the military commission commenced

on november 8 2004 however the district court granted hamdans petition for habeas corpus and stayed the commissions proceedings it concluded that the presidents authority to establish military commissions extends only to offenders or offenses triable by military commission under the law of war 344 f supp 2d at 158 that the law of war includes the geneva convention iii relative to the treatment of prisoners of war aug 12 1949 1955 6 u s t 3316 t i a s no 3364 third geneva convention that hamdan is entitled to the full protections of the third geneva convention until adjudged in compliance with that treaty not to be a prisoner of war and that whether or not hamdan is properly classified as a prisoner of war the military commission convened to try him was established in violation of both the ucmj and common article 3 of the third geneva convention because it had the power to convict based on evidence the accused would never see or hear 344 f supp 2d at 158172

the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit reversed like the district court the court of appeals declined the governments invitation to abstain from considering hamdans challenge cf schlesinger v councilman 420 u s 738 1975 on the merits the panel rejected the district courts further conclusion that hamdan was entitled to relief under the third geneva convention all three judges agreed that the geneva conventions were not judicially enforceable 415 f 3d at 38 and two thought that the conventions did not in any event apply to hamdan id at 4042 but see id at 44 williams j concurring in other portions of its opinion the court concluded that our decision in quirin foreclosed any separationofpowers objection to 572 the military commissions jurisdiction and held that hamdans trial before the contemplated commission would violate neither the ucmj nor u s armed forces regulations intended to implement the geneva conventions 415 f 3d at 38 4243
on november 7 2005 we granted certiorari to decide whether the military commission convened to try hamdan has authority to do so and whether hamdan may rely on the geneva conventions in these proceedingsiion february 13 2006 the government filed a motion to dismiss the writ of certiorari the ground cited for dismissal was the recently enacted detainee treatment act of 2005 dta pub l 109148 119 stat 2739 we postponed our ruling on that motion pending argument on the merits 546 u s 1166 2006 and now deny it

the dta which was signed into law on december 30 2005 addresses a broad swath of subjects related to detainees it places restrictions on the treatment and interrogation of detainees in u s custody and it furnishes procedural protections for u s personnel accused of engaging in improper interrogation dta §§ 10021004 119 stat 27392740 it also sets forth certain procedures for status review of detainees outside the united states § 1005 id at 2740 subsections a through d of § 1005 direct the secretary of defense to report to congress the procedures being used by csrts to determine the proper classification of detainees held in guantanamo bay iraq and afghanistan and to adopt certain safeguards as part of those procedures

subsection e of § 1005 which is entitled judicial review of detention of enemy combatants supplies the basis for the governments jurisdictional argument the subsection contains three numbered paragraphs the first paragraph amends the judicial code as follows

5731 in general—section 2241 of title 28 united states code is amended by adding at the end the following
e except as provided in section 1005 of the detainee treatment act of 2005 no court justice or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider—
1 an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the department of defense at guantanamo bay cuba or
2 any other action against the united states or its agents relating to any aspect of the detention by the department of defense of an alien at guantanamo bay cuba who—
a is currently in military custody or
b has been determined by the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit in accordance with the procedures set forth in section 1005e of the detainee treatment act of 2005 to have been properly detained as an enemy combatant § 1005e id at 27412742paragraph 2 of subsection e vests in the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit the exclusive jurisdiction to determine the validity of any final decision of a csrt that an alien is properly detained as an enemy combatant
paragraph 2 also delimits the scope of that review see §§ 1005e2ciii id at 2742

paragraph 3 mirrors paragraph 2 in structure but governs judicial review of final decisions of military commissions not csrts it vests in the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit exclusive jurisdiction to determine the validity of any final decision rendered pursuant to military commission order no 1 dated august 31 2005 or any successor military order § 1005e3a id at 27432 574 review is as of right for any alien sentenced to death or a term of imprisonment of 10 years or more but is at the court of appeals discretion in all other cases the scope of review is limited to the following inquiriesi whether the final decision of the military commission was consistent with the standards and procedures specified in the military order referred to in subparagraph a and
ii to the extent the constitution and laws of the united states are applicable whether the use of such standards and procedures to reach the final decision is consistent with the constitution and laws of the united states § 1005e3d ibidfinally § 1005 contains an effective date provision which reads as follows1 in general—this section shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this act
2 review of combatant status tribunal and military commission decisions—paragraphs 2 and 3 of subsection e shall apply with respect to any claim whose review is governed by one of such paragraphs and that is pending on or after the date of the enactment of this act § 1005h id at 274327443the dta is silent about whether paragraph 1 of subsection e shall apply to claims pending on the date of enactment

the government argues that §§ 1005e1 and 1005h had the immediate effect upon enactment of repealing federal jurisdiction not just over detainee habeas actions yet to be filed but also over any such actions then pending in any federal court—including this court accordingly it argues we 575 lack jurisdiction to review the court of appeals decision below

hamdan objects to this theory on both constitutional and statutory grounds principal among his constitutional arguments is that the governments preferred reading raises grave questions about congress authority to impinge upon this courts appellate jurisdiction particularly in habeas cases support for this argument is drawn from ex parte yerger 8 wall 85 1869 in which having explained that the denial to this court of appellate jurisdiction to consider an original writ of habeas corpus would greatly weaken the efficacy of the writ id at 102103 we held that congress would not be presumed to have effected such denial absent an unmistakably clear statement to the contrary see id at 104105 see also felker v turpin 518 u s 651 1996 durousseau v united states 6 cranch 307 314 1810 opinion for the court by marshall c j the appellate powers of this court are not created by statute but are given by the constitution united states v klein 13 wall 128 1872 cf ex parte mccardle 7 wall 506 514 1869 holding that congress had validly foreclosed one avenue of appellate review where its repeal of habeas jurisdiction reproduced in the margin4 could not have been a plainer instance of positive exception hamdan also suggests that if the governments reading is correct congress has unconstitutionally suspended the writ of habeas corpus

we find it unnecessary to reach either of these arguments ordinary principles of statutory construction suffice to rebut 576 the governments theory—at least insofar as this case which was pending at the time the dta was enacted is concerned

the government acknowledges that only paragraphs 2 and 3 of subsection e are expressly made applicable to pending cases see § 1005h2 119 stat 27432744 but argues that the omission of paragraph 1 from the scope of that express statement is of no moment this is so we are told because congress failure to expressly reserve federal courts jurisdiction over pending cases erects a presumption against jurisdiction and that presumption is rebutted by neither the text nor the legislative history of the dta
the first part of this argument is not entirely without support in our precedents we have in the past applied intervening statutes conferring or ousting jurisdiction whether or not jurisdiction lay when the underlying conduct occurred or when the suit was filed landgraf v usi film products 511 u s 244 274 1994 citing bruner v united states 343 u s 112 1952 hallowell v commons 239 u s 506 1916 see republic of austria v altmann 541 u s 677 693 2004 but the presumption that these cases have applied is more accurately viewed as the nonapplication of another presumption—viz the presumption against retroactivity—in certain limited circumstances5 if a statutory provision would operate retroactively as applied to cases pending at the time the provision was enacted then our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result landgraf 511 u s at 280 we have explained however that unlike other intervening changes in the law a 577 jurisdictionconferring or jurisdictionstripping statute usually takes away no substantive right but simply changes the tribunal that is to hear the case hallowell 239 u s at 508 if that is truly all the statute does no retroactivity problem arises because the change in the law does not impair rights a party possessed when he acted increase a partys liability for past conduct or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed landgraf 511 u s at 2806 and if a new rule has no retroactive effect the presumption against retroactivity will not prevent its application to a case that was already pending when the new rule was enacted

that does not mean however that all jurisdictionstripping provisions—or even all such provisions that truly lack retroactive effect—must apply to cases pending at the time of their enactment7 normal rules of construction including a contextual reading of the statutory language may dictate otherwise lindh v murphy 521 u s 320 326 578 19978 a familiar principle of statutory construction relevant both in lindh and here is that a negative inference may be drawn from the exclusion of language from one statutory provision that is included in other provisions of the same statute see id at 330 see also e g russello v united states 464 u s 16 23 1983 where congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion the court in lindh relied on this reasoning to conclude that certain limitations on the availability of habeas relief imposed by aedpa applied only to cases filed after that statutes effective date congress failure to identify the temporal reach of those limitations which governed noncapital cases stood in contrast to its express command in the same legislation that new rules governing habeas petitions in capital cases apply to cases pending on or after the date of enactment § 107c 110 stat 1226 see lindh 521 u s at 329330 that contrast combined with the fact that the amendments at issue affected substantive entitlement to relief id at 327 warranted drawing a negative inference

a like inference follows a fortiori from lindh in this case if    congress was reasonably concerned to ensure that §§ 1005e2 and 3 be applied to pending cases it should have been just as concerned about § 1005e1 unless it had the different intent that the latter section not be applied to the general run of pending cases id at 329 if anything the evidence of deliberate omission is stronger here than it 579 was in lindh in lindh the provisions to be contrasted had been drafted separately but were later joined together and   considered simultaneously when the language raising the implication was inserted id at 330 we observed that congress tandem review and approval of the two sets of provisions strengthened the presumption that the relevant omission was deliberate id at 331 see also field v mans 516 u s 59 75 1995 the more apparently deliberate the contrast the stronger the inference as applied for example to contrasting statutory sections originally enacted simultaneously in relevant respects here congress not only considered the respective temporal reaches of paragraphs 1 2 and 3 of subsection e together at every stage but omitted paragraph 1 from its directive that paragraphs 2 and 3 apply to pending cases only after having rejected earlier proposed versions of the statute that would have included what is now paragraph 1 within the scope of that directive compare dta § 1005h2 119 stat 27432744 with 151 cong rec s12655 nov 10 2005 s amdt 2515 see id at s14257s14258 dec 21 2005 discussing similar language proposed in both the house and the senate9 congress rejection of the very language that would have 580 achieved the result the government urges here weighs heavily against the governments interpretation see doe v chao 540 u s 614 621623 200410

581 the government nonetheless offers two reasons why in its view no negative inference may be drawn in favor of jurisdiction first it asserts that lindh is inapposite because section 1005e1 and h1 remove jurisdiction while section 1005e2 3 and h2 create an exclusive review mechanism and define the nature of that review reply brief in support of respondents motion to dismiss 4 because the provisions being contrasted address wholly distinct subject matters martin v hadix 527 u s 343 356 1999 the government argues congress different treatment of them is of no significance

this argument must fail because it rests on a false distinction between the jurisdictional nature of subsection e1 and the procedural character of subsections e2 and e3 in truth all three provisions govern jurisdiction over detainees claims subsection e1 addresses jurisdiction in habeas cases and other actions relating to any aspect of the detention while subsections e2 and e3 vest exclusive11 but limited jurisdiction in the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit to review final decisions of csrts and military commissions

that subsection e1 strips jurisdiction while subsections e2 and e3 restore it in limited form is hardly a distinction upon which a negative inference must founder justice scalia in arguing to the contrary maintains that congress 582 had ample reason to provide explicitly for application of subsections e2 and e3 to pending cases because jurisdictionousting provisions like subsection e1 have been treated differently under our retroactivity jurisprudence than jurisdictioncreating ones like subsections e2 and e3 post at 662 dissenting opinion see also reply brief in support of respondents motion to dismiss 56 that theory is insupportable assuming arguendo that subsections e2 and e3 confer new jurisdiction in the d c circuit where there was none before post at 662 emphasis in original but see rasul v bush 542 u s 466 2004 and that our precedents can be read to strongly indicate that jurisdictioncreating statutes raise special retroactivity concerns not also raised by jurisdictionstripping statutes post at 66212 subsections e2 and e3 confer jurisdiction in a manner that cannot conceivably give rise to retroactivity questions under our precedents the provisions impose no additional liability or obligation on any private party or even on the united states unless one counts the burden of litigating an appeal—a burden not a single one of our cases suggests triggers retroactivity concerns13 583 moreover it strains credulity to suggest that the desire to reinforce the application of subsections e2 and e3 to pending cases drove congress to exclude subsection e1 from § 1005h2

the governments second objection is that applying subsections e2 and e3 but not e1 to pending cases produces an absurd result because it grants albeit only temporarily dual jurisdiction over detainees cases in circumstances where the statute plainly envisions that the d c circuit will have exclusive and immediate jurisdiction over such cases reply brief in support of respondents motion to dismiss 7 but the premise here is faulty subsections e2 and e3 grant jurisdiction only over actions to determine the validity of any final decision of a csrt or commission because hamdan at least is not contesting any final decision of a csrt or military commission his action does not fall within the scope of subsection e2 or e3 there is then no absurdity14

the governments more general suggestion that congress can have had no good reason for preserving habeas jurisdiction over cases that had been brought by detainees prior to enactment of the dta not only is belied by the legislative history see n 10 supra but is otherwise without merit there is nothing absurd about a scheme under which pending habeas actions—particularly those like this one that challenge the very legitimacy of the tribunals whose judgments congress would like to have reviewed—are preserved and more routine challenges to final decisions rendered 584 by those tribunals are carefully channeled to a particular court and through a particular lens of review

finally we cannot leave unaddressed justice scalias contentions that the meaning of § 1005e1 is entirely clear post at 660 and that the plain import of a statute repealing jurisdiction is to eliminate the power to consider and render judgment—in an already pending case no less than in a case yet to be filed post at 657 emphasis in original only by treating the bruner rule as an inflexible trump a thing it has never been see n 7 supra and ignoring both the rest of § 1005s text and its drafting history can one conclude as much congress here expressly provided that subsections e2 and e3 applied to pending cases it chose not to so provide—after having been presented with the option—for subsection e1 the omission is an integral part of the statutory scheme that muddies whatever plain meaning may be discerned from blinkered study of subsection e1 alone the dissents speculation about what congress might have intended by the omission not only is counterfactual cf n 10 supra recounting legislative history but rests on both a misconstruction of the dta and an erroneous view of our precedents see supra at 582583 and n 12

for these reasons we deny the governments motion to dismiss15iiirelying on our decision in councilman 420 u s 738 the government argues that even if we have statutory jurisdiction 585 we should apply the judgemade rule that civilian courts should await the final outcome of ongoing military proceedings before entertaining an attack on those proceedings brief for respondents 12 like the district court and the court of appeals before us we reject this argument

in councilman an army officer on active duty was referred to a courtmartial for trial on charges that he violated the ucmj by selling transferring and possessing marijuana 420 u s at 739740 objecting that the alleged offenses were not service connected id at 740 the officer filed suit in federal district court to enjoin the proceedings he neither questioned the lawfulness of courtsmartial or their procedures nor disputed that as a serviceman he was subject to courtmartial jurisdiction his sole argument was that the subject matter of his case did not fall within the scope of courtmartial authority see id at 741 759 the district court granted his request for injunctive relief and the court of appeals affirmed

we granted certiorari and reversed id at 761 we did not reach the merits of whether the marijuana charges were sufficiently service connected to place them within the subjectmatter jurisdiction of a courtmartial instead we concluded that as a matter of comity federal courts should normally abstain from intervening in pending courtmartial proceedings against members of the armed forces16 and 586 further that there was nothing in the particular circumstances of the officers case to displace that general rule see id at 740 758

councilman identifies two considerations of comity that together favor abstention pending completion of ongoing courtmartial proceedings against service personnel see new v cohen 129 f 3d 639 643 cadc 1997 see also 415 f 3d at 3637 discussing councilman and new first military discipline and therefore the efficient operation of the armed forces are best served if the military justice system acts without regular interference from civilian courts see councilman 420 u s at 752 second federal courts should respect the balance that congress struck between military preparedness and fairness to individual service members when it created an integrated system of military courts and review procedures a critical element of which is the court of military appeals consisting of civilian judges completely removed from all military influence or persuasion    id at 758 quoting h r rep no 491 81st cong 1st sess 7 1949 just as abstention in the face of ongoing state criminal proceedings is justified by our expectation that state courts will enforce federal rights so abstention in the face of ongoing courtmartial proceedings is justified by our expectation that the military court system established by congress—with its substantial procedural protections and provision for appellate review by independent civilian judges—will vindicate servicemens constitutional rights 420 u s at 758 see id at 75575817
587 the same cannot be said here indeed neither of the comity considerations identified in councilman weighs in favor of abstention in this case first hamdan is not a member of our nations armed forces so concerns about military discipline do not apply second the tribunal convened to try hamdan is not part of the integrated system of military courts complete with independent review panels that congress has established unlike the officer in councilman hamdan has no right to appeal any conviction to the civilian judges of the court of military appeals now called the united states court of appeals for the armed forces see § 924 108 stat 2831 instead under dept of defense military commission order no 1 commission order no 1 app c to brief for petitioner 46a which was issued by the secretary of defense on march 21 2002 and amended most recently on august 31 2005 and which governs the procedures for hamdans commission any conviction would be reviewed by a panel consisting of three military officers designated by the secretary id § 6h4 commission order no 1 provides that appeal of a review panels decision may be had only to the secretary himself § 6h5 and then finally to the president § 6h618

we have no doubt that the various individuals assigned review power under commission order no 1 would strive to act impartially and ensure that hamdan receive all protections to which he is entitled nonetheless these review bodies clearly lack the structural insulation from military influence that characterizes the court of appeals for the 588 armed forces and thus bear insufficient conceptual similarity to state courts to warrant invocation of abstention principles19

in sum neither of the two comity considerations underlying our decision to abstain in councilman applies to the circumstances of this case instead this courts decision in quirin is the most relevant precedent in quirin eight german saboteurs were captured upon arrival by submarine in new york and florida 317 u s at 21 the president convened a military commission to try seven of the saboteurs who then filed habeas corpus petitions in the united states district court for the district of columbia challenging their trial by commission we granted the saboteurs petition for certiorari to the court of appeals before judgment see id at 19 far from abstaining pending the conclusion of military proceedings which were ongoing we convened a special term to hear the case and expedited our review that course of action was warranted we explained in view of the public importance of the questions raised by the cases and of the duty which rests on the courts in time of war as well as in time of peace to preserve unimpaired the constitutional safeguards of civil liberty and because in our opinion the public interest required that we consider and decide those questions without any avoidable delay ibid

as the court of appeals here recognized quirin provides a compelling historical precedent for the power of civilian courts to entertain challenges that seek to interrupt the 589 processes of military commissions 415 f 3d at 3620 the circumstances of this case like those in quirin simply do not implicate the obligations of comity that under appropriate circumstances justify abstention quackenbush v allstate ins co 517 u s 706 733 1996 kennedy j concurring

finally the government has identified no other important countervailing interest that would permit federal courts to depart from their general duty to exercise the jurisdiction that is conferred upon them by congress id at 716 majority opinion to the contrary hamdan and the government both have a compelling interest in knowing in advance whether hamdan may be tried by a military commission that arguably is without any basis in law and operates 590 free from many of the procedural rules prescribed by congress for courtsmartial—rules intended to safeguard the accused and ensure the reliability of any conviction while we certainly do not foreclose the possibility that abstention may be appropriate in some cases seeking review of ongoing military commission proceedings such as military commissions convened on the battlefield the foregoing discussion makes clear that under our precedent abstention is not justified here we therefore proceed to consider the merits of hamdans challengeivthe military commission a tribunal neither mentioned in the constitution nor created by statute was born of military necessity see w winthrop military law and precedents 831 rev 2d ed 1920 hereinafter winthrop though foreshadowed in some respects by earlier tribunals like the board of general officers that general washington convened to try british major john andré for spying during the revolutionary war the commission as such was inaugurated in 1847 id at 832 g davis a treatise on the military law of the united states 308 rev 3d ed 1915 hereinafter davis as commander of occupied mexican territory and having available to him no other tribunal general winfield scott that year ordered the establishment of both military commissions to try ordinary crimes committed in the occupied territory and a council of war to try offenses against the law of war winthrop 832 emphasis in original

when the exigencies of war next gave rise to a need for use of military commissions during the civil war the dual system favored by general scott was not adopted instead a single tribunal often took jurisdiction over ordinary crimes war crimes and breaches of military orders alike as further discussed below each aspect of that seemingly broad jurisdiction was in fact supported by a separate military exigency generally though the need for military commissions 591 during this period—as during the mexican war— was driven largely by the then very limited jurisdiction of courtsmartial the occasion for the military commission arises principally from the fact that the jurisdiction of the courtmartial proper in our law is restricted by statute almost exclusively to members of the military force and to certain specific offences defined in a written code id at 831 emphasis in original

exigency alone of course will not justify the establishment and use of penal tribunals not contemplated by article i § 8 and article iii § 1 of the constitution unless some other part of that document authorizes a response to the felt need see ex parte milligan 4 wall 2 121 1866 certainly no part of the judicial power of the country was conferred on military commissions ex parte vallandigham 1 wall 243 251 1864 see also quirin 317 u s at 25 congress and the president like the courts possess no power not derived from the constitution and that authority if it exists can derive only from the powers granted jointly to the president and congress in time of war see id at 2629 in re yamashita 327 u s 1 11 1946

the constitution makes the president the commander in chief of the armed forces art ii § 2 cl 1 but vests in congress the powers to declare war    and make rules concerning captures on land and water art i § 8 cl 11 to raise and support armies id cl 12 to define and punish   offences against the law of nations id cl 10 and to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces id cl 14 the interplay between these powers was described by chief justice chase in the seminal case of ex parte milligan

the power to make the necessary laws is in congress the power to execute in the president both powers imply many subordinate and auxiliary powers each includes all authorities essential to its due exercise but neither can the president in war more than in 592 peace intrude upon the proper authority of congress nor congress upon the proper authority of the president    congress cannot direct the conduct of campaigns nor can the president or any commander under him without the sanction of congress institute tribunals for the trial and punishment of offences either of soldiers or civilians unless in cases of a controlling necessity which justifies what it compels or at least insures acts of indemnity from the justice of the legislature 4 wall at 13914021
whether chief justice chase was correct in suggesting that the president may constitutionally convene military commissions without the sanction of congress in cases of controlling necessity is a question this court has not answered definitively and need not answer today for we held in quirin that congress had through article of war 15 sanctioned the use of military commissions in such circumstances 317 u s at 28 by the articles of war and especially article 15 congress has explicitly provided so far as it may constitutionally do so that military tribunals shall have jurisdiction to try offenders or offenses against the law of war in appropriate cases article 21 of the ucmj the language of which is substantially identical to the old article 15 and was preserved by congress after world war ii22 reads as follows

593jurisdiction of courtsmartial not exclusive
the provisions of this code conferring jurisdiction upon courtsmartial shall not be construed as depriving military commissions provost courts or other military tribunals of concurrent jurisdiction in respect of offenders or offenses that by statute or by the law of war may be tried by such military commissions provost courts or other military tribunals 64 stat 115we have no occasion to revisit quirins controversial characterization of article of war 15 as congressional authorization for military commissions cf brief for legal scholars and historians as amici curiae 1215 contrary to the governments assertion however even quirin did not view the authorization as a sweeping mandate for the president to invoke military commissions when he deems them necessary brief for respondents 17 rather the quirin court recognized that congress had simply preserved what power under the constitution and the common law of war the president had had before 1916 to convene military commissions—with the express condition that the president and those under his command comply with the law of war see 317 u s at 282923 that much is evidenced by the courts inquiry following its conclusion that congress had authorized military commissions into whether the law of war had indeed been complied with in that case see ibid

the government would have us dispense with the inquiry that the quirin court undertook and find in either the aumf or the dta specific overriding authorization for the very commission that has been convened to try hamdan neither of these congressional acts however expands the 594 presidents authority to convene military commissions first while we assume that the aumf activated the presidents war powers see hamdi v rumsfeld 542 u s 507 2004 plurality opinion and that those powers include the authority to convene military commissions in appropriate circumstances see id at 518 quirin 317 u s at 2829 see also yamashita 327 u s at 11 there is nothing in the text or legislative history of the aumf even hinting that congress intended to expand or alter the authorization set forth in article 21 of the ucmj cf yerger 8 wall at 105 repeals by implication are not favored24

likewise the dta cannot be read to authorize this commission although the dta unlike either article 21 or the aumf was enacted after the president had convened hamdans commission it contains no language authorizing that tribunal or any other at guantanamo bay the dta obviously recognizes the existence of the guantanamo bay commissions in the weakest sense brief for respondents 15 because it references some of the military orders governing them and creates limited judicial review of their final decisions dta § 1005e3 119 stat 2743 but the statute also pointedly reserves judgment on whether the constitution and laws of the united states are applicable in reviewing such decisions and whether if they are the standards and procedures used to try hamdan and other detainees actually violate the constitution and laws ibid

together the ucmj the aumf and the dta at most acknowledge a general presidential authority to convene military 595 commissions in circumstances where justified under the constitution and laws including the law of war absent a more specific congressional authorization the task of this court is as it was in quirin to decide whether hamdans military commission is so justified it is to that inquiry we now turnvthe common law governing military commissions may be gleaned from past practice and what sparse legal precedent exists commissions historically have been used in three situations see bradley  goldsmith congressional authorization and the war on terrorism 118 harv l rev 2048 21322133 2005 winthrop 831846 hearings on h r 2498 before the subcommittee of the house committee on armed services 81st cong 1st sess 975 1949 first they have substituted for civilian courts at times and in places where martial law has been declared their use in these circumstances has raised constitutional questions see duncan v kahanamoku 327 u s 304 1946 milligan 4 wall at 121122 but is well recognized25 see winthrop 822 836839 second commissions have been established to try civilians as part of a temporary military government over occupied enemy territory or territory regained from an 596 enemy where civilian government cannot and does not function duncan 327 u s at 314 see milligan 4 wall at 141142 chase c j concurring in judgment distinguishing martial law proper from military government in occupied territory illustrative of this second kind of commission is the one that was established with jurisdiction to apply the german criminal code in occupied germany following the end of world war ii see madsen v kinsella 343 u s 341 356 195226

the third type of commission convened as an incident to the conduct of war when there is a need to seize and subject to disciplinary measures those enemies who in their attempt to thwart or impede our military effort have violated the law of war quirin 317 u s at 2829 has been described as utterly different from the other two bickers military commissions are constitutionally sound a response to professors katyal and tribe 34 tex tech l rev 899 902 2002200327 not only is its jurisdiction limited to offenses cognizable during time of war but its role is primarily a factfinding one—to determine typically on the battlefield 597 itself whether the defendant has violated the law of war the last time the u s armed forces used the lawofwar military commission was during world war ii in quirin this court sanctioned president roosevelts use of such a tribunal to try nazi saboteurs captured on american soil during the war 317 u s 1 and in yamashita we held that a military commission had jurisdiction to try a japanese commander for failing to prevent troops under his command from committing atrocities in the philippines 327 u s 1

quirin is the model the government invokes most frequently to defend the commission convened to try hamdan that is both appropriate and unsurprising since guantanamo bay is neither enemyoccupied territory nor under martial law the lawofwar commission is the only model available at the same time no more robust model of executive power exists quirin represents the highwater mark of military power to try enemy combatants for war crimes

the classic treatise penned by colonel william winthrop whom we have called the blackstone of military law reid v covert 354 u s 1 19 n 38 1957 plurality opinion describes at least four preconditions for exercise of jurisdiction by a tribunal of the type convened to try hamdan first a military commission except where otherwise authorized by statute can legally assume jurisdiction only of offences committed within the field of the command of the convening commander winthrop 836 the field of the command in these circumstances means the theatre of war ibid second the offense charged must have been committed within the period of the war28 id at 837 no jurisdiction exists to try offenses committed either before or after the war ibid third a military commission not established pursuant to martial law or an occupation may try 598 only individuals of the enemys army who have been guilty of illegitimate warfare or other offences in violation of the laws of war and members of ones own army who in time of war become chargeable with crimes or offences not cognizable or triable by the criminal courts or under the articles of war id at 838 finally a lawofwar commission has jurisdiction to try only two kinds of offense violations of the laws and usages of war cognizable by military tribunals only and breaches of military orders or regulations for which offenders are not legally triable by courtmartial under the articles of war id at 83929

all parties agree that colonel winthrops treatise accurately describes the common law governing military commissions and that the jurisdictional limitations he identifies were incorporated in article of war 15 and later article 21 of the ucmj it also is undisputed that hamdans commission lacks jurisdiction to try him unless the charge properly sets forth not only the details of the act charged but the circumstances conferring jurisdiction id at 842 emphasis in original the question is whether the preconditions designed to ensure that a military necessity exists to justify the use of this extraordinary tribunal have been satisfied here

the charge against hamdan described in detail in part i supra alleges a conspiracy extending over a number of years from 1996 to november 200130 all but two months of that more than 5yearlong period preceded the attacks of 599 september 11 2001 and the enactment of the aumf—the act of congress on which the government relies for exercise of its war powers and thus for its authority to convene military commissions31 neither the purported agreement with 600 usama bin laden and others to commit war crimes nor a single overt act is alleged to have occurred in a theater of war or on any specified date after september 11 2001 none of the overt acts that hamdan is alleged to have committed violates the law of war

these facts alone cast doubt on the legality of the charge and hence the commission as winthrop makes plain the offense alleged must have been committed both in a theater of war and during not before the relevant conflict but the deficiencies in the time and place allegations also underscore—indeed are symptomatic of—the most serious defect of this charge the offense it alleges is not triable by lawofwar military commission see yamashita 327 u s at 13 neither congressional action nor the military orders constituting the commission authorized it to place petitioner on trial unless the charge proffered against him is of a violation of the law of war32

601 there is no suggestion that congress has in exercise of its constitutional authority to define and punish    offences against the law of nations u s const art i § 8 cl 10 602 positively identified conspiracy as a war crime33 as we explained in quirin that is not necessarily fatal to the governments claim of authority to try the alleged offense by military commission congress through article 21 of the ucmj has incorporated by reference the common law of war which may render triable by military commission certain offenses not defined by statute 317 u s at 30 when however neither the elements of the offense nor the range of permissible punishments is defined by statute or treaty the precedent must be plain and unambiguous to demand any less would be to risk concentrating in military hands a degree of adjudicative and punitive power in excess of that contemplated either by statute or by the constitution cf loving v united states 517 u s 748 771 1996 acknowledging that congress may not delegate the power to make laws reid 354 u s at 2324 the founders envisioned the army as a necessary institution but one dangerous to liberty if not confined within its essential bounds the federalist no 47 p 324 j cooke ed 1961 j madison the accumulation of all powers legislative executive and judiciary in the same hands    may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny34

603 this high standard was met in quirin the violation there alleged was by universal agreement and practice both in this country and internationally recognized as an offense against the law of war 317 u s at 30 see id at 3536 this precept of the law of war has been so recognized in practice both here and abroad and has so generally been accepted as valid by authorities on international law that we think it must be regarded as a rule or principle of the law of war recognized by this government by its enactment of the fifteenth article of war footnote omitted although the picture arguably was less clear in yamashita compare 327 u s at 16 stating that the provisions of the fourth hague convention of 1907 36 stat 2306 plainly required the defendant to control the troops under his command with 327 u s at 35 murphy j dissenting the disagreement between the majority and the dissenters in that case concerned whether the historic and textual evidence constituted clear precedent— not whether clear precedent was required to justify trial by lawofwar military commission

at a minimum the government must make a substantial showing that the crime for which it seeks to try a defendant by military commission is acknowledged to be an offense against the law of war that burden is far from satisfied here the crime of conspiracy has rarely if ever been tried as such in this country by any lawofwar military commission 604 not exercising some other form of jurisdiction35 and does not appear in either the geneva conventions or the hague conventions—the major treaties on the law of war36 winthrop explains that under the common law governing military commissions it is not enough to intend to violate the law of war and commit overt acts in furtherance of that intention unless the overt acts either are themselves offenses against the law of war or constitute steps sufficiently substantial to qualify as an attempt see winthrop 841 the jurisdiction of the military commission should be restricted to cases of offence consisting in overt acts i e in unlawful commissions or actual attempts to commit and not in intentions merely emphasis in original

the government cites three sources that it says show otherwise first it points out that the nazi saboteurs in quirin were charged with conspiracy see brief for respondents 27 second it observes that winthrop at one 605 point in his treatise identifies conspiracy as an offense prosecuted by military commissions ibid citing winthrop 839 and n 5 finally it notes that another military historian charles roscoe howland lists conspiracy to violate the laws of war by destroying life or property in aid of the enemy as an offense that was tried as a violation of the law of war during the civil war brief for respondents 2728 citing c howland digest of opinions of the judge advocates general of the army 1071 1912 hereinafter howland on close analysis however these sources at best lend little support to the governments position and at worst undermine it by any measure they fail to satisfy the high standard of clarity required to justify the use of a military commission

that the defendants in quirin were charged with conspiracy is not persuasive since the court declined to address whether the offense actually qualified as a violation of the law of war—let alone one triable by military commission the quirin defendants were charged with the following offenses

i violation of the law of war
ii violation of article 81 of the articles of war defining the offense of relieving or attempting to relieve or corresponding with or giving intelligence to the enemy
iii violation of article 82 defining the offense of spying
iv conspiracy to commit the offenses alleged in charges i ii and iii 317 u s at 23
the government defending its charge argued that the conspiracy alleged constituted an additional violation of the law of war id at 15 the saboteurs disagreed they maintained that the charge of conspiracy can not stand if the other charges fall id at 8 the court however declined to resolve the dispute it concluded first that the 606 specification supporting charge i adequately alleged a violation of the law of war that was not merely colorable or without foundation id at 36 the facts the court deemed sufficient for this purpose were that the defendants admitted enemy combatants entered upon u s territory in time of war without uniform for the purpose of destroying property used or useful in prosecuting the war that act was a hostile and warlike one id at 36 37 the court was careful in its decision to identify an overt complete act responding to the argument that the saboteurs had not actually committed or attempted to commit any act of depredation or entered the theatre or zone of active military operations and therefore had not violated the law of war the court responded that they had actually passed our military and naval lines and defenses or went behind those lines in civilian dress and with hostile purpose id at 38 the offense was complete when with that purpose they entered—or having so entered they remained upon—our territory in time of war without uniform or other appropriate means of identification ibid

turning to the other charges alleged the court explained that since the first specification of charge i sets forth a violation of the law of war we have no occasion to pass on the adequacy of the second specification of charge i or to construe the 81st and 82nd articles of war for the purpose of ascertaining whether the specifications under charges ii and iii allege violations of those articles or whether if so construed they are constitutional id at 46 no mention was made at all of charge iv—the conspiracy charge

if anything quirin supports hamdans argument that conspiracy is not a violation of the law of war not only did the court pointedly omit any discussion of the conspiracy charge but its analysis of charge i placed special emphasis on the completion of an offense it took seriously the saboteurs argument that there can be no violation of a law of war—at least not one triable by military commission —without the 607 actual commission of or attempt to commit a hostile and warlike act id at 3738

that limitation makes eminent sense when one considers the necessity from whence this kind of military commission grew the need to dispense swift justice often in the form of execution to illegal belligerents captured on the battlefield see s rep no 130 64th cong 1st sess 40 1916 testimony of brig gen enoch h crowder observing that article of war 15 preserves the power of the military commander in the field in time of war to use military commissions emphasis added the same urgency would not have been felt visàvis enemies who had done little more than agree to violate the laws of war cf 31 op atty gen 356 357 361 1918 opining that a german spy could not be tried by military commission because having been apprehended before entering any camp fortification or other military premises of the united states he had committed his offenses outside of the field of military operations the quirin court acknowledged as much when it described the presidents authority to use lawofwar military commissions as the power to seize and subject to disciplinary measures those enemies who in their attempt to thwart or impede our military effort have violated the law of war 317 u s at 2829 emphasis added

winthrop and howland are only superficially more helpful to the government howland granted lists conspiracy by two or more to violate the laws of war by destroying life or property in aid of the enemy as one of over 20 offenses against the laws and usages of war passed upon and punished by military commissions howland 10701071 but while the records of cases that howland cites following his list of offenses against the law of war support inclusion of the other offenses mentioned they provide no support for the inclusion of conspiracy as a violation of the law of war see id at 1071 citing record books of the judge advocate general office r 2 144 r 3 401 589 649 r 4 320 r 5 608 36 590 r 6 20 r 7 413 r 8 529 r 9 149 202 225 481 524 535 r 10 567 r 11 473 513 r 13 125 675 r 16 446 r 21 101 280 winthrop apparently recognizing as much excludes conspiracy of any kind from his own list of offenses against the law of war see winthrop 839840

winthrop does unsurprisingly include criminal conspiracies in his list of crimes and statutory offenses cognizable by state or u s courts and triable by martial law or military government commission see id at 839 and in a footnote he cites several civil war examples of conspiracies of this class or of the first and second classes combined id at 839 n 5 emphasis added the government relies on this footnote for its contention that conspiracy was triable both as an ordinary crime a crime of the first class and independently as a war crime a crime of the second class but the footnote will not support the weight the government places on it

as we have seen the military commissions convened during the civil war functioned at once as martial law or military government tribunals and as lawofwar commissions see n 27 supra accordingly they regularly tried war crimes and ordinary crimes together indeed as howland observes not unfrequently the crime as charged and found was a combination of the two species of offenses howland 1071 see also davis 310 n 2 winthrop 842 the example he gives is murder in violation of the laws of war howland 10711072 winthrops conspiracy of the first and second classes combined is like howlands example best understood as a species of compound offense of the type tried by the hybrid military commissions of the civil war it is not a standalone offense against the law of war winthrop confirms this understanding later in his discussion when he emphasizes that overt acts constituting war crimes are the only proper subject at least of those military tribunals not convened to stand in for local courts winthrop 841 and nn 22 23 citing w finlason martial law 130 1867 emphasis in original

609 justice thomas cites as evidence that conspiracy is a recognized violation of the law of war the civil war indictment against henry wirz which charged the defendant with maliciously willfully and traitorously    combining confederating and conspiring with others to injure the health and destroy the lives of soldiers in the military service of the united states    to the end that the armies of the united states might be weakened and impaired in violation of the laws and customs of war post at 701 dissenting opinion quoting h r doc no 314 55th cong 3d sess 785 1899 emphasis deleted as shown by the specification supporting that charge however wirz was alleged to have personally committed a number of atrocities against his victims including torture injection of prisoners with poison and use of ferocious and bloodthirsty dogs to seize tear mangle and maim the bodies and limbs of prisoners many of whom died as a result id at 789790 crucially judge advocate general holt determined that one of wirzs alleged coconspirators r b winder should not be tried by military commission because there was as yet insufficient evidence of his own personal involvement in the atrocities in the case of r b winder while the evidence at the trial of wirz was deemed by the court to implicate him in the conspiracy against the lives of all federal prisoners in rebel hands no such specific overt acts of violation of the laws of war are as yet fixed upon him as to make it expedient to prefer formal charges and bring him to trial id at 783 emphasis added37

610 finally international sources confirm that the crime charged here is not a recognized violation of the law of war38 as observed above see supra at 603604 none of the major treaties governing the law of war identifies conspiracy as a violation thereof and the only conspiracy crimes that have been recognized by international war crimes tribunals whose jurisdiction often extends beyond war crimes proper to crimes against humanity and crimes against the peace are conspiracy to commit genocide and common plan to wage aggressive war which is a crime against the peace and requires for its commission actual participation in a concrete plan to wage war 1 trial of the major war criminals before the international military tribunal nuremberg 14 november 19451 october 1946 p 225 1947 hereinafter trial of major war criminals the international military tribunal at nuremberg over the prosecutions objections pointedly refused to recognize as a violation of the law of war conspiracy to commit war crimes see e g 22 id at 46939 and convicted only hitlers most senior associates of conspiracy to wage aggressive war see s pomorski conspiracy 611 and criminal organization in the nuremberg trial and international law 213 233235 g ginsburgs  v kudriavtsev eds 1990 as one prominent figure from the nuremberg trials has explained members of the tribunal objected to recognition of conspiracy as a violation of the law of war on the ground that the angloamerican concept of conspiracy was not part of european legal systems and arguably not an element of the internationally recognized laws of war t taylor anatomy of the nuremberg trials a personal memoir 36 1992 see also id at 550 observing that francis biddle who as attorney general prosecuted the defendants in quirin thought the french judge had made a persuasive argument that conspiracy in the truest sense is not known to international law40

in sum the sources that the government and justice thomas rely upon to show that conspiracy to violate the law of war is itself a violation of the law of war in fact demonstrate quite the opposite far from making the requisite substantial showing the government has failed even to offer a merely colorable case for inclusion of conspiracy among those offenses cognizable by lawofwar military commission cf quirin 317 u s at 36 because the charge does not 612 support the commissions jurisdiction the commission lacks authority to try hamdan

the charges shortcomings are not merely formal but are indicative of a broader inability on the executives part here to satisfy the most basic precondition—at least in the absence of specific congressional authorization—for establishment of military commissions military necessity hamdans tribunal was appointed not by a military commander in the field of battle but by a retired major general stationed away from any active hostilities cf rasul v bush 542 u s at 487 kennedy j concurring in judgment observing that guantanamo bay is    far removed from any hostilities hamdan is charged not with an overt act for which he was caught redhanded in a theater of war and which military efficiency demands be tried expeditiously but with an agreement the inception of which long predated the attacks of september 11 2001 and the aumf that may well be a crime41 but it is not an offense that by the law of war may be tried by military commission 10 u s c § 821 none of the overt acts alleged to have been committed in furtherance of the agreement is itself a war crime or even necessarily occurred during time of or in a theater of war any urgent need for imposition or execution of judgment is utterly belied by the record hamdan was arrested in november 2001 and he was not charged until mid2004 these simply are not the circumstances in which by any stretch of the historical evidence or this courts precedents a military commission established by executive order under the authority 613 of article 21 of the ucmj may lawfully try a person and subject him to punishmentviwhether or not the government has charged hamdan with an offense against the law of war cognizable by military commission the commission lacks power to proceed the ucmj conditions the presidents use of military commissions on compliance not only with the american common law of war but also with the rest of the ucmj itself insofar as applicable and with the rules and precepts of the law of nations quirin 317 u s at 28 —including inter alia the four geneva conventions signed in 1949 see yamashita 327 u s at 2021 2324 the procedures that the government has decreed will govern hamdans trial by commission violate these lawsathe commissions procedures are set forth in commission order no 1 which was amended most recently on august 31 2005—after hamdans trial had already begun every commission established pursuant to commission order no 1 must have a presiding officer and at least three other members all of whom must be commissioned officers § 4a1 the presiding officers job is to rule on questions of law and other evidentiary and interlocutory issues the other members make findings and if applicable sentencing decisions § 4a5 the accused is entitled to appointed military counsel and may hire civilian counsel at his own expense so long as such counsel is a u s citizen with security clearance at the level secret or higher §§ 4c23

the accused also is entitled to a copy of the charges against him both in english and his own language if different to a presumption of innocence and to certain other rights typically afforded criminal defendants in civilian courts and courtsmartial see §§ 5ap these rights 614 are subject however to one glaring condition the accused and his civilian counsel may be excluded from and precluded from ever learning what evidence was presented during any part of the proceeding that either the appointing authority or the presiding officer decides to close grounds for such closure include the protection of information classified or classifiable    information protected by law or rule from unauthorized disclosure the physical safety of participants in commission proceedings including prospective witnesses intelligence and law enforcement sources methods or activities and other national security interests § 6b342 appointed military defense counsel must be privy to these closed sessions but may at the presiding officers discretion be forbidden to reveal to his or her client what took place therein ibid

another striking feature of the rules governing hamdans commission is that they permit the admission of any evidence that in the opinion of the presiding officer would have probative value to a reasonable person § 6d1 under this test not only is testimonial hearsay and evidence obtained through coercion fully admissible but neither live testimony nor witnesses written statements need be sworn see §§ 6d2b 3 moreover the accused and his civilian counsel may be denied access to evidence in the form of protected information which includes classified information as well as information protected by law or rule from unauthorized disclosure and information concerning other national security interests §§ 6b3 6d5av so long as the presiding officer concludes that the evidence is probative under § 6d1 and that its admission without the accuseds knowledge would not result in the denial of a full and fair trial § 6d5b43 finally a presiding officers determination 615 that evidence would not have probative value to a reasonable person may be overridden by a majority of the other commission members § 6d1

once all the evidence is in the commission members not including the presiding officer must vote on the accuseds guilt a twothirds vote will suffice for both a verdict of guilty and for imposition of any sentence not including death the imposition of which requires a unanimous vote § 6f any appeal is taken to a threemember review panel composed of military officers and designated by the secretary of defense only one member of which need have experience as a judge § 6h4 the review panel is directed to disregard any variance from procedures specified in this order or elsewhere that would not materially have affected the outcome of the trial before the commission ibid once the panel makes its recommendation to the secretary of defense the secretary can either remand for further proceedings or forward the record to the president with his recommendation as to final disposition § 6h5 the president then unless he has delegated the task to the secretary makes the final decision § 6h6 he may change the commissions findings or sentence only in a manner favorable to the accused ibidbhamdan raises both general and particular objections to the procedures set forth in commission order no 1 his general objection is that the procedures admitted deviation from those governing courtsmartial itself renders the commission illegal chief among his particular objections are that he may under the commission order be convicted 616 based on evidence he has not seen or heard and that any evidence admitted against him need not comply with the admissibility or relevance rules typically applicable in criminal trials and courtmartial proceedings

the government objects to our consideration of any procedural challenge at this stage on the grounds that 1 the abstention doctrine espoused in councilman 420 u s 738 precludes preenforcement review of procedural rules 2 hamdan will be able to raise any such challenge following a final decision under the dta and 3 there is    no basis to presume before the trial has even commenced that the trial will not be conducted in good faith and according to law brief for respondents 4546 nn 2021 the first of these contentions was disposed of in part iii supra and neither of the latter two is sound

first because hamdan apparently is not subject to the death penalty at least as matters now stand and may receive a sentence shorter than 10 years imprisonment he has no automatic right to review of the commissions final decision44 before a federal court under the dta see § 1005e3 119 stat 2743 second contrary to the governments assertion there is a basis to presume that the procedures employed during hamdans trial will violate the law the procedures are described with particularity in commission order no 1 and implementation of some of them has already occurred one of hamdans complaints is that he will be and indeed already has been excluded from his own trial see reply brief for petitioner 12 app to pet for cert 45a under these circumstances review of the procedures in advance of a final decision— the timing of which is left entirely to the discretion of the president under the dta—is appropriate we turn then to consider the merits of hamdans procedural challenge

617cin part because the difference between military commissions and courtsmartial originally was a difference of jurisdiction alone and in part to protect against abuse and ensure evenhandedness under the pressures of war the procedures governing trials by military commission historically have been the same as those governing courtsmartial see e g 1 the war of the rebellion 248 2d series 1894 general order 1 issued during the civil war required military commissions to be constituted in a similar manner and their proceedings be conducted according to the same general rules as courtsmartial in order to prevent abuses which might otherwise arise accounts of commentators from winthrop through general crowder—who drafted article of war 15 and whose views have been deemed authoritative by this court madsen 343 u s at 353—confirm as much45 as recently as the korean and vietnam wars during which use of military commissions was contemplated but never made the principle of procedural parity was espoused as a background assumption see paust antiterrorism military commissions courting illegality 23 mich j intl l 1 35 20012002

there is a glaring historical exception to this general rule the procedures and evidentiary rules used to try general yamashita near the end of world war ii deviated in significant respects from those then governing courtsmartial 618 see 327 u s 1 the force of that precedent however has been seriously undermined by postworld war ii developments

yamashita from late 1944 until september 1945 was commanding general of the fourteenth army group of the imperial japanese army which had exercised control over the philippine islands on september 3 1945 after american forces regained control of the philippines yamashita surrendered three weeks later he was charged with violations of the law of war a few weeks after that he was arraigned before a military commission convened in the philippines he pleaded not guilty and his trial lasted for two months on december 7 1945 yamashita was convicted and sentenced to hang see id at 5 id at 3134 murphy j dissenting this court upheld the denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus

the procedures and rules of evidence employed during yamashitas trial departed so far from those used in courtsmartial that they generated an unusually long and vociferous critique from two members of this court see id at 4181 rutledge j joined by murphy j dissenting46 among the dissenters primary concerns was that the commission had free rein to consider all evidence which in the commissions opinion would be of assistance in proving or disproving the charge without any of the usual modes of authentication id at 49 opinion of rutledge j

619 the majority however did not pass on the merits of yamashitas procedural challenges because it concluded that his status disentitled him to any protection under the articles of war specifically those set forth in article 38 which would become article 36 of the ucmj or the geneva convention of 1929 47 stat 2021 1929 geneva convention the court explained that yamashita was neither a person made subject to the articles of war by article 2 thereof 327 u s at 20 nor a protected prisoner of war being tried for crimes committed during his detention id at 21

at least partially in response to subsequent criticism of general yamashitas trial the ucmjs codification of the articles of war after world war ii expanded the category of persons subject thereto to include defendants in yamashitas and hamdans position47 and the third geneva convention of 1949 extended prisonerofwar protections to individuals tried for crimes committed before their capture see 3 intl comm of red cross48 commentary geneva convention relative to the treatment of prisoners of war 413 j pictet gen ed 1960 hereinafter gciii commentary explaining 620 that article 85 which extends the conventions protections to prisoners of war prosecuted under the laws of the detaining power for acts committed prior to capture was adopted in response to judicial interpretations of the 1929 geneva convention including this courts decision in yamashita the most notorious exception to the principle of uniformity then has been stripped of its precedential value

the uniformity principle is not an inflexible one it does not preclude all departures from the procedures dictated for use by courtsmartial but any departure must be tailored to the exigency that necessitates it see winthrop 835 n 81 that understanding is reflected in article 36 of the ucmj which providesa the procedure including modes of proof in cases before courtsmartial courts of inquiry military commissions and other military tribunals may be prescribed by the president by regulations which shall so far as he considers practicable apply the principles of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the united states district courts but which may not be contrary to or inconsistent with this chapter
b all rules and regulations made under this article shall be uniform insofar as practicable and shall be reported to congress 70a stat 50article 36 places two restrictions on the presidents power to promulgate rules of procedure for courtsmartial and military commissions alike first no procedural rule he adopts may be contrary to or inconsistent with the ucmj—however practical it may seem second the rules adopted must be uniform insofar as practicable that is the rules applied to military commissions must be the same as those applied to courtsmartial unless such uniformity proves impracticable

621 hamdan argues that commission order no 1 violates both of these restrictions he maintains that the procedures described in the commission order are inconsistent with the ucmj and that the government has offered no explanation for their deviation from the procedures governing courtsmartial which are set forth in the manual for courtsmartial united states 2005 ed manual for courtsmartial among the inconsistencies hamdan identifies is that between § 6 of the commission order which permits exclusion of the accused from proceedings and denial of his access to evidence in certain circumstances and the ucmjs requirement that all    proceedings other than votes and deliberations by courtsmartial shall be made a part of the record and shall be in the presence of the accused 10 u s c § 839c 2000 ed supp v hamdan also observes that the commission order dispenses with virtually all evidentiary rules applicable in courtsmartial

the government has three responses first it argues only 9 of the ucmjs 158 articles—the ones that expressly mention military commissions49—actually apply to commissions and commission order no 1 sets forth no procedure 622 that is contrary to or inconsistent with those 9 provisions second the government contends military commissions would be of no use if the president were hamstrung by those provisions of the ucmj that govern courtsmartial finally the presidents determination that the danger to the safety of the united states and the nature of international terrorism renders it impracticable to apply in military commissions    the principles of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the united states district courts november 13 order § 1f is in the governments view explanation enough for any deviation from courtmartial procedures see brief for respondents 4347 and n 22

hamdan has the better of this argument without reaching the question whether any provision of commission order no 1 is strictly contrary to or inconsistent with other provisions of the ucmj we conclude that the practicability determination the president has made is insufficient to justify variances from the procedures governing courtsmartial subsection b of article 36 was added after world war ii and requires a different showing of impracticability from the one required by subsection a subsection a requires that the rules the president promulgates for courtsmartial provost courts and military commissions alike conform to those that govern procedures in article iii courts so far as he considers practicable 10 u s c § 836a emphasis added subsection b by contrast demands that the rules applied in courtsmartial provost courts and military commissions— whether or not they conform with the federal rules of evidence—be uniform insofar as practicable § 836b emphasis added under the latter provision then the rules set forth in the manual for courtsmartial must apply to military commissions unless impracticable50

623 the president here has determined pursuant to subsection a that it is impracticable to apply the rules and principles of law that govern the trial of criminal cases in the united states district courts § 836a to hamdans commission we assume that complete deference is owed that determination the president has not however made a similar official determination that it is impracticable to apply the rules for courtsmartial51 and even if subsection bs requirements may be satisfied without such an official determination the requirements of that subsection are not satisfied here

nothing in the record before us demonstrates that it would be impracticable to apply courtmartial rules in this case there is no suggestion for example of any logistical difficulty in securing properly sworn and authenticated evidence or in applying the usual principles of relevance and admissibility assuming arguendo that the reasons articulated in the presidents article 36a determination ought to be considered in evaluating the impracticability of applying courtmartial rules the only reason offered in support of that determination is the danger posed by international terrorism52 624 without for one moment underestimating that danger it is not evident to us why it should require in the case of hamdans trial any variance from the rules that govern courtsmartial

the absence of any showing of impracticability is particularly disturbing when considered in light of the clear and admitted failure to apply one of the most fundamental protections afforded not just by the manual for courtsmartial but also by the ucmj itself the right to be present see 10 u s c § 839c 2000 ed supp v whether or not that departure technically is contrary to or inconsistent with the terms of the ucmj 10 u s c § 836a the jettisoning of so basic a right cannot lightly be excused as practicable

under the circumstances then the rules applicable in courtsmartial must apply since it is undisputed that commission order no 1 deviates in many significant respects from those rules it necessarily violates article 36b

the governments objection that requiring compliance with the courtmartial rules imposes an undue burden both ignores the plain meaning of article 36b and misunderstands the purpose and the history of military commissions the military commission was not born of a desire to dispense a more summary form of justice than is afforded by courtsmartial it developed rather as a tribunal of necessity to be employed when courtsmartial lacked jurisdiction over either the accused or the subject matter see winthrop 831 exigency lent the commission its legitimacy but did not further justify the wholesale jettisoning of procedural protections 625 that history explains why the military commissions procedures typically have been the ones used by courtsmartial that the jurisdiction of the two tribunals today may sometimes overlap see madsen 343 u s at 354 does not detract from the force of this history53 article 21 did not transform the military commission from a tribunal of true exigency into a more convenient adjudicatory tool article 36 confirming as much strikes a careful balance between uniform procedure and the need to accommodate exigencies that may sometimes arise in a theater of war that article not having been complied with here the rules specified for hamdans trial are illegal54dthe procedures adopted to try hamdan also violate the geneva conventions the court of appeals dismissed hamdans geneva convention challenge on three independent grounds 1 the geneva conventions are not judicially enforceable 2 hamdan in any event is not entitled to their protections and 3 even if he is entitled to their protections councilman abstention is appropriate judge williams concurring rejected the second ground but agreed with the 626 majority respecting the first and the last as we explained in part iii supra the abstention rule applied in councilman 420 u s 738 is not applicable here55 and for the reasons that follow we hold that neither of the other grounds the court of appeals gave for its decision is persuasiveithe court of appeals relied on johnson v eisentrager 339 u s 763 1950 to hold that hamdan could not invoke the geneva conventions to challenge the governments plan to prosecute him in accordance with commission order no 1 eisentrager involved a challenge by 21 german nationals to their 1945 convictions for war crimes by a military tribunal convened in nanking china and to their subsequent imprisonment in occupied germany the petitioners argued inter alia that the 1929 geneva convention rendered illegal some of the procedures employed during their trials which they said deviated impermissibly from the procedures used by courtsmartial to try american soldiers see id at 789 we rejected that claim on the merits because the petitioners unlike hamdan here had failed to identify any prejudicial disparity between the commission that tried them and those that would try an offending soldier of the american forces of like rank and in any event could claim no protection under the 1929 geneva convention during trials for crimes that occurred before their confinement as prisoners of war id at 79056

627 buried in a footnote of the opinion however is this curious statement suggesting that the court lacked power even to consider the merits of the geneva convention argument

we are not holding that these prisoners have no right which the military authorities are bound to respect the united states by the geneva convention of july 27 1929 47 stat 2021 concluded with fortysix other countries including the german reich an agreement upon the treatment to be accorded captives these prisoners claim to be and are entitled to its protection it is however the obvious scheme of the agreement that responsibility for observance and enforcement of these rights is upon political and military authorities rights of alien enemies are vindicated under it only through protests and intervention of protecting powers as the rights of our citizens against foreign governments are vindicated only by presidential intervention id at 789 n 14
the court of appeals on the strength of this footnote held that the 1949 geneva convention does not confer upon hamdan a right to enforce its provisions in court 415 f 3d at 40

whatever else might be said about the eisentrager footnote it does not control this case we may assume that the obvious scheme of the 1949 conventions is identical in all relevant respects to that of the 1929 geneva convention57 and even that that scheme would absent some other provision of law preclude hamdans invocation of the conventions provisions as an independent source of law binding the governments 628 actions and furnishing petitioner with any enforceable right58 for regardless of the nature of the rights conferred on hamdan cf united states v rauscher 119 u s 407 1886 they are as the government does not dispute part of the law of war see hamdi 542 u s at 520521 plurality opinion and compliance with the law of war is the condition upon which the authority set forth in article 21 is grantediifor the court of appeals acknowledgment of that condition was no bar to hamdans trial by commission as an alternative to its holding that hamdan could not invoke the geneva conventions at all the court of appeals concluded that the conventions did not in any event apply to the armed conflict during which hamdan was captured the court accepted the executives assertions that hamdan was captured in connection with the united states war with al qaeda and that that war is distinct from the war with the taliban in afghanistan it further reasoned that the war with al qaeda evades the reach of the geneva conventions see 415 f 3d at 4142 we like judge williams disagree with the latter conclusion

the conflict with al qaeda is not according to the government a conflict to which the full protections afforded detainees under the 1949 geneva conventions apply because article 2 of those conventions which appears in all four conventions renders the full protections applicable only to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the high contracting 629 parties 6 u s t at 331859 since hamdan was captured and detained incident to the conflict with al qaeda and not the conflict with the taliban and since al qaeda unlike afghanistan is not a high contracting party—i e a signatory of the conventions the protections of those conventions are not it is argued applicable to hamdan60

we need not decide the merits of this argument because there is at least one provision of the geneva conventions that applies here even if the relevant conflict is not one between signatories61 article 3 often referred to as common article 3 because like article 2 it appears in all four geneva conventions provides that in a conflict not of an international character occurring in the territory of one of the high contracting parties each party62 to the conflict shall be bound to apply as a minimum certain provisions protecting persons taking no active part in the hostilities including 630 members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed hors de combat by    detention ibid one such provision prohibits the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples id at 3320

the court of appeals thought and the government asserts that common article 3 does not apply to hamdan because the conflict with al qaeda being international in scope does not qualify as a conflict not of an international character 415 f 3d at 41 that reasoning is erroneous the term conflict not of an international character is used here in contradistinction to a conflict between nations so much is demonstrated by the fundamental logic of the conventions provisions on its application id at 44 williams j concurring common article 2 provides that the present convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the high contracting parties 6 u s t at 3318 art 2 ¶ 1 high contracting parties signatories also must abide by all terms of the conventions visàvis one another even if one party to the conflict is a nonsignatory power and must so abide visàvis the nonsignatory if the latter accepts and applies those terms ibid art 2 ¶ 3 common article 3 by contrast affords some minimal protection falling short of full protection under the conventions to individuals associated with neither a signatory nor even a nonsignatory power who are involved in a conflict in the territory of a signatory the latter kind of conflict is distinguishable from the conflict described in common article 2 chiefly because it does not involve a clash between nations whether signatories or not in context then the phrase not of an international character bears its literal meaning see e g j bentham introduction to the principles of morals and legislation 6 296 j 631 burns  h hart eds 1970 using the term international law as a new though not inexpressive appellation meaning betwixt nation and nation defining international to include mutual transactions between sovereigns as such intl comm of red cross commentary on the additional protocols to the geneva conventions of 12 august 1949 p 1351 1987 a noninternational armed conflict is distinct from an international armed conflict because of the legal status of the entities opposing each other

although the official commentaries accompanying common article 3 indicate that an important purpose of the provision was to furnish minimal protection to rebels involved in one kind of conflict not of an international character i e a civil war see gciii commentary 3637 the commentaries also make clear that the scope of application of the article must be as wide as possible id at 3663 in fact limiting language that would have rendered common article 3 applicable especially to cases of civil war colonial conflicts or wars of religion was omitted from the final version of the article which coupled broader scope of application with a narrower range of rights than did earlier proposed iterations see id at 4243iiicommon article 3 then is applicable here and as indicated above requires that hamdan be tried by a regularly 632 constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples 6 u s t at 3320 art 3 ¶ 1d while the term regularly constituted court is not specifically defined in either common article 3 or its accompanying commentary other sources disclose its core meaning the commentary accompanying a provision of the fourth geneva convention for example defines regularly constituted tribunals to include ordinary military courts and definitely exclude all special tribunals gciv commentary 340 defining the term properly constituted in article 66 which the commentary treats as identical to regularly constituted64 see also yamashita 327 u s at 44 rutledge j dissenting describing military commission as a court specially constituted for the particular trial and one of the red cross own treatises defines regularly constituted court as used in common article 3 to mean established and organised in accordance with the laws and procedures already in force in a country intl comm of red cross 1 customary intl humanitarian law 355 2005 see also gciv commentary 340 observing that ordinary military courts will be set up in accordance with the recognized principles governing the administration of justice

the government offers only a cursory defense of hamdans military commission in light of common article 3 see brief for respondents 4950 as justice kennedy explains that defense fails because the regular military courts in our system are the courtsmartial established by congressional statutes post at 644 opinion concurring in part at a minimum a military commission can be regularly constituted by the standards of our military justice system 633 only if some practical need explains deviations from courtmartial practice post at 645 as we have explained see part vic supra no such need has been demonstrated here65ivinextricably intertwined with the question of regular constitution is the evaluation of the procedures governing the tribunal and whether they afford all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples 6 u s t at 3320 art 3 ¶ 1d like the phrase regularly constituted court this phrase is not defined in the text of the geneva conventions but it must be understood to incorporate at least the barest of those trial protections that have been recognized by customary international law many of these are described in article 75 of protocol i to the geneva conventions of 1949 adopted in 1977 protocol i although the united states declined to ratify protocol i its objections were not to article 75 thereof indeed it appears that the government regards the provisions of article 75 as an articulation of safeguards to which all persons in the hands of an enemy are entitled taft the law of armed conflict after 911 some salient features 28 yale j intl l 319 322 2003 among the rights set forth in article 75 is the right to be tried in ones presence protocol i art 754e66

634 we agree with justice kennedy that the procedures adopted to try hamdan deviate from those governing courtsmartial in ways not justified by any evident practical need post at 647 and for that reason at least fail to afford the requisite guarantees see post at 646653 we add only that as noted in part via supra various provisions of commission order no 1 dispense with the principles articulated in article 75 and indisputably part of the customary international law that an accused must absent disruptive conduct or consent be present for his trial and must be privy to the evidence against him see §§ 6b3 d67 that the 635 government has a compelling interest in denying hamdan access to certain sensitive information is not doubted cf post at 723724 thomas j dissenting but at least absent express statutory provision to the contrary information used to convict a person of a crime must be disclosed to himvh3

common article 3 obviously tolerates a great degree of flexibility in trying individuals captured during armed conflict its requirements are general ones crafted to accommodate a wide variety of legal systems but requirements they are nonetheless the commission that the president has convened to try hamdan does not meet those requirementsviiwe have assumed as we must that the allegations made in the governments charge against hamdan are true we have assumed moreover the truth of the message implicit in that charge—viz that hamdan is a dangerous individual whose beliefs if acted upon would cause great harm and even death to innocent civilians and who would act upon those beliefs if given the opportunity it bears emphasizing that hamdan does not challenge and we do not today address the governments power to detain him for the duration of active hostilities in order to prevent such harm but in undertaking to try hamdan and subject him to criminal punishment the executive is bound to comply with the rule of law that prevails in this jurisdiction

the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings

it is so ordered

the chief justice took no part in the consideration or decision of this case

636justice breyer with whom justice kennedy justice souter and justice ginsburg join concurringthe dissenters say that todays decision would sorely hamper the presidents ability to confront and defeat a new and deadly enemy post at 705 opinion of thomas j they suggest that it undermines our nations ability to prevent future attacks of the grievous sort that we have already suffered post at 724 that claim leads me to state briefly what i believe the majority sets forth both explicitly and implicitly at greater length the courts conclusion ultimately rests upon a single ground congress has not issued the executive a blank check cf hamdi v rumsfeld 542 u s 507 536 2004 plurality opinion indeed congress has denied the president the legislative authority to create military commissions of the kind at issue here nothing prevents the president from returning to congress to seek the authority he believes necessary

where as here no emergency prevents consultation with congress judicial insistence upon that consultation does not weaken our nations ability to deal with danger to the contrary that insistence strengthens the nations ability to determine—through democratic means—how best to do so the constitution places its faith in those democratic means our court today simply does the samejustice kennedy with whom justice souter justice ginsburg and justice breyer join as to parts i and ii concurring in partmilitary commission order no 1 which governs the military commission established to try petitioner salim hamdan for war crimes exceeds limits that certain statutes duly enacted by congress have placed on the presidents authority to convene military courts this is not a case then where the executive can assert some unilateral authority to fill a void left by congressional inaction it is a case where congress in the proper exercise of its powers as an independent 637 branch of government and as part of a long tradition of legislative involvement in matters of military justice has considered the subject of military tribunals and set limits on the presidents authority where a statute provides the conditions for the exercise of governmental power its requirements are the result of a deliberative and reflective process engaging both of the political branches respect for laws derived from the customary operation of the executive and legislative branches gives some assurance of stability in time of crisis the constitution is best preserved by reliance on standards tested over time and insulated from the pressures of the moment

these principles seem vindicated here for a case that may be of extraordinary importance is resolved by ordinary rules the rules of most relevance here are those pertaining to the authority of congress and the interpretation of its enactments

it seems appropriate to recite these rather fundamental points because the court refers as it should in its exposition of the case to the requirement of the geneva conventions of 1949 that military tribunals be regularly constituted ante at 632—a requirement that controls here if for no other reason because congress requires that military commissions like the ones at issue conform to the law of war 10 u s c § 821 whatever the substance and content of the term regularly constituted as interpreted in this and any later cases there seems little doubt that it relies upon the importance of standards deliberated upon and chosen in advance of crisis under a system where the single power of the executive is checked by other constitutional mechanisms all of which returns us to the point of beginning—that domestic statutes control this case if congress after due consideration deems it appropriate to change the controlling statutes in conformance with the constitution and other laws it has the power and prerogative to do so

638 i join the courts opinion save parts v and vi—d—iv to state my reasons for this reservation and to show my agreement with the remainder of the courts analysis by identifying particular deficiencies in the military commissions at issue this separate opinion seems appropriateitrial by military commission raises separationofpowers concerns of the highest order located within a single branch these courts carry the risk that offenses will be defined prosecuted and adjudicated by executive officials without independent review cf loving v united states 517 u s 748 756758 760 1996 concentration of power puts personal liberty in peril of arbitrary action by officials an incursion the constitutions threepart system is designed to avoid it is imperative then that when military tribunals are established full and proper authority exists for the presidential directive

the proper framework for assessing whether executive actions are authorized is the threepart scheme used by justice jackson in his opinion in youngstown sheet  tube co v sawyer 343 u s 579 1952 when the president acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of congress his authority is at its maximum for it includes all that he possesses in his own right plus all that congress can delegate id at 635 when the president acts in absence of either a congressional grant or denial of authority he can only rely upon his own independent powers but there is a zone of twilight in which he and congress may have concurrent authority or in which its distribution is uncertain id at 637 and when the president takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of congress his power is at its lowest ebb ibid

in this case as the court observes the president has acted in a field with a history of congressional participation and regulation ante at 593 619620 in the uniform code 639 of military justice ucmj 10 u s c § 801 et seq which congress enacted building on earlier statutes in 1950 see act of may 5 1950 ch 169 64 stat 107 and later amended see e g military justice act of 1968 82 stat 1335 congress has set forth governing principles for military courts the ucmj as a whole establishes an intricate system of military justice it authorizes courtsmartial in various forms 10 u s c §§ 816820 2000 ed and supp iii it regulates the organization and procedure of those courts e g §§ 822835 851854 it defines offenses §§ 877934 and rights for the accused e g §§ 827bc 831 844 846 855 2000 ed and it provides mechanisms for appellate review §§ 859876b 2000 ed and supp iii as explained below the statute further recognizes that special military commissions may be convened to try war crimes see infra at 641 § 821 2000 ed while these laws provide authority for certain forms of military courts they also impose limitations at least two of which control this case if the president has exceeded these limits this becomes a case of conflict between presidential and congressional action—a case within justice jacksons third category not the second or first

one limit on the presidents authority is contained in article 36 of the ucmj that section providesa pretrial trial and posttrial procedures including modes of proof for cases arising under this chapter triable in courtsmartial military commissions and other military tribunals and procedures for courts of inquiry may be prescribed by the president by regulations which shall so far as he considers practicable apply the principles of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the united states district courts but which may not be contrary to or inconsistent with this chapter
b all rules and regulations made under this article shall be uniform insofar as practicable 10 u s c § 836 2000 ed 640 in this provision the statute allows the president to implement and build on the ucmjs framework by adopting procedural regulations subject to three requirements 1 procedures for military courts must conform to districtcourt rules insofar as the president considers practicable 2 the procedures may not be contrary to or inconsistent with the provisions of the ucmj and 3 insofar as practicable all rules and regulations under § 836 must be uniform a requirement as the court points out that indicates the rules must be the same for military commissions as for courtsmartial unless such uniformity is impracticable ante at 620 622 and n 50as the court further instructs even assuming the first and second requirements of § 836 are satisfied here—a matter of some dispute see ante at 620622—the third requires us to compare the militarycommission procedures with those for courtsmartial and determine to the extent there are deviations whether greater uniformity would be practicable ante at 623625 although we can assume the presidents practicability judgments are entitled to some deference the court observes that congress choice of language in the uniformity provision of 10 u s c § 836b contrasts with the language of § 836a this difference suggests at the least a lower degree of deference for § 836b determinations ante at 623 the rules for military courts may depart from federalcourt rules whenever the president considers conformity impracticable § 836a but the statute requires procedural uniformity across different military courts insofar as uniformity is practicable § 836b not insofar as the president considers it to be so the court is right to conclude this is of relevance to our decision further as the court is also correct to conclude ante at 623624 the term practicable cannot be construed to permit deviations based on mere convenience or expedience practicable means feasible that is possible to practice or perform or capable of being put into practice done or accomplished websters 641 third new international dictionary 1780 1961 congress chosen language then is best understood to allow the selection of procedures based on logistical constraints the accommodation of witnesses the security of the proceedings and the like insofar as the pretrial trial and posttrial procedures for the military commissions at issue deviate from courtmartial practice the deviations must be explained by some such practical need

in addition to § 836 a second ucmj provision 10 u s c § 821 requires us to compare the commissions at issue to courtsmartial this provision statesthe provisions of this chapter conferring jurisdiction upon courtsmartial do not deprive military commissions provost courts or other military tribunals of concurrent jurisdiction with respect to offenders or offenses that by statute or by the law of war may be tried by military commissions provost courts or other military tribunalsin § 821 congress has addressed the possibility that special military commissions—criminal courts other than courtsmartial—may at times be convened at the same time however the presidents authority to convene military commissions is limited it extends only to offenders or offenses that by statute or by the law of war may be tried by such military commissions ibid see also ante at 593 the government does not claim to base the charges against hamdan on a statute instead it invokes the law of war that law as the court explained in ex parte quirin 317 u s 1 1942 derives from rules and precepts of the law of nations it is the body of international law governing armed conflict id at 28 if the military commission at issue is illegal under the law of war then an offender cannot be tried by the law of war before that commission

the court is correct to concentrate on one provision of the law of war that is applicable to our nations armed conflict 642 with al qaeda in afghanistan and as a result to the use of a military commission to try hamdan ante at 629633 see also 415 f 3d 33 44 cadc 2005 williams j concurring that provision is common article 3 of the four geneva conventions of 1949 it prohibits as relevant here the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples see e g article 3 of the geneva convention iii relative to the treatment of prisoners of war aug 12 1949 1955 6 u s t 3316 3318 t i a s no 3364 the provision is part of a treaty the united states has ratified and thus accepted as binding law see id at 3316 by act of congress moreover violations of common article 3 are considered war crimes punishable as federal offenses when committed by or against united states nationals and military personnel see 18 u s c § 2441 there should be no doubt then that common article 3 is part of the law of war as that term is used in § 821

the dissent by justice thomas argues that common article 3 nonetheless is irrelevant to this case because in johnson v eisentrager 339 u s 763 1950 it was said to be the obvious scheme of the 1929 geneva convention that rights of alien enemies are vindicated under it only through protests and intervention of protecting powers i e signatory states id at 789 n 14 as the court explains ante at 626628 this language from eisentrager is not controlling here even assuming the eisentrager analysis has some bearing upon the analysis of the broader 1949 conventions and that in consequence rights are vindicated under those conventions only through protests and intervention 339 u s at 789 n 14 common article 3 is nonetheless relevant to the question of authorization under § 821 common article 3 is part of the law of war that congress has directed the president to follow in establishing military 643 commissions ante at 629630 consistent with that view the eisentrager court itself considered on the merits claims that procedural irregularities under the 1929 convention deprived the military commission of jurisdiction 339 u s at 789 790

in another militarycommission case in re yamashita 327 u s 1 1946 the court likewise considered on the merits—without any caveat about remedies under the convention—a claim that an alleged violation of the 1929 convention established want of authority in the commission to proceed with the trial id at 23 24 that is the precise inquiry we are asked to perform here

assuming the president has authority to establish a special military commission to try hamdan the commission must satisfy common article 3s requirement of a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples 6 u s t at 3320 the terms of this general standard are yet to be elaborated and further defined but congress has required compliance with it by referring to the law of war in § 821 the court correctly concludes that the military commission here does not comply with this provision

common article 3s standard of a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples ibid supports at the least a uniformity principle similar to that codified in § 836b the concept of a regularly constituted court providing indispensable judicial guarantees requires consideration of the system of justice under which the commission is established though no doubt certain minimum standards are applicable see ante at 632633 1 intl comm of red cross 1 customary intl humanitarian law 355 2005 explaining that courts are regularly constituted under common article 3 if they are established and organised in accordance with the laws and procedures already in force in a country

644 the regular military courts in our system are the courtsmartial established by congressional statutes acts of congress confer on those courts the jurisdiction to try any person subject to war crimes prosecution 10 u s c § 818 as the court explains moreover while special military commissions have been convened in previous armed conflicts—a practice recognized in §821—those military commissions generally have adopted the structure and procedure of courtsmartial see e g 1 the war of the rebellion a compilation of the official records of the union and confederate armies 248 2d series 1894 civil war general order requiring that military commissions be constituted in a similar manner and their proceedings be conducted according to the same general rules as courtsmartial in order to prevent abuses which might otherwise arise w winthrop military law and precedents 835 n 81 rev 2d ed 1920 military commissions are constituted and composed and their proceedings are conducted similarly to general courtsmartial 1 u n war crimes commission law reports of trials of war criminals 116117 1947 reprint 1997 hereinafter law reports discussing postworld war ii regulations requiring that military commissions have regard for rules of procedure and evidence applicable in general courtsmartial see also ante at 617620 post at 707 n 15 thomas j dissenting today moreover § 836b— which took effect after the military trials in the world war ii cases invoked by the dissent see madsen v kinsella 343 u s 341 344345 and n 6 1952 yamashita supra at 5 quirin 317 u s at 23—codifies this presumption of uniformity at least as to pretrial trial and posttrial procedures absent more concrete statutory guidance this historical and statutory background—which suggests that some practical need must justify deviations from the courtmartial model—informs the understanding of which military courts are regularly constituted under united states law

645 in addition whether or not the possibility contemplated by the regulations here of midtrial procedural changes could by itself render a military commission impermissibly irregular ante at 633 n 65 see also military commission order no 1 § 11 aug 31 2005 app to brief for petitioner 46a72a hereinafter mco an acceptable degree of independence from the executive is necessary to render a commission regularly constituted by the standards of our nations system of justice and any suggestion of executive power to interfere with an ongoing judicial process raises concerns about the proceedings fairness again however courtsmartial provide the relevant benchmark subject to constitutional limitations see ex parte milligan 4 wall 2 1866 congress has the power and responsibility to determine the necessity for military courts and to provide the jurisdiction and procedures applicable to them the guidance congress has provided with respect to courtsmartial indicates the level of independence and procedural rigor that congress has deemed necessary at least as a general matter in the military context

at a minimum a military commission like the one at issue—a commission specially convened by the president to try specific persons without express congressional authorization—can be regularly constituted by the standards of our military justice system only if some practical need explains deviations from courtmartial practice in this regard the standard of common article 3 applied here in conformity with § 821 parallels the practicability standard of § 836b section 836 however is limited by its terms to matters properly characterized as procedural—that is pretrial trial and posttrial procedures—while common article 3 permits broader consideration of matters of structure organization and mechanisms to promote the tribunals insulation from command influence thus the combined effect of the two statutes discussed here—§§ 836 and 821—is that considerations of practicability must support departures from courtmartial 646 practice relevant concerns as noted earlier relate to logistical constraints accommodation of witnesses security of the proceedings and the like not mere expedience or convenience this determination of course must be made with due regard for the constitutional principle that congressional statutes can be controlling including the congressional direction that the law of war has a bearing on the determination

these principles provide the framework for an analysis of the specific military commission at issue hereiiin assessing the validity of hamdans military commission the precise circumstances of this case bear emphasis the allegations against hamdan are undoubtedly serious captured in afghanistan during our nations armed conflict with the taliban and al qaeda—a conflict that continues as we speak—hamdan stands accused of overt acts in furtherance of a conspiracy to commit terrorism delivering weapons and ammunition to al qaeda acquiring trucks for use by usama bin ladens bodyguards providing security services to bin laden and receiving weapons training at a terrorist camp app to pet for cert 65a67a nevertheless the circumstances of hamdans trial present no exigency requiring special speed or precluding careful consideration of evidence for roughly four years hamdan has been detained at a permanent united states military base in guantanamo bay cuba and regardless of the outcome of the criminal proceedings at issue the government claims authority to continue to detain him based on his status as an enemy combatant

against this background the court is correct to conclude that the military commission the president has convened to try hamdan is unauthorized ante at 625 631633 635 the following analysis which expands on the courts discussion explains my reasons for reaching this conclusion

647 to begin with the structure and composition of the military commission deviate from conventional courtmartial standards although these deviations raise questions about the fairness of the trial no evident practical need explains them

under the ucmj courtsmartial are organized by a convening authority—either a commanding officer the secretary of defense the secretary concerned or the president 10 u s c §§ 822824 2000 ed and supp iii the convening authority refers charges for trial manual for courtsmartial united states rule for courtsmartial 401 2005 ed hereinafter r c m and selects the courtmartial members who vote on the guilt or innocence of the accused and determine the sentence 10 u s c §§ 825d2 851852 2000 ed r c m 503a paralleling this structure under mco no 1 an appointing authority—either the secretary of defense or the secretarys designee—establishes commissions subject to the order mco no 1 § 2 approves and refers charges to be tried by those commissions § 4b2a and appoints commission members who vote on the conviction and sentence §§ 4a 13 in addition the appointing authority determines the number of commission members at least three oversees the chief prosecutor provides investigative or other resources to the defense insofar as he or she deems necessary for a full and fair trial approves or rejects plea agreements approves or disapproves communications with news media by prosecution or defense counsel a function shared by the general counsel of the department of defense and issues supplementary commission regulations subject to approval by the general counsel of the department of defense unless the appointing authority is the secretary of defense see mco no 1 §§ 4a2 5h 6a4 7a military commission instruction no 3 § 5c july 15 2005 hereinafter mci available at 648 wwwdefenselinkmilnewsaug2005d20051003mci4pdf mci no 4 § 6 § 3b3 apr 15 2004 available at www defenselinkmilnewsapr2004d20040420ins6pdf all internet materials as visited june 27 2006 and available in clerk of courts case file

against the background of these significant powers for the appointing authority which in certain respects at least conform to ordinary courtmartial standards the regulations governing the commissions at issue make several noteworthy departures at a general courtmartial—the only type authorized to impose penalties of more than one years incarceration or to adjudicate offenses against the law of war r c m 201f 10 u s c §§ 818820 2000 ed and supp iii—the presiding officer who rules on legal issues must be a military judge r c m 501a1 801a45 10 u s c § 8161 2000 ed supp iii see also r c m 201f2bii likewise requiring a military judge for certain other courtsmartial 10 u s c § 819 2000 ed and supp iii same a military judge is an officer who is a member of a state or federal bar and has been specially certified for judicial duties by the judge advocate general for the officers armed service r c m 502c 10 u s c § 826b to protect their independence military judges at general courtsmartial are assigned and directly responsible to the judge advocate general or the judge advocate generals designee r c m 502c they must be detailed to the court in accordance with applicable regulations by a person assigned as a military judge and directly responsible to the judge advocate general or the judge advocate generals designee r c m 503b see also 10 u s c § 826c see generally weiss v united states 510 u s 163 179181 1994 discussing provisions that insulate military judges from the effects of command influence and thus preserve judicial impartiality here by contrast the appointing authority selects the presiding officer mco no 1 §§ 4a1 a4 649 and that officer need only be a judge advocate that is a military lawyer § 4a4

the appointing authority moreover exercises supervisory powers that continue during trial any interlocutory question the disposition of which would effect a termination of proceedings with respect to a charge is subject to decision not by the presiding officer but by the appointing authority § 4a5e stating that the presiding officer shall certify such questions to the appointing authority other interlocutory questions may be certified to the appointing authority as the presiding officer deems appropriate ibid while in some circumstances the government may appeal certain rulings at a courtmartial—including an order or ruling that terminates the proceedings with respect to a charge or specification r c m 908a see also 10 u s c § 862a—the appeals go to a body called the court of criminal appeals not to the convening authority r c m 908 10 u s c § 862b see also r c m 1107 requiring the convening authority to approve or disapprove the findings and sentence of a courtmartial but providing for such action only after entry of sentence and restricting actions that increase penalties 10 u s c § 860 same cf § 837a barring command influence on courtmartial actions the court of criminal appeals functions as the militarys intermediate appeals court it is established by the judge advocate general for each armed service and composed of appellate military judges r c m 1203 10 u s c § 866 this is another means in which by structure and tradition the courtmartial process is insulated from those who have an interest in the outcome of the proceedings

finally in addition to these powers with respect to the presiding officer the appointing authority has greater flexibility in appointing commission members while a general courtmartial requires absent a contrary election by the accused at least five members r c m 501a1 10 u s c § 8161 2000 ed and supp iii the appointing authority 650 here is free as noted earlier to select as few as three mco no 1 § 4a2 this difference may affect the deliberative process and the prosecutions burden of persuasion

as compared to the role of the convening authority in a courtmartial the greater powers of the appointing authority here—including even the resolution of dispositive issues in the middle of the trial—raise concerns that the commissions decisionmaking may not be neutral if the differences are supported by some practical need beyond the goal of constant and ongoing supervision that need is neither apparent from the record nor established by the governments submissions

it is no answer that at the end of the day the detainee treatment act of 2005 dta 119 stat 2739 affords militarycommission defendants the opportunity for judicial review in federal court as the court is correct to observe the scope of that review is limited dta § 1005e3d id at 2743 see also ante at 573574 and the review is not automatic if the defendants sentence is under 10 years § 1005e3b 119 stat 2743 also provisions for review of legal issues after trial cannot correct for structural defects such as the role of the appointing authority that can cast doubt on the factfinding process and the presiding judges exercise of discretion during trial before militarycommission defendants may obtain judicial review furthermore they must navigate a military review process that again raises fairness concerns at the outset the appointing authority unless the appointing authority is the secretary of defense performs an administrative review of undefined scope ordering any supplementary proceedings deemed necessary mco no 1 § 6h3 after that the case is referred to a threemember review panel composed of officers selected by the secretary of defense § 6h4 mci no 9 § 4b oct 11 2005 available at wwwdefenselinkmilnewsoct2005d20051014mci9pdf though the review panel may return the case for further 651 proceedings only if a majority forms a definite and firm conviction that a material error of law occurred mco no 1 § 6h4 mci no 9 § 4c1a only one member must have experience as a judge mco no 1 § 6h4 nothing in the regulations requires that other panel members have legal training by comparison to the review of courtmartial judgments performed by such independent bodies as the judge advocate general the court of criminal appeals and the court of appeals for the armed forces 10 u s c §§ 862 864 866 867 869 the review process here lacks structural protections designed to help ensure impartiality

these structural differences between the military commissions and courtsmartial—the concentration of functions including legal decisionmaking in a single executive official the less rigorous standards for composition of the tribunal and the creation of special review procedures in place of institutions created and regulated by congress—remove safeguards that are important to the fairness of the proceedings and the independence of the court congress has prescribed these guarantees for courtsmartial and no evident practical need explains the departures here for these reasons the commission cannot be considered regularly constituted under united states law and thus does not satisfy congress requirement that military commissions conform to the law of war

apart from these structural issues moreover the basic procedures for the commissions deviate from procedures for courtsmartial in violation of § 836b as the court explains ante at 614615 623 the mco abandons the detailed military rules of evidence which are modeled on the federal rules of evidence in conformity with § 836as requirement of presumptive compliance with districtcourt rules

instead the order imposes just one evidentiary rule evidence shall be admitted if    the evidence would have probative value to a reasonable person mco no 1 § 6d1 although it is true some military commissions applied 652 an amorphous evidence standard in the past see e g 1 law reports 117118 discussing world war ii militarycommission orders exec order no 9185 7 fed reg 5103 1942 order convening military commission to try nazi saboteurs the evidentiary rules for those commissions were adopted before congress enacted the uniformity requirement of 10 u s c § 836b as part of the ucmj see act of may 5 1950 ch 169 64 stat 107 120 149 and while some flexibility may be necessary to permit trial of battlefield captives like hamdan military statutes and rules already provide for introduction of deposition testimony for absent witnesses 10 u s c § 849d r c m 702 and use of classified information military rule evid 505 indeed the depositiontestimony provision specifically mentions military commissions and thus is one of the provisions the government concedes must be followed by the commission at issue see ante at 621 and n 49 that provision authorizes admission of deposition testimony only if the witness is absent for specified reasons § 849d—a requirement that makes no sense if military commissions may consider all probative evidence whether or not this conflict renders the rules at issue contrary to or inconsistent with the ucmj under § 836a it creates a uniformity problem under § 836b

the rule here could permit admission of multiple hearsay and other forms of evidence generally prohibited on grounds of unreliability indeed the commission regulations specifically contemplate admission of unsworn written statements mco no 1 § 6d3 and they make no provision for exclusion of coerced declarations save those established to have been made as a result of torture mci no 10 § 3a mar 24 2006 available at wwwdefenselinkmil newsmar2006d20060327mci10pdf cf military rule evid 304c3 generally barring use of statements obtained through the use of coercion unlawful influence or unlawful inducement 10 u s c § 831d same besides even if 653653 evidence is deemed nonprobative by the presiding officer at hamdans trial the militarycommission members still may view it in another departure from courtmartial practice the militarycommission members may object to the presiding officers evidence rulings and determine themselves by majority vote whether to admit the evidence mco no 1 § 6d1 cf r c m 801a4 e1 providing that the military judge at a courtmartial determines all questions of law

as the court explains the government has made no demonstration of practical need for these special rules and procedures either in this particular case or as to the military commissions in general ante at 622624 nor is any such need selfevident for all the governments regulations and submissions reveal it would be feasible for most if not all of the conventional military evidence rules and procedures to be followed

in sum as presently structured hamdans military commission exceeds the bounds congress has placed on the presidents authority in articles 36 and 21 of the ucmj 10 u s c §§ 836 821 because congress has prescribed these limits congress can change them requiring a new analysis consistent with the constitution and other governing laws at this time however we must apply the standards congress has provided by those standards the military commission is deficientiiiin light of the conclusion that the military commission here is unauthorized under the ucmj i see no need to consider several further issues addressed in the plurality opinion by justice stevens and the dissent by justice thomas

first i would not decide whether common article 3s standard—a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples 6 u s t at 3320 ¶ 1d—necessarily 654 requires that the accused have the right to be present at all stages of a criminal trial as justice stevens explains mco no 1 authorizes exclusion of the accused from the proceedings if the presiding officer determines that among other things protection of classified information so requires see §§ 6b3 d5 ante at 613614 justice stevens observes that these regulations create the possibility of a conviction and sentence based on evidence hamdan has not seen or heard—a possibility the plurality is correct to consider troubling ante at 634635 and n 67 collecting cases see also in re oliver 333 u s 257 277 1948 finding no support for sustaining petitioners conviction of contempt of court upon testimony given in petitioners absence

as the dissent by justice thomas points out however the regulations bar the presiding officer from admitting secret evidence if doing so would deprive the accused of a full and fair trial mco no 1 § 6d5b see also post at 722723 this fairness determination moreover is unambiguously subject to judicial review under the dta see § 1005e3di 119 stat 2743 allowing review of compliance with the standards and procedures in mco no 1 the evidentiary proceedings at hamdans trial have yet to commence and it remains to be seen whether he will suffer any prejudicial exclusion

there should be reluctance furthermore to reach unnecessarily the question whether as the plurality seems to conclude ante at 633 article 75 of protocol i to the geneva conventions is binding law notwithstanding the earlier decision by our government not to accede to the protocol for all these reasons and without detracting from the importance of the right of presence i would rely on other deficiencies noted here and in the opinion by the court—deficiencies that relate to the structure and procedure of the commission and that inevitably will affect the proceedings— as the basis for finding the military commissions lack authorization 655 under 10 u s c § 836 and fail to be regularly constituted under common article 3 and § 821

i likewise see no need to address the validity of the conspiracy charge against hamdan—an issue addressed at length in part v of justice stevens opinion and in part iic of justice thomas dissent see ante at 600613 post at 689704 in light of the conclusion that the military commissions at issue are unauthorized congress may choose to provide further guidance in this area congress not the court is the branch in the better position to undertake the sensitive task of establishing a principle not inconsistent with the national interest or with international justice banco nacional de cuba v sabbatino 376 u s 398 428 1964

finally for the same reason i express no view on the merits of other limitations on military commissions described as elements of the common law of war in part v of justice stevens opinion see ante at 595600 611613 post at 683689 thomas j dissenting

with these observations i join the courts opinion with the exception of parts v and vidivjustice scalia with whom justice thomas and justice alito join dissentingon december 30 2005 congress enacted the detainee treatment act dta it unambiguously provides that as of that date no court justice or judge shall have jurisdiction to consider the habeas application of a guantanamo bay detainee notwithstanding this plain directive the court today concludes that on what it calls the statutes most natural reading every court justice or judge before whom such a habeas application was pending on december 30 has jurisdiction to hear consider and render judgment on it this conclusion is patently erroneous and even if it were not the jurisdiction supposedly retained should in an exercise of sound equitable discretion not be exercised

656iah3

the dta provides no court justice or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the department of defense at guantanamo bay cuba § 1005e1 119 stat 2742 internal division omitted this provision took effect on the date of the enactment of this act § 1005h1 id at 2743 which was december 30 2005 as of that date then no court had jurisdiction to hear or consider the merits of petitioners habeas application this repeal of jurisdiction is simply not ambiguous as between pending and future cases it prohibits any exercise of jurisdiction and it became effective as to all cases last december 30 it is also perfectly clear that the phrase no court justice or judge includes this court and its members and that by exercising our appellate jurisdiction in this case we are hearing or considering    an application for a writ of habeas corpus

an ancient and unbroken line of authority attests that statutes ousting jurisdiction unambiguously apply to cases pending at their effective date for example in bruner v united states 343 u s 112 1952 we granted certiorari to consider whether the tucker acts provision denying district court jurisdiction over suits by officers of the united states barred a suit by an employee of the united states after we granted certiorari congress amended the tucker act by adding suits by employees to the provision barring jurisdiction over suits by officers id at 114 this statute narrowing the jurisdiction of the district courts became effective while the case was pending before us ibid and made no explicit reference to pending cases because the statute did not reserve jurisdiction over pending cases id at 115 we held that it clearly ousted jurisdiction over them summarizing centuries of practice we said this 657 rule—that when a law conferring jurisdiction is repealed without any reservation as to pending cases all cases fall with the law—has been adhered to consistently by this court id at 116117 see also landgraf v usi film products 511 u s 244 274 1994 opinion for the court by stevens j we have regularly applied intervening statutes conferring or ousting jurisdiction whether or not jurisdiction lay when the underlying conduct occurred or when the suit was filed

this venerable rule that statutes ousting jurisdiction terminate jurisdiction in pending cases is not as todays opinion for the court would have it a judgemade presumption against jurisdiction ante at 576 that we have invented to resolve an ambiguity in the statutes it is simple recognition of the reality that the plain import of a statute repealing jurisdiction is to eliminate the power to consider and render judgment—in an already pending case no less than in a case yet to be filedwithout jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any cause jurisdiction is power to declare the law and when it ceases to exist the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause and this is not less clear upon authority than upon principle ex parte mccardle 7 wall 506 514 1869 emphasis added


















































to alter this plain meaning our cases have required an explicit reservation of pending cases in the jurisdictionrepealing statute for example bruner as mentioned looked to whether congress made any reservation as to pending cases 343 u s at 116117 see also id at 115 congress made no provision for cases pending at the effective date of the act withdrawing jurisdiction and for this reason courts of appeals ordered pending cases terminated for want of jurisdiction likewise in hallowell v commons 239 u s 506 1916 justice holmes relied on the fact 658 that the jurisdictionousting provision made no exception for pending litigation but purported to be universal id at 508 and in insurance co v ritchie 5 wall 541 1867 we again relied on the fact that the jurisdictional repeal was made without any saving of such causes as that before us id at 544 as in bruner hallowell and ritchie the dtas directive that no court justice or judge shall have jurisdiction § 1005e1 119 stat 2742 is made without any reservation as to pending cases and purports to be universal what we stated in an earlier case remains true here when if it had been the intention to confine the operation of the jurisdictional repeal    to cases not pending it would have been so easy to have said so we must presume that congress meant the language employed should have its usual and ordinary signification and that the old law should be unconditionally repealed railroad co v grant 98 u s 398 403 1879

the court claims that i read too much into the bruner line of cases ante at 577 n 7 and that the bruner rule has never been an inflexible trump ante at 584 but the court sorely misdescribes bruner—as if it were a kind of earlyday lindh v murphy 521 u s 320 1997 resolving statutory ambiguity by oblique negative inference on the contrary as described above bruner stated its holding as an unqualified rule which has been adhered to consistently by this court 343 u s at 116117 though bruner referred to an express saving clause elsewhere in the statute id at 115 n 7 it disavowed any reliance on such oblique indicators to vary the plain meaning quoting ritchie at length it is quite possible that this effect of the jurisdictionstripping statute was not contemplated by congress    but when terms are unambiguous we may not speculate on probabilities of intention 343 u s at 116 quoting 5 wall at 544545

the court also attempts to evade the bruner line of cases by asserting that the presumption of application to pending 659 cases that these cases have applied is more accurately viewed as the nonapplication of another presumption—viz the presumption against retroactivity—in certain limited circumstances ante at 576 i have already explained that what the court calls a presumption is simply the acknowledgment of the unambiguous meaning of such provisions but even taking it to be what the court says the effect upon the present case would be the same prospective applications of a statute are effective upon the statutes effective date that is what an effectivedate provision like § 1005h1 means1 shall take effect upon enactment is presumed to mean shall have prospective effect upon enactment and that presumption is too strong to be overcome by any negative inference drawn from other provisions of the statute landgraf supra at 288 scalia j concurring in judgments the courts nonapplication of    the presumption against retroactivity to § 1005e1 is thus just another way of stating that the statute takes immediate effect in pending cases

though the court resists the bruner rule it cannot cite a single case in the history of angloamerican law before 660 today in which a jurisdictionstripping provision was denied immediate effect in pending cases absent an explicit statutory reservation by contrast the cases granting such immediate effect are legion and they repeatedly rely on the plain language of the jurisdictional repeal as an inflexible trump ante at 584 by requiring an express reservation to save pending cases see e g bruner supra at 115 kline v burke constr co 260 u s 226 234 1922 hallowell 239 u s at 508 gwin v united states 184 u s 669 675 1902 gurnee v patrick county 137 u s 141 144 1890 sherman v grinnell 123 u s 679 680 1887 railroad co v grant supra at 403 assessors v osbornes 9 wall 567 575 1870 ex parte mccardle 7 wall at 514 ritchie supra at 544 norris v crocker 13 how 429 440 1852 yeaton v united states 5 cranch 281 1809 marshall c j discussed in gwin supra at 675 king v justices of the peace of london 3 burr 1456 1457 97 eng rep 924 925 k b 1764 cf national exchange bank of baltimore v peters 144 u s 570 572 1892bdisregarding the plain meaning of § 1005e1 and the requirement of explicit exception set forth in the foregoing cases the court instead favors a negative inference    from the exclusion of language from one statutory provision that is included in other provisions of the same statute ante at 578 specifically it appeals to the fact that § 1005e2 and e3 are explicitly made applicable to pending cases by § 1005h2 a negative inference of the sort the court relies upon might clarify the meaning of an ambiguous provision but since the meaning of § 1005e1 is entirely clear the omitted language in that context would have been redundant

even if § 1005e1 were at all ambiguous in its application to pending cases the negative inference from § 1005h2 touted by the court would have no force the numerous 661 cases in the bruner line would at least create a powerful default presumption against jurisdiction ante at 576 the negative inference urged by the court would be a particularly awkward and indirect way of rebutting such a longstanding and consistent practice this is especially true since the negative inference that might be drawn from § 1005h2s specification that certain provisions shall apply to pending cases is matched by a negative inference in the opposite direction that might be drawn from § 1005b2 which provides that certain provisions shall not apply to pending cases

the courts reliance on our opinion in lindh v murphy 521 u s 320 1997 is utterly misplaced lindh involved two provisions of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 aedpa a set of amendments to chapter 153 of the federal habeas statute that redefined the scope of collateral review by federal habeas courts and a provision creating a new chapter 154 in the habeas statute specially to govern federal collateral review of state capital cases see 521 u s at 326327 the latter provision explicitly rendered the new chapter 154 applicable to cases pending at the time of aedpas enactment the former made no specific reference to pending cases id at 327 in lindh we drew a negative inference from chapter 154s explicit reference to pending cases to conclude that the chapter 153 amendments did not apply in pending cases it was essential to our reasoning however that both provisions appeared to be identically difficult to classify under our retroactivity cases first we noted that after landgraf there was reason for congress to suppose that an explicit statement was required to render the amendments to chapter 154 applicable in pending cases because the new chapter 154 will have substantive as well as purely procedural effects 521 u s at 327 the next step—and the critical step—in our reasoning was that congress had identical reason to suppose that an explicit statement would be required to apply the chapter 153 662 amendments to pending cases but did not provide it id at 329 the negative inference of lindh rested on the fact that nothing    but a different intent explained the different treatment ibid

here by contrast there is ample reason for the different treatment the exclusivereview provisions of the dta unlike both § 1005e1 and the aedpa amendments in lindh confer new jurisdiction in the d c circuit where there was none before for better or for worse our recent cases have contrasted jurisdictioncreating provisions with jurisdictionousting provisions retaining the venerable rule that the latter are not retroactive even when applied in pending cases but strongly indicating that the former are typically retroactive for example we stated in hughes aircraft co v united states ex rel schumer 520 u s 939 951 1997 that a statute that creates jurisdiction where none previously existed is as much subject to our presumption against retroactivity as any other see also republic of austria v altmann 541 u s 677 695 2004 opinion for the court by stevens j id at 722 kennedy j dissenting the court gives our retroactivity jurisprudence a dazzling clarity in asserting that subsections e2 and e3 confer jurisdiction in a manner that cannot conceivably give rise to retroactivity questions under our precedents2 ante at 663 582 this statement rises to the level of sarcasm when one considers its authors description of the governing test of our retroactivity jurisprudencethe conclusion that a particular rule operates retroactively comes at the end of a process of judgment concerning the nature and extent of the change in the law and the degree of connection between the operation of the new rule and a relevant past event any test of retroactivity will leave room for disagreement in hard cases and is unlikely to classify the enormous variety of legal changes with perfect philosophical clarity however retroactivity is a matter on which judges tend to have sound    instincts    and familiar considerations of fair notice reasonable reliance and settled expectations offer sound guidance landgraf 511 u s at 270 opinion for the court by stevens jthe only familiar consideration reasonable reliance and settled expectation i am aware of pertaining to the present 664 case is the rule of bruner—applicable to § 1005e1 but not to § 1005e2 and e3—which the court stubbornly disregards it is utterly beyond question that § 1005e2s and 3s application to pending cases without explicit specification was not as clear as § 1005e1s that is alone enough to explain the difference in treatment

another obvious reason for the specification was to stave off any suspension clause problems raised by the immediately effective ouster of jurisdiction brought about by subsection e1 that is to say specification of the immediate effectiveness of subsections e2 and e3 which unlike subsection e1 would not fall within the bruner rule and would not automatically be deemed applicable in pending cases could reasonably have been thought essential to be sure of replacing the habeas jurisdiction that subsection e1 eliminated in pending cases with an adequate substitute see infra at 670672

these considerations by no means prove that an explicit statement would be required to render subsections e2 and e3 applicable in pending cases but they surely gave congress ample reason to doubt that their application in pending cases would unfold as naturally as the court glibly assumes in any event even if it were true that subsections e2 and e3 confer jurisdiction in a manner that cannot conceivably give rise to retroactivity questions ante at 582 this would merely establish that subsection h2s reference to pending cases was wholly superfluous when applied to subsections e2 and e3 just as it would have been for subsection e1 lindhs negative inference makes sense only when congress would have perceived the wisdom of being explicit with respect to the immediate application of both of two statutory provisions 521 u s at 328 but chose to be explicit only for one of them—not when it would have perceived no need to be explicit for both but enacted a redundancy only for one

665 in short it is simply untrue that congress should have been just as concerned about specifying the application of § 1005e1 to pending cases ante at 578 quoting lindh supra at 329 in fact the negativeinference approach of lindh is particularly inappropriate in this case because the negative inference from § 1005h2 would tend to defeat the purpose of the very provisions that are explicitly rendered applicable in pending cases § 1005e2 and 3 those provisions purport to vest exclusive jurisdiction in the d c circuit to consider the claims raised by petitioners here see infra at 670672 by drawing a negative inference à la lindh the court supplants this exclusivereview mechanism with a dualreview mechanism for petitioners who were expeditious enough to file applications challenging the csrts or military commissions before december 30 2005 whatever the force of lindhs negative inference in other cases it surely should not apply here to defeat the purpose of the very provision from which the negative inference is drawncworst of all is the courts reliance on the legislative history of the dta to buttress its implausible reading of § 1005e1 we have repeatedly held that such reliance is impermissible where as here the statutory language is unambiguous but the court nevertheless relies both on floor statements from the senate and quite heavily on the drafting history of the dta to begin with floor statements the court urges that some statements made by senators preceding passage of the act lend further support to the courts interpretation citing excerpts from the floor debate that support its view ante at 580 n 10 the court immediately goes on to discount numerous floor statements by the dtas sponsors that flatly contradict its view because those statements appear to have been inserted into the congressional record after the senate debate ibid of course this observation even if true makes no difference 666 unless one indulges the fantasy that senate floor speeches are attended like the philippics of demosthenes by throngs of eager listeners instead of being delivered like demosthenes practice sessions on the beach alone into a vast emptiness whether the floor statements are spoken where no senator hears or written where no senator reads they represent at most the views of a single senator in any event the court greatly exaggerates the onesidedness of the portions of the floor debate that clearly occurred before the dtas enactment some of the statements of senator graham a sponsor of the bill only make sense on the assumption that pending cases are covered3 and at least one opponent of the dta unmistakably expressed his understanding that it would terminate our jurisdiction in this very case4 of course in its discussion of legislative history the court wholly ignores the presidents signing statement which explicitly set forth his understanding that the dta ousted jurisdiction over pending cases5

667 but selectivity is not the greatest vice in the courts use of floor statements to resolve todays case these statements were made when members of congress were fully aware that our continuing jurisdiction over this very case was at issue the question was divisive and floor statements made on both sides were undoubtedly opportunistic and crafted solely for use in the briefs in this very litigation see e g 151 cong rec s14257s14258 dec 21 2005 statement of sen levin arguing against a reading that would strip the federal courts of jurisdiction to consider pending cases including the hamdan case now pending in the supreme court and urging that lindh requires the same negative inference that the court indulges today emphasis added the courts reliance on such statements cannot avoid the appearance of similar opportunism in a virtually identical context the author of todays opinion has written for the court that the legislative history discloses some frankly partisan statements about the meaning of the final effective date language but those statements cannot plausibly be read as reflecting any general agreement landgraf 511 u s at 262 opinion for the court by stevens j likewise the handful of floor statements that the court treats as authoritative do not reflect any general agreement they reflect the nowcommon tactic—which the court once again rewards—of pursuing through floorspeech ipse dixit what could not be achieved through the constitutionally prescribed method of putting language into a bill that a majority of both houses vote for and the president signs

with regard to the floor statements at least the court shows some semblance of seemly shame tucking away its 668 reference to them in a halfhearted footnote not so for its reliance on the dtas drafting history which is displayed prominently see ante at 579580 i have explained elsewhere that such drafting history is no more legitimate or reliable an indicator of the objective meaning of a statute than any other form of legislative history this case presents a textbook example of its unreliability the court ante at 579 trumpets the fact that a bill considered in the senate included redundant language not included in the dta as passed reconfirming that the abolition of habeas jurisdiction shall apply to any application or other action that is pending on or after the date of the enactment of this act 151 cong rec s12655 nov 10 2005 but this earlier version of the bill also differed from the dta in other material respects most notably it provided for postdecision review by the d c circuit only of the decisions of csrts not military commissions ibid and it limited that review to whether the status determination    was consistent with the procedures and standards specified by the secretary of defense ibid not whether the use of such standards and procedures   is consistent with the constitution and laws of the united states dta § 1005e2cii 119 stat 2742 to say that what moved senators to reject this earlier bill was the action that is pending provision surpasses the intuitive powers of even this courts greatest justices6 and to think that the house and the president also had this rejection firmly in mind is absurd as always—but especially in the context of strident partisan legislative conflict of the sort that characterized enactment of this legislation—the language of the statute that was actually passed by both houses of congress and signed by the president is our only authoritative and only reliable guidepost

669da final but powerful indication of the fact that the court has made a mess of this statute is the nature of the consequences that ensue though this case concerns a habeas application challenging a trial by military commission dta § 1005e1 strips the courts of jurisdiction to hear or consider any application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the department of defense at guantanamo bay cuba the vast majority of pending petitions no doubt do not relate to military commissions at all but to more commonly challenged aspects of detention such as the terms and conditions of confinement see rasul v bush 542 u s 466 498 2004 scalia j dissenting the solicitor general represents that habeas petitions have been filed on behalf of a purported 600 guantanamo bay detainees including one that seeks relief on behalf of every guantanamo detainee who has not already filed an action respondents motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction 20 n 10 hereinafter motion to dismiss the courts interpretation transforms a provision abolishing jurisdiction over all guantanamorelated habeas petitions into a provision that retains jurisdiction over cases sufficiently numerous to keep the courts busy for years to comeiibecause i would hold that § 1005e1 unambiguously terminates the jurisdiction of all courts to hear or consider pending habeas applications i must confront petitioners arguments that the provision so interpreted violates the suspension clause this claim is easily dispatched we stated in johnson v eisentrager 339 u s 763 768 1950

we are cited to no instance where a court in this or any other country where the writ is known has issued it on behalf of an alien enemy who at no relevant time and in no stage of his captivity has been within its territorial jurisdiction nothing in the text of the constitution 670 extends such a right nor does anything in our statutes
notwithstanding the illconsidered dicta in the courts opinion in rasul 542 u s at 480481 it is clear that guantanamo bay cuba is outside the sovereign territorial jurisdiction of the united states see id at 500505 scalia j dissenting petitioner an enemy alien detained abroad has no rights under the suspension clause

but even if petitioner were fully protected by the clause the dta would create no suspension problem this court has repeatedly acknowledged that the substitution of a collateral remedy which is neither inadequate nor ineffective to test the legality of a persons detention does not constitute a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus swain v pressley 430 u s 372 381 1977 see also ins v st cyr 533 u s 289 314 n 38 2001 congress could without raising any constitutional questions provide an adequate substitute through the courts of appeals

petitioner has made no showing that the postdecision exclusive review by the d c circuit provided in § 1005e3 is inadequate to test the legality of his trial by military commission his principal argument is that the exclusivereview provisions are inadequate because they foreclose review of the claims he raises here though petitioners brief does not parse the statutory language his argument evidently rests on an erroneously narrow reading of dta § 1005e3dii 119 stat 2743 that provision grants the d c circuit authority to review to the extent the constitution and laws of the united states are applicable whether the use of such standards and procedures to reach the final decision is consistent with the constitution and laws of the united states in the quoted text the phrase such standards and procedures refers to the standards and procedures specified in the military order referred to in subparagraph a namely military commission order no 1 dated august 31 2005 or any successor military order dta 671 § 1005e3di e3a ibid this military commission order order no 1 is the department of defenses fundamental implementing order for the presidents order authorizing trials by military commission order no 1 establishes commissions § 2 delineates their jurisdiction § 3 provides for their officers § 4a provides for their prosecution and defense counsel § 4b c lays out all their procedures both pretrial and trial § 5ap § 6ag and provides for posttrial military review through the secretary of defense and the president § 6h in short the standards and procedures specified in order no 1 include every aspect of the military commissions including the fact of their existence and every respect in which they differ from courtsmartial petitioners claims that the president lacks legal authority to try him before a military commission constitute claims that the use of such standards and procedures as specified in order no 1 is inconsistent with the constitution and laws of the united states dta § 1005e3dii 119 stat 2743 the d c circuit thus retains jurisdiction to consider these claims on postdecision review and the government does not dispute that the dta leaves unaffected our certiorari jurisdiction under 28 u s c § 12541 to review the d c circuits decisions motion to dismiss 16 n 8 thus the dta merely defers our jurisdiction to consider petitioners claims it does not eliminate that jurisdiction it constitutes neither an inadequate nor an ineffective substitute for petitioners pending habeas application7

672 though it does not squarely address the issue the court hints ominously that the governments preferred reading would raise grave questions about congress authority to impinge upon this courts appellate jurisdiction particularly in habeas cases ante at 575 citing ex parte yerger 8 wall 85 1869 felker v turpin 518 u s 651 1996 durousseau v united states 6 cranch 307 1810 united states v klein 13 wall 128 1872 and ex parte mccardle 7 wall 506 it is not clear how there could be any such lurking questions in light of the aptly named exceptions clause of article iii § 2 which in making our appellate jurisdiction subject to such exceptions and under such regulations as the congress shall make explicitly permits exactly what congress has done here but any doubt our prior cases might have created on this score is surely chimerical in this case as just noted the exclusivereview provisions provide a substitute for habeas review adequate to satisfy the suspension clause which forbids the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus a fortiori they provide a substitute adequate to satisfy any implied substantive limitations whether real or imaginary upon the exceptions clause which authorizes such exceptions as § 1005e1iiieven if congress had not clearly and constitutionally eliminated jurisdiction over this case neither this court nor the lower courts ought to exercise it traditionally equitable principles govern both the exercise of habeas jurisdiction and the granting of the injunctive relief sought by petitioner see schlesinger v councilman 420 u s 738 754 1975 673 weinberger v romerobarcelo 456 u s 305 311 1982 in light of congresss provision of an alternate avenue for petitioners claims in § 1005e3 those equitable principles counsel that we abstain from exercising jurisdiction in this case

in requesting abstention the government relies principally on councilman in which we abstained from considering a servicemans claim that his charge for marijuana possession was not sufficiently serviceconnected to trigger the subjectmatter jurisdiction of the military courtsmartial see 420 u s at 740 758 admittedly councilman does not squarely control petitioners case but it provides the closest analogue in our jurisprudence as the court describes ante at 586 councilman identified two considerations of comity that together favored abstention pending completion of ongoing courtmartial proceedings against service personnel but the court errs in finding these considerations inapplicable to this case both of them and a third consideration not emphasized in councilman all cut in favor of abstention here

first the court observes that councilman rested in part on the fact that military discipline and therefore the efficient operation of the armed forces are best served if the military justice system acts without regular interference from civilian courts and concludes that hamdan is not a member of our nations armed forces so concerns about military discipline do not apply ante at 586 587 this is true enough but for some reason the court fails to make any inquiry into whether military commission trials might involve other military necessities or unique military exigencies 420 u s at 757 comparable in gravity to those at stake in councilman to put this in context the charge against the respondent in councilman was the offbase possession and sale of marijuana while he was stationed in fort sill oklahoma see id at 739740 the charge against the petitioner here is joining and actively abetting the murderous conspiracy that slaughtered thousands of innocent american 674 civilians without warning on september 11 2001 while councilman held that the prosecution of the former charge involved military necessities counseling against our interference the court does not even ponder the same question for the latter charge

the reason for the courts blinkered study of this question ante at 584 is not hard to fathom the principal opinion on the merits makes clear that it does not believe that the trials by military commission involve any military necessity at all the charges shortcomings    are indicative of a broader inability on the executives part here to satisfy the most basic precondition    for establishment of military commissions military necessity ante at 612 this is quite at odds with the views on this subject expressed by our political branches because of military necessity a joint session of congress authorized the president to use all necessary and appropriate force including military commissions against those nations organizations or persons such as petitioner he determines planned authorized committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on september 11 2001 authorization for use of military force § 2a 115 stat 224 note following 50 u s c § 1541 2000 ed supp iii in keeping with this authority the president has determined that to protect the united states and its citizens and for the effective conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist attacks it is necessary for individuals subject to this order    to be detained and when tried to be tried for violations of the laws of war and other applicable laws by military tribunals military order of nov 13 2001 3 cfr 2001 comp § 1e p 918 2002 hereinafter military order it is not clear where the court derives the authority—or the audacity—to contradict this determination if military necessities relating to duty and discipline required abstention in councilman supra at 757 military necessities relating to the disabling deterrence and punishment 675 of the massmurdering terrorists of september 11 require abstention all the more here

the court further seeks to distinguish councilman on the ground that the tribunal convened to try hamdan is not part of the integrated system of military courts complete with independent review panels that congress has established ante at 587 to be sure councilman emphasized that congress created an integrated system of military courts and review procedures a critical element of which is the court of military appeals consisting of civilian judges completely removed from all military influence or persuasion who would gain over time thorough familiarity with military problems 420 u s at 758 internal quotation marks and footnote omitted the court contrasts this integrated system insulated from military influence with the review scheme established by order no 1 which provides that appeal of a review panels decision may be had only to the secretary himself § 6h5 and then finally to the president § 6h6 ante at 587

even if we were to accept the courts extraordinary assumption that the president lacks the structural insulation from military influence that characterizes the court of appeals for the armed forces ante at 5875888 the courts description of the review scheme here is anachronistic as of december 30 2005 the final review of decisions by military commissions is now conducted by the d c circuit pursuant to § 1005e3 of the dta and by this court under 28 u s c § 12541 this provision for review by article iii courts creates if anything a review scheme more insulated 676 from executive control than that in councilman9 at the time we decided councilman congress had not conferred on any article iii court jurisdiction directly to review courtmartial determinations 420 u s at 746 the final arbiter of direct appeals was the court of military appeals now the court of appeals for the armed forces an article i court whose members possessed neither life tenure nor salary protection nor the constitutional protection from removal provided to federal judges in article iii § 1 see 10 u s c § 867a2 1970 ed

moreover a third consideration counsels strongly in favor of abstention in this case councilman reasoned that the considerations of comity the necessity of respect for coordinate judicial systems that motivated our decision in younger v harris 401 u s 37 1971 were inapplicable to courtsmartial because the peculiar demands of federalism are not implicated 420 u s at 756 757 though military commissions likewise do not implicate the peculiar demands of federalism considerations of interbranch comity 677 at the federal level weigh heavily against our exercise of equity jurisdiction in this case here apparently for the first time in history see motion to dismiss 6 a district court enjoined ongoing military commission proceedings which had been deemed necessary by the president to protect the united states and its citizens and for the effective conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist attacks military order § 1e such an order brings the judicial branch into direct conflict with the executive in an area where the executives competence is maximal and ours is virtually nonexistent we should exercise our equitable discretion to avoid such conflict instead the court rushes headlong to meet it elsewhere we have deferred exercising habeas jurisdiction until state courts have the first opportunity to review a petitioners claim merely to reduce friction between the state and federal court systems osullivan v boerckel 526 u s 838 844 845 1999 the friction created today between this court and the executive branch is many times more serious

in the face of such concerns the court relies heavily on ex parte quirin 317 u s 1 1942 far from abstaining pending the conclusion of military proceedings which were ongoing in quirin we convened a special term to hear the case and expedited our review ante at 588 it is likely that the government in quirin unlike here preferred a hasty resolution of the case in this court so that it could swiftly execute the sentences imposed see hamdi v rumsfeld 542 u s 507 569 2004 scalia j dissenting but the courts reliance on quirin suffers from a more fundamental defect once again it ignores the dta which creates an avenue for the consideration of petitioners claims that did not exist at the time of quirin collateral application for habeas review was the only vehicle available and there was no compelling reason to postpone consideration of the quirin application until the termination of military proceedings because the only cognizable claims presented were general 678 challenges to the authority of the commissions that would not be affected by the specific proceedings see supra at 662663 n 2 in the dta by contrast congress has expanded the scope of article iii review and has channeled it exclusively through a single postverdict appeal to article iii courts because congress has created a novel unitary scheme of article iii review of military commissions that was absent in 1942 quirin is no longer governing precedent

i would abstain from exercising our equity jurisdiction as the government requests

  

for the foregoing reasons i dissentjustice thomas with whom justice scalia joins and with whom justice alito joins in all but parts i iic1 and iiib2 dissentingfor the reasons set forth in justice scalias dissent it is clear that this court lacks jurisdiction to entertain petitioners claims see ante at 655669 the court having concluded otherwise it is appropriate to respond to the courts resolution of the merits of petitioners claims because its opinion openly flouts our wellestablished duty to respect the executives judgment in matters of military operations and foreign affairs the pluralitys evident belief that it is qualified to pass on the military necessity ante at 612 of the commander in chiefs decision to employ a particular form of force against our enemies is so antithetical to our constitutional structure that it simply cannot go unanswered i respectfully dissentiour review of petitioners claims arises in the context of the presidents wartime exercise of his commander in chief authority in conjunction with the complete support of congress accordingly it is important to take measure of the 679 respective roles the constitution assigns to the three branches of our government in the conduct of war

as i explained in hamdi v rumsfeld 542 u s 507 2004 the structural advantages attendant to the executive branch—namely the decisiveness activity secrecy and dispatch that flow from the executives unity id at 581 dissenting opinion quoting the federalist no 70 p 472 j cooke ed 1961 a hamilton—led the founders to conclude that the president has primary responsibility—along with the necessary power—to protect the national security and to conduct the nations foreign relations 542 u s at 580 consistent with this conclusion the constitution vests in the president the executive power art ii § 1 provides that he shall be commander in chief of the armed forces § 2 and places in him the power to recognize foreign governments § 3 this court has observed that these provisions confer upon the president broad constitutional authority to protect the nations security in the manner he deems fit see e g prize cases 2 black 635 668 1863 if a war be made by invasion of a foreign nation the president is not only authorized but bound to resist force by force    without waiting for any special legislative authority fleming v page 9 how 603 615 1850 acknowledging that the president has the authority to employ the nations armed forces in the manner he may deem most effectual to harass and conquer and subdue the enemy

congress to be sure has a substantial and essential role in both foreign affairs and national security but congress cannot anticipate and legislate with regard to every possible action the president may find it necessary to take or every possible situation in which he might act and such failure of congress    does not especially    in the areas of foreign policy and national security imply congressional disapproval of action taken by the executive dames  moore v regan 453 u s 654 678 1981 quoting haig v agee 453 u s 280 291 1981 rather in these domains 680 the fact that congress has provided the president with broad authorities does not imply—and the judicial branch should not infer—that congress intended to deprive him of particular powers not specifically enumerated see dames  moore 453 u s at 678 the enactment of legislation closely related to the question of the presidents authority in a particular case which evinces legislative intent to accord the president broad discretion may be considered to invite measures on independent presidential responsibility internal quotation marks omitted

when the president acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization from congress his actions are supported by the strongest of presumptions and the widest latitude of judicial interpretation and the burden of persuasion    rests heavily upon any who might attack it id at 668 quoting youngstown sheet  tube co v sawyer 343 u s 579 637 1952 jackson j concurring accordingly in the very context that we address today this court has concluded that the detention and trial of petitioners—ordered by the president in the declared exercise of his powers as commander in chief of the army in time of war and of grave public danger—are not to be set aside by the courts without the clear conviction that they are in conflict with the constitution or laws of congress constitutionally enacted ex parte quirin 317 u s 1 25 1942

under this framework the presidents decision to try hamdan before a military commission for his involvement with al qaeda is entitled to a heavy measure of deference in the present conflict congress has authorized the president to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations organizations or persons he determines planned authorized committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on september 11 2001    in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the united states by such nations organizations or persons authorization for use of military force aumf 115 stat 681 224 note following 50 u s c § 1541 2000 ed supp iii emphasis added as a plurality of the court observed in hamdi the capture detention and trial of unlawful combatants by universal agreement and practice are important incidents of war 542 u s at 518 quoting quirin supra at 28 30 emphasis added and are therefore an exercise of the necessary and appropriate force congress has authorized the president to use hamdi 542 u s at 518 id at 587 thomas j dissenting hamdis observation that military commissions are included within the aumfs authorization is supported by this courts previous recognition that an important incident to the conduct of war is the adoption of measures by the military commander not only to repel and defeat the enemy but to seize and subject to disciplinary measures those enemies who in their attempt to thwart or impede our military effort have violated the law of war in re yamashita 327 u s 1 11 1946 see also quirin supra at 2829 madsen v kinsella 343 u s 341 354 n 20 1952 the military commission    is an institution of the greatest importance in a period of war and should be preserved quoting s rep no 229 63d cong 2d sess 53 1914 testimony of gen crowder

although the court concedes the legitimacy of the presidents use of military commissions in certain circumstances ante at 594 it suggests that the aumf has no bearing on the scope of the presidents power to utilize military commissions in the present conflict ibid instead the court determines the scope of this power based exclusively on article 21 of the uniform code of military justice ucmj 10 u s c § 821 the successor to article 15 of the articles of war which quirin held authorized trial of offenses against the law of war before military commissions 317 u s at 29 as i shall discuss below article 21 alone supports the use of commissions here nothing in the language of article 21 however suggests that it outlines the entire reach of congressional authorization of military commissions in all 682 conflicts—quite the contrary the language of article 21 presupposes the existence of military commissions under an independent basis of authorization1 indeed consistent with hamdis conclusion that the aumf itself authorizes the trial of unlawful combatants the original sanction for military commissions historically derived from congressional authorization of the initiation of war with its attendant authorization of the employment of all necessary and proper agencies for its due prosecution w winthrop military law and precedents 831 rev 2d ed 1920 hereinafter winthrop emphasis deleted accordingly congressional authorization for military commissions pertaining to the instant conflict derives not only from article 21 of the ucmj but also from the more recent and broader authorization contained in the aumf2

i note the courts error respecting the aumf not because it is necessary to my resolution of this case—hamdans military commission can plainly be sustained solely under article 21—but to emphasize the complete congressional sanction of the presidents exercise of his commander in chief authority to conduct the present war in such circumstances as previously noted our duty to defer to the executives military and foreign policy judgment is at its zenith it does not countenance 683 the kind of secondguessing the court repeatedly engages in today military and foreign policy judgmentsare and should be undertaken only by those directly responsible to the people whose welfare they advance or imperil they are decisions of a kind for which the judiciary has neither aptitude facilities nor responsibility and which has long been held to belong in the domain of political power not subject to judicial intrusion or inquiry hamdi supra at 582583 thomas j dissenting quoting chicago  southern air lines inc v waterman s s corp 333 u s 103 111 1948it is within this framework that the lawfulness of hamdans commission should be examinediithe plurality accurately describes some aspects of the history of military commissions and the prerequisites for their use thus i do not dispute that military commissions have historically been used in three different situations ante at 595 and that the only situation relevant to the instant case is the use of military commissions to seize and subject to disciplinary measures those enemies who    have violated the law of war ante at 596 quoting quirin supra at 2829 similarly i agree with the plurality that winthrops treatise sets forth the four relevant considerations for determining the scope of a military commissions jurisdiction considerations relating to the 1 time and 2 place of the offense 3 the status of the offender and 4 the nature of the offense charged winthrop 836840 the executive has easily satisfied these considerations here the pluralitys contrary conclusion rests upon an incomplete accounting and an unfaithful application of those considerationsathe first two considerations are that a lawofwar military commission may only assume jurisdiction of offences committed 684 within the field of the command of the convening commander and that such offenses must have been committed within the period of the war see id at 836 837 ante at 597 here as evidenced by hamdans charging document the executive has determined that the theater of the present conflict includes afghanistan pakistan and other countries where al qaeda has established training camps app to pet for cert 64a and that the duration of that conflict dates back at least to usama bin ladens august 1996 declaration of jihad against the americans ibid under the executives description of the conflict then every aspect of the charge which alleges overt acts in afghanistan pakistan yemen and other countries taking place from 1996 to 2001 satisfies the temporal and geographic prerequisites for the exercise of lawofwar military commission jurisdiction id at 65a67a and these judgments pertaining to the scope of the theater and duration of the present conflict are committed solely to the president in the exercise of his commander in chief authority see prize cases 2 black at 670 concluding that the presidents commander in chief judgment about the nature of a particular conflict was a question to be decided by him and this court must be governed by the decisions and acts of the political department of the government to which this power was entrusted

nevertheless the plurality concludes that the legality of the charge against hamdan is doubtful because hamdan is charged not with an overt act for which he was caught redhanded in a theater of war    but with an agreement the inception of which long predated    the relevant armed conflict ante at 612 emphasis in original the pluralitys willingness to secondguess the executives judgments in this context based upon little more than its unsupported assertions constitutes an unprecedented departure from the traditionally limited role of the courts with respect to war and an unwarranted intrusion on executive authority and 685 even if such secondguessing were appropriate the pluralitys attempt to do so is unpersuasive

as an initial matter the plurality relies upon the date of the aumfs enactment to determine the beginning point for the period of the war winthrop 836837 thereby suggesting that petitioners commission does not have jurisdiction to try him for offenses committed prior to the aumfs enactment ante at 598600 612 but this suggestion betrays the pluralitys unfamiliarity with the realities of warfare and its willful blindness to our precedents the starting point of the present conflict or indeed any conflict is not determined by congressional enactment but rather by the initiation of hostilities see prize cases supra at 668 recognizing that war may be initiated by invasion of a foreign nation and that such initiation and the presidents response usually precedes congressional action thus congress enactment of the aumf did not mark the beginning of this nations conflict with al qaeda but instead authorized the president to use force in the midst of an ongoing conflict moreover while the presidents war powers may not have been activated until the aumf was passed ante at 599 n 31 emphasis deleted the date of such activation has never been used to determine the scope of a military commissions jurisdiction3 instead the traditional rule is that offenses 686 committed before a formal declaration of war or before the declaration of martial law may be tried by military commission green the military commission 42 am j intl l 832 848 1948 hereinafter green see also c howland digest of opinions of the judgeadvocates general of the army 1067 1912 hereinafter howland a military commission    exercising    jurisdiction    under the laws of war    may take cognizance of offenses committed during the war before the initiation of the military government or martial law emphasis in original4 cf yamashita 327 u s at 13 the extent to which the power to prosecute violations of the law of war shall be exercised before peace is declared rests not with the courts but with the political branch of the government consistent with this principle on facts virtually identical to those here a military commission tried julius otto kuehn for conspiring with japanese officials to betray the united states fleet to the imperial japanese government prior to its attack on pearl harbor green 8485

the common law of war as it pertains to offenses triable by military commission is derived from the experience of our wars and our wartime tribunals winthrop 839 and the laws and usages of war as understood and practiced by the civilized nations of the world 11 op atty gen 297 310 1865 moreover the common law of war is marked by two important features first as with the common law generally it is flexible and evolutionary in nature building upon the experience of the past and taking account of the exigencies of the present thus the law of war like every other code of laws declares what shall not be done and does not say what may be done the legitimate use of the great 690 power of war or rather the prohibitions upon the use of that power increase or diminish as the necessity of the case demands id at 300 accordingly this court has recognized that the jurisdiction of our commonlaw war courts has not been prescribed by statute but rather has been adapted in each instance to the need that called it forth madsen 343 u s at 346348 second the common law of war affords a measure of respect for the judgment of military commanders thus the commander of an army in time of war has the same power to organize military tribunals and execute their judgments that he has to set his squadrons in the field and fight battles his authority in each case is from the law and usage of war 11 op atty gen at 305 in recognition of these principles congress has generally left it to the president and the military commanders representing him to employ the commission as occasion may require for the investigation and punishment of violations of the laws of war madsen supra at 347 n 9 quoting winthrop 831 emphasis added

in one key respect the plurality departs from the proper framework for evaluating the adequacy of the charge against hamdan under the laws of war the plurality holds that where as here neither the elements of the offense nor the range of permissible punishments is defined by statute or treaty the precedent establishing whether an offense is triable by military commission must be plain and unambiguous ante at 602 this is a pure contrivance and a bad one at that it is contrary to the presumption we acknowledged in quirin namely that the actions of military commissions are not to be set aside by the courts without the clear conviction that they are unlawful 317 u s at 25 emphasis added it is also contrary to yamashita which recognized the legitimacy of that military commission notwithstanding a substantial disagreement pertaining to whether yamashita had been charged with a violation of the law of war compare 327 u s at 17 noting that the allegations were adequate 691 and need not be stated with    precision with id at 35 murphy j dissenting arguing that the charge was inadequate nor does it find support from the separationofpowers authority cited by the plurality indeed madisons praise of the separation of powers in the federalist no 47 quoted ante at 602 if it has any relevance at all merely highlights the illegitimacy of todays judicial intrusion onto core executive prerogatives in the waging of war where executive competence is at its zenith and judicial competence at its nadir

the pluralitys newly minted clearstatement rule is also fundamentally inconsistent with the nature of the common law which by definition evolves and develops over time and does not in all cases say what may be done 11 op atty gen at 300 similarly it is inconsistent with the nature of warfare which also evolves and changes over time and for which a flexible evolutionary commonlaw system is uniquely appropriate6 though the charge against hamdan easily satisfies even the pluralitys manufactured rule see infra at 692706 the pluralitys inflexible approach has dangerous implications for the executives ability to discharge his duties as commander in chief in future cases we should undertake to determine whether an unlawful combatant has been charged with an offense against the law of war with an understanding that the common law of war is flexible responsive to the exigencies of the present conflict and deferential to the judgment of military commanders

6921under either the correct flexible approach to evaluating the adequacy of hamdans charge or under the pluralitys new clearstatement approach hamdan has been charged with conduct constituting two distinct violations of the law of war cognizable before a military commission membership in a warcriminal enterprise and conspiracy to commit war crimes the charging section of the indictment alleges both that hamdan willfully and knowingly joined an enterprise of persons who shared a common criminal purpose app to pet for cert 65a and that he conspired and agreed with al qaeda to commit    offenses triable by military commission ibid7

693 the common law of war establishes that hamdans willful and knowing membership in al qaeda is a war crime chargeable before a military commission hamdan a confirmed enemy combatant and member or affiliate of al qaeda has been charged with willfully and knowingly joining a group al qaeda whose purpose is to support violent attacks against property and nationals both military and civilian of the united states id at 64a 344 f supp 2d at 161 moreover the allegations specify that hamdan joined and maintained his relationship with al qaeda even though he believed that usama bin laden and his associates were involved in the attacks on the u s embassies in kenya and tanzania in august 1998 the attack on the uss cole in october 2000 and the attacks on the united states on september 11 2001 app to pet for cert 65a these allegations against a confirmed unlawful combatant are alone sufficient to sustain the jurisdiction of hamdans military commission

for well over a century it has been established that to unite with banditti jayhawkers guerillas or any other unauthorized marauders is a high offence against the laws of war the offence is complete when the band is organized or joined the atrocities committed by such a band do not constitute the offence but make the reasons and sufficient reasons they are why such banditti are denounced by the laws of 694 war 11 op atty gen at 312 emphasis added8 in other words unlawful combatants such as hamdan violate the law of war merely by joining an organization such as al qaeda whose principal purpose is the killing and disabling    of peaceable citizens or soldiers winthrop 784 see also 11 op atty gen at 314 a bushwhacker a jayhawker a bandit a war rebel an assassin being public enemies may be tried condemned and executed as offenders against the laws of war this conclusion is unsurprising as it is a cardinal principle of the law of war    that the civilian population must enjoy complete immunity 4 intl comm of red cross commentary geneva convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war 3 j pictet gen ed 1958 numerous instances of trials for violation of the laws of war of offenders of this description are published in the general orders of the years 1862 to 1866 winthrop 784 and n 579 accordingly on this basis alone 695 the allegations of hamdans charge tested by any reasonable standard adequately allege a violation of the law of war yamashita 327 u s at 17

the conclusion that membership in an organization whose purpose is to violate the laws of war is an offense triable by military commission is confirmed by the experience of the 696 military tribunals convened by the united states at nuremberg pursuant to article 10 of the charter of the international military tribunal imt the united states convened military tribunals to bring individuals to trial for membership in a group or organization    declared criminal by the imt 1 trials of war criminals before the nuernberg military tribunals p xii art 10 hereinafter trials the imt designated various components of four nazi groups—the leadership corps gestapo sd and ss— as criminal organizations 22 imt trial of the major war criminals 505 511 517 1948 see also t taylor anatomy of the nuremberg trials a personal memoir 584585 1992 a member of such an organization could be    convicted of the crime of membership and be punished for that crime by death 22 imt at 499 under this authority the united states military tribunal at nuremberg convicted numerous individuals for the act of knowing and voluntary membership in these organizations for example in military tribunal case no 1 united states v brandt karl brandt karl gebhardt rudolf brandt joachim mrugowsky wolfram sievers viktor brack and waldemar hoven were convicted and sentenced to death for the crime of inter alia membership in an organization declared criminal by the imt karl genzken and fritz fischer were sentenced to life imprisonment for the same and helmut poppendick was convicted of no other offense than membership in a criminal organization and sentenced to a 10year term of imprisonment 2 trials 180300 this court denied habeas relief 333 u s 836 1948 and the executions were carried out at landsberg prison on june 2 1948 2 trials 330

moreover the government has alleged that hamdan was not only a member of al qaeda while it was carrying out terrorist attacks on civilian targets in the united states and abroad but also that hamdan aided and assisted al qaedas top leadership by supplying weapons transportation and other services app to pet for cert 65a67a these allegations 697 further confirm that hamdan is triable before a lawofwar military commission for his involvement with al qaeda see h r doc no 65 55th cong 3d sess 234 1894 there are numerous rebels    that    furnish the enemy with arms provisions clothing horses and means of transportation such insurgents are banding together in several of the interior counties for the purpose of assisting the enemy to rob to maraud and to lay waste to the country all such persons are by the laws of war in every civilized country liable to capital punishment emphasis added winthrop 840 including in the list of offenses triable by lawofwar military commissions dealing with    enemies or furnishing them with money arms provisions medicines  c10 undoubtedly the conclusion that such conduct violates the law of war led to the enactment of article 104 of the ucmj which provides that any person who    aids or attempts to aid the enemy with arms ammunition supplies money or other things    shall suffer death or such other punishment as a courtmartial or military commission may direct 10 u s c § 9042separate and apart from the offense of joining a contingent of uncivilized combatants who are not    likely to respect the laws of war winthrop 784 hamdan has been charged with conspiring and agreeing with    the al qaida organization    to commit    offenses triable by military commission app to pet for cert 65a those offenses include attacking civilians attacking civilian objects murder by an unprivileged belligerent and terrorism ibid this 698 too alleges a violation of the law of war triable by military commission

the experience of our wars winthrop 839 is rife with evidence that establishes beyond any doubt that conspiracy to violate the laws of war is itself an offense cognizable before a lawofwar military commission world war ii provides the most recent examples of the use of american military commissions to try offenses pertaining to violations of the laws of war in that conflict the orders establishing the jurisdiction of military commissions in various theaters of operation provided that conspiracy to violate the laws of war was a cognizable offense see letter general headquarters united states army forces pacific sept 24 1945 record in yamashita v styer o t 1945 no 672 pp 14 16 exh f order respecting the regulations governing the trial of war criminals provided that participation in a common plan or conspiracy to accomplish various offenses against the law of war was cognizable before military commissions 1 u n war crimes commission law reports of trials of war criminals 114115 1947 reprint 1997 hereinafter u n commission recounting that the orders establishing world war ii military commissions in the pacific and china included participation in a common plan or conspiracy pertaining to certain violations of the laws of war as an offense triable by military commission indeed those orders authorized trial by military commission of participation in a conspiracy to commit murder    or other inhumane acts    against any civilian population id at 114 which is precisely the offense hamdan has been charged with here and conspiracy to violate the laws of war was charged in the highest profile case tried before a world war ii military commission see quirin 317 u s at 23 and on numerous other occasions see e g colepaugh v looney 235 f 2d 429 431 ca10 1956 green 848 describing the conspiracy trial of julius otto kuehn

699 to support its contrary conclusion ante at 600 the plurality attempts to evade the import of quirin and the other world war ii authorities by resting upon this courts failure to address the sufficiency of the conspiracy charge in the quirin case ante at 605607 but the common law of war cannot be ascertained from this courts failure to pass upon an issue or indeed to even mention the issue in its opinion11 rather it is ascertained by the practice and usage of war winthrop 839 supra at 689690

the civil war experience provides further support for the presidents conclusion that conspiracy to violate the laws of war is an offense cognizable before lawofwar military commissions indeed in the highest profile case to be tried before a military commission relating to that war namely the trial of the men involved in the assassination of president lincoln the charge provided that those men had combined confederated and conspired    to kill and murder president lincoln g c m o no 356 1865 reprinted in h r doc no 314 55th cong 3d sess 696 1899 hereinafter g c m o no 35612

700 in addition to the foregoing highprofile example winthrops treatise enumerates numerous civil war military commission trials for conspiracy to violate the law of war winthrop 839 n 5 the plurality attempts to explain these examples away by suggesting that the conspiracies listed by winthrop are best understood as a species of compound offense namely violations both of the law of war and ordinary criminal laws rather than standalone offenses against the law of war ante at 608 citing as an example murder in violation of the laws of war but the fact that for example conspiracy to commit murder can at the same time violate ordinary criminal laws and the law of war so that it is a combination of the two species of offenses howland 1071 does not establish that a military commission would not have jurisdiction to try that crime solely on the basis that it was a violation of the law of war rather if anything and consistent with the principle that the common law of war is flexible and affords some level of deference to the judgments of military commanders it establishes that military commissions would have the discretion to try the offense as 1 one against the law of war or 2 one against the ordinary criminal laws or 3 both

in any event the pluralitys effort to avoid the import of winthrops footnote through the smokescreen of its compound offense theory ante at 607608 cannot be reconciled with the particular charges that sustained military commission jurisdiction in the cases that winthrop cites for example 701 in the military commission trial of henry wirz charge i provided that he had beenmaliciously willfully and traitorously    combining confederating and conspiring together with various other named and unnamed coconspirators to injure the health and destroy the lives of soldiers in the military service of the united states then held and being prisoners of war within the lines of the socalled confederate states and in the military prisons thereof to the end that the armies of the united states might be weakened and impaired in violation of the laws and customs of war g c m o no 607 1865 reprinted in h r doc no 314 at 785 emphasis addedlikewise in the military commission trial of leger grenfel charge i accused grenfel of conspiring in violation of the laws of war to release rebel prisoners of war confined by authority of the united states at camp douglas near chicago ill g c m o no 452 1865 reprinted in h r doc no 314 at 724 emphasis added13 see also g c m o 702 no 41 p 20 1864 indictment in the military commission trial of robert louden charged conspiring with the rebel enemies of the united states to embarrass and impede the military authorities in the suppression of the existing rebellion by the burning and destruction of steamboats and means of transportation on the mississippi river these examples provide incontrovertible support for the presidents conclusion that the common law of war permits military commission trials for conspiracy to violate the law of war and they specifically contradict the pluralitys conclusion to the contrary thereby easily satisfying its requirement that the government make a substantial showing that the crime for which it seeks to try a defendant by military commission is acknowledged to be an offense against the law of war ante at 60314

703 the plurality further contends in reliance upon winthrop that conspiracy is not an offense cognizable before a lawofwar military commission because it is not enough to intend to violate the law of war and commit overt acts in furtherance of that intention unless the overt acts either are themselves offenses against the law of war or constitute steps sufficiently substantial to qualify as an attempt ante at 604 but winthrop does not support the pluralitys conclusion the passage in winthrop cited by the plurality states only that the jurisdiction of the military commission should be restricted to cases of offence consisting in overt acts i e in unlawful commissions or actual attempts to commit and not in intentions merely winthrop 841 emphasis in original this passage would be helpful to the plurality if its subject were conspiracy rather than the jurisdiction of the military commission winthrop is not speaking here of the requirements for a conspiracy charge but of the requirements for all charges intentions do not suffice an unlawful act—such as committing the crime of conspiracy—is necessary winthrop says nothing to exclude either conspiracy or membership in a criminal enterprise both of which go beyond intentions merely and consist of overt acts i e    unlawful commissions or actual attempts to commit and both of which are expressly recognized by winthrop as crimes against the law of war triable by military commissions id at 784 id at 839 and n 5 840 indeed the 704 commission of an overt act is the traditional requirement for the completion of the crime of conspiracy and the charge against hamdan alleges numerous such overt acts app to pet for cert 65a the pluralitys approach unsupported by winthrop requires that any overt act to further a conspiracy must itself be a completed war crime distinct from conspiracy—which merely begs the question the plurality sets out to answer namely whether conspiracy itself may constitute a violation of the law of war and even the pluralitys unsupported standard is satisfied here hamdan has been charged with the overt acts of providing protection transportation weapons and other services to the enemy id at 65a67a acts which in and of themselves are violations of the laws of war see supra at 696697 winthrop 8398403ultimately the pluralitys determination that hamdan has not been charged with an offense triable before a military commission rests not upon any historical example or authority but upon the pluralitys raw judgment of the inability on the executives part here to satisfy the most basic precondition    for establishment of military commissions military necessity ante at 612 this judgment starkly confirms that the plurality has appointed itself the ultimate arbiter of what is quintessentially a policy and military judgment namely the appropriate military measures to take against those who aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on september 11 2001 aumf § 2a 115 stat 224 the pluralitys suggestion that hamdans commission is illegitimate because it is not dispensing swift justice on the battlefield is unsupportable ante at 607 even a cursory review of the authorities confirms that lawofwar military commissions have wideranging jurisdiction to try offenses against the law of war in exigent and nonexigent circumstances alike see e g winthrop 839840 see also yamashita 327 u s at 5 military commission trial after the cessation 705 of hostilities in the philippines quirin 317 u s 1 military commission trial in washington d c traditionally retributive justice for heinous war crimes is as much a military necessity as the demands of military efficiency touted by the plurality and swift military retribution is precisely what congress authorized the president to impose on the september 11 attackers in the aumf

today a plurality of this court would hold that conspiracy to massacre innocent civilians does not violate the laws of war this determination is unsustainable the judgment of the political branches that hamdan and others like him must be held accountable before military commissions for their involvement with and membership in an unlawful organization dedicated to inflicting massive civilian casualties is supported by virtually every relevant authority including all of the authorities invoked by the plurality today it is also supported by the nature of the present conflict we are not engaged in a traditional battle with a nationstate but with a worldwide hydraheaded enemy who lurks in the shadows conspiring to reproduce the atrocities of september 11 2001 and who has boasted of sending suicide bombers into civilian gatherings has proudly distributed videotapes of beheadings of civilian workers and has tortured and dismembered captured american soldiers but according to the plurality when our armed forces capture those who are plotting terrorist atrocities like the bombing of the khobar towers the bombing of the u s s cole and the attacks of september 11—even if their plots are advanced to the very brink of fulfillment—our military cannot charge those criminals with any offense against the laws of war instead our troops must catch the terrorists redhanded ante at 612 in the midst of the attack itself in order to bring them to justice not only is this conclusion fundamentally inconsistent with the cardinal principle of the law of war namely protecting noncombatants but it would sorely hamper the presidents ability to confront and defeat a new and deadly enemy

706 after seeing the plurality overturn longstanding precedents in order to seize jurisdiction over this case ante at 656658 scalia j dissenting and after seeing them disregard the clear prudential counsel that they abstain in these circumstances from using equitable powers ante at 672678 it is no surprise to see them go on to overrule one after another of the presidents judgments pertaining to the conduct of an ongoing war those justices who today disregard the commander in chiefs wartime decisions only 10 days ago deferred to the judgment of the corps of engineers with regard to a matter much more within the competence of lawyers upholding that agencys wildly implausible conclusion that a storm drain is a tributary of the waters of the united states see rapanos v united states 547 u s 715 2006 it goes without saying that there is much more at stake here than storm drains the pluralitys willingness to secondguess the determination of the political branches that these conspirators must be brought to justice is both unprecedented and dangerousiiih2

the court holds that even if the government has charged hamdan with an offense against the law of war cognizable by military commission the commission lacks power to proceed because of its failure to comply with the terms of the ucmj and the four geneva conventions signed in 1949 ante at 613 this position is untenableaas with the jurisdiction of military commissions the procedure of such commissions has not been prescribed by statute but has been adapted in each instance to the need that called it forth madsen 343 u s at 347348 indeed this court has concluded that in the absence of attempts by congress to limit the presidents power it appears that as commanderinchief of the army and navy of the united states he may in time of war establish and prescribe 707 the jurisdiction and procedure of military commissions id at 348 this conclusion is consistent with this courts understanding that military commissions are our commonlaw war courts id at 34634715 as such should the conduct of those who compose martiallaw tribunals become a matter of judicial determination subsequently before the civil courts those courts will give great weight to the opinions of the officers as to what the customs of war in any case justify and render necessary birkhimer 534

708 the court nevertheless concludes that at least one provision of the ucmj amounts to an attempt by congress to limit the presidents power this conclusion is not only contrary to the text and structure of the ucmj but it is also inconsistent with precedent of this court consistent with madsens conclusion pertaining to the commonlaw nature of military commissions and the presidents discretion to prescribe their procedures article 36 of the ucmj authorizes the president to establish procedures for military commissions which shall so far as he considers practicable apply the principles of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the united states district courts but which may not be contrary to or inconsistent with this chapter 10 u s c § 836a emphasis added far from constraining the presidents authority article 36 recognizes the presidents prerogative to depart from the procedures applicable in criminal cases whenever he alone does not deem such procedures practicable while the procedural regulations promulgated by the executive must not be contrary to the ucmj only a few provisions of the ucmj mention military commissions see ante at 621 n 49 and there is no suggestion that the procedures to be employed by hamdans commission implicate any of those provisions

notwithstanding the foregoing the court concludes that article 36b of the ucmj 10 u s c § 836b which provides that all rules and regulations made under this article shall be uniform insofar as practicable ante at 620 requires the president to employ the same rules and procedures in military commissions as are employed by courtsmartial insofar as practicable ante at 622 the court further concludes that hamdans commission is unlawful because the president has not explained why it is not practicable to apply the same rules and procedures to hamdans commission as would be applied in a trial by courtmartial ante at 623624

709 this interpretation of § 836b is unconvincing as an initial matter the court fails to account for our cases interpreting the predecessor to article 21 of the ucmj—article 15 of the articles of war—which provides crucial context that bears directly on the proper interpretation of article 36b article 15 of the articles of war provided thatthe provisions of these articles conferring jurisdiction upon courtsmartial shall not be construed as depriving military commissions provost courts or other military tribunals of concurrent jurisdiction in respect of offenders or offenses that by statute or by the law of war may be triable by such military commissions provost courts or other military tribunals 41 stat 790in yamashita this court concluded that article 15 of the articles of war preserved the presidents unfettered authority to prescribe military commission procedure the court explained by thus recognizing military commissions in order to preserve their traditional jurisdiction over enemy combatants unimpaired by the articles congress gave sanction    to any use of the military commission contemplated by the common law of war 327 u s at 20 emphasis added16 see also quirin 317 u s at 28 madsen 343 u s at 355 in reaching this conclusion this court treated as authoritative the congressional testimony of judge advocate 710 general crowder who testified that article 15 of the articles of war was enacted to preserve the military commission as our commonlaw war court yamashita supra at 19 n 7 and this court recognized that article 15s preservation of military commissions as commonlaw war courts preserved the presidents commander in chief authority to both establish military commissions and to prescribe their procedures madsen 343 u s at 348 id at 348349 explaining that congress had refrained from legislating in the area of military commission procedures in contrast with its traditional readiness to    prescribe with particularity the jurisdiction and procedure of united states courtsmartial cf green 834 the military commission exercising jurisdiction under common law authority is usually appointed by a superior military commander and is limited in its procedure only by the will of that commander like any other common law court in the absence of directive of superior authority to the contrary the military commission is free to formulate its own rules of procedure

given these precedents the courts conclusion that article 36b requires the president to apply the same rules and procedures to military commissions as are applicable to courtsmartial is unsustainable when congress codified article 15 of the articles of war in article 21 of the ucmj it was presumed to be aware of    and to adopt this courts interpretation of that provision as preserving the commonlaw status of military commissions inclusive of the presidents unfettered authority to prescribe their procedures lorillard v pons 434 u s 575 580 1978 the courts conclusion that article 36b repudiates this settled meaning of article 21 is not based upon a specific textual reference to military commissions but rather on a onesentence subsection providing that all rules and regulations made under this article shall be uniform insofar as practicable 10 u s c § 836b this is little more than an impermissible repeal by implication 711 see branch v smith 538 u s 254 273 2003 plurality opinion we have repeatedly stated    that absent a clearly expressed congressional intention repeals by implication are not favored citations and internal quotation marks omitted moreover the courts conclusion is flatly contrary to its duty not to set aside hamdans commission without the clear conviction that it is in conflict with the    laws of congress constitutionally enacted quirin supra at 25 emphasis added

nothing in the text of article 36b supports the courts sweeping conclusion that it represents an unprecedented congressional effort to change the nature of military commissions from commonlaw war courts to tribunals that must presumptively function like courtsmartial and such an interpretation would be strange indeed the vision of uniformity that motivated the adoption of the ucmj embodied specifically in article 36b is nothing more than uniformity across the separate branches of the armed services see act of may 5 1950 ch 169 64 stat 107 preamble to the ucmj explaining that the ucmj is an act to unify consolidate revise and codify the articles of war the articles for the government of the navy and the disciplinary laws of the coast guard there is no indication that the ucmj was intended to require uniformity in procedure between courtsmartial and military commissions tribunals that the ucmj itself recognizes are different to the contrary the ucmj expressly recognizes that different tribunals will be constituted in different manners and employ different procedures see 10 u s c § 866 providing for three different types of courtsmartial—general special and summary—constituted in different manners and employing different procedures thus article 36b is best understood as establishing that so far as practicable the rules and regulations governing tribunals convened by the navy must be uniform with the rules and regulations governing tribunals convened by the army but consistent with this courts prior interpretations 712 of article 21 and over a century of historical practice it cannot be understood to require the president to conform the procedures employed by military commissions to those employed by courtsmartial17

even if article 36b could be construed to require procedural uniformity among the various tribunals contemplated by the ucmj hamdan would not be entitled to relief under the courts reading the president is entitled to prescribe different rules for military commissions than for courtsmartial when he determines that it is not practicable to prescribe uniform rules the court does not resolve the level of deference such determinations would be owed however because in its view the president has not    determined that it is impracticable to apply the rules for courtsmartial ante at 623 this is simply not the case on the same day that the president issued military commission order no 1 the secretary of defense explained that the president decided to establish military commissions because he wanted the option of a process that is different from those processes which we already have namely the federal court system    and the military court system dept of 713 defense news briefing on military commissions mar 21 2002 remarks of donald rumsfeld available at httpwwwdodgovtranscripts2002t03212002t0321sdhtml as visited june 26 2006 and available in clerk of courts case file hereinafter news briefing and that the commissions are intended to be different    because the president recognized that there had to be differences to deal with the unusual situation we face and that a different approach was needed ibid the president reached this conclusion becausewere in the middle of a war and    had to design a procedure that would allow us to pursue justice for these individuals while at the same time prosecuting the war most effectively and that means setting rules that would allow us to preserve our intelligence secrets develop more information about terrorist activities that might be planned for the future so that we can take action to prevent terrorist attacks against the united states    there was a constant balancing of the requirements of our war policy and the importance of providing justice for the individuals    and each deviation from the standard kinds of rules that we have in our criminal courts was motivated by the desire to strike this balance between individual justice and the broader war policy ibid remarks of douglas j feith under secretary of defense for policy emphasis addedthe court provides no explanation why the presidents determination that employing courtmartial procedures in the military commissions established pursuant to military commission order no 1 would hamper our war effort is in any way inadequate to satisfy its newly minted practicability requirement on the contrary this determination is precisely the kind for which the judiciary has neither aptitude facilities nor responsibility and which has long been held to belong in the domain of political power not subject to judicial 714 intrusion or inquiry chicago  southern air lines inc v waterman s s corp 333 u s at 111 and in the context of the present conflict it is exactly the kind of determination congress countenanced when it authorized the president to use all necessary and appropriate force against our enemies accordingly the presidents determination is sufficient to satisfy any practicability requirement imposed by article 36b

the court further contends that hamdans commission is unlawful because it fails to provide him the right to be present at his trial as recognized in 10 u s c § 839c 2000 ed supp v ante at 624 but § 839c applies to courtsmartial not military commissions it provideswhen the members of a courtmartial deliberate or vote only the members may be present all other proceedings including any other consultation of the members of the court with counsel or the military judge shall be made a part of the record and shall be in the presence of the accused the defense counsel the trial counsel and in cases in which a military judge has been detailed to the court the military judgein context all other proceedings plainly refers exclusively to other proceedings pertaining to a courtmartial18 this is confirmed by the provisions subsequent reference to members of the court and to cases in which a military judge has been detailed to the court it is also confirmed by the other provisions of § 839 which refer only to courtsmartial see §§ 839a14 any time after the service of charges which have been referred for trial to a courtmartial composed of a military judge and members the military 715 judge may    call the court into session without the presence of the members for the purpose of hearing motions issuing rulings holding arraignments receiving pleas and performing various procedural functions see also § 839b proceedings under subsection a shall be conducted in the presence of the accused section 839c simply does not address the procedural requirements of military commissionsbthe court contends that hamdans military commission is also unlawful because it violates common article 3 of the geneva conventions see ante at 629635 furthermore hamdan contends that his commission is unlawful because it violates various provisions of the third geneva convention these contentions are untenable1as an initial matter and as the court of appeals concluded both of hamdans geneva convention claims are foreclosed by johnson v eisentrager 339 u s 763 1950 in that case the respondents claimed inter alia that their military commission lacked jurisdiction because it failed to provide them with certain procedural safeguards that they argued were required under the geneva conventions id at 789790 while this court rejected the underlying merits of the respondents geneva convention claims id at 790 it also held in the alternative that the respondents could not assert    that anything in the geneva convention makes them immune from prosecution or punishment for war crimes id at 789 the court explainedwe are not holding that these prisoners have no right which the military authorities are bound to respect the united states by the geneva convention of july 27 1929 47 stat 2021 concluded with fortysix other countries including the german reich an agreement upon the treatment to be accorded captives these 716 prisoners claim to be and are entitled to its protection it is however the obvious scheme of the agreement that responsibility for observance and enforcement of these rights is upon political and military authorities rights of alien enemies are vindicated under it only through protests and intervention of protecting powers as the rights of our citizens against foreign governments are vindicated only by presidential intervention id at 789 n 14this alternative holding is no less binding than if it were the exclusive basis for the courts decision see massachusetts v united states 333 u s 611 623 1948 while the court attempts to cast eisentragers unqualified alternative holding as footnote dictum ante at 627 it does not dispute the correctness of its conclusion namely that the provisions of the 1929 geneva convention were not judicially enforceable because that convention contemplated that diplomatic measures by political and military authorities were the exclusive mechanisms for such enforcement nor does the court suggest that the 1949 geneva conventions departed from this framework see ibid we may assume that the obvious scheme of the 1949 conventions is identical in all relevant respects to that of the 1929 convention

instead the court concludes that petitioner may seek judicial enforcement of the provisions of the geneva conventions because they are    part of the law of war and compliance with the law of war is the condition upon which the authority set forth in article 21 is granted ante at 628 citation omitted but article 21 authorizes the use of military commissions it does not purport to render judicially enforceable aspects of the law of war that are not so enforceable of their own accord see quirin 317 u s at 28 by enacting article 21 congress has explicitly provided so far as it may constitutionally do so that military tribunals shall have jurisdiction to try offenders or offenses against the law of war the court cannot escape eisentragers holding 717 merely by observing that article 21 mentions the law of war indeed though eisentrager did not specifically consider the courts novel interpretation of article 21 eisentrager involved a challenge to the legality of a world war ii military commission which like all such commissions found its authorization in article 15 of the articles of war the predecessor to article 21 of the ucmj thus the courts interpretation of article 21 is foreclosed by eisentrager

in any event the courts argument is too clever by half the judicial nonenforceability of the geneva conventions derives from the fact that those conventions have exclusive enforcement mechanisms see eisentrager supra at 789 n 14 and this too is part of the law of war the courts position thus rests on the assumption that article 21s reference to the laws of war selectively incorporates only those aspects of the geneva conventions that the court finds convenient namely the substantive requirements of common article 3 and not those aspects of the conventions that the court for whatever reason disfavors namely the conventions exclusive diplomatic enforcement scheme the court provides no account of why the partial incorporation of the geneva conventions should extend only so far—and no further—because none is available beyond its evident preference to adjudicate those matters that the law of war through the geneva conventions consigns exclusively to the political branches

even if the court were correct that article 21 of the ucmj renders judicially enforceable aspects of the law of war that are not so enforceable by their own terms article 21 simply cannot be interpreted to render judicially enforceable the particular provision of the law of war at issue here namely common article 3 of the geneva conventions as relevant article 21 provides that the provisions of this chapter conferring jurisdiction upon courtsmartial do not deprive military commissions    of concurrent jurisdiction with respect to offenders or offenses that by statute or by 718 the law of war may be tried by military commissions 10 u s c § 821 emphasis added thus to the extent article 21 can be interpreted as authorizing judicial enforcement of aspects of the law of war that are not otherwise judicially enforceable that authorization only extends to provisions of the law of war that relate to whether a particular offender or a particular offense is triable by military commission common article 3 of the geneva conventions the sole provision of the geneva conventions relevant to the courts holding relates to neither rather it relates exclusively to the particulars of the tribunal itself namely whether it is regularly constituted and whether it affords all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples third geneva convention art 3 ¶ 1d relative to the treatment of prisoners of war aug 12 1949 1955 6 u s t 3316 3320 t i a s no 33642in addition to being foreclosed by eisentrager hamdans claim under common article 3 of the geneva conventions is meritless common article 3 applies to armed conflict not of an international character occurring in the territory of one of the high contracting parties 6 u s t at 3318 pursuant to his authority as commander in chief and chief executive of the united states the president has accepted the legal conclusion of the department of justice    that common article 3 of geneva does not apply to    al qaeda    detainees because among other reasons the relevant conflicts are international in scope and common article 3 applies only to armed conflict not of an international character app 35 under this courts precedents the meaning attributed to treaty provisions by the government agencies charged with their negotiation and enforcement is entitled to great weight sumitomo shoji america inc v avagliano 457 u s 176 184185 1982 united states v stuart 489 u s 353 369 1989 our duty to defer to the 719 presidents understanding of the provision at issue here is only heightened by the fact that he is acting pursuant to his constitutional authority as commander in chief and by the fact that the subject matter of common article 3 calls for a judgment about the nature and character of an armed conflict see generally united states v curtisswright export corp 299 u s 304 320 1936

the presidents interpretation of common article 3 is reasonable and should be sustained the conflict with al qaeda is international in character in the sense that it is occurring in various nations around the globe thus it is also occurring in the territory of more than one of the high contracting parties the court does not dispute the presidents judgments respecting the nature of our conflict with al qaeda nor does it suggest that the presidents interpretation of common article 3 is implausible or foreclosed by the text of the treaty indeed the court concedes that common article 3 is principally concerned with furnishing minimal protection to rebels involved in    a civil war ante at 631 precisely the type of conflict the presidents interpretation envisions to be subject to common article 3 instead the court without acknowledging its duty to defer to the president adopts its own admittedly plausible reading of common article 3 but where as here an ambiguous treaty provision not of an international character is susceptible of two plausible and reasonable interpretations our precedents require us to defer to the executives interpretation3but even if common article 3 were judicially enforceable and applicable to the present conflict petitioner would not be entitled to relief as an initial matter any claim petitioner has under common article 3 is not ripe the only relevant acts that are and shall remain prohibited under common article 3 are the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced 720 by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples art 3 ¶ 1d 6 u s t at 3318 3320 emphasis added as its terms make clear common article 3 is only violated as relevant here by the act of passing of sentence and thus hamdan will only have a claim if his military commission convicts him and imposes a sentence accordingly as hamdans claim is contingent upon future events that may not occur as anticipated or indeed may not occur at all it is not ripe for adjudication texas v united states 523 u s 296 300 1998 internal quotation marks omitted19 indeed even if we assume he will be convicted and sentenced whether his trial will be conducted in a manner so as to deprive him of the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples is entirely speculative and premature adjudication of hamdans claim is especially inappropriate here because reaching the merits of the dispute would force us to decide whether an action taken by one of the other two branches of the federal government was unconstitutional raines v byrd 521 u s 811 819820 1997

in any event hamdans military commission complies with the requirements of common article 3 it is plainly regularly constituted because such commissions have been employed throughout our history to try unlawful combatants for crimes against the law of war this court has recounted that history as follows

721 by a practice dating from 1847 and renewed and firmly established during the civil war military commissions have become adopted as authorized tribunals in this country in time of war    their competency has been recognized not only in acts of congress but in executive proclamations in rulings of the courts and in the opinions of the attorneys general madsen 343 u s at 346 n 8
hamdans commission has been constituted in accordance with these historical precedents as i have previously explained the procedures to be employed by that commission and the executives authority to alter those procedures are consistent with the practice of previous american military commissions see supra at 706712 and n 15

the court concludes hamdans commission fails to satisfy the requirements of common article 3 not because it differs from the practice of previous military commissions but because it deviates from the procedures governing courtsmartial ante at 634 but there is neither a statutory nor historical requirement that military commissions conform to the structure and practice of courtsmartial a military commission is a different tribunal serving a different function and thus operates pursuant to different procedures the 150year pedigree of the military commission is itself sufficient to establish that such tribunals are regularly constituted courts art 3 ¶ 1d 6 u s t at 3320

similarly the procedures to be employed by hamdans commission afford all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples neither the court nor petitioner disputes the governments description of those procedures

petitioner is entitled to appointed military legal counsel 32 cfr 94c2 and may retain a civilian attorney which he has done 32 cfr 94c2iiib petitioner is entitled to the presumption of innocence 32 722 cfr 95b proof beyond a reasonable doubt 32 cfr 95c and the right to remain silent 32 cfr 95f he may confront witnesses against him 32 cfr 95i and may subpoena his own witnesses if reasonably available 32 cfr 95h petitioner may personally be present at every stage of the trial unless he engages in disruptive conduct or the prosecution introduces classified or otherwise protected information for which no adequate substitute is available and whose admission will not deprive him of a full and fair trial 32 cfr 95k military commission order no 1 dept of defense aug 31 2005 § 6b3 and d5b if petitioner is found guilty the judgment will be reviewed by a review panel the secretary of defense and the president if he does not designate the secretary as the final decisionmaker 32 cfr 96h the final judgment is subject to review in the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit and ultimately in this court see dta § 1005e3 119 stat 2743 28 u s c 12541 brief for respondents 4
notwithstanding these provisions which in my judgment easily satisfy the nebulous standards of common article 320 the plurality concludes that hamdans commission is unlawful because of the possibility that hamdan will be barred from proceedings and denied access to evidence that may be used to convict him ante at 633635 but under the commissions rules the government may not impose such bar or denial on hamdan if it would render his trial unfair 723 a question that is clearly within the scope of the appellate review contemplated by regulation and statute

moreover while the executive is surely not required to offer a particularized defense of these procedures prior to their application the procedures themselves make clear that hamdan would only be excluded other than for disruption if it were necessary to protect classified or classifiable intelligence dept of defense military commission order no 1 § 6b3 aug 31 2005 including the sources and methods for gathering such intelligence the government has explained that we want to make sure that these proceedings which are going on in the middle of the war do not interfere with our war effort and    because of the way we would be able to handle interrogations and intelligence information may actually assist us in promoting our war aims news briefing remarks of douglas j feith under secretary of defense for policy and this court has concluded in the very context of a threat to reveal our nations intelligence gathering sources and methods that it is obvious and unarguable that no governmental interest is more compelling than the security of the nation haig 453 u s at 307 quoting aptheker v secretary of state 378 u s 500 509 1964 and that measures to protect the secrecy of our governments foreign intelligence operations plainly serve these interests haig supra at 307 see also snepp v united states 444 u s 507 509 n 3 1980 per curiam the government has a compelling interest in protecting both the secrecy of information important to our national security and the appearance of confidentiality so essential to the effective operation of our foreign intelligence service curtisswright 299 u s at 320 this interest is surely compelling here according to the government because al qaeda operates as a clandestine force relying on sleeper agents to mount surprise attacks one of the most critical fronts in the current war involves gathering intelligence about future terrorist attacks and how the terrorist network 724 operates—identifying where its operatives are how it plans attacks who directs operations and how they communicate brief for united states in no 034792 united states v moussaoui ca4 p 9 we should not rule out the possibility that this compelling interest can be protected while at the same time affording hamdan and others like him a fair trial

in these circumstances civilized peoples would take into account the context of military commission trials against unlawful combatants in the war on terrorism including the need to keep certain information secret in the interest of preventing future attacks on our nation and its foreign installations so long as it did not deprive the accused of a fair trial accordingly the presidents understanding of the requirements of common article 3 is entitled to great weight see supra at 7184in addition to common article 3 which applies to conflicts not of an international character hamdan also claims that he is entitled to the protections of the third geneva convention which applies to conflicts between two or more high contracting parties there is no merit to hamdans claim

article 2 of the convention provides that the present convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the high contracting parties 6 u s t at 3318 pursuant to his authority as commander in chief and chief executive of the united states the president has determined that the convention is inapplicable here explaining that none of the provisions of geneva apply to our conflict with al qaeda in afghanistan or elsewhere throughout the world because among other reasons al qaeda is not a high contracting party app 35 the presidents findings about the nature of the present conflict with respect to members of al qaeda operating in afghanistan represents a core 725 exercise of his commander in chief authority that this court is bound to respect see prize cases 2 black at 670

  

for these reasons i would affirm the judgment of the court of appealsjustice alito with whom justice scalia and justice thomas join in parts i—iii dissentingfor the reasons set out in justice scalias dissent which i join i would hold that we lack jurisdiction on the merits i join justice thomas dissent with the exception of parts i iic1 and iiib2 which concern matters that i find unnecessary to reach i add the following comments to provide a further explanation of my reasons for disagreeing with the holding of the courtithe holding of the court as i understand it rests on the following reasoning a military commission is lawful only if it is authorized by 10 u s c § 821 this provision permits the use of a commission to try offenders or offenses that by statute or by the law of war may be tried by such a commission because no statute provides that an offender such as petitioner or an offense such as the one with which he is charged may be tried by a military commission he may be tried by military commission only if the trial is authorized by the law of war the geneva conventions are part of the law of war and common article 3 of the conventions prohibits petitioners trial because the commission before which he would be tried is not a regularly constituted court third geneva convention art 3 ¶ 1d relative to the treatment of prisoners of war aug 12 1949 1955 6 u s t 3316 3320 t i a s no 3364 i disagree with this holding because petitioners commission is a regularly constituted court

726 common article 3 provides as followsin the case of armed conflict not of an international character occurring in the territory of one of the high contracting parties each party to the conflict shall be bound to apply as a minimum the following provisions
1    the following acts are and shall remain prohibited   
    
d the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples id at 33183320 emphasis addedcommon article 3 thus imposes three requirements sentences may be imposed only by 1 a court 2 that is regularly constituted and 3 that affords all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples id at 3320

i see no need here to comment extensively on the meaning of the first and third requirements the first requirement is largely selfexplanatory and with respect to the third i note only that on its face it imposes a uniform international standard that does not vary from signatory to signatory

the second element regularly constituted is the one on which the court relies and i interpret this element to require that the court be appointed or established in accordance with the appointing countrys domestic law i agree with the court see ante at 632 n 64 that as used in common article 3 the term regularly is synonymous with properly the term constitute means appoint set up or establish websters third new international dictionary 486 1961 and therefore regularly constituted means properly appointed set up or established our cases repeatedly use the phrases regularly constituted and properly constituted in this sense see e g hamdi v 727 rumsfeld 542 u s 507 538 2004 plurality opinion of oconnor j nguyen v united states 539 u s 69 83 2003 ryder v united states 515 u s 177 187 1995 williams v bruffy 96 u s 176 185 1878

in order to determine whether a court has been properly appointed set up or established it is necessary to refer to a body of law that governs such matters i interpret common article 3 as looking to the domestic law of the appointing country because i am not aware of any international law standard regarding the way in which such a court must be appointed set up or established and because different countries with different government structures handle this matter differently accordingly a regularly constituted court is a court that has been appointed set up or established in accordance with the domestic law of the appointing countryiiin contrast to this interpretation the opinions supporting the judgment today hold that the military commission before which petitioner would be tried is not a regularly constituted court 1 because no evident practical need explains why its structure and composition    deviate from conventional courtmartial standards ante at 647 kennedy j concurring in part see also ante at 632633 opinion of the court and 2 because contrary to 10 u s c § 836b the procedures specified for use in the proceeding before the military commission impermissibly differ from those provided under the uniform code of military justice ucmj for use by courtsmartial ante at 615625 opinion of the court ante at 651653 kennedy j concurring in part i do not believe that either of these grounds is soundai see no basis for the courts holding that a military commission cannot be regarded as a regularly constituted court unless it is similar in structure and composition to a 728 regular military court or unless there is an evident practical need for the divergence there is no reason why a court that differs in structure or composition from an ordinary military court must be viewed as having been improperly constituted tribunals that vary significantly in structure composition and procedures may all be regularly or properly constituted consider for example a municipal court a state trial court of general jurisdiction an article i federal trial court a federal district court and an international court such as the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia although these courts are differently constituted and differ substantially in many other respects they are all regularly constituted

if common article 3 had been meant to require trial before a countrys military courts or courts that are similar in structure and composition the drafters almost certainly would have used language that expresses that thought more directly other provisions of the convention relative to the treatment of prisoners of war refer expressly to the ordinary military courts and expressly prescribe the uniformity principle that justice kennedy sees in common article 3 see ante at 643644 article 84 provides that a prisoner of war shall be tried only by a military court unless the existing laws of the detaining power expressly permit the civil courts to try a member of the armed forces of the detaining power in respect of the particular offence alleged to have been committed by the prisoner of war 6 u s t at 3382 article 87 states that prisoners of war may not be sentenced by the military authorities and courts of the detaining power to any penalties except those provided for in respect of members of the armed forces of the said power who have committed the same acts id at 3384 similarly article 66 of the geneva convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war—a provision to which the court looks for guidance in interpreting common article 3 see ante at 632—expressly provides that civilians 729 charged with committing crimes in occupied territory may be handed over by the occupying power to its properly constituted nonpolitical military courts on condition that the said courts sit in the occupied country 6 u s t 3516 35583560 t i a s no 3365 if common article 3 had been meant to incorporate a uniformity principle it presumably would have used language like that employed in the provisions noted above for these reasons i cannot agree with the courts conclusion that the military commission at issue here is not a regularly constituted court because its structure and composition differ from those of a courtmartial

contrary to the suggestion of the court see ante at 632 the commentary on article 66 of the fourth geneva convention does not undermine this conclusion as noted article 66 permits an occupying power to try civilians in its properly constituted nonpolitical military courts 6 u s t at 3558 the commentary on this provision states

the courts are to be regularly constituted this wording definitely excludes all special tribunals it is the ordinary military courts of the occupying power which will be competent 4 intl comm of red cross commentary geneva convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war 340 j pictet gen ed 1958 hereinafter gciv commentary
the court states that this commentary defines regularly constituted tribunals to include ordinary military courts and definitely exclude all special tribunals ante at 632 alteration in original this much is clear from the commentary itself yet the mere statement that a military court is a regularly constituted tribunal is of no help in addressing petitioners claim that his commission is not such a tribunal as for the commentarys mention of special tribunals it is doubtful whether we should take this gloss on article 66—which prohibits an occupying power from trying civilians in courts set up specially for that purpose—to tell 730 us much about the very different context addressed by common article 3

but even if common article 3 recognizes this prohibition on special tribunals that prohibition does not cover petitioners tribunal if special means anything in contradistinction to regular it would be in the sense of special as relating to a single thing and regular as uniform in course practice or occurrence websters third new international dictionary 2186 1913 insofar as respondents propose to conduct the tribunals according to the procedures of military commission order no 1 and orders promulgated thereunder—and nobody has suggested respondents intend otherwise—then it seems that petitioners tribunal like the hundreds of others respondents propose to conduct is very much regular and not at all specialbi also disagree with the courts conclusion that petitioners military commission is illegal ante at 625 because its procedures allegedly do not comply with 10 u s c § 836 even if § 836b unlike common article 3 does impose at least a limited uniformity requirement amongst the tribunals contemplated by the ucmj but see ante at 711712 thomas j dissenting and even if it is assumed for the sake of argument that some of the procedures specified in military commission order no 1 impermissibly deviate from courtmartial procedures it does not follow that the military commissions created by that order are not regularly constituted or that trying petitioner before such a commission would be inconsistent with the law of war if congress enacted a statute requiring the federal district courts to follow a procedure that is unconstitutional the statute would be invalid but the district courts would not likewise if some of the procedures that may be used in military commission proceedings are improper the appropriate remedy is to proscribe the use of those particular procedures not to outlaw 731 the commissions i see no justification for striking down the entire commission structure simply because it is possible that petitioners trial might involve the use of some procedure that is improperiiireturning to the three elements of common article 31 a court 2 that is appointed set up and established in compliance with domestic law and 3 that respects universally recognized fundamental rights—i conclude that all of these elements are satisfied in this caseafirst the commissions qualify as courts

second the commissions were appointed set up and established pursuant to an order of the president just like the commission in ex parte quirin 317 u s 1 1942 and the court acknowledges that quirin recognized that the statutory predecessor of 10 u s c § 821 preserved the presidents power to convene military commissions ante at 593 although justice kennedy concludes that an acceptable degree of independence from the executive is necessary to render a commission regularly constituted by the standards of our nations system of justice ante at 645 he offers no support for this proposition which in any event seems to be more about fairness or integrity than regularity the commission in quirin was certainly no more independent from the executive than the commissions at issue here and 10 u s c §§ 821 and 836 do not speak to this issue1

finally the commission procedures taken as a whole and including the availability of review by a united states court of appeals and by this court do not provide a basis for 732 deeming the commissions to be illegitimate the court questions the following two procedural rules the rule allowing the secretary of defense to change the governing rules from time to time which does not rule out midtrial changes see ante at 633 n 65 opinion of the court ante at 645 kennedy j concurring in part and the rule that permits the admission of any evidence that would have probative value to a reasonable person which departs from our legal systems usual rules of evidence see ante at 614615 623 opinion of the court ante at 651653 kennedy j concurring in part2 neither of these two rules undermines the legitimacy of the commissions

surely the entire commission structure cannot be stricken merely because it is possible that the governing rules might be changed during the course of one or more proceedings if a change is made and applied during the course of an ongoing proceeding and if the accused is found guilty the validity of that procedure can be considered in the review proceeding for that case after all not every midtrial change will be prejudicial a midtrial change might amend the governing rules in a way that is inconsequential or actually favorable to the accused

as for the standard for the admission of evidence at commission proceedings the court does not suggest that this rule violates the international standard incorporated into common article 3 the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples 6 u s t at 3320 rules of evidence differ from country to country and much of the world does not follow aspects of our evidence 733 rules such as the general prohibition against the admission of hearsay see e g blumenthal shedding some light on calls for hearsay reform civil law hearsay rules in historical and modern perspective 13 pace intl l rev 93 96101 2001 if a particular accused claims to have been unfairly prejudiced by the admission of particular evidence that claim can be reviewed in the review proceeding for that case it makes no sense to strike down the entire commission structure based on speculation that some evidence might be improperly admitted in some future case

in sum i believe that common article 3 is satisfied here because the military commissions 1 qualify as courts 2 that were appointed and established in accordance with domestic law and 3 any procedural improprieties that might occur in particular cases can be reviewed in those casesbthe commentary on common article 3 supports this interpretation the commentary on common article 3 ¶ 1d in its entirety statesalthough sentences and executions without a proper trial were common practice until quite recently they are nevertheless shocking to the civilized mind    sentences and executions without previous trial are too open to error summary justice may be effective on account of the fear it arouses    but it adds too many further innocent victims to all the other innocent victims of the conflict all civilized nations surround the administration of justice with safeguards aimed at eliminating the possibility of judicial errors the convention has rightly proclaimed that it is essential to do this even in time of war we must be very clear about one point it is only summary justice which it is intended to prohibit no sort of immunity is given to anyone under this provision there is nothing in it to prevent 734 a person presumed to be guilty from being arrested and so placed in a position where he can do no further harm and it leaves intact the right of the state to prosecute sentence and punish according to the law gciv commentary 39 emphasis addedit seems clear that the commissions at issue here meet this standard whatever else may be said about the system that was created by military commission order no 1 and augmented by the detainee treatment act § 1005e1 119 stat 2742 this system—which features formal trial procedures multiple levels of administrative review and the opportunity for review by a united states court of appeals and by this court—does not dispense summary justice

3 the penultimate subsections of § 1005 emphasize that the provision does not confer any constitutional right on an alien detained as an enemy combatant outside the united states and that the united states does not for purposes of § 1005 include guantanamo bay §§ 1005f—g

4 and be it further enacted that so much of the act approved february 5 1867 entitled an act to amend an act to establish the judicial courts of the united states approved september 24 1789 as authorized an appeal from the judgment of the circuit court to the supreme court of the united states or the exercise of any such jurisdiction by said supreme court on appeals which have been or may hereafter be taken be and the same is hereby repealed 7 wall at 508

5 see hughes aircraft co v united states ex rel schumer 520 u s 939 951 1997 the fact that courts often apply newly enacted jurisdictionallocating statutes to pending cases merely evidences certain limited circumstances failing to meet the conditions for our generally applicable presumption against retroactivity   

6 cf ibid statutes merely addressing which court shall have jurisdiction to entertain a particular cause of action can fairly be said merely to regulate the secondary conduct of litigation and not the underlying primary conduct of the parties emphasis in original

7 in his insistence to the contrary justice scalia reads too much into bruner v united states 343 u s 112 1952 hallowell v commons 239 u s 506 1916 and insurance co v ritchie 5 wall 541 1867 see post at 656658 dissenting opinion none of those cases says that the absence of an express provision reserving jurisdiction over pending cases trumps or renders irrelevant any other indications of congressional intent indeed bruner itself relied on such other indications—including a negative inference drawn from the statutory text cf infra at 578—to support its conclusion that jurisdiction was not available the court observed that 1 congress had been put on notice by prior lower court cases addressing the tucker act that it ought to specifically reserve jurisdiction over pending cases see 343 u s at 115 and 2 in contrast to the congressional silence concerning reservation of jurisdiction reservation had been made of any rights or liabilities existing at the effective date of the act repealed by another provision of the act ibid n 7

8 the question in lindh was whether new limitations on the availability of habeas relief imposed by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 aedpa 110 stat 1214 applied to habeas actions pending on the date of aedpas enactment we held that they did not at the outset we rejected the states argument that in the absence of a clear congressional statement to the contrary a procedural rule must apply to pending cases 521 u s at 326

9 that paragraph 1 along with paragraphs 2 and 3 is to take effect on the date of the enactment dta § 1005h1 119 stat 2743 is not dispositive a statement that a statute will become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date ins v st cyr 533 u s 289 317 2001 quoting landgraf v usi film products 511 u s 244 257 1994 certainly the effective date provision cannot bear the weight justice scalia would place on it see post at 659 and n 1 congress deemed that provision insufficient standing alone to render subsections e2 and e3 applicable to pending cases hence its adoption of subsection h2 justice scalia seeks to avoid reducing subsection h2 to a mere redundancy—a consequence he seems to acknowledge must otherwise follow from his interpretation—by speculating that congress had special reasons not also relevant to subsection e1 to worry that subsections e2 and e3 would be ruled inapplicable to pending cases as we explain infra at 582583 and n 12 that attempt fails

10 we note that statements made by senators preceding passage of the dta lend further support to what the text of the dta and its drafting history already make plain senator levin one of the sponsors of the final bill objected to earlier versions of the dtas effective date provision that would have made subsection e1 applicable to pending cases see e g 151 cong rec s12667 nov 10 2005 amendment proposed by sen graham that would have rendered what is now subsection e1 applicable to any application or other action that is pending on or after the date of the enactment of this act senator levin urged adoption of an alternative amendment that would apply only to new habeas cases filed after the date of enactment id at s12802 nov 15 2005 that alternative amendment became the text of subsection h2 in light of the extensive discussion of the dtas effect on pending cases prior to passage of the dta see e g id at s12664 nov 10 2005 id at s12755 nov 14 2005 id at s12799s12802 nov 15 2005 id at s14245 s14252s14253 s14257s14258 s14274s14275 dec 21 2005 it cannot be said that the changes to subsection h2 were inconsequential cf post at 668 scalia j dissenting

while statements attributed to the final bills two other sponsors senators graham and kyl arguably contradict senator levins contention that the final version of the dta preserved jurisdiction over pending habeas cases see 151 cong rec s14263s14264 dec 21 2005 those statements appear to have been inserted into the congressional record after the senate debate see reply brief for petitioner 5 n 6 see also 151 cong rec s14260 statement of sen kyl i would like to say a few words about the nowcompleted national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2006 emphasis added all statements made during the debate itself support senator levins understanding that the final text of the dta would not render subsection e1 applicable to pending cases see e g id at s14245 s14252s14253 s14274s14275 dec 21 2005 the statements that justice scalia cites as evidence to the contrary construe subsection e3 to strip this court of jurisdiction see post at 666 n 4 dissenting opinion quoting 151 cong rec s12796 nov 15 2005 statement of sen specter—a construction that the government has expressly disavowed in this litigation see n 11 infra the inapposite november 14 2005 statement of senator graham which justice scalia cites as evidence of that senators assumption that pending cases are covered post at 666 and n 3 citing 151 cong rec s12756 nov 14 2005 follows directly after the uncontradicted statement of his cosponsor senator levin assuring members of the senate that the amendment will not strip the courts of jurisdiction over pending cases id at s12755

11 the district of columbia circuits jurisdiction while exclusive in one sense would not bar this courts review on appeal from a decision under the dta see reply brief in support of respondents motion to dismiss 1617 n 12 while the dta does not expressly call for supreme court review of the district of columbia circuits decisions sections 1005e2 and 3    do not remove this courts jurisdiction over such decisions under 28 u s c § 12541

12 this assertion is itself highly questionable the cases that justice scalia cites to support his distinction are republic of austria v altmann 541 u s 677 2004 and hughes aircraft co v united states ex rel schumer 520 u s 939 1997 see post at 662 while the court in both of those cases recognized that statutes creating jurisdiction may have retroactive effect if they affect substantive rights see altmann 541 u s at 695 and n 15 hughes aircraft 520 u s at 951 we have applied the same analysis to statutes that have jurisdictionstripping effect see lindh v murphy 521 u s 320 327328 1997 id at 342343 rehnquist c j dissenting construing aedpas amendments as ousting jurisdiction

13 see landgraf 511 u s at 271 n 25 observing that the great majority of our decisions relying upon the antiretroactivity presumption have involved intervening statutes burdening private parties though we have applied the presumption in cases involving new monetary obligations that fell only on the government emphasis added see also altmann 541 u s at 728729 kennedy j dissenting explaining that if retroactivity concerns do not arise when a new monetary obligation is imposed on the united states it is because congress by virtue of authoring the legislation is itself fully capable of protecting the federal government from having its rights degraded by retroactive laws

14 there may be habeas cases that were pending in the lower courts at the time the dta was enacted that do qualify as challenges to final decisions within the meaning of subsection e2 or e3 we express no view about whether the dta would require transfer of such an action to the d c circuit

15 because we conclude that § 1005e1 does not strip federal courts jurisdiction over cases pending on the date of the dtas enactment we do not decide whether if it were otherwise this court would nonetheless retain jurisdiction to hear hamdans appeal cf supra at 575 nor do we decide the manner in which the canon of constitutional avoidance should affect subsequent interpretation of the dta see e g st cyr 533 u s at 300 a construction of a statute that would entirely preclude review of a pure question of law by any court would give rise to substantial constitutional questions

16 councilman distinguished service personnel from civilians whose challenges to ongoing military proceedings are cognizable in federal court see e g united states ex rel toth v quarles 350 u s 11 1955 as we explained in councilman abstention is not appropriate in cases in which individuals raise substantial arguments denying the right of the military to try them at all and in which the legal challenge turns on the status of the persons as to whom the military asserted its power 420 u s at 759 quoting noyd v bond 395 u s 683 696 n 8 1969 in other words we do not apply councilman abstention when there is a substantial question whether a military tribunal has personal jurisdiction over the defendant because we conclude that abstention is inappropriate for a more basic reason we need not consider whether the jurisdictional exception recognized in councilman applies here

17 see also noyd 395 u s at 694696 noting that the court of military appeals consisted of disinterested civilian judges and concluding that there was no reason for the court to address an air force captains argument that he was entitled to remain free from confinement pending appeal of his conviction by courtmartial when the highest military court stands ready to consider petitioners arguments cf parisi v davidson 405 u s 34 4143 1972 under accepted principles of comity the court should stay its hand only if the relief the petitioner seeks    would also be available to him with reasonable promptness and certainty through the machinery of the military judicial system in its processing of the courtmartial charge

18 if he chooses the president may delegate this ultimate decisionmaking authority to the secretary of defense see § 6h6

19 justice scalia chides us for failing to include the d c circuits review powers under the dta in our description of the review mechanism erected by commission order no 1 see post at 675 whether or not the limited review permitted under the dta may be treated as akin to the plenary review exercised by the court of appeals for the armed forces petitioner here is not afforded a right to such review see infra at 616 § 1005e3 119 stat 2743

20 having correctly declined to abstain from addressing hamdans challenge to the lawfulness of the military commission convened to try him the court of appeals suggested that councilman abstention nonetheless applied to bar its consideration of one of hamdans arguments—namely that his commission violated article 3 of the third geneva convention 6 u s t 3316 3318 see part vi infra although the court of appeals rejected the article 3 argument on the merits it also stated that because the challenge was not jurisdictional it did not fall within the exception that schlesinger v councilman 420 u s 738 1975 recognized for defendants who raise substantial arguments that a military tribunal lacks personal jurisdiction over them see 415 f 3d at 42

in reaching this conclusion the court of appeals conflated two distinct inquiries 1 whether hamdan has raised a substantial argument that the military commission lacks authority to try him and more fundamentally 2 whether the comity considerations underlying councilman apply to trigger the abstention principle in the first place as the court of appeals acknowledged at the beginning of its opinion the first question warrants consideration only if the answer to the second is yes see 415 f 3d at 3637 since as the court of appeals properly concluded the answer to the second question is in fact no there is no need to consider any exception

at any rate it appears that the exception would apply here as discussed in part vi infra hamdan raises a substantial argument that because the military commission that has been convened to try him is not a regularly constituted court under the geneva conventions it is ultra vires and thus lacks jurisdiction over him brief for petitioner 5

21 see also winthrop 831 in general it is those provisions of the constitution which empower congress to declare war and raise armies and which in authorizing the initiation of war authorize the employment of all necessary and proper agencies for its due prosecution from which this tribunal derives its original sanction emphasis in original

22 article 15 was first adopted as part of the articles of war in 1916 see act of aug 29 1916 ch 418 § 3 art 15 39 stat 652 when the articles of war were codified and reenacted as the ucmj in 1950 congress determined to retain article 15 because it had been construed by the supreme court ex parte quirin 317 u s 1 1942 s rep no 486 81st cong 1st sess 13 1949

23 whether or not the president has independent power absent congressional authorization to convene military commissions he may not disregard limitations that congress has in proper exercise of its own war powers placed on his powers see youngstown sheet  tube co v sawyer 343 u s 579 637 1952 jackson j concurring the government does not argue otherwise

24 on this point it is noteworthy that the court in ex parte quirin 317 u s 1 1942 looked beyond congress declaration of war and accompanying authorization for use of force during world war ii and relied instead on article of war 15 to find that congress had authorized the use of military commissions in some circumstances see id at 2629 justice thomas assertion that we commit error in reading article 21 of the ucmj to place limitations upon the presidents use of military commissions see post at 682 dissenting opinion ignores the reasoning in quirin

25 the justification for and limitations on these commissions were summarized in milligan

if in foreign invasion or civil war the courts are actually closed and it is impossible to administer criminal justice according to law then on the theatre of active military operations where war really prevails there is a necessity to furnish a substitute for the civil authority thus overthrown to preserve the safety of the army and society and as no power is left but the military it is allowed to govern by martial rule until the laws can have their free course as necessity creates the rule so it limits its duration for if this government is continued after the courts are reinstated it is a gross usurpation of power martial rule can never exist where the courts are open and in the proper and unobstructed exercise of their jurisdiction it is also confined to the locality of actual war 4 wall at 127 emphasis in original

26 the limitations on these occupied territory or military government commissions are tailored to the tribunals purpose and the exigencies that necessitate their use they may be employed pending the establishment of civil government madsen 343 u s at 354355 which may in some cases extend beyond the cessation of hostilities id at 348

27 so much may not be evident on cold review of the civil war trials often cited as precedent for this kind of tribunal because the commissions established during that conflict operated as both martial law or military government tribunals and lawofwar commissions hence military commanders began the practice during the civil war of using the same name the same rules and often the same tribunals to try both ordinary crimes and war crimes bickers 34 tex tech l rev at 908 for the first time accused horse thieves and alleged saboteurs found themselves subject to trial by the same military commission id at 909 the civil war precedents must therefore be considered with caution as we recognized in quirin 317 u s at 29 and as further discussed below commissions convened during time of war but under neither martial law nor military government may try only offenses against the law of war

28 if the commission is established pursuant to martial law or military government its jurisdiction extends to offenses committed within the exercise of military government or martial law winthrop 837

31 justice thomas would treat usama bin ladens 1996 declaration of jihad against americans as the inception of the war see post at 683688 dissenting opinion but even the government does not go so far although the united states had for some time prior to the attacks of september 11 2001 been aggressively pursuing al qaeda neither in the charging document nor in submissions before this court has the government asserted that the presidents war powers were activated prior to september 11 2001 cf brief for respondents 25 describing the events of september 11 2001 as an act of war that triggered a right to deploy military forces abroad to defend the united states by combating al qaeda justice thomas further argument that the aumf is backward looking and therefore authorizes trial by military commission of crimes that occurred prior to the inception of war is insupportable see post at 685 n 3 if nothing else article 21 of the ucmj requires that the president comply with the law of war in his use of military commissions as explained in the text the law of war permits trial only of offenses committed within the period of the war winthrop 837 see also quirin 317 u s at 2829 observing that lawofwar military commissions may be used to try those enemies who in their attempt to thwart or impede our military effort have violated the law of war emphasis added the sources that justice thomas relies on to suggest otherwise simply do not support his position colonel greens short exegesis on military commissions cites howland for the proposition that offenses committed before a formal declaration of war or before the declaration of martial law may be tried by military commission the military commission 42 am j intl l 832 848 1948 emphasis added cited post at 686 assuming that to be true nothing in our analysis turns on the admitted absence of either a formal declaration of war or a declaration of martial law our focus instead is on the september 11 2001 attacks that the government characterizes as the relevant acts of war and on the measure that authorized the presidents deployment of military force— the aumf because we do not question the governments position that the war commenced with the events of september 11 2001 the prize cases 2 black 635 1863 cited post at 679 684 685 and 687 thomas j dissenting are not germane to the analysis

finally justice thomas assertion that julius otto kuehns trial by military commission for conspiring with japanese officials to betray the united states fleet to the imperial japanese government prior to its attack on pearl harbor stands as authoritative precedent for hamdans trial by commission post at 686 misses the mark in three critical respects first kuehn was tried for federal espionage crimes under what were then 50 u s c §§ 31 32 and 34 not with commonlaw violations of the law of war see hearings before the joint committee on the investigation of the pearl harbor attack 79th cong 1st sess pt 30 pp 30673069 1946 second he was tried by martial law commission a kind of commission justice thomas acknowledges is not relevant to the analysis here and whose jurisdiction extends to offenses committed within the exercise of   martial law winthrop 837 see n 28 supra not a commission established exclusively to try violations of the law of war see winthrop 837 third the martial law commissions established to try crimes in hawaii were ultimately declared illegal by this court see duncan v kahanamoku 327 u s 304 324 1946 the phrase martial law as employed in the hawaiian organic act while intended to authorize the military to act vigorously for the maintenance of an orderly civil government and for the defense of the islands against actual or threatened rebellion or invasion was not intended to authorize the supplanting of courts by military tribunals

32 justice thomas adopts the remarkable view not advocated by the government that the charging document in this case actually includes more than one charge conspiracy and several other illdefined crimes like joining an organization that has a criminal purpose being a guerrilla and aiding the enemy see post at 693697 and n 9 there are innumerable problems with this approach

first the crimes justice thomas identifies were not actually charged it is one thing to observe that charges before a military commission need not be stated with the precision of a common law indictment post at 692 n 7 it is quite another to say that a crime not charged may nonetheless be read into an indictment second the government plainly had available to it the tools and the time it needed to charge petitioner with the various crimes justice thomas refers to if it believed they were supported by the allegations as justice thomas himself observes see post at 697 the crime of aiding the enemy may in circumstances where the accused owes allegiance to the party whose enemy he is alleged to have aided be triable by military commission pursuant to article 104 of the ucmj 10 u s c § 904 indeed the government has charged detainees under this provision when it has seen fit to do so see brief for david hicks as amicus curiae 7

third the cases justice thomas relies on to show that hamdan may be guilty of violations of the law of war not actually charged do not support his argument justice thomas begins by blurring the distinction between those categories of offender who may be tried by military commission e g jayhawkers and the like with the offenses that may be so tried even when it comes to being a guerrilla cf post at 695 n 9 a label alone does not render a person susceptible to execution or other criminal punishment the charge of being a guerrilla invariably is accompanied by the allegation that the defendant took up arms as such this is because as explained by judge advocate general holt in a decision upholding the charge of being a guerrilla as one recognized by the universal usage of the times the charge is simply shorthand akin to being a spy for the perpetration of a succession of similar acts of violence record books of the judge advocate general office r 3 590 the sources cited by justice thomas confirm as much see cases cited post at 694695 n 9

likewise the suggestion that the nuremberg precedents support hamdans conviction for the uncharged crime of joining a criminal organization must fail cf post at 695697 the convictions of certain highlevel nazi officials for membership in a criminal organization were secured pursuant to specific provisions of the charter of the international military tribunal that permitted indictment of individual organization members following convictions of the organizations themselves see arts 9 and 10 in 1 trial of the major war criminals before the international military tribunal nuremberg 14 november 19451 october 1946 p 12 1947 the initial plan to use organizations convictions as predicates for mass individual trials ultimately was abandoned see t taylor anatomy of the nuremberg trials a personal memoir 584585 638 1992

33 cf 10 u s c § 904 making triable by military commission the crime of aiding the enemy § 906 same for spying war crimes act of 1996 18 u s c § 2441 2000 ed and supp iii listing war crimes foreign operations export financing and related appropriations act 1998 § 583 111 stat 2436 same

34 while the common law necessarily is evolutionary in nature post at 689 thomas j dissenting even in jurisdictions where commonlaw crimes are still part of the penal framework an act does not become a crime without its foundations having been firmly established in precedent see e g queen v rimmington 2006 2 all e r 257 275279 2005 house of lords id at 279 while some degree of vagueness is inevitable and development of the law is a recognised feature of common law courts    the lawmaking function of the courts must remain within reasonable limits see also rogers v tennessee 532 u s 451 472478 2001 scalia j dissenting the caution that must be exercised in the incremental development of commonlaw crimes by the judiciary is for the reasons explained in the text all the more critical when reviewing developments that stem from military action

35 the 19thcentury trial of the lincoln conspirators even if properly classified as a trial by lawofwar commission cf w rehnquist all the laws but one civil liberties in wartime 165167 1998 analyzing the conspiracy charges in light of ordinary criminal law principles at the time is at best an equivocal exception although the charge against the defendants in that case accused them of combining confederating and conspiring together to murder the president they were also charged as we read the indictment cf post at 699700 n 12 thomas j dissenting with maliciously unlawfully and traitorously murdering the said abraham lincoln h r doc no 314 55th cong 3d sess 696 1899 moreover the attorney general who wrote the opinion defending the trial by military commission treated the charge as if it alleged the substantive offense of assassination see 11 op atty gen 297 1865 analyzing the propriety of trying by military commission the offence of having assassinated the president see also mudd v caldera 134 f supp 2d 138 140 dc 2001

36 by contrast the geneva conventions do extend liability for substantive war crimes to those who order their commission see third geneva convention art 129 6 u s t at 3418 and this court has read the fourth hague convention of 1907 to impose command responsibility on military commanders for acts of their subordinates see yamashita 327 u s at 1516

37 the other examples justice thomas offers are no more availing the civil war indictment against robert louden cited post at 702 alleged a conspiracy but not one in violation of the law of war see war dept general court martial order no 41 p 20 1864 a separate charge of transgression of the laws and customs of war made no mention of conspiracy id at 17 the charge against lenger grenfel and others for conspiring to release rebel prisoners held in chicago only supports the observation made in the text that the civil war tribunals often charged hybrid crimes mixing elements of crimes ordinarily triable in civilian courts like treason and violations of the law of war judge advocate general holt in recommending that grenfels death sentence be upheld it was in fact commuted by presidential decree see h r doc no 314 at 725 explained that the accused united himself with traitors and malefactors for the overthrow of our republic in the interest of slavery id at 689

38 the court in quirin assumed that there are acts regarded in other countries or by some writers on international law as offenses against the law of war which would not be triable by military tribunal here either because they are not recognized by our courts as violations of the law of war or because they are of that class of offenses constitutionally triable only by a jury 317 u s at 29 we need not test the validity of that assumption here because the international sources only corroborate the domestic ones

39 accordingly the tribunal determined to disregard the charges    that the defendants conspired to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity 22 trial of major war criminals 469 see also ibid the charter does not define as a separate crime any conspiracy except the one to commit acts of aggressive war

40 see also 15 united nations war crimes commissions law reports of trials of war criminals 9091 1949 observing that although a few individuals were charged with conspiracy under european domestic criminal codes following world war ii the united states military tribunals established at that time did not recognise as a separate offence conspiracy to commit war crimes or crimes against humanity the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia icty drawing on the nuremberg precedents has adopted a joint criminal enterprise theory of liability but that is a species of liability for the substantive offense akin to aiding and abetting not a crime on its own see prosecutor v tadić judgment case no it941a icty app chamber july 15 1999 see also prosecutor v milutinović decision on dragoljub ojdanićs motion challenging jurisdiction— joint criminal enterprise case no it9937ar72 ¶ 26 icty app chamber may 21 2003 stating that criminal liability pursuant to a joint criminal enterprise is not a liability for    conspiring to commit crimes

41 justice thomas suggestion that our conclusion precludes the government from bringing to justice those who conspire to commit acts of terrorism is therefore wide of the mark see post at 686 n 3 704706 that conspiracy is not a violation of the law of war triable by military commission does not mean the government may not for example prosecute by courtmartial or in federal court those caught plotting terrorist atrocities like the bombing of the khobar towers post at 705

42 the accused also may be excluded from the proceedings if he engages in disruptive conduct § 5k

43 as the district court observed this section apparently permits reception of testimony from a confidential informant in circumstances where hamdan will not be permitted to hear the testimony see the witnesss face or learn his name if the government has information developed by interrogation of witnesses in afghanistan or elsewhere it can offer such evidence in transcript form or even as summaries of transcripts 344 f supp 2d 152 168 dc 2004

44 any decision of the commission is not final until the president renders it so see commission order no 1 § 6h6

45 see winthrop 835 and n 81 military commissions are constituted and composed and their proceedings are conducted similarly to general courtsmartial id at 841842 s rep no 130 64th cong 1st sess 40 1916 testimony of gen crowder both classes of courts have the same procedure see also e g h coppée field manual of courtsmartial 105 1863 military commissions are appointed by the same authorities as those which may order courtsmartial they are constituted in a manner similar to such courts and their proceedings are conducted in exactly the same way as to form examination of witnesses etc

46 the dissenters views are summarized in the following passage

it is outside our basic scheme to condemn men without giving reasonable opportunity for preparing defense in capital or other serious crimes to convict on official documents    affidavits    documents or translations thereof diaries    photographs motion picture films and    newspapers or on hearsay once twice or thrice removed more particularly when the documentary evidence or some of it is prepared ex parte by the prosecuting authority and includes not only opinion but conclusions of guilt nor in such cases do we deny the rights of confrontation of witnesses and crossexamination yamashita 327 u s at 44 footnotes omitted

47 article 2 of the ucmj now reads

a the following persons are subject to the ucmj



9 prisoners of war in custody of the armed forces



12 subject to any treaty or agreement to which the united states is or may be a party or to any accepted rule of international law persons within an area leased by or otherwise reserved or acquired for the use of the united states which is under the control of the secretary concerned and which is outside the united states and outside the commonwealth of puerto rico guam and the virgin islands 10 u s c § 802a

guantanamo bay is such a leased area see rasul v bush 542 u s 466 471 2004

48 the international committee of the red cross is referred to by name in several provisions of the 1949 geneva conventions and is the body that drafted and published the official commentary to the conventions though not binding law the commentary is as the parties recognize relevant in interpreting the conventions provisions

49 aside from articles 21 and 36 discussed at length in the text the other seven articles that expressly reference military commissions are 1 28 requiring appointment of reporters and interpreters 2 47 making it a crime to refuse to appear or testify before a courtmartial military commission court of inquiry or any other military court or board 3 48 allowing a courtmartial provost court or military commission to punish a person for contempt 4 49d permitting admission into evidence of a duly authenticated deposition taken upon reasonable notice to the other parties only if admissible under the rules of evidence and only if the witness is otherwise unavailable 5 50 permitting admission into evidence of records of courts of inquiry if otherwise admissible under the rules of evidence and if certain other requirements are met 6 104 providing that a person accused of aiding the enemy may be sentenced to death or other punishment by military commission or courtmartial and 7 106 mandating the death penalty for spies convicted before military commission or courtmartial

50 justice thomas relies on the legislative history of the ucmj to argue that congress adoption of article 36b in the wake of world war ii was motivated solely by a desire for uniformity across the separate branches of the armed services post at 711 but even if congress was concerned with ensuring uniformity across service branches that does not mean it did not also intend to codify the longstanding practice of procedural parity between courtsmartial and other military tribunals indeed the suggestion that congress did not intend uniformity across tribunal types is belied by the textual proximity of subsection a which requires that the rules governing criminal trials in federal district courts apply absent the presidents determination of impracticability to courtsmartial provost courts and military commissions alike and subsection b which imposes the uniformity requirement

51 we may assume that such a determination would be entitled to a measure of deference for the reasons given by justice kennedy see post at 640 opinion concurring in part however the level of deference accorded to a determination made under subsection b presumably would not be as high as that accorded to a determination under subsection a

52 justice thomas looks not to the presidents official article 36a determination but instead to press statements made by the secretary of defense and the under secretary of defense for policy see post at 712713 dissenting opinion we have not heretofore in evaluating the legality of executive action deferred to comments made by such officials to the media moreover the only additional reason the comments provide—aside from the general danger posed by international terrorism —for departures from courtmartial procedures is the need to protect classified information as we explain in the text and as justice kennedy elaborates in his separate opinion the structural and procedural defects of hamdans commission extend far beyond rules preventing access to classified information

53 justice thomas relies extensively on madsen for the proposition that the president has free rein to set the procedures that govern military commissions see post at 706707 709 n 16 710 and 721 that reliance is misplaced not only did madsen not involve a lawofwar military commission but 1 the petitioner there did not challenge the procedures used to try her 2 the ucmj with its new article 36b did not become effective until may 31 1951 after the petitioners trial see 343 u s at 345 n 6 and 3 the procedures used to try the petitioner actually afforded more protection than those used in courtsmartial see id at 358360 see also id at 358 the military government courts for germany    have had a less military character than that of courtsmartial

54 prior to the enactment of article 36b it may well have been the case that a deviation from the rules governing courtsmartial would not have rendered the military commission illegal post at 707 n 15 thomas j dissenting quoting winthrop 841 article 36b however imposes a statutory command that must be heeded

55 justice thomas makes the different argument that hamdans geneva convention challenge is not yet ripe because he has yet to be sentenced see post at 719720 this is really just a species of the abstention argument we have already rejected see part iii supra the text of the geneva conventions does not direct an accused to wait until sentence is imposed to challenge the legality of the tribunal that is to try him

56 as explained in part vi—c supra that is no longer true under the 1949 conventions

57 but see e g 4 intl comm of red cross commentary geneva convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war 21 j pictet gen ed 1958 hereinafter gciv commentary the 1949 geneva conventions were written first and foremost to protect individuals and not to serve state interests gciii commentary 91 it was not   until the conventions of 1949    that the existence of rights conferred on prisoners of war was affirmed

59 for conveniences sake we use citations to the third geneva convention only

60 the president has stated that the conflict with the taliban is a conflict to which the geneva conventions apply see white house memorandum humane treatment of taliban and al qaeda detainees 2 feb 7 2002 available at httpwwwjusticescholarsorgpegcarchivewhitehousebushmemo20020207edpdf

61 hamdan observes that article 5 of the third geneva convention requires that if there be any doubt whether he is entitled to prisonerofwar protections he must be afforded those protections until his status is determined by a competent tribunal 6 u s t at 3324 see also headquarters depts of army navy air force and marine corps army regulation 1908 enemy prisoners of war retained personnel civilian internees and other detainees 1997 app 116 because we hold that hamdan may not in any event be tried by the military commission the president has convened pursuant to the november 13 order and commission order no 1 the question whether his potential status as a prisoner of war independently renders illegal his trial by military commission may be reserved

62 the term party here has the broadest possible meaning a party need neither be a signatory of the convention nor even represent a legal entity capable of undertaking international obligations gciii commentary 37

63 see also id at 35 common article 3 has the merit of being simple and clear    its observance does not depend upon preliminary discussions on the nature of the conflict gciv commentary 51 nobody in enemy hands can be outside the law u s army judge advocate generals legal center and school dept of the army law of war workshop deskbook 228 june 2000 reprint 2004 common article 3 serves as a minimum yardstick of protection in all conflicts not just internal armed conflicts quoting nicaragua v united states 1986 i c j 14 ¶ 218 25 i l m 1023 prosecutor v tadić case no it941 decision on the defence motion for interlocutory appeal on jurisdiction ¶ 102 icty app chamber oct 2 1995 stating that the character of the conflict is irrelevant in deciding whether common article 3 applies

64 the commentarys assumption that the terms properly constituted and regularly constituted are interchangeable is beyond reproach the french version of article 66 which is equally authoritative uses the term régulièrement constitués in place of properly constituted 6 u s t at 3559

65 further evidence of this tribunals irregular constitution is the fact that its rules and procedures are subject to change midtrial at the whim of the executive see commission order no 1 § 11 providing that the secretary of defense may change the governing rules from time to time

66 other international instruments to which the united states is a signatory include the same basic protections set forth in article 75 see e g international covenant on civil and political rights art 14 ¶ 3d mar 23 1976 999 u n t s 171 setting forth the right of an accused to be tried in his presence and to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing following world war ii several defendants were tried and convicted by military commission for violations of the law of war in their failure to afford captives fair trials before imposition and execution of sentence in two such trials the prosecutors argued that the defendants failure to apprise accused individuals of all evidence against them constituted violations of the law of war see 5 u n war crimes commission law reports of trials of war criminals 25 30 1948 reprint 1997 trial of sergeantmajor shigeru ohashi 66 75 trial of general tanaka hisakasu

67 the government offers no defense of these procedures other than to observe that the defendant may not be barred from access to evidence if such action would deprive him of a full and fair trial commission order no 1 § 6d5b but the government suggests no circumstances in which it would be fair to convict the accused based on evidence he has not seen or heard cf crawford v washington 541 u s 36 49 2004 it is a rule of the common law founded on natural justice that no man shall be prejudiced by evidence which he had not the liberty to cross examine quoting state v webb 2 n c 103 104 super l  eq 1794 per curiam diaz v united states 223 u s 442 455 1912 describing the right to be present as scarcely less important to the accused than the right of trial itself lewis v united states 146 u s 370 372 1892 exclusion of defendant from part of proceedings is contrary to the dictates of humanity internal quotation marks omitted joint antifascist refugee comm v mcgrath 341 u s 123 170 n 17 171 1951 frankfurter j concurring the plea that evidence of guilt must be secret is abhorrent to free men internal quotation marks omitted more fundamentally the legality of a tribunal under common article 3 cannot be established by bare assurances that whatever the character of the court or the procedures it follows individual adjudicators will act fairlyscalia dissent footnotes1 the court apparently believes that the effectivedate provision means nothing at all that paragraph 1 along with paragraphs 2 and 3 is to take effect on the date of the enactment dta § 1005h1 119 stat 2743 is not dispositive says the court ante at 579 n 9 the courts authority for this conclusion is its quote from ins v st cyr 533 u s 289 317 2001 to the effect that a statement that a statute will become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date ante at 579 n 9 emphasis added and internal quotation marks omitted but this quote merely restates the obvious an effectivedate provision does not render a statute applicable to conduct that occurred at an earlier date but of course it renders the statute applicable to conduct that occurs on the effective date and all future dates—such as the courts exercise of jurisdiction here the court seems to suggest that because the effectivedate provision does not authorize retroactive application it also fails to authorize prospective application and is thus useless verbiage this cannot be true

2 a comparison with lindh v murphy 521 u s 320 1997 shows this not to be true subsections e2 and e3 of § 1005 resemble the provisions of aedpa at issue in lindh whose retroactivity as applied to pending cases the lindh majority did not rule upon see id at 326 in that they go beyond mere procedure id at 327 they impose novel and unprecedented disabilities on the executive branch in its conduct of military affairs subsection e2 imposes judicial review on the combatant status review tribunals csrts whose implementing order did not subject them to review by article iii courts see memorandum from deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz re order establishing combatant status review tribunals p 3 § h july 7 2004 available at http wwwdefenselinkmilnewsjul2004d20040707reviewpdf all internet materials as visited june 27 2006 and available in clerk of courts case file subsection e3 authorizes the d c circuit to review the validity of any final decision rendered pursuant to military commission order no 1 § 1005e3a 119 stat 2743 historically federal courts have never reviewed the validity of the final decision of any military commission their jurisdiction has been restricted to considering the commissions lawful authority to hear decide and condemn in re yamashita 327 u s 1 8 1946 emphasis added see also johnson v eisentrager 339 u s 763 786787 1950 thus contrary to the courts suggestion ante at 581 582 subsections e2 and e3 confer new jurisdiction they impose judicial oversight on a traditionally unreviewable exercise of military authority by the commander in chief they arguably speak not just to the power of a particular court but to    substantive rights    as well hughes aircraft co v united states ex rel schumer 520 u s 939 951 1997—namely the unreviewable powers of the president our recent cases had reiterated that the executive is protected by the presumption against retroactivity in such comparatively trivial contexts as suits for tax refunds and increased pay see landgraf v usi film products 511 u s 244 271 n 25 1994

6 the court asserts that it cannot be said that the changes to subsection h2 were inconsequential ante at 580 n 10 but the courts sole evidence is the selfserving floor statements that it selectively cites

7 petitioner also urges that he could be subject to indefinite delay if military officials and the president are deliberately dilatory in reviewing the decision of his commission in reviewing the constitutionality of legislation we generally presume that the executive will implement its provisions in good faith and it is unclear in any event that delay would inflict any injury on petitioner who after an adverse determination by his csrt see 344 f supp 2d 152 161 dc 2004 is already subject to indefinite detention under our decision in hamdi v rumsfeld 542 u s 507 2004 plurality opinion moreover the mere possibility of delay does not render an alternative remedy inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of a military commission trial swain v pressley 430 u s 372 381 1977 in an analogous context we discounted the notion that postponement of relief until postconviction review inflicted any cognizable injury on a serviceman charged before a military courtmartial schlesinger v councilman 420 u s 738 754755 1975 see also younger v harris 401 u s 37 46 1971

8 the very purpose of article iis creation of a civilian commander in chief in the president of the united states was to generate structural insulation from military influence see the federalist no 28 a hamilton id no 69 same we do not live under a military junta it is a disservice to both those in the armed forces and the president to suggest that the president is subject to the undue control of the military

9 in rejecting our analysis the court observes that appeals to the d c circuit under subsection e3 are discretionary rather than as of right when the military commission imposes a sentence less than 10 years imprisonment see ante at 588 n 19 616 § 1005e3b 119 stat 2743 the relevance of this observation to the abstention question is unfathomable the fact that article iii review is discretionary does not mean that it lacks structural insulation from military influence ante at 587 and its discretionary nature presents no obstacle to the courts future review of these cases

the court might more cogently have relied on the discretionary nature of review to argue that the statute provides an inadequate substitute for habeas review under the suspension clause see supra at 670672 but this argument would have no force even if all appeals to the d c circuit were discretionary the exercise of habeas jurisdiction has traditionally been entirely a matter of the courts equitable discretion see withrow v williams 507 u s 680 715718 1993 scalia j concurring in part and dissenting in part so the fact that habeas jurisdiction is replaced by discretionary appellate review does not render the substitution inadequate swain 430 u s at 381thomas dissent1 as previously noted article 15 of the articles of war was the predecessor of article 21 of the ucmj article 21 provides as follows the provisions of this chapter conferring jurisdiction upon courtsmartial do not deprive military commissions provost courts or other military tribunals of concurrent jurisdiction with respect to offenders or offenses that by statute or by the law of war may be tried by military commissions provost courts or other military tribunals 10 u s c § 821

2 although the president very well may have inherent authority to try unlawful combatants for violations of the law of war before military commissions we need not decide that question because congress has authorized the president to do so cf hamdi v rumsfeld 542 u s 507 587 2004 thomas j dissenting same conclusion respecting detention of unlawful combatants

3 even if the formal declaration of war were generally the determinative act in ascertaining the temporal reach of the jurisdiction of a military commission the aumf itself is inconsistent with the pluralitys suggestion that such a rule is appropriate in this case see ante at 598600 612 the text of the aumf is backward looking authorizing the use of all necessary and appropriate force against those nations organizations or persons he determines planned authorized committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on september 11 2001 § 2a 115 stat 224 thus the presidents decision to try hamdan by military commission—a use of force authorized by the aumf—for hamdans involvement with al qaeda prior to september 11 2001 fits comfortably within the framework of the aumf in fact bringing the september 11 conspirators to justice is the primary point of the aumf by contrast on the pluralitys logic the aumf would not grant the president the authority to try usama bin laden himself for his involvement in the events of september 11 2001

4 the plurality suggests these authorities are inapplicable because nothing in its analysis turns on the admitted absence of either a formal declaration of war or a declaration of martial law our focus instead is on the    aumf ante at 599 n 31 the difference identified by the plurality is purely semantic both green and howland confirm that the date of the enactment that establishes a legal basis for forming military commissions—whether it be a declaration of war a declaration of martial law or an authorization to use military force—does not limit the jurisdiction of military commissions to offenses committed after that date

5 the plurality attempts to evade the import of this historical example by observing that kuehn was tried before a martial law commission for a violation of federal espionage statutes ibid as an initial matter the fact that kuehn was tried before a martial law commission for an offense committed prior to the establishment of martial law provides strong support for the presidents contention that he may try hamdan for offenses committed prior to the enactment of the aumf here the aumf serves the same function as the declaration of martial law in hawaii in 1941 establishing legal authority for the constitution of military commissions moreover kuehn was not tried and punished by statute but by the laws and usages of war united states v kuehn board of review 6 office of the military governor hawaii 1942 indeed in upholding the imposition of the death penalty a sentence not authorized by the espionage statutes id at 5 kuehns board of review explained that the fact that persons may be tried and punished    by a military commission for committing acts defined as offenses by    federal statutes does not mean that such persons are being tried for violations of such    statutes they are instead being tried for acts made offenses only by orders of the    commanding general id at 6 lastly the import of this example is not undermined by duncan v kahanamoku 327 u s 304 1946 the question before the court in that case involved only whether loyal civilians in loyal territory should have their daily conduct governed by military orders id at 319 it did not involve the wellestablished power of the military to exercise jurisdiction over    enemy belligerents id at 313

6 indeed respecting the present conflict the president has found that the war against terrorism ushers in a new paradigm one in which groups with broad international reach commit horrific acts against innocent civilians sometimes with the direct support of states our nation recognizes that this new paradigm—ushered in not by us but by terrorists—requires new thinking in the law of war app 3435 under the courts approach the presidents ability to address this new paradigm of inflicting death and mayhem would be completely frozen by rules developed in the context of conventional warfare

7 it is true that both of these separate offenses are charged under a single heading entitled charge conspiracy app to pet for cert 65a but that does not mean that they must be treated as a single crime when the law of war treats them as separate crimes as we acknowledged in in re yamashita 327 u s 1 1946 charges of violations of the law of war triable before a military tribunal need not be stated with the precision of a common law indictment id at 17 cf w birkhimer military government and martial law 536 3d rev ed 1914 hereinafter birkhimer it would be extremely absurd to expect the same precision in a charge brought before a courtmartial as is required to support a conviction before a justice of the peace internal quotation marks omitted

nevertheless the plurality contends that hamdan was not actually charged ante at 601 n 32 emphasis deleted with being a member in a warcriminal organization but that position is demonstrably wrong hamdans charging document expressly charges that he willfully and knowingly joined an enterprise of persons who shared a common criminal purpose app to pet for cert 65a moreover the pluralitys contention that we may only look to the label affixed to the charge to determine if the charging document alleges an offense triable by military commission is flatly inconsistent with its treatment of the civil war cases—where it accepts as valid charges that did not appear in the heading or title of the charging document or even the listed charge itself but only in the supporting specification see e g ante at 609 discussing the military commission trial of wirz for example in the wirz case wirz was charged with conspiring to violate the laws of war and that charge was supported with allegations that he personally committed a number of atrocities the plurality concludes that military commission jurisdiction was appropriate in that case not based upon the charge of conspiracy but rather based upon the allegations of various atrocities in the specification which were not separately charged ante at 609 just as these atrocities not separately charged were independent violations of the law of war supporting wirzs trial by military commission so too here hamdans membership in al qaeda and his provision of various forms of assistance to al qaedas top leadership are independent violations of the law of war supporting his trial by military commission

8 these observations respecting the law of war were made by the attorney general in defense of the military commission trial of the lincoln conspirators as the foregoing quoted portion of that opinion makes clear the attorney general did not as the plurality maintains treat the charge as if it alleged the substantive offense of assassination ante at 604 n 35 rather he explained that the conspirators high offence against the laws of war was complete when their band was organized or joined and did not depend upon atrocities committed by such a band 11 op atty gen 297 312 1865 moreover the attorney generals conclusions specifically refute the pluralitys unsupported suggestion that i have blurred the line between those categories of offender who may be tried by military commission    with the offenses that may be so tried ante at 601 n 32

9 the general orders establishing the jurisdiction for military commissions during the civil war provided that such offenses were violations of the laws of war cognizable before military commissions see h r doc no 65 55th cong 3d sess 164 1894 persons charged with the violation of the laws of war as spies bridgeburners marauders c will    be held for trial under such charges id at 234 there are numerous rebels    that    furnish the enemy with arms provisions clothing horses and means of transportation such insurgents are banding together in several of the interior counties for the purpose of assisting the enemy to rob to maraud and to lay waste the country all such persons are by the laws of war in every civilized country liable to capital punishment emphasis added numerous trials were held under this authority see e g u s war dept general court martial order no 51 p 1 1866 hereinafter g c m o indictment in the military commission trial of james harvey wells charged being a guerrilla and specified that he willfully    took up arms as a guerrilla marauder and did join belong to act and cooperate with guerrillas g c m o no 108 headquarters dept of kentucky p 1 1865 indictment in the military commission trial of henry c magruder charged being a guerrilla and specified that he unlawfully and of his own wrong took up arms as a guerrilla marauder and did join belong to act and cooperate with a band of guerrillas g c m o no 41 p 1 1864 indictment in the military commission trial of john west wilson charged that wilson did take up arms as an insurgent and guerrilla against the laws and authorities of the united states and did join and cooperate with an armed band of insurgents and guerrillas who were engaged in plundering the property of peaceable citizens    in violation of the laws and customs of war g c m o no 153 p 1 1864 indictment in the military commission trial of simeon b kight charged that defendant was a guerrilla and has been engaged in an unwarrantable and barbarous system of warfare against citizens and soldiers of the united states g c m o no 93 pp 34 1864 indictment in the military commission trial of francis h norvel charged being a guerrilla and specified that he unlawfully and by his own wrong took up arms as an outlaw guerrilla and bushwhacker against the lawfully constituted authorities of the united states government id at 9 indictment in the military commission trial of james a powell charged transgression of the laws and customs of war and specified that he took up arms in insurrection as a military insurgent and did join himself to and in arms consort with    a rebel enemy of the united states and the leader of a band of insurgents and armed rebels id at 1011 indictment in the military commission trial of joseph overstreet charged being a guerrilla and specified that he did join belong to consort and cooperate with a band of guerrillas insurgents outlaws and public robbers

10 even if the plurality were correct that a membership offense must be accompanied by allegations that the defendant took up arms ante at 601 n 32 that requirement has easily been satisfied here not only has hamdan been charged with providing assistance to top al qaeda leadership itself an offense triable by military commission he has also been charged with receiving weapons training at an al qaeda camp app to pet for cert 66a67a

11 the plurality recounts the respective claims of the parties in quirin pertaining to this issue and cites the united states reports ante at 605 but the claims of the parties are not included in the opinion of the court but rather in the sections of the reports entitled argument for petitioners and argument for respondent see 317 u s at 617

12 the plurality concludes that military commission jurisdiction was appropriate in the case of the lincoln conspirators because they were charged with maliciously unlawfully and traitorously murdering the said abraham lincoln ante at 604 n 35 but the sole charge filed in that case alleged conspiracy and the allegations pertaining to maliciously unlawfully and traitorously murdering the said abraham lincoln were not charged or labeled as separate offenses but rather as overt acts in pursuance of and in prosecuting said malicious unlawful and traitorous conspiracy g c m o no 356 at 696 emphasis added while the plurality contends the murder of president lincoln was charged as a distinct separate offense the foregoing quoted language of the charging document unequivocally establishes otherwise moreover though i agree that the allegations pertaining to these overt acts provided an independent basis for the military commissions jurisdiction in that case that merely confirms the propriety of examining all the acts alleged—whether or not they are labeled as separate offenses—to determine if a defendant has been charged with a violation of the law of war as i have already explained hamdan has been charged with violating the law of war not only by participating in a conspiracy to violate the law of war but also by joining a warcriminal enterprise and by supplying provisions and assistance to that enterprises top leadership

13 the pluralitys attempt to undermine the significance of these cases is unpersuasive the plurality suggests the wirz case is not relevant because the specification supporting his conspiracy charge alleged that he personally committed a number of atrocities ante at 609 but this does not establish that conspiracy to violate the laws of war the very crime with which wirz was charged is not itself a violation of the law of war rather at best it establishes that in addition to conspiracy wirz violated the laws of war by committing various atrocities just as hamdan violated the laws of war not only by conspiring to do so but also by joining al qaeda and providing provisions and services to its top leadership moreover the fact that wirz was charged with overt acts that are more severe than the overt acts with which hamdan has been charged does not establish that conspiracy is not an offense cognizable before military commission rather it merely establishes that wirzs offenses may have been comparably worse than hamdans offenses

the pluralitys claim that the charge against leger grenfel supports its compound offense theory is similarly unsupportable the plurality does not and cannot dispute that grenfel was charged with conspiring to violate the laws of war by releasing rebel prisoners—a charge that bears no relation to a crime ordinarily triable in civilian courts ante at 609 n 37 tellingly the plurality does not reference or discuss this charge but instead refers to the conclusion of judge advocate holt that grenfel also united himself with traitors and malefactors for the overthrow of our republic in the interest of slavery ante at 610 n 37 quoting h r doc no 314 at 689 but judge advocate holts observation provides no support for the pluralitys conclusion as it does not discuss the charges that sustained military commission jurisdiction much less suggest that such charges were not violations of the law of war

14 the plurality contends that international practice—including the practice of the imt at nuremberg—supports its conclusion that conspiracy is not an offense triable by military commission because the angloamerican concept of conspiracy was not part of european legal systems and arguably not an element of the internationally recognized laws of war ante at 611 quoting t taylor anatomy of the nuremberg trials a personal memoir 36 1992 but while the imt did not criminalize all conspiracies to violate the law of war it did criminalize participation in a common plan or conspiracy to wage aggressive war see 1 trials at xixii art 6a moreover the world war ii military tribunals of several european nations recognized conspiracy to violate the laws of war as an offense triable before military commissions see 15 u n commission 9091 noting that the french military tribunal at marseilles found henri georges stadelhofer guilty of the crime of association de malfaiteurs namely of having formed with various members of the german gestapo an association with the aim of preparing or committing crimes against persons or property without justification under the laws and usages of war 11 id at 98 noting that the netherlands military tribunals were authorized to try conspiracy to violate the laws of war thus the european legal systems approach to domestic conspiracy law has not prevented european nations from recognizing conspiracy offenses as violations of the law of war this is unsurprising as the law of war is derived not from domestic law but from the wartime practices of civilized nations including the united states which has consistently recognized that conspiracy to violate the laws of war is an offense triable by military commission

15 though it does not constitute a basis for any holding of the court the court maintains that as a general rule the procedures governing trials by military commission historically have been the same as those governing courtsmartial ante at 617 while it is undoubtedly true that military commissions have invariably employed most of the procedures employed by courtsmartial that is not a requirement see winthrop 841 military commissions    are commonly conducted according to the rules and forms governing courtsmartial these warcourts are indeed more summary in their action than are the courts held under the articles of war and    their proceedings    will not be rendered illegal by the omission of details required upon trials by courtsmartial emphasis in original footnotes omitted 1 u n commission 116117 the world war ii mediterranean regulations no 8 provide that military commissions shall conduct their proceedings as may be deemed necessary for full and fair trial having regard for but not being bound by the rules of procedure prescribed for general courts martial emphasis added id at 117 in the world war ii european directive it is stated    that military commissions shall have power to make as occasion requires such rules for the conduct of their proceedings consistent with the powers of such commissions and with the rules of procedure    as are deemed necessary for a full and fair trial of the accused having regard for without being bound by the rules of procedure and evidence prescribed for general courts martial moreover such a requirement would conflict with the settled understanding of the flexible and responsive nature of military commissions and the presidents wartime authority to employ such tribunals as he sees fit see birkhimer 537538 military commissions may so vary their procedure as to adapt it to any situation and may extend their powers to any necessary degree    the military commander decides upon the character of the military tribunal which is suited to the occasion    and his decision is final

16 the court suggests that congress amendment to article 2 of the ucmj providing that the ucmj applies to persons within an area leased by or otherwise reserved or acquired for the use of the united states 10 u s c § 802a12 deprives yamashitas conclusion respecting the presidents authority to promulgate military commission procedures of its precedential value ante at 620 but this merely begs the question of the scope and content of the remaining provisions of the ucmj nothing in the additions to article 2 or any other provision of the ucmj suggests that congress has disturbed this courts unequivocal interpretation of article 21 as preserving the commonlaw status of military commissions and the corresponding authority of the president to set their procedures pursuant to his commander in chief powers see quirin 317 u s at 28 yamashita 327 u s at 20 madsen v kinsella 343 u s 341 355 1952

17 it bears noting that while the court does not hesitate to cite legislative history that supports its view of certain statutory provisions see ante at 579 580581 n 10 it makes no citation of the legislative history pertaining to article 36b which contradicts its interpretation of that provision indeed if it were authoritative the only legislative history relating to article 36b would confirm the obvious—article 36bs uniformity requirement pertains to uniformity between the three branches of the armed forces and no more when that subsection was introduced as an amendment to article 36 its author explained that it would leave the three branches enough leeway to provide a different provision where it is absolutely necessary because there are some differences in the services hearings on h r 2498 before the subcommittee no 1 of the house committee on armed services 81st cong 1st sess 1015 1949 a further statement explained that there might be some slight differences that would pertain as to the navy in contrast to the army but at least article 36b is an expression of the congressional intent that we want it to be as uniform as possible ibid

18 in addition to being foreclosed by the text of the provision the courts suggestion that 10 u s c § 839c 2000 ed supp v applies to military commissions is untenable because it would require in military commission proceedings that the accused be present when the members of the commission voted on his guilt or innocence

19 the court does not dispute the conclusion that common article 3 cannot be violated unless and until hamdan is convicted and sentenced instead it contends that the geneva conventions do not direct an accused to wait until sentence is imposed to challenge the legality of the tribunal that is to try him ante at 626 n 55 but the geneva conventions do not direct defendants to enforce their rights through litigation but through the conventions exclusive diplomatic enforcement provisions moreover neither the courts observation respecting the geneva conventions nor its reference to the equitable doctrine of abstention bears on the constitutional prohibition on adjudicating unripe claims

20 notably a prosecutor before the quirin military commission has described these procedures as a substantial improvement over those in effect during world war ii further observing that they go a long way toward assuring that the trials will be full and fair national institute of military justice procedures for trials by military commissions of certain nonunited states citizens in the war against terrorism p x 2002 foreword by lloyd n cutleralito dissent footnotes1 section 821 looks to the law of war not separationofpowers issues and § 836 as justice kennedy notes concerns procedures not structure see ante at 645

2 the plurality but not justice kennedy suggests that the commission rules are improper insofar as they allow a defendant to be denied access to evidence under some circumstances see ante at 633635 but here too if this procedure is used in a particular case and the accused is convicted the validity of this procedure can be challenged in the review proceeding in that case in that context both the asserted need for the procedure and its impact on the accused can be analyzed in concrete termsembed"
