staring at a maple leaf
leaning on the mother tree
i said to myself we all lost touch
your favorite fruit is chocolate covered cherries
and seedless watermelon oh
nothing from the ground is good enough
body rise
look whats over me

chorus
oh chariot your golden waves
are walking down upon this face
oh chariot im singing out loud
to guide me
give me your strength

verse 2
remember seeking moons rebirth
rains made mirrors of the earth
the sun was just yellow energy
if its a living promise land
even over fields of sand
seasons fill my mind and
cover me
bringing back
more than a memory

oh chariot your golden waves
are walking down upon this face
oh chariot im singing out loud
to guide me
give me your strength

bridge
youll be my vacation away from this place
you know what i want
holding that cup
its pouring over the sides
make me wanna spread my arms and fly

chorus
oh chariot your golden waves
are walking down upon this face
oh chariot im singing out loud
to guide me
give me your strength

outro
give me your strength chariot
give me your strength chariot
give me your strength chariot
give me your strength chariot
give me your strength give it to me
chariot
give me your strength give it to me
chariot
give me your strength give it to me

give me your strength oh chariot2embed"
