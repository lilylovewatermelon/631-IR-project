you got your ways and ive got mine
its takin up all of my time
waitin for you to adore me
come sit and drink from a cup
dont leave until youre filled up
youre tired of all your travelin

prechorus
i dont need nothin at all
nothin but your kiss
and nothin but your arms
i dont need nothin at all

chorus
but somebody to love
somebody to hold
somebody that i can feel in my blood
somebody to hold
somebody to own
somebody to make me feel im in love

verse 2
i know im may seem forward
im not tryin to save face
im tryna live in this moment
come closer sin would say
tell me how long that it will take
to unravel your body

i dont need nothin at all
nothin but your touch
and nothin but your hand
i dont need nothin at all

chorus
but somebody to love
somebody to hold
somebody that i can feel in my blood
somebody to hold
somebody to own
somebody to make me feel im in love

like a woman in the wilderness
i’m running to you

dont freak but can you make it through the night for me
i know you can cause youre a man
you’re waiting in the street

chorus
i need somebody to love
somebody to hold
somebody that i can feel in my blood
somebody to love
somebody to hold
somebody to make me feel im in love
