woke before the morning sun
i found it tucked beneath the hills
i sat and watched it rise
it hit the sky and burst to flames
the lotus flowers
got me thinking bout the way that we live
ive got this feeling
its gonna stop

driven by religion
running backwards down a one way road
a course collision split decision
trying to save your soul
manifest destiny
is just a fancy word for murder
ive got this feeling
its gonna stop

chorus
a billion faces running round my head
all got opinions but they dont mean shit
keep dropping bombs until the whole worlds dead
they said its all been done and its all been said
theyll turn this message into a pop movement
a fashion statement call it politics
you can mark my words theyll put a spin on it
they say its all been done
see cage the elephant liveget tickets as low as 399you might also likeverse 2
look outside the box my friend
you hearts been dead since who knows when
it seems weve missed the mark
lost all hope and given in
pack up the suitcase
take that handkerchief and wipe off your chin
the fear that drives you
needs to be stopped

chorus

verse 3
fell into a daze
and found my mind was gone and laid to waste
a battle ground indeed
where holy wars have taken place
i saw the sun set watched it travel down
and tear through the ground
the hate that drives us
needs to be stopped4embed"
