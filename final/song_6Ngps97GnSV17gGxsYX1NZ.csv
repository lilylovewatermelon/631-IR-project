every guy at this festival has you in their eyes
i never think about it too much but im thinking tonight
and its really annoying that im triggered like this
cause your name isnt spoken but im speaking it
and i dont know why it happened but it happened like this

prechorus
my best friends are with me and i feel okay
the last time i was here i was eighteen
my mind is racing and i feel so strange
last time i was here you were with me

chorus
i fell in love at the orange show speedway
it didnt look like this three years ago
i had it all at the orange show speedway
or someplace like that it all looks the same
everything changes what a shame

verse 2
im in the middle of the crowd and its like no times passed
im halfexpecting you to be there when i turn to my left
we were stupid and young and i was so in love
we were just friends riding on the line between acceptable
and angering your girlfriend

my best friends are with me and i feel okay
the last time i was here i was eighteen
my mind is racing and i feel so strange
last time i was here you were with me

chorus
i fell in love at the orange show speedway
it didnt look like this three years ago
i had it all at the orange show speedway
or someplace like that it all looks the same
everything changes what a shame

break
uh yep ooh fireworks
this is the best voice memo diary to date i think this is amazing
just wanted to update myself
no one else listens to these but myself
hey okay you got the fireworks if you put that in a song

outro
i fell in love at the orange show speedway
but ive never been here in my life
i think it all kinda feels like an orange show speedway
when youre racing headfirst towards something thatll kill you in five seconds flat
when im racing headfirst towards everything that i want back1embed"
