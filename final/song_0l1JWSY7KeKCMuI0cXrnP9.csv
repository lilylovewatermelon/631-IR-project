alchemist you know me man
im the type of nigga that write rhymes
right on the spot in the studio soon as i hear the track
you know what im sayin
word but i wanted to bring
a couple of books to the studio today man
i found these shits up in the crib man in boxes man
i dont even remember when i was writin these shits
or whats in these shits man
probably a bunch of bullshit man… fuck it check it

verse 1
how can i trust you when i cant trust me
picture myself a old man a og
some niggas will conversate with liars all day
time pass— nah let me start somethin else
soul on ice death threats given by clowns
i guess livin is prison when you live around clowns
im hexed cursed worse i been blessed first
i thought i was abnormal
‘cause i would overcome any tasked called to
so there it is im a prince im against lames
who do minor shit swear they on the top of they game
your rhymin is called vagina monologue it kinda supports
theories of scary niggas who should lie in the morgue
rarely yall come in contact with the real
since pun passed he was the last shine of sun i could feel
yo said theres a few left since musics expressions of life
damn i wish i took more time to write in my book of rhymes
see nas liveget tickets as low as 106you might also likebreak
oh shit tina
i been lookin for this bitch number damn
no this rhyme is weak
this is weak i remember this bullshit right here
my book of rhymes
gandhi was a… what the fuck

verse 2
gandhi was a fool nigga fight to the death
the us army is a school that teach you plights of conquest
i wonder when i wrote this… nah its weak
the moneys your religion sky the limit live life
numbers is big business makes the poor live trife
the glimmers of hope provoke those without dollars to dream
through your existence become wealthy knowledge is king
pimps and card sharks thiefs murderers with hard luck
addicts and fiends prostitutes passin for teens is my society
cops that shoot blacks is routine for notoriety
grow up watchin welldressed niggas with charms
beautiful ladies on their arms
dangerous new cars was my fantasy for nas
rubbin my lips with camphophenique
still behind the ears wet turned out to be
pioneers vets amongst hustlers crack sellers and liars and squares
nah that was weak there
my people be projects or jail never harvard or yale
pardon me type in my twoway while im chargin my cell
its hard to be iced up with gucci god povertys real
i cant fight you ‘cause you would sue me niggas be groupies
i see imitators tryin to make albums spittin my style
and they dont even realize that i notice they stealin nas shit
i pump some rick james with that teena marie
my nina lean on me like scoob and scrap
this cant be my book of rhymes
break
this cant be my book of rhymes writin this bullshit
my book of rhymes
nah neva that fuck that
aw why you laughin alchemist
hah you a funny nigga
naw yeah my book of rhymes
im tellin you ima come up with some new shit now
fuck that ima write again now fuck that
i musta been high on some shit… what the fuck is this

verse 3
look how we treat pregnancy women in the hood
our values so low our values are no good
things our mothers told us we shouldve heeded
‘cause now we need it we older almost able t—
im jealous of you how come you so beautiful
smellin fresh youthful intelligent while im stressin and shit
ayo i envy you ‘cause all you do is smile
and things come your way
such a innocent child is what some say
i get upset ‘cause i just want to be treated the way you are
like a star not a worry in this world thus far
but wait a minute we both need your mothers attention
i must be crazy jealous of my own baby infant kinda crazy15embed"
