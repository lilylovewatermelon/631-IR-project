104 10 104 hello wegot we got a  423 we got a young man riding around in a natty caddy hehe
not natty caddy not that at all

verse 1
whos that creepin through the city in that dark ass tint
misdemeanor on the way yo
i slide in my rimless bentley no tights im gymnast
bending blocks my world of legos
now baby hold that wheel while im rollin up
hopefully she old enough
to purchase that liquor what i need from the store
she understands her selection advance her affection
and fears my rejection never needing a ho
i got plans to be that nigga i know you met him as a child
he gave you 10 bones dont sweat it dont wile
be cool for a minute 93 til be cool for emmett
the hung soul a rapper goes rapping those wrapping woes up
defying foes lying toes weapons on tuck
malcolm they tackle for belief in the movement
but rashad got applause for releasing the music

hook
now sometimes i be gettin higher than a bitch
smoking all my lows put the fire to the spliff
what up now what up
now ive been getting higher and higher
and higher and higher
now what up now what up now what up what up

ay ay ay yeah
niggas steppin in the swimming pool invincible
women i pursue get lost in this uh
middle of the summers in miami
kembe with me henney sippin shots like i bought it for him
im with brown skin small waisted
im creeping with my ball faces i like her titties too
i like her attitude i like her flexible
she got a baby due i think she bisexual
at least i hope so
i glance to that little grown man at her front door
he looking at me like i looked at pops when he come fo
my mama as a toddler i was selfish this aint nothin new
i can spit a couple 22s if i want to
i save it for the tour the allure of the gap tooth
rap toose in shape or somethin
always knew he would make him something
he got schemes to smoke green
and make him some take em son

hook
now sometimes i be gettin higher than a bitch
smoking all my lows put the fire to the spliff
what up now what up
now ive been getting higher and higher
and higher and higher
now what up now what up now what up what up43embed"
