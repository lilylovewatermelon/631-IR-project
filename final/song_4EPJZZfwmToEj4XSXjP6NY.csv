well its your hometown i think ive outgrown
i wanna travel the world but i i just cant do it alone
so im just waiting on fate to come wrap around me
think about all the foreign places we could be

chorus
ill be flicking stones at your window
ill be waiting outside til youre ready to go
wont you come down come away with me
just think of all the places we could be
ill be waiting waiting on a brand new day

verse 2
riding on waves walking on sand
digging in caves to find the treasures of the land
and if we find gold well well just throw it away
we can write stories bout the journeys that we made
we could be big in japan

chorus
ill be flicking stones at your window
ill be waiting outside til youre ready to go
wont you come down come away with me
just think of all the places we could be
ill be waiting waiting on a brand new day
waiting on a brand new day
you might also likebridge
they said theyll keep me here
but i couldn’t do another year
i said ill see you soon
because i whistle to a different tune
think of all the places we could be
think of all the people we could meet

chorus
ill be flicking stones at your window
ill be waiting outside til you’re ready to go
wont you come down come away with me
just think of all the places we could be
ill be waiting waiting on a brand new day3embed"
