i know its been a long time
since the last time we talked
i know ive been a stranger
and thats all my fault
and asking you for anything
dont really seem right
but the winds of change are blowing
so im begging you tonight

chorus
give me love when i aint got nobody
a little hope when i aint got none at all
give me light up ahead on a journey
give me strength when im standing
and faith when i fall yeah

verse 2
i know the rain is coming
and its sure gonna pour
i know there aint no running
from this kind of storm
its gonna get harder and harder
they keep on pushing through
im gonna wanna quit
so ill be counting on you
see kip moore liveget tickets as low as 49you might also likechorus
to give me love when i aint got nobody
a little hope when i aint got none at all
give me light up ahead on a journey
give me strength when im standing
and faith when i fall

bridge
when the clouds start parting
and the sun starts shining through
this time i wont forget
i wont forget about you

chorus
give me love when i aint got nobody
a little hope when i aint got none at all
give me love when i aint got nobody
a little hope when i aint got none at all
give me light up ahead on a journey
give me strength when im standing
and faith when i fall

give me strength when im standing
and faith when i fall yeahembed"
