verse 1 justin with all
she was my once in a lifetime
happy ending come true
oh i guess i should have told her
i thought she knew
she said i took her for granted
its the last thing i would do
oh ill never understand it
i thought she knew i thought she knew

chorus jc with all
i thought she knew my world revolved around her
my love light burns for her alone
but she couldnt see the flame
only myself to blame
i should have known
i should have known

verse 2 joey with all
a heart full of words left unspoken
now that were through
id sell my soul to have this silence broken
oh i thought she knew i thought she knew
i thought she knew

i thought she knew my world revolved around her
my love light burns for her alone
but she couldnt see the flame
only myself to blame
i should have known
