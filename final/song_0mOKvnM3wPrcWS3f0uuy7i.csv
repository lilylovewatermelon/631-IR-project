theres a boy
lost his way looking for someone to play
theres a girl in the window
tears rolling down her face

prechorus
were only lost children trying to find a friend
trying to find our way back home

chorus
we dont know where to go
so ill just get lost with you
well never fall apart cause we fit together right
we fit together right
these dark clouds over me rain down and roll away
well never fall apart cause we fit together like two pieces of a broken heart

we could build sandcastles
ill be the queen youll be my king

were only lost children trying to find a friend
trying to find our way back home
