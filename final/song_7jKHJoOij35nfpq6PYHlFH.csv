verse 1 violent j  shaggy 2 dope
245 and the bell went off
thank god many people think im odd
but i talk with no one and i walk alone
and i avoid sunlight with a chalky tone
i get home and dont say hi it aint no one there
i dont care i walk in and go right up the stairs
to my room get in bed and just wait for dark
because thats when the real show start tap tap
tap tap on the glass go the piece of ass
so young and pretty its too bad she passed
but she comes to my room and we talk at night
shes demonic and bloody but she holds me tight
in my bedroom with her im never alone
and i kiss her cold lips until the morning come
then she gone i can still hear her voice loom
but she only exist in the dark of my room

chorus violent j  shaggy 2 dope

i try to smile a lot but im always frontin
but i do love a ghost and at least thats somethin
she dont talk much when she do it gets cold
usually we just lay there and we hold each other
were lovers we dont need others
one of my mothers cats jumped up on the covers
and it scared my baby guess she dont like pets
so i twisted its fuckin head off at the neck
look baby its bloody its gone its doomed
please come back to the room
ill do anything for thee dont ignore me

and i will if you want me to for any reason
i hate that you leave when the lights come on
and if i had it my way the fuckin sund be gone

in my room you and i tap tap go the piece of ass
verse 3 violent j  shaggy 2 dope
sometimes i kiss her i start shakin
she slips me the tongue and it tastes like bacon
uh oh somethings wrong babys upset
she told me she was spotted by the neighbors kid
she cant come back now cause they know our secret
unless i can make them keep it
if i do she may come to life
now im in their yard with a shotgun and knife
cut the screen went in and found the kid
blew a bowl of spaghetti in the side of his head
and the daddy was next runnin down the hall
i shredded his throat and he was quick to fall
tossed the mossberg and gripped the knife
started stabbin the shit outta his wife
went home a bloody mess with a job well done tap tap
wash up and wait for my baby to come tap tap

chorus violent j  shaggy 2 dope
