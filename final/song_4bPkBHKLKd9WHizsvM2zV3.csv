a warning sign
i missed the good part then i realised
i started lookin and the bubble burst
i started lookin for excuses

ive gotta tell you what a state im in
ive gotta tell you in my loudest tones
that i started lookin for a warning sign

chorus
when the truth is
i miss you
yeah the truth is
that i miss you so

a warning sign
you came back to haunt me and i realised
that you were an island and i passed you by
when you were an island to discover

prechorus
come on in
ive gotta tell you what a state im in
ive gotta tell you in my loudest tones
that i started lookin for a warning sign
