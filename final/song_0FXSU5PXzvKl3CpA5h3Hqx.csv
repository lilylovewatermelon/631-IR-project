i sit here clutching useless lists
keys for doors that dont exist
i crack my teeth on pearls
i tear into the history
show me what it means to me in this world
yeah in this world

chorus
cause i am due for a miracle
im waiting for a sign
ill stare straight into the sun
and i wont close my eyes
till i understand or go blind

verse 2
i see the parts but not the whole
i studied saints and scholars both
and no perfect plan unfurls
do i trust my heart or just my mind
why is truth so hard to find in this world
yeah in this world

chorus
cause i am due for a miracle
im waiting for a sign
ill stare straight into the sun
and i wont close my eyes
till i understand or go blind till i understand or go blind
see thrice liveget tickets as low as 32you might also likebridge
i know that theres a point ive missed
a shrine or stone i havent kissed
a scar that never graced my wrist
a mirror that hasnt met my fist
but i cant help feeling like im

chorus
due for a miracle
im waiting for a sign waiting for a sign
ill stare straight into the sun
and i wont close my eyes and i wont close my eyes

chorus
due for a miracle
im waiting for a sign
ill stare straight into the sun
and i wont close my eyes3embed"
