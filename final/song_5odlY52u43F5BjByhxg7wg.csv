it was just two lovers
sittin in the car listenin to blonde
fallin for each other
pink and orange skies feelin super childish
no donald glover
missed call from my mother
like where you at tonight
got no alibi

prechorus
i was all alone with the love of my life
shes got glitter for skin
my radiant beam in the night
i dont need no light to see you

chorus
shine
its your golden hour ohohoh
you slow down time
in your golden hour ohohoh

verse 2
we were just two lovers
feet up on the dash drivin nowhere fast
burnin through the summer
radio on blast make the moment last she got solar power
minutes feel like hours
she knew she was the baddest
can you even imagine fallin like i did
you might also likeprechorus
for the love of my life
shes got glow on her face
a glorious look in her eyes
my angel of light
i was all alone with the love of my life
shes got glitter for skin
my radiant beam in the night
i dont need no light to see you

chorus
shine
its your golden hour ohohoh
you slow down time
in your golden hour ohohoh
