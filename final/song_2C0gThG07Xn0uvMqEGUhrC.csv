so i typed a text to a girl i used to see
saying that i chose this cutie pie with whom i wanna be
and i apologize if this message gets you down
then i cced every girl that id seesee round town
and hate to see yall frown but id rather see her smilin
wetness all around me true but im no island
peninsula maybe it makes no sense i know crazy
give up all this pussy cat thats in my lap no looking back
spaceships dont come equipped with rearview mirrors
they dip as quick as they can the atmosphere is now ripped
im so like a pimp im glad its night
so the light from thе sun would not burn me on my bum
when i shoot the moon high jump thе broom
like a preemie out the womb my partner yelling too soon
dont do it reconsider read some liter
ature on the subject you sure fuck it
you know we got your back like chiropractic
if that bitch do you dirty well wipe her ass out as in detergent
now hurry hurry go on to the altar
i know you aint a pimp but pimp remember what i taught ya
keep your heart three stacks keep your heart
ayy keep your heart three stacks keep your heart
man these girls is smart three stacks these girls is smart
play your part play your part

at ease with the swagger wont see no one better
he way above the lames you know like hes on a ladder
