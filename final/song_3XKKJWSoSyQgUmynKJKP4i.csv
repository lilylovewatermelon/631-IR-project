verse 1
im so down underground i be scalping all my tickets
forging all my sound scans like yall can tell the difference
the mission fishin for the disenfranchised little kids
we shoot em in a barrel its so easy when theyre pissed
under educated extra caffeinated
i just masturbated now im motivated
cant live with us you cant live without us
i take it then i break it then you write my paycheck
you can call me little miss piss with a kiss
and after all this the rest is all bullshit

prechorus
and you love it
you love it
you love it
you love it

chorus

im bumping like a pimp on the stage to save face
i overcompensate with very bad taste
no offense no romance sick of your parents
im about to take a stance in your daughters underpants
its no accident you all pay my rent
and i am free to download all the porno on the internet
carried on a stick stick not too fucking quick quick
now that im a prick prick yall can jack my dick
say no to brains its a nobrainer
lowest common denominator
pays the bills to be this sterile
fuck me now rip me off later

prechorus
and you love it
you love it
you love it
you love it
