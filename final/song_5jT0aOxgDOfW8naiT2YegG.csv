remember that onerounder that we had in chicago
woo i aint gon’ lie that was some classic shit
boy you danced your way out of an asswhoopin and showed the world that you could rap wit clips
you popped a bottle celebrated a debatable
and that was at a time when i was practicin’ abstinence
‘cause i didnt give a fuck but i still was killin pussies by accident
now you got me in a small room battlin on the app and shit
hopin thisll make your stature lift
invitin all of these cameras to this secret location to let your ratchet spit
showin smack how you throw bullets in the field hopin’ to get lux and surf after this
puttin’ in all that work for the league for the league to tell you “no” like kaepernick
‘cause you not a star
you from a city called pontiac and nobody in your family got a car
you not even that nice
you make ugly faces like “i know” and the crowd get hype
nigga thats not a bar
jesus christ saga ran from me
he got low so loso now me and you gotta spar
‘cause lyrically we both qurans
you butler and i’m what you read when you tryna find allah
we are not the same
i know niggas that dont even rhyme that wanna take my schemes
next to the semi semmi but i aint akeem
wit a rocket and it ain’t hakeem
sniper rifle im on the roof
soon as you stop dancin imma take mine clean
until then you gon be in the view interview more than ace amin
and by ace i mean danger
its kinda hard to stay mellow ‘melo when your whole team blazers
i get to wavin you dont even wave back he a mean neighbor
the mac open up jc face everywhere thats a screensaver
extendo  that shit turn the baby into a teenager
thats my old gun
wait ‘til they get a load of my new extendo
he got a glock9 from the plug oh he must have brought a new nintendo
ill take your niece lure her laura upstairs and throw that little bitch through the window
and you dont think family matters ‘til she never come downstairs like judy winslow
im from harlem but the problem
my schemes so fabulous fabolous they think i might be from brooklyn
in front of my building movin blow in the bag like spike lee in crooklyn
homemade silencer on the gun ill clap you while the white people lookin
and they gon love it ‘cause im raisin the potato like white people cookin
now for the blacks that dont understand that i can understand so the hate is valid
but charron in his house goin crazy ‘cause they put raisins in their potato salad
back to you  you clappin who
nigga i want you to imagine that
beasley callin you cheeko sendin you a deposit and you about to battle smack
exactly wont ever happen like you squeezin out of the cadillac
i got some big shit thats kickin like franchise before battle rap
aye all you rookies callin out us vets i fuck wit yall but yall depressin
but for the right price i might walk through the swamp and give your honor lessons
my aim so fuckin good right now i could palm a wesson
look in the camera and shoot a hater out the comment section
i know yall want me to keep goin ‘cause im doin him dirty
but blame smack ‘cause this the app and they only paid me to go 2 minutes and 30
laughs
you might also likeround 1 jc
lately you been wildin out
i been handin out ls so lately they called me to bring the l that fits you
its tailored so i had to put down the poundssomethin you never been through
now they say you been on your shit lately
yeah you provin that so i assume i should be on my best against you
but they seen what i been through
war wore in battle rapmore than them lom suits
i heard you lost weight charlieand im glad you found it
but im proud of you
but bein mad at joe for not bein on his rushmore
what is this amountin a mountain to
the day we saw clips in his feelings fillings like 50 wit the face shot
i know the shit wowed me too
the shit hit me like a bet voiceovershit didnt even sound like you
but nonetheless they required that special aim
weapon raise so imma let it spray
its not as cheap as you think
you know how many calls i get to kill a nigga weak in the ring
just about every seven days
so make this effort worth it and look alive man
since when does bringin these pussies the smoke take a devised plan
i thought you boys was fit for war
youll more likely hear i got deployed into the war before you could ever tell a nigga i ran iran
i dont know who the fuck you niggas think you talkin to
it literally goes for all of you
i even told the staff it dont matter who you cast p
er is the only thing they gon be walkin through
i am wit action
i killed yo ass befobut it was in chicago and they aint give a fuck cause the shit happens
but you back kickin
so whoever act get clapped wit him
im on his trail blazin
i even give his dame diss and now she wrapped in the shack shaq wit him
its a quick trip
i know you not nearsighted but you never really seen shit this tense tints
its immeasurable like my accuracy with sixshots
the hits level you
one for every limb then the brain
and the last in n the chainncredible
you are just another tyrese before he became famous
cause you on camera in my way
but just another victim of a crime wave
for just bein on camera comin out the side of your faceany old kind way conway
nigga stop
you jumped in this bitch bellyfirst  you been a flop
i look at you likesam jackson when mcdowells was gettin robbed
like who the fuck is this asshole
then its the mop
untuck it and clap
i chef up three of them thangs
we can have a rebuttaling match
or ill take the 30 drop it
itll be like hospice you can die right where you most comfortable at
who better than i
you already expected to die
but the fact that you accepted this death by the god is outlandish
im outstandinglike a heroin nod
and the only thing you deserve from this ability is a welfare check
you saw what i did to the shooter and the driver
one shot made him pass at the wheel
that shit took belair prep
i know you know the deal
they gave me three rounds when i proved i needed one
this shit bout to be overkill
and you know that publishing clearinghouse shit
thats that annual check for the weak week just so niggas know its real
its bodybags at every battle
make sure your homie found one
now do not jump in that bitch yet cause this is only round 1
round 2 charlie clips

and before this develop into somethin negative i end up in jail havin a kodak mo
i hope you get the picture
i will pistolwhip smart guy til the bitch come out of him like sister sister
hahaha

revolver spinnin

round 3 charlie clips
jc i fuck wit you

jc

charlie clips
but omarion lil fizz and raz b should be jumpin you
cause you sent a dance video to the nigga that grip they butt
but it didnt make you feel uncomfortable
and yall got the nerve to say jc stands for jesus christ
nigga my lord and savior would never fuck wit you
you been askin askin to get loaded so long and look at god
he put a nigga thats loaded right in front of you
and you gon pretend like you dont give a damn
but the way you chasin lux it remind me of instagram
and yall gon fuck wit the plot
oh cause see you use the ink well but you always posin to be somethin you not
oh imma shut him up loaded uploaded
he gon get the large picture and it aint gon be somethin to crop
and its crazy cause every time he feel the need to rise he always gotta see lux at the top
cause you know inkwell the filter rise and you see lux at the
what are you sellin me
the lord work in mysterious ways
at least thats what my grandmama was tellin me
and she was right cause you can do the robot but cant get the nigga who could do the robot
and his eeeenergy sold separately
jesus christ you just had to be the judas
well you gon get these beats bad these shits cassidyinfluenced
and yeah jc my eeeenergy sold separatelybut batterys included
i said and yeah you was right
i had a couple rocky steps in my career but my new shitll make drago run
im a different creed from a harlem about 20 blocks away from the apollo son
i keep bullets all inside my crib
i could reach in the linen closet and give you a hollow one
and that was crazy when you think about it cause lennon is hollows son
i showed twork  aka jeroozsalem  who really was the best
i battled math showed justin and he really was impressed
john john now jc
ill even show jerry who really run the west wess
all i do is knock off js like rum nitty gettin dressed
imagine me takin this nigga to the game store to get madden and 2k and this nigga pick up just dance
put on music tell him to stand still and jc just cant
jesus christ im just charlie
dont need 100 niggas its just clips
and you wont dance for any man in the world jcjust chris
you know what you gotta be one of the worst hustlers that i ever met
cause you only makin a thousand off of smack
you known for baggy clothes a classic with chilla chasin lux
you kinda lousy wit the stats
oh shit you did kill rich dolarz though
im proud of you  in fact
i think its funny
cause you bragged about how you ate dolarz 8 for a monthand now you on the app
yeah i know i know keep goin cause im doin him dirty
but smack you only paid me to go 2 minutes and
nah you know what fuck all that
i think imma extend the rhyme
you paid me to go 230 but for my niggas who bought the app fuck it  ill extend the time
i already know you gon do orlandonick jokes probly
but you danced for chris stokes and he said he seen that man go down
and thats crazy
so why bring up nick and all them lies from orlando brown
if i catch you wit orlando in orlando then them bats go wavin
and them gats go blazin
itll be more bmore niggas in the field throwin bullets than lamar jackson and thats so raven
i did that just for the app cause i was doin him dirty
i gave yall 245 even though i got paid for 2 minutes and 30

round 3 jc
i really hate the fact that you been gettin by wit that style

charlie clips
you love it

jc
its kinda i dont
its kinda old now
but since you been tryin new shit i told em we was gon get silencers to mute clipsright after the volume go down
now we here
acknowledge fear
you just rappin
im rappin to wrap up a body that woulda wrapped up another solid year
i been doin this shit since i started clips
show respector you know whats next
big remington left a hole big as a fist in his shit
chkchk openchest
one deploy when it burst
yall pain brings me so much joy that it hurts
i mean its a cemetery full of plots yall could sleep in and you goin in it first
mad i told you about the plots before you seen em oh well spoiler alert
you basic and weak

charlie clips
that was hard

jc
you basic and weak
you are basic and weak
dyin from a overdose of a drug that was based in a week
now the hand out for payment
niggas love tryna write like me for me til the fans demand that they change it
im too witty charms what makes it unique
this shit like a pandora bracelet
the shit wild
stretch him out that mean extended clips if you get loud
then you get ate eight but he only remember two pieces chris childs
you are too in the way
i killed yo ass last time you was too in the way
and at that point they shouldve threw you away
but they done brought a savage back
to break down clips over battle rap
oh this shit bout to ruin your day
just cause the rounds short it means you die faster
theres no amnesty
you just actin
these clips really kill right in the act  ask brandon lee
see these quotes different and its okay if you dont get it
most miss it
til its right on the side of they faceprolific
i know you couldnt have caught this worse
i mean it was supposed to start with bars at first
but when you couldnt make it close
it was time to create a ghost and i had to show him how stars starz network
one call then we wreckin yo shit
you started off makin a name off rock then you became a steppin stone with
now its my turn my for cookin
and when you see me loadin that last bullet that put all the pressure on clips
and you still fat and forever second
but you can be first for the weapon testin
im shootin somethin jc gotta hold hole in two hands resurrection
i aim the piece you already died from a round you know exactly how my aim can be
like if i swing through with a kyrie move nobody gonna wanna play with me
so start saying your peace
or face the barrelsave all that shit to say to the piece
now you really gotta face that rap behind bars
time to live up to that famous name in the streets charlie jr
nah time to go but its a shame he couldnt have departed sooner
but he gotta die
his name for some reason once again is on that dotted line
and imma have some much shit poppin up on clips it gon feel monetized
i only needed one smith but they done gave clips to a gunsmith to break all this down
last time i had a six shooter but somehow he the target now
cool one shot from the mag numb magnum everything from the target down
you couldve always been fully loaded clips
the accuracy is what everything revolve around
and thats why theres no reason not to make this battle all tragic
i mean surely shirley im dumb cold cole but still clap a large ratchet
and ill let em all have it
then the eulogy get delivered and ill be staring at your box smiling
just so they know an amazon packed it
it is over wit
overdose from the dopest pen and yall know i wrote the shit
cause every battle turns into a eulogy my condolencesembed"
