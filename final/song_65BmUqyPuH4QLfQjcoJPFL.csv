well we got a few hours
blurred lines im fighting like hell to try and keep my eyes wide open
were always running from running to running late or running out of
its the return that keeps us going

weve been gone for way too long
cant count all the roads weve been down
try to keep it between the ditches til the dolly parton bridge is in the front window
weve been gone for way too long
cant count all the roads weve been down
but now were a stones throw
a stones throw from home

been counting down hours for hours
now so close we can almost tastе it
only 20 odd mile marks left for us to pass
everything that wеve been needing and missing and wanting is just ahead waiting
giving us even more reason to drive slower leaving than we do coming back

weve been gone for way too long
cant count all the roads weve been down
try to keep it between the ditches til the dolly parton bridge is in the front window
weve been gone for way too long
cant count all the roads weve been down
but now were a stones throw
a stones throw from home

lord ive been gone
lord ive been gone
ive been gone
ive been gone
ive been gone
ive been gone
ive been gone
ive been gone
ive been gone
ive been goneembed"
