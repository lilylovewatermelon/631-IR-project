let the wind blow through our hair
love is reckless lets get reckless tonight

there aint nothing out here but a big tall texas sky
theres a red sun painted across the pond tonight
well your daddys got plans for you
and mine thinks im at school
they say its reckless to chase a dream
but this towns got nothing for you and me

lets roll the windows down turn the radio up
let the wind blow through our hair
theres a moon tonight and a road outside
baby were gettin out of here
i could care less where it leads us
love is reckless lets get reckless tonight

lets take my thunderbird and leave tonight
ill keep the pedal to the floor until we see morning light
they cant live our lives for us
if we let em well lose our love
and love dies hard in this texas sun
id rather be reckless and on the run

lets roll the windows down turn the radio up
let the wind blow through our hair
theres a moon tonight and a road outside
baby were gettin out of here
i could care less where it leads us
love is reckless lets get reckless tonight
see alabama liveget tickets as low as 58you might also likewhen youre crazy in love you gotta take a chance
burn the bridge and dont look back

turn the radio up roll the windows down
let the wind blow through our hair
theres a moon tonight and a road outside
baby were gettin out of here

roll the windows down turn the radio up
love is reckless lets get reckless
lets get recklessembed"
