been a bet it all gambler
yeah i let it all ride
never been afraid of losin
yeah theres been times ive lost it all
but it wont really matter
someday when im gone

you can bury me on deadwood mountain
by my brother wild bill and sister calamity jane
dont bring me no flowers
just a six gun smokin
put me eight feet down
when you bury me
put me eight feet down
when you bury me

when your heart runs deeper
then a ghost town gold mine
you just know your bound to find that motherload
youll spend your last heartbeat chasing after rainbows
no theres no place you wont go
to win one more time

you can bury me on deadwood mountain
by my brother wild bill and sister calamity jane
dont bring me no flowers
just a six gun smokin
put me eight feet down
when you bury me
put me eight feet down
when you bury me
you might also likeand cover me a little extra deep
cause thats the only way
im gonna rest in peace

you can bury me on deadwood mountain
by my brother wild bill and sister calamity jane
dont bring me no flowers
just a six gun smokin
put me eight feet down
when you bury me
put me eight feet down
when you bury meembed"
