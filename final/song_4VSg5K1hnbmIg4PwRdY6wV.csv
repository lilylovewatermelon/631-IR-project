my baby lives in shades of blue
blue eyes and jazz and attitude
he lives in california too
he drives a chevy malibu
and when he calls he calls for me and not for you
he lives for love he loves his drugs he loves his baby too

prechorus
but i cant fix him cant make him better
and i cant do nothing about his strange weather

chorus
but you are unfixable
i cant break through your world
cause you live in shades of cool
your heart is unbreakable

verse 2
my baby lives in shades of cool
cold heart and hands and aptitude
he lives for love for women too
im one of many bonnies blue
and when he calls he calls for me and not for you
he prays for love he prays for peace and maybe someone new

i cant break through your world

your hot hot weather in the summer
