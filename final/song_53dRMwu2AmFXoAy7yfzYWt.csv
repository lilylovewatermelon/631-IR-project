beneath this vast region
manifest destination
leaves us fast erasing

chorus
days pass
time flies
you dont realize
today you waste

this dying youth of beauty and pleasure evaporates
lives are connected to lasting obsessions that become possessions of waste
while buying the next new fashion thats fed to enslave this land of the free

chorus
days pass
time flies
you dont realize
today you waste

dont be so surprised

you dont realize
