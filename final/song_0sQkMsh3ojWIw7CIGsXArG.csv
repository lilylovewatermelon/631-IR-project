earthquakes and hurricanes
and slow moving freight trains
girl thats how you make me feel sometimes
but you were gone away from here
so far my dear
up by that northern state line

chorus
virginia lie in all my broken dreams
you pick me up and you sure make me smile
virginia and i would give anything
to come dance around my memory for awhile

verse 2
off in the moonlight
sweet southern moonlight
a billion stars bare feet in the sand
im counting down the summer days
smiling at our reckless ways
you was my girl and i was your man

chorus
virginia
lie in all my broken dreams
you pick me up and you sure make me smile
virginia
and i would give anything
to come dance around my memory for awhile
see whiskey myers liveget tickets as low as 44you might also likeverse 3
thats the way the story goes
of broken hearts and sad souls
you left me here not saying goodbye
said you headed with your paw
north arkansas
but that was back before 1975

chorus
virginia lie in all my broken dreams
you pick me up and you sure make me smile
virginia and i would give anything
to come dance around my memory for awhileembed"
