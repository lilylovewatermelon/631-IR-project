i know this girl from way back
some time ago
fine as the autumn sun
with a heart of gold
one day we talked about some
men in her past
cause i was just tryin to understand

prehook
why its always like she always tried to hide
what it is she feels or whats on her mind
when it comes to love
she gets so afraid that someone will come
and hurt her again someday

hook
all her life she never had
someone to show her what it means
means to have or be in real love

verse 2
she never had a man
who was kind to her
never told her i love you
without gettin hurt no
some people say shes bitter
some think shes scared
some people say
she thinks nobody cares
see musiq soulchild liveget tickets as low as 50you might also likeprehook
now she walks around
and protects her heart
never look for love
lives behind a wall
tell it to herself
all men are the same
cause thats how it is
and that is such a shame

hook
all her life she never had
someone to show her what it means
means to have or be in real love

interlude
ohh yea
dont you
baby dont you
dont you be afraid of me
dont know why
i just wanna be the one
you need not
yeah

hook
because all her life she never had
someone to show her what it means
means to have or be in real love
all her life she never had
someone to show her what it means
to have or be in real love

all her life she never had
someone to show her what it means
means to have or be in real loveembed"
