i cannot disguise
all the stomach pains and the walking of the canes
when you do come out
and you whisper up to me in your life of tragedy
but i cannot grow
til you eat the last of me oh when will i be free
and you a parasite
just find another host just another fool to roast

prechorus serj tankian
cause you my tapeworm tells me what to do
you my tapeworm tells me where to go

chorus serj tankian
pull the tapeworm out of your ass hey
pull the tapeworm out of your ass hey
pull the tapeworm out of your ass hey
pull the tapeworm out of your ass hey

verse 2 serj tankian  daron malakian
i cannot deny
all the evil traits and the filling of the crates
when you you do come out out
and you slither up to me in your pimpin majesty
but i cannot grow
til you eat the last of me oh when will i be free
and you you a parasite site
just find another host just another stool to post
