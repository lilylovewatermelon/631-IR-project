hey gloria are you standing close to the edge
look out to the setting sun the brink of your vision
eternal youth is a landscape of a lie
the cracks of my skin can prove as the years will testify
say your prayers and light a fire were gonna start a war
your slogans a gun for hire its what we waited for
hey gloria this is why were on the edge
the fight of our lives been drawn to this undying love

chorus
gloria ¡viva la gloria
you blast your name in graffiti on the walls
fallin in broken glass thats slashing through your spirit
i can hear it like a jilted crowd
gloria where are you gloria
you found a home in all your scars and ammunition
you made your bed in salad days amongst the ruins
ashes to ashes of our youth

bridge
she smashed her knuckles into winter gloria
as autumns wind fades into black
she is the saint of all the sinners gloria
the one thats fallen through the cracks
so dont put away your burnin light
see green day liveget tickets as low as 49you might also likechorus
gloria where are you gloria
dont lose your faith to your lost naiveté
weather the storm and dont look back on last november
when your banners were burnin down
gloria ¡viva la gloria
send me your amnesty down to the broken hearted
bring us the season that we always will remember
dont let the bonfires go out

outro
so gloria send out your message of
the light that shadows in the night
gloria wheres your undying love
tell me the story of your life your life11embed"
