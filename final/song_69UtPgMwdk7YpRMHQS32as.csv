youve been hiding out for quite a while now
living off of people you know
trying to raise a little money to pay off all the monkeys
that you met inside the rabbit hole
youre taking candy from the white witch
youre smoking tea with mama kin
well theres a wolf outside a brick house screaming
this time im gonna blow it in

prechorus
because the mind is a weapon see
and its got you on your hands and knees
pull the trigger if youre gonna
we all know that you wanna
count off 1 2 1 2 3

chorus
youd better pray that theres another way out
youd better pray that someones listening now
and doesnt wanna watch you drown
cause when you lie like the devil himself
no angels gonna hear your cry for help

verse 2
i know you must really think its funny
you had everybody fooled in the end
but its a little unassuming considering how you knew me
im the only one that called you a friend
