i know this isn’t what i wanted
never thought itd come this far
im thinking back to where we started
and how we lost all that we are
we were young and times were easy
i could see its not the same
im standing here but you dont see me
id give it all for that to change
and i don’t want to lose her
i don’t want to let her go

chorus 1 miley cyrus  nick jonas
im standing out in the rain
i need to know if it’s over
cause i will leave you alone
flooded with all this pain
knowing that ill never hold her like i did before the storm
before the storm

verse 2 nick jonas  miley cyrus
and with every strike of lightning
comes a memory that lasts
not a word is left unspoken as the thunder starts to crash
maybe i should give up
you might also likechorus 1 miley cyrus  nick jonas
im standing out in the rain
i need to know if it’s over
cause i will leave you alone
flooded with all this pain
knowing that ill never hold her like i did before the storm
before the storm

bridge miley cyrus  nick jonas
trying to keep the light from going in
and the clouds from ripping out my broken heart
we always say a heart is not whole
without the one who gets you through the storm

chorus 2 miley cyrus  nick jonas
standing out in the rain knowing that its really over
please dont leave me alone
im flooded with all this pain
knowing that ill never hold you like i did before the storm

outro miley cyrus  nick jonas
yeah like i did before the storm1embed"
