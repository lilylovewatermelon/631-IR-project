outside theres a rusty pickup
underneath a shed
mockingbirds nest in the tailpipe
empty feed sack in the bed
they took away my keys
sayin im too old to drive
its like theyre tryin to bury me
while im still alive

chorus
i always wanted a son
i always wanted a woodshed
i always wanted to ride on an open range
and learn how to fly a plane but i guess
even pictures we never take
memories well never make still fadе
i never did all i wanted to do
but i always wantеd to

verse 2
they talk like i cant hear em
when they have to change my sheets
theyre getting tired and angry
cause i wont accept defeat
uncle frank lived to be a hundred
hell im only ninety five
i aint raising no white flag
while im still alive
see cody johnson liveget tickets as low as 15you might also likechorus
i always wanted a son
i always wanted a woodshed
i always wanted to ride on an open range
and learn how to fly a plane but i guess
even pictures we never take
memories well never make still fade
i never did all i wanted to do
but i always wanted to

verse 3
my marie showed up this morning
floatin right above that chair
she smiled the sweetest smile at me
as she hovered in the air
when that fever stole her from me
i was twenty seven she was just twenty five
i never dreamed id see my angel again
while im still alive

chorus
i always wanted a son
i always wanted a woodshed
i always wanted to ride on an open range
and learn how to fly a plane but i guess
even pictures we never take
memories well never make still fade
i never did all i wanted to do
but i always wanted to
outro
i never did all i wanted to do
but i always wanted toembed"
