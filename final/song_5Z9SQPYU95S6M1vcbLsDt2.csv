time goes by and still i am stuck on you
yeah time goes by and still i am stuck on you ooh you ooh

verse 1
ive been afraid dont wanna fade out of my body
ive been astray barely awake floating above me
covered in gray what can i say ive been a zombie
im feeling like ive been locked in a grave
you were the laugh you were the life you were the party
you were the brave i was the weak you were the army
you were the faith you were the truth i was the sorry
im feeling like youve been taken away

prechorus
you were my one you were my one
when all has been said all has been done
you were my one you were my one
now i am left reaching above me oh oh

chorus
time goes by and still i am stuck on you
ooh you ooh woahoh
yeah time goes by and still i am stuck on you
ooh you ooh woahoh

didnt you know you were the home you were the only
where did you go where did you go where did you go

prechorus
you were my one you were my one
when all has been said all has been done
you were my one you were my one
now i am left reaching above me oh oh

chorus
time goes by and still i am stuck on you

time goes by and still i am stuck on you
