i was just with you on your birthday
and i met your whole family
but on the way home
you kept looking at your phone
couldnt help but ask who is that babe
and the way you said nobody
i knew the rumors
they were more than just rumors

prechorus
maybe i should have noticed
you were just half in love
maybe i should have noticed
that im not the only one

chorus
somebody told me that you
got another lover youve been givin it to
cant believe i believed you
you were my girl
somebody saw you with him
now youre tryna tell me that hes only a friend
cant believe i believed that
you were my girl ooh ooh
ooh oohoohooh
