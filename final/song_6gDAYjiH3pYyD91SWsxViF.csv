my weight bet on you
i cant deny you
i could try
but i dont want anyone but barely sweet tonight

verse 2 tegan and sara
your path before you
your choice you know you
i could choose
but i dont want anything bad to come of you

chorus tegan and sara
we are born
were hopeless on our own
but every chance we get we run
every chance we get we run
we are shown
were helpless on our own
but every chance we get we run
every chance we get we run

verse 3 tegan and sara
the tears spill on you
it seems beyond you
you could try
but you dont want anyone together spend the night

a stage before us
a song a chorus
we could try
but we dont want anything to change the mood tonight

chorus tegan and sara
we are born
were hopeless on our own
but every chance we get we run
every chance we get we run
we are shown
were helpless on our own
but every chance we get we run
every chance we get we run4embed"
