its monday morning and i would kill for a chance to drive
get so far away from here with you my dear that ill never leave your side
nobody knows the troubles ive seen
in a van on a soapbox for the world to see

chorus
miles away and i wish this didnt mean so much to me
to be a monument for the rest of them
miles away and i wish this didnt mean so much to me
to be a monument for the rest of them

verse 2
were getting older ive started to fear for my life
is this the way that it should be this whole things riding on me
its been a long road so far with nowhere to turn
theres no looking back from here no more dwelling on my fears

chorus
miles away and i wish this didnt mean so much to me
to be a monument for the rest of them
miles away and i wish this didnt mean so much to me
to be a monument for the rest of them

twenty bucks says youll remember me
when you see me on your tv screen
it may be the first time
but it wont be the last time
twenty bucks says youll remember me
when you see me on your tv screen
it may be the first time
but it wont be the last time
twenty bucks says youll remember me
when you see me on your tv screen
it may be the first time
but it wont be the last time

and ill scream so loud that everyone in this place
will hear every word i say
cause this is my time this is my time to shine
let nothing stand in our way
and ill scream so loud that everyone in this place
will hear every word i say
cause this is my time this is my time to shine
let nothing stand in our way
