ive got nowhere to go
its not like suppers gonna be waitin there
sittin on the stove

i think ill take the long way home
if im in a traffic jam
at least i aint alone

in my two bedroom house
on a halfacre lot
where i keep the grass cut
and i keep the door unlocked
were two of a kind
this old dead frame and me
and just like this old house
im empty

aint nothin left but some little hope
where the pictures hung
might as well accept she aint comin back
i oughta move on

it shouldnt be this hard to do
it dont feel much like livin
sittin alone here in this living room
you might also likein my two bedroom house
on a halfacre lot
where i keep the grass cut
and i keep the door unlocked
were two of a kind
this old dead frame and me
and just like this old house
im empty

were two of a kind
this old dead frame and me
cause just like this old house
yeah just like this old house
im empty
yeah baby im emptyembed"
