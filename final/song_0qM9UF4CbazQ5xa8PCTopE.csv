then she met no id and gave me his number

and im rapping on the beats they was supposed to buy
i guess im getting high off my own supply
downtown mixing fabrics tryna find the magic
started a little blog just to get some traffic
old folksll tell you not to play in traffic uh

south park had em all laughing
now all my niggas designing and we all swaggin uh
ignore the critics just to say we did it

i pledge allegiance to my grandma
for that banana pudding our piece of americana
our apple pie was supplied through arm  hammer
straight out the kitchen shh dont wake nana
built a republic that still stands
im tryna lead a nation to leave to my little mans
or my daughter so im boiling this water
the scales was lopsided im just restoring order
hold up here comes grandma whats up yaya
whats that smell oh im just boiling some agua
no papa bad santa
the streets raised me pardon my bad manners
i got my liberty chopping grams up
street justice i pray god understand us
i pledge allegiance to all the scramblers
this is the starspangled banner
