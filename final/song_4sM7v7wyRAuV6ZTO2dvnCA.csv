i have a problem that i cannot explain
i have no reason why it should have been so plain
have no questions but i sure have excuse
i lack the reason why i should be so confused

chorus daron malakian  serj tankian
i know how i feel when im around you
i dont know how i feel when im around you
around you

verse 2 serj tankian
left a message but it aint a bit of use
i have some pictures the wild might be the deuce
today you saw you saw me you explained
playing the show when running down the plane

chorus daron malakian  serj tankian
i know how i feel when im around you
i dont know how i feel when im around you
i i know how i feel when im around you
i dont know how i feel when im around you
around you
