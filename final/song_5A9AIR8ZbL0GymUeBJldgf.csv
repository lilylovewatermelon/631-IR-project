6 am
the clock is ringing
i need to spend an hour snoozing
cause i dont think im gonna make it
i punch in
im still sleeping
watch the clock but its not moving
cause every day is never ending
i need to work im always spending

chorus
and i feel like im living the worst day
over and over again
and i feel like the summer is leaving again
i feel like im living the worst day
i feel like youre gone
and every day is the worst day ever

verse 2
yesterday was the worst day ever
and tomorrow wont be better
its history repeating on and on
summer plans are gone forever
i trade them in for dishpan water
and every day is never ending
i need to work im always spending

and i feel like im living the worst day
over and over again
and i feel like the summer is leaving again
i feel like im living the worst day
i feel like youre gone
and every day is the worst day ever

bridge
its so long
i cant go on
its so long
i cant go on

chorus
and i feel like im living the worst day
over and over again
i feel like the summer is leaving again
i feel like im living the worst day
i feel like youre gone
and every day is the worst day ever
whoa every day is the worst day ever
whoa whoa whoa is the worst day ever
whoa whoa whoa is the worst day ever
whoa whoa whoa is the worst day ever
