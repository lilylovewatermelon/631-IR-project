hermit crabs and cowry shells
crush beneath his feet as he comes towards you
hes waving at you
lift him up to see what you can see
he begins his focusing
hes aiming at you

verse 2
and now he has cutaways from memories
and closeups of anything that
he has seen or even dreamed
and now hes finished focusing
hes imagining lightning
striking sea sickness
away from here

chorus
look whos laughing now that youve wasted
how many years and youve barely even tasted
anything remotely close to
everything youve boasted about
look whos crying now

verse 3
driftwood floats after years of erosion
incoming tide touches roots to expose them
quicksand steals my shoe
clouds bring the fstop blues

how many years and youve barely even tasted
anything remotely close to
everything youve boasted about
look whos crying now2embed"
