i lost the signal and put you away
swore upon the sun id save you for a rainy day
loosened the noose then let go of the rope
i know if its never coming back it has to go

prechorus
i keep calling your name keep calling your name
i wanna hold you close but i never wanna feel ashamed
so i keep calling at night keep calling at night
i wanna hold you close i just never wanna hold you tight

chorus
goodness gracious i cant seem to stop calling if off
calling it off just to keep crawlin to your arms
goodness gracious i cant seem to stop calling it off
calling it off just to keep crawlin to your arms

verse 2
i found the weakness and put it to play
swore upon the stars id keep you till the night was day
shake my head dizzy so ill never know
you said if youre never coming back you have to go

prechorus
i keep calling your name keep calling your name
i wanna hold you close but i never wanna feel ashamed
so i keep calling at night keep calling at night
i wanna hold you close i just never wanna hold you tight
