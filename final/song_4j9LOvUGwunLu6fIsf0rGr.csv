visions in my head would lay
all the plans i had delayed
tricks on me my mind will play
see you laying next to me

wind that shakes the barley tree
kurt the only friend of me
he prepared me food and drinks
cause i will need all my strength

tomorrow im finally coming home tomorrow
i just gotta get through today
but hey whats one more day to wait

tomorrow youll be back in my arms tomorrow
i just gotta get through today
but hey whats one more day to wait
one more day

i been countin all the days
watchin all the season change
and i no longer have to wait
cause ima see your pretty face
you might also likei meet with this foolish shrink
tries to tell me what to think
but im wiser than he know
in one ear and out it go

how can they say you dont exist
when ive been branded by your lips
nothing they can say or do
will keep me from seeing you

tomorrow im finally coming home tomorrow
i just gotta get through today
but hey whats one more day to wait

tomorrow youll be back in my arms tomorrow
i just gotta get through today
but hey whats one more day to wait
one more day

i been countin all the days
watchin all the season change
and i no longer have to wait
cause ima see your pretty face

tomorrow im finally coming home tomorrow
i just gotta get through today
but hey whats one more day to wait
one more day
tomorrow youll be back in my arms tomorrow
i just gotta get through today
but hey whats one more day to wait
one more day

oh oh oh oh
oh oh ohembed"
