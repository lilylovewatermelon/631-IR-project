staying home alone on a friday
flat on the floor looking back on old love
or lack thereof
after all the crushes are faded
and all my wishful thinking was wrong
im jaded i hate it

chorus
im tired of being alone
so hurry up and get here
so tired of being alone
so hurry up and get here get here

verse 2
searching all my days just to find you
im not sure who im looking for
ill know it when i see you
until then ill hide in my bedroom
staying up all night just to write
a love song for no one

chorus
im tired of being alone
so hurry up and get here
so tired of being alone
so hurry up and get here

i could have met you in a sandbox
i could have passed you on the sidewalk
could i have missed my chance
and watched you walk away
