prove to be a terrifying vulture tony stark is only the icing on the cake the studio is so confident with what they’ve come up with that they’ve already announced the film’s sequel months ahead of its own release judging by the trailers this is going to be a web of fun  scopeyloganin part inspired by old man logan the film is set in a dystopian future where mutantkind has all but died out by the time logan hits theaters hugh jackman will have portrayed wolverine across 9 different xmen films over the course of 17 years thats an impressive feat and it makes sense that he would like to hang up his claws fortunately logan appears to be both the proper sendoff for wolverine and professor x and the ideal introduction for x23 laura kinney who may take over the mantle as wolverine as she has done in the comics were finally getting the wolverine movie we deserve r rating and all thanks to the success of fox deadpool but how will this film affect the xmen continuity only time will tell but for now lets just keep our fingers crossed for what seems to be a surprisingly wellcrafted character piece that happens to be set in a superhero world  scopeywonder womanthe dc extended universe has left some bad impressions with batman v superman dawn of justice and suicide squad there has never been a good liveaction superheroine movie and yet all hopes are up for wonder woman the long overdue solo movie of the amazonian warrior princess gal gadot’s performance as diana prince had already been one of the few things everyone liked in batman v superman and now she’ll have an entire film to prove her worth risks were taken by employing a female director patty jenkins of monster and a hardly used historical setting world war i add in fan favorite writer geoff johns and some inspiring trailers and wonder woman seems like the movie to add the necessary grace and wisdom to the uneven dc comics films  igordebragaalien covenantridley scott’s 1979 alien is a nearperfect movie  it is iconic words to describe the creatures various states have entered the lexicon facehugger xenomorph chestburster simply to fulfill the need of fans to discuss the events  none of them are named in the original  the first movie is a group of rational adults responding logically to an unknown force  as soon as they realize how big the creature has grown they try to leave  they do not waste time  two of the three remaining die in the few minutes it takes to prep the shuttle  ripley played by sigourney weaver escapes – barely – and only because she’s able to think clearly despite being terrified
alien changed the expectations for a woman in a film its visuals have permeated the global culture while prometheus was a disappointment ridley scott has shown he can make great movies blade runner gladiator black hawk down  alien covenant is a chance for the series to regain its position of prestige  and even if it’s a disappointment it’ll be an interesting one  bradapaloozaall eyez on meafter the critical acclaim and box office success of the nwa biopic straight outta compton a new story brings us a dramatic retelling of the short but intense and thrilling life career and death of tupac shakur from his struggles growing up in east harlem in the 70s and 80s to his rise as one of the definitive faces of hiphop the film will explore racial tensions of the 80s and 90s political context of the hiphop movement at the time and a visualization ganginvolvement in hiphop the film will also see the debut of demetrius shipp jr who will be playing the largerthanlife rapper in what’s slated to be one of the most talked about films in music this year  zachary mahabirblade runner 2049seeing all the acclaim blade runner has today it is hard to believe that it actually split critics and was ignored by audiences when it was released in 1982 yet here it is getting a bigbudgeted sequel in which 30 years after the events of the original an android hunter played by ryan gosling uncovers a dark secret and eventually finds the longmissing fellow policeman rick deckard again played by harrison ford director denis villeneuve already proved competence for scifi with arrival and by the trailer is doing his best to replicate the neonoir atmosphere add both ridley scott and writer hampton fancher are backing blade runner 2049 and it seems like a movie bound to please old fans and amass new ones  igordebragacars 3when someone mentions pixar there are probably a few films that come to mind finding nemo toy story monster’s inc inside out cars and cars 2 are probably hiding somewhere at the bottom of your list as the two worst reviewed movies in pixar’s arsenal they’re something of a black spot on pixars near spotless record

it’s not that anyone hates them people just don’t seem to care in fact their only true advocate is the cco of pixar himself john lasseter if you ask him he’ll explain that the cars franchise is something of a personal project for him inspired by his childhood love of cars most everyone else sees it as a mediocre bump on the amazing ride that is pixar’s filmography

but maybe cars 3 can right this when the first teaser trailer for cars 3 was released everything changed with what could be the most breathtaking and dark trailer for a kids movie ever the hype train for cars 3 is absolutely off the rails and we at genius couldn’t be more excited  alekazamcocoin 2015 pixar released two movies due to the disastrous production and consequent delay of the good dinosaur  inside out released in june was a success but the good dinosaur became pixar’s first film to not recoup its budget  in 2017 pixar is going to once again release two films but the outlook for this year looks much brighter especially for its highlyanticipated film coco

the film is inspired by día de los muertos and the artwork clearly reflects the colorful artwork and traditions centered around that holiday  the story follows miguel a boy who is passionate about music even though his family has banned music in the family when he ends up in the land of the dead he decides to search for his musical idol while accompanied by a mischievous spirit named hector

with the voice talents of anthony gonzales gael garcía bernal benjamin bratt and renee victor coco looks to be yet another great whimsical adventure from the folks at pixar  cordyleomewar for the planet of the apeswho knew that after the disastrous tim burton remake planet of the apes could still be more fun than a barrel of monkeys in 2011 rise of the planet of the apes was a fresh start showing the origins of the primate uprising creating the animals through topnotch motion capture
actionpacked followup dawn of the planet of the apes was one of the top moneymakers of 2014 leading most of its cast and crew to return in war for the planet of the apes

andy serkis is back as caesar the chimpanzee leader of the intelligent apes who are now forced to battle with a human army led by woody harrelsons ruthless colonel  igordebragakingsman the golden circlethe first kingsman film was more than just a modern james bond it was witty and fastpaced and interesting and shined the spotlight on not only the dangers of globalism but also a host of young upandcoming actors namely leads taron egerton and sophia cookson it carried a few unforgettable scenes and gory graphics galore see the controversial church massacre scene if theres any questions there its hard to imagine how kingsman the golden circle will be able to eclipse the first film but looking at the cast list is enough to excite even the casual movie fanatic regulars egerton colin firth and mark strong are to be joined by the likes of channing tatum jeff bridges julianne moore and more the title of the film appears to allude to the water stain left by a glass of whiskey on a table  chances are that were going to need several glasses to be able to stomach our excitement for this film  sereinik2embed"
