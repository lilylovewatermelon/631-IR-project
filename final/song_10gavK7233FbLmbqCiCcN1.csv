do you think he wants me anymore
its all left up to circumstances
a whole life filled with second chances
pounded like nails into my floor

everybody hates
and everybody dies
begin to seperate
a world thats full of lies
seperate yourself
to seperate itself
seperate yourself
to seperate itself

surely theres a better place for me
a place where i can spend enternity
a place where there is no more pain
and there is only sunshine reigning
and there is no one walking on their knees

everybody hates
and everybody dies
begin to seperate
a world thats full of lies
seperate yourself
to seperate itself
seperate yourself
to seperate itself
you might also likemy angels they surround me
my demons they have found me
my demons they surround me
my angels they have found me now
my angels they surround me
my demons they have found me now

seperate yourself
to seperate itself
seperate yourself
to seperate itself
seperate yourself
