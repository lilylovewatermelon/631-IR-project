let me let me begin
let me begin with an i owe you
who i owe everything to
lately lately my friend
lately you think im ignoring you
but ive been trying to pull through

prechorus
all of the pain i know youre looking down down on me
i could have been someone
i hurt everyone
pushed away everyone who got near

chorus
tell me something that i dont know
i couldnt let you go
fell on my knees
turned my face to the rain
thats when you heard my call
sold me my stubborn soul
phoenix is rising its rising again
oo oo oo
woah oo oo
woah oo oo

save me save me again
save me the way that you did before
cause no one ever could have loved me more

give me the strength when i need it more
give me the reason that im looking for

prechorus
i was a pain they were looking down down on me
i could have been someone
i hurt everyone
pushed away everyone that was near

chorus
tell me something that i dont know
i couldnt let you go
fell on my knees
turned my face to the rain
thats when you heard my call
sold me my stubborn soul
the phoenix is rising its rising again

rising woah oo oo
its rising woah oo oo

tell me something that i dont know
i couldnt let you go

turned my face to the rain
thats when you heard my call
sold me my stubborn soul
