watch me light the sky
light up the sky
watch me light the sky
light up the sky

verse 1
hands held high sweat dripping off me
light it softly got these fakers trying to stop me
this aint a hobby its a way of life
just like holyfield and tyson gloves on fight night
boom here comes the hurricane monsoon
switched up came to redecorate the room
my ears are ringing from hearing the same sound
so what now all of the walls just came down

prechorus
i blaze a trail like the rays from tail lights
sound shaking the ground like earthquakes hail might
someday ill die but not tonight
excuse me while i light up the sky

chorus
light up the sky
watch me light the sky
light up the sky
light up the sky

game time ripping mint condition
lights out stomping all competition
my upmost to its highest it gets no flyer
uh oh we set the mainframe on fire
boom cold lead from the peddle i push to the metal
the dust never settles
f5 level kick up the bass in the tremble
because faith thats rebel i could show you the devil

prechorus
i blaze a trail like the rays from taillights
sound shaking the ground like earthquakes and hail might
someday ill die but not tonight
excuse me while i light up the sky

chorus
light up the sky
watch me light the sky
light up the sky
light up the sky

bridge
nowhere else have i seen such lions led by lambs
so if youre not afraid of us stand up and take my hand
we got a battle upfront but beyond thats the promise land
and when we all shout together then believe me theyll understand
