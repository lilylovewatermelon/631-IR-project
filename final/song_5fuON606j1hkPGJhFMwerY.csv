i wanna tell you a story
aint got no characters in it but me
i wanna sing you a sad song
most of it i dont expect you to believe
it starts off just the whiskey and wine
oh some miles of travel and some real good times
but it ends in a dark corridor
where there aint no windows
and there aint no doors

chorus
well thats me
just adrinking off this bottle and adrifting out to sea
well thats me
just asitting here astaring and ashaking like a leaf
well thats me
just aleaning on my shovel in this graveyard of dreams
yeah thats me
just aleaning on my shovel in this graveyard of dreams

verse 2
i wanna take you to a shipwreck
a thousand miles underneath the black sea
it looks like everybodys sleeping
but look close they are dead indeed
i wanna lead you to an armchair
deep back in the files of my mind
i wanna sit you in a candles light
where ive been spending all of my time
you might also likechorus
well thats me
just adrinking off this bottle is it drinking off of me
well thats me
just asitting here astaring and ashaking like a leaf
well thats me
just aleaning on my shovel in this graveyard of dreams
yeah thats me
just aleaning on my shovel in this graveyard of dreams2embed"
