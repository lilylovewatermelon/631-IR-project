i heard you like to go out late at night
dance around the amber of the southern lights
knew you were home by the creak in the floor
your foot silhouette under a bedroom door

verse 2
driving me home at 7 am
hand in mine like a heavensent hymn
moving and shaking like the ramblers do
after gettin through the days i never thought id get through

chorus
you bring heaven down to me
coursin through my blood as i breathe
i bet the angels are jealous of a girl i know
she takes my stain and makes me white as snow
white as snow ooh

verse 3
i hear jesus makes sin white as linen like the sheets that were in
and your teeth when youre grinnin
take it away and you give it to god
like the night you dumped out all the liquor i bought

verse 4
and theres a way the grass smells on a summer night
when its freshly cut the moistures right
its nights like these in the august heat
i think the devils just another boy i can beat
see zach bryan liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likechorus
you bring heaven down to me
coursin through my blood as i breathe
i bet the angels are jealous of a girl i know
she takes my stain and makes me white as snow
white as snow ooh

chorus
you bring heaven down to me
coursin through my blood as i breathe
i bet the angels are jealous of a girl i know
she takes my stain and makes me white as snow
white as snow ooh1embed"
