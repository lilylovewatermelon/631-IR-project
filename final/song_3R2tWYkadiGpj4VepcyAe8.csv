whoa where have you been
my lifes not the same without you in it

verse 1
my love ive watched you disappear
right before my eyes right before i told you how i feel
no i must thank you now for the things youve done
you helped me fight my demons like a mother to her son
just hold on

chorus
whoa where have you been
my lifes not the same without you in it
whoa forever ill wait
your love and affection is all that i crave
i long for your kiss and your memory still remains

verse 2
my heavy heart you carried on your back
and right before your eyes i stood back up and picked up all the slack
my love i have done my best to hold my head up high
ill never be the same without you in my life

chorus
whoa where have you been
my lifes not the same without you in it
whoa forever ill wait
your love and affection is all that i crave
i long for your kiss and your memory still remains
see falling in reverse liveget tickets as low as 105you might also likebridge
oh blood in blood out oh

chorus
whoa where have you been
my lifes not the same without you in it
whoa forever ill wait
your love and affection is all that i crave
whoa where have you been
my lifes not the same without you in it
whoa forever ill wait
your love and affection is all that i crave
i long for your kiss and your memory still remains
i long for your kiss and your memory still remains1embed"
