chorus
this life i live like baby dont drink like
baby dont think too much dont drive
how i got here i cant even tell my nigga
aint a damn thing parked outside
size my cup nigga im gucci
sides my hair nigga im boosie
nigga burnt out cant even catch fire no more
figured it was just a west side movie

refrain
but thank god i got my bank where i keep my heart inside
and i keep it far away from all these hoes and flashin lights
im like granny with the whip im not oprah with these hoes
and i keep a snoopy barbie because it keep me on my toes

verse 1
we been ridin for ten exits and i still been in your throat
we get better by the steps so if i ever let you go
baby you classy baby you got it
baby you aint really spossed to do the whole thing
bitch too smart got lost just fuckin with a nigga
got tossed cause a nigga couldnt think

this life i live like baby dont drink like
baby dont think too much dont drive
how i got here i cant even tell my nigga
aint a damn thing parked outside
size my cup nigga im gucci
sides my hair nigga im boosie
nigga burnt out cant even catch fire no more
figured it was just a west side movie

verse 2
i was pillin in the back i was chillin in the back
cause i always really wanna be that nigga in the back
you dont live it with me i cant show you how to live
but i promise i can show a pussy nigga how to act
junked out smokin from the side door
with a bitch i wanted in the eighth grade
hope you got an ass like nori
hope you pussy niggas never see me
this is why i never want a feature
cause i can tell you bitches got a limit
i can be subjective bout you fuckin up the high
why you fuckin up the ride why you fuckin up the heist
i remember lookin from the outside
i remember workin after work late
i remember nigga havin nothin but my momma
and some starter on my mothafuckin birthday birthday
baby can i live it like i bought it
let my momma smoke it â€˜til she finish
let a nigga sip it all alone babe
it done been a long day it done been a hard 1030
all my niggas tell me that they want it
hope i see my niggas at the finish
let a nigga sip it all alone babe
it done been a long day it done been a hard 1030
