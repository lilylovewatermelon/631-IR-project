i like to see everything in neon
drink  lime green stay up til dawn
maybe  the way that im living is killing me
i like to light up the stage with a song
do shit to keep me turned on
but  one day i woke up like
maybe  ill do it differently

prechorus
so i moved to california‚ but its just a state of mind
it  turns out everywhere you go‚ you take yourself‚ thats not a lie
wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
its killing me slowly

chorus
dream a little dream of me
make  me into something sweet
turn the radio on dancing to a pop song
fuck it i love you
fuck it‚ i love you
fuck it i love you
i really do
