oh oh oh

verse 1
no matter what you say about love
i keep coming back for more
keep my hand in the fire
sooner or later i get what im askin for
no matter what you say about life
i learn every time i bleed
the truth is a stranger soul is in danger
i gotta let my spirit be free

prechorus
to admit that im wrong
and then change my mind
sorry but i have to move on
and leave you behind

chorus
i cant waste time so give it a moment
i realize nothings broken
no need to worry bout everything ive done
live every second like it was my last one
dont look back at a new direction
i loved you once needed protection
youre still a part of everything i do
youre on my heart just like a tattoo
just like a tattoo
ill always have you ill always have you
ill always have you

im sick of playing all of these games
its not about taking sides
when i looked in the mirror
it didnt deliver

prechorus
it hurt enough to think that i could stop
admit that im wrong and then change my mind
sorry but i gotta be strong and leave you behind

chorus
i cant waste time so give it a moment
i realize nothings broken
no need to worry bout everything ive done
live every second like it was my last one
dont look back at a new direction
i loved you once needed protection
youre still a part of everything i do
youre on my heart just like a tattoo
just like a tattoo
ill always have you ill always have you
ill always have you

bridge
if i live every moment
wont change any moment
theres still a part of me in you
i will never regret you
still the memory of you
marks everything i do ohoh
