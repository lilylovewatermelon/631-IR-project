she screams when im away
shes been gone before
i worried all the time why worry anymore
now i go away
now i know today

chorus
i picked out your star
turned night to day
a simple whisper from your voice
and i fade away
you wished for love
you pushed me away
your love for me was everything i need
the air i breathe

verse 2
she now shes all alone
her eyes they drown in tears
their love was meant to last
but she is blind with fear
now i go away
now i know today

chorus
i picked out your star
turned night to day
a simple whisper from your voice
and i fade away
you wished for love
you pushed me away
your love for me was everything i need
the air i breathe

leave me be
now im free
love reflecting everything
you want space
i need you to help me see this through
there she goes there she goes there she goes

chorus
i picked out your star
turned night to day
a simple whisper from your voice
and i fade away
you wished for love
you pushed me away
your love for me was everything i need
the air i breathe
i picked out your star
turned night to day
a simple whisper from your voice
and i fade away
you wished for love
you pushed me away
your love for me was everything i need
the air i breatheembed"
