verse 3
well the pregame was bad
but the postman was worse
and the president kept saying shit that wed already heard
so we kept the tv off
and i kept on writing songs
that i knew youd come to hate
if you ever knew what they were about

dont shout at me like im across the room
when im right here when youre right this time
well do better in another life in another time with another

hello to curlin up with a bottle

but ill let you know said ill let you know
will you say in time
right now were doing fine
but well let you know said well let you know
