why do you care what people think
are you hooked up to their leash
you know anklebiters
ate up your personality
try to remember how it felt
to just make up your own steps
and let anklebiters
chew up spit out someone else

prechorus
fall in love with yourself
because

chorus
someday youre gonna be the only one youve got
someday youre gonna be the only one youve got
why you wanna please the world and leave yourself to drop dead
someday youre gonna be the only one youve got

verse 2
what do you actually expect
a broken mirror to reflect
you know anklebiters
gave you a false perception
and why do i cmon cmon
defend your ignorance
oh why do i cmon cmon
defend the state youre in

you should fall in love with yourself
oh again
fall in love with yourself
because

chorus
someday youre gonna be the only one youve got
someday youre gonna be the only one youve got
why you wanna please the world and leave yourself to drop dead
someday youre gonna be the only one youve got

someday youre gonna be alone
