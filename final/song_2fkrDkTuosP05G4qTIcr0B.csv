but your scars are healing wrong
the helium balloon inside your room has come undone
and its pushing up at the ceiling
and the flickering lights it cannot get beyond
everyone takes turns
now its yours to play the part
and theyre sitting all around you
holding copies of your chart
and the misery inside their eyes is
synchronized and reflecting it to yours

hold on
one more time with feeling
try it again breathings just a rhythm
say it in your mind until you know that the words are right
this is why we fight

you thought by now youd be
so much better than you are
you thought by now theyd see
that you had come so far

and the pride inside their eyes
would synchronize into a love youve never known
so much more than youve been shown
you might also likehold on
one more time with feeling
try it again breathings just a rhythm
say it in your mind until you know that the

words are right

this is why we fight
this is why we fight2embed"
