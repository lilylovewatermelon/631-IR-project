see a light in the darkness
a city shining without a veil
this hill becoming a mountain
a solid rock that will never fail

chorus
your name my hope
fortress in the raging storm
my heart is your home
jesus let your love take hold

verse 2
the stone the builders rejected
laid to ransom a fractured bride
our crushing weight on your shoulders
you stand forever with arms stretched wide

chorus
your name my hope
fortress in the raging storm
my heart is your home
jesus let your love take hold
your name my hope
fortress in the raging storm
my heart is your home
jesus let your love take hold
