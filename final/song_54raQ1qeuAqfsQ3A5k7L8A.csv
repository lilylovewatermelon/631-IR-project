i grew up as your usual suburbanite
a tiny town in massachusetts overwhelmingly white white— white— white
i went to church on sundays in a suit and a tie in a suit and a tie
then spent my free time watching family guy
i started doing comedy when i was just a sheltered kid
i wrote offensive shit and i said it
father please forgive me for i did not realize what i did
or that id live to regret it

prechorus
times are changing and im getting old
are you gonna hold me accountable
my bed is empty and im getting cold
isnt anybody gonna hold me accountable ugh

chorus
im problematic
hes a problem
when i was 17 on halloween i dressed up as aladdin
hes a problem
i did not darken my skin but still it feels weird in hindsight

verse 2
i want to show you how im growing as a person but first
i feel i must address the lyrics from the previous verse
i tried to hide behind my childhood and thats not okay
my actions are my own i wont explain them away
ive done a lot of selfreflecting since i started singing this song
i was totally wrong when i said it
father please forgive me for i did not realize what i did
or that id live to regret it
