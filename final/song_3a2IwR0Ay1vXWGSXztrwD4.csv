turn it off
stop look listen what i’m saying
don’t push haven’t got to chase it
just me i don’t have to fake it
never gonna change it i don’t have to fake it

bridge
back off back off you wont get very far
back off back off i think you think you’re a star
back off back off i don’t know who you are
i think you think you’re a star you’re a star

prechorus
there’s something bad in you
makes me wanna scream
i’d like it out of my mind so
i can’t hear a thing
im about to tell you what i mean
turn it off off i turn it off

chorus
fast cars smooth talk
flash watch  turn it off
fake hair fake tan
lip gloss  turn it off
hot shot who cares
cause i just don’t give a damn
turn it off off
i turn it off

time moves seems like nothings changing

so seen but it doesn’t faze me
never gonna change me no it doesn’t faze me
