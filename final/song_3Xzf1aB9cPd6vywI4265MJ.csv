her only one
sometimes this road will bear no signs of direction direction
so rely on your heart to lead the way lead the way lead
and sometimes you will need to take correction correction
dont you dare let your humble mind sway proceed
see some days will be brighter than a babys name
and others will be grayer than the hairs on your daddys face
and when those gray days start to come
just take it in and just say

oooo oo oooo and know that the suns coming tomorrow oh yeah i promise
oooo oo oooo you know that it will be okay yeah
oooo oo oooo and know that the suns coming tomorrow oh yeah i promise
oooo oo oooo you know that it will be okay yeah
