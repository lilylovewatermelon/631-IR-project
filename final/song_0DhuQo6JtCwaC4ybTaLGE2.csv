driving down the road again
a highway that never ends
taking naps in my old car
singing in guitar bars
killing time with cafe queens
and truckers playing slot machines
i meet a lot of wannabes
dreaming big and living free like me

charlie runs the produce shack
living in a van out back
selling peas and homemade syrup
cantaloupes and elvis shirts
bragging on future plans
with whiskey breath and shaky hands
i meet a lot of wannabes
dreaming big and living free like me

chorus
wearing wrinkled traveling clothes
to another onenight show
cause thats where i was born to be
have guitar will travel light
here today and gone tonight
playing this lifetime lottery
see kenny chesney liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likeverse 2
heres to faces i have seen
a carnival of those who dream
rodeos seeking fame
table dancers i cant name
willie t in abilene
karaokes alltime king
and every six string wannabe
dreaming big and living free like me

chorus
wearing wrinkled traveling clothes
to another onenight show
cause thats where i was born to be
have guitar will travel light
here today and gone tonight
playing this lifetime lottery

verse 3
to every dreamer i have known
may lady luck take you home
i pray for every wannabe
dreaming big and living free like me
i pray for every wannabe
dreaming big and living free like me
outro
living free like me
living free like me
living free like meembed"
