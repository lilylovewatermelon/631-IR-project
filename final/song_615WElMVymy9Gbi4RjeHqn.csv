i dont want the same disease
that everybodys got these days
i dont wanna live that way
i do not wanna live in pain
so take your parasites away
and keep em somewhere far from me
cause i dont want the same disease
that everybodys got these days

prechorus
i dont want to live that way
i do not want to live in pain

chorus
another fool in history
ill tell you what it means to me
its nothing but lobotomy
its nothing but an angry sea
striking a wave with me oh with me

verse 2
its coming like a big freight train
its spreading like a wild flame
you know its coming all our ways
so dig your dirt and make your grave
mmmmmmamma save me
come on and vaccinate me
cause i dont want the same disease
that everybodys got these days

another fool in history
ill tell you what it means to me
its nothing but lobotomy
its nothing but an angry sea
striking a wave with me with me with me
