im awake again at 3am
my heads so tired but i dont care
no i dont
outside the sky looks like its burning down but
i wont fear
no i wont

chorus
falling down like angels fighting
stars and lightning hold me tightly
hold me tightly

verse 2
close your blinds tonight
theyll soften and disperse the light and
if youre lucky a car might drive by
and the headlights fill your ceiling with shooting stars
works of art
waiting for your arms to part
and welcome in my beating heart
badum badum badum badum

chorus
falling down like angels fighting
stars and lightning hold me tightly
hold me tight like angels fighting
stars and lightning hold me tightly
hold me tight like angels fighting
stars and lightning hold me tightly
