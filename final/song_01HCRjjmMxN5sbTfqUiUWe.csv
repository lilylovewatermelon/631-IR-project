i was all alone we were young you were like wine
heady as the fog rolling in oer the hillside
lovely as the song in the air as the wind blows
opiate as the cold of the frost on the windows
lo the rose is gone from my eyes so deceiving
so my little dove im afraid i am leaving

verse 2
now i am not the fool i was when i was younger
crocodile eyes i have seen how you hunger
fluttering your lashes like ashes and embers
warm and bright as fire devouring timber
no i cannot trust what you say when youre grieving
so my love im sorry but still i am leaving

verse 3
even when you hunt me with ire relentless
batter down my door when you find me defenceless
i will not abide all your raging and reaving
i have set my mind and my will i am leavingyou might also like1embed"
