but i dont feel any different
the clanking of crystal
explosions off in the distance
in the distance

so this is the new year
and i have no resolutions
its selfassigned penance
for problems with easy solutions

so everybody put your best suit or dress on
lets make believe that we are wealthy for just this once
lighting firecrackers off on the front lawn
as thirty dialogues bleed into one
i wish the world was flat as the old days
and i could travel just by folding the map
no more airplanes or congested freeways
thered be no distance that could hold us back

thered be no distance that could hold us back
thered be no distance that could hold us back

so this is the new year
so this is the new year
so this is the new year
so this is the new yearsee death cab for cutie liveget tickets as low as 147you might also likeembed"
