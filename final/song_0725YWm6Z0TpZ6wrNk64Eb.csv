too many bottles of this wine we cant pronounce
too many bowls of that green no lucky charms
the maids come around too much
parents aint around enough
too many joy rides in daddys jaguar
too many white lies and white lines
super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
super rich kids with nothing but fake friends

verse 1 frank ocean
start my day up on the roof
theres nothing like this type of view
point the clicker at the tube
i prefer expensive news
new car new girl
new ice new glass
new watch good times babe
its good times yeah
she wash my back three times a day
this shower head feels so amazing
well both be high the help dont stare
they just walk by they must dont care
a million one a million two
a hundred more will never do

verse 2 earl sweatshirt
alright close your eyes to what you cant imagine
we are the xannygnashing
caddysmashing bratty assy
he mad he snatched his daddys jag
and used the shit for batting practice
adamant and he thrashing
purchasing crappy grams with half the hand of cash you handed
panic and patch me up
pappy done latchkeyed us
toying with raggy anns and mammy done had enough
brash as fuck breachin all these aqueducts
dont believe us
treat us like we cant erupt yup
alternate verse 2 frank ocean
polo sweats and hermes blankets
them label hoes be stealing my shit
and all they clothes revealing they tits
pills high enough to touch the rim in that bitch
we party in my living room
cause father is gone
and he left me this empire
that runs on its own
so all i got to do is whatever the fuck i want
all we ever do is whatever the fuck we want

verse 3 frank ocean
we end our day up on the roof
i say ill jump i never do
but when im drunk i act a fool
talking bout do they sew wings on tailored suits
im on that ledge she grabs my arm
she slaps my hand
its good times yeah
sleeve rips off i slip i fall
the markets down like 60 stories
and some dont end the way they should
my silver spoon has fed me good
a million one a million cash
close my eyes and feel the crash

too many joy rides in daddys jaguar
too many white lies and white lines

super rich kids with nothing but fake friends

outro frank ocean
