paintings of dogs playing pool
smoking cigarettes they drink til they drool
well we aint so dumb just numb
and tomorrows another year
could you tell us what happened cause we werent here
weve been hitching a ride with a big fake rubber thumb

chorus
and youre a star now
blinking bright
and you drive so fast now
out of sight

verse 2
the tickertape wants us to fail
and the limousine just drives us to jail
and the concierge cant tell us where the ladies dance
but you are my friend in miles
radio waves stations and dials and smiles
cities and towns slow down

chorus
and youre a star now
blinking bright
and you drive so fast now
out of sight
see smash mouth liveget tickets as low as 56you might also likerefrain
out of sight
out of sight

chorus
and youre a star now
blinking bright
and you drive so fast now
out of sight

refrain
out of sight
out of sight
out of sightembed"
