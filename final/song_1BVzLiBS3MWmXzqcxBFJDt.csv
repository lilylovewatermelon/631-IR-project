i had one saying we were done
in a baton rouge college bar
it kinda came out of nowhere
man i took that one pretty hard that one pretty hard
and i had another one in another town
and i spent a whole lot of nights missing her
til it all went black she stopped texting back
and i finally got the picture

chorus
so heres to the almost so close
its over out of the blues
heres to the hey i think we need to talk
and the it aint me its you oh it aint me
heres to the tears and beers and wasted years
on the weeds that looked like daisies
i wouldnt be sitting here next to you
if it werent for the almost maybes

verse 2
heres to the one that my family thought
was gonna make me drop to one knee
and i tried like hell but i couldnt help
my mama loved her more than me mama loved her more than me
and to all those july crushes
turning into september leavins
goodbyes that didnt feel good back then
it happened for a real good reason

heres to the almost so close
its over out of the blues
heres to the hey i think we need to talk
and the it aint me its you oh it aint me
heres to the tears and beers and wasted years
on the weeds that looked like daisies
i wouldnt be sitting here next to you
if it werent for the almost maybes

if it werent for the almost maybes

chorus
heres to the almost so close
its over out of the blues

on the weeds that looked like daisies
i wouldnt be sitting here next to you
if it werent for the almost maybes
