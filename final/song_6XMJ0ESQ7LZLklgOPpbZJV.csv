thats not what i came here for
no its not what i came here for
and i wont hear you cry when im gone
i wont know if im doing you wrong
i never know if im doing you wrong

hook
a constant reminder of where i can find her
light that might give up the way
its all that im asking for without her im lost
but my love dont fade away
so watch the world tear us apart
a stoic mind and bleeding heart
you never see my bleeding heart
and your lights always shining on
and i been traveling oh so long
i been traveling oh so long

hook
a constant reminder of where i can find her
light that might give up the way
its all that im asking for without her im lost
but my love dont fade away
