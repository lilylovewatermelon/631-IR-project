flying out of broken soil
safe to say that you blinded me
i saw you when my sight was sore
met your lips in the dead of night
and took you on the kitchen floor
good god i got it bad for you babe

guess i don’t know anything about it
guess i thought you were preaching to an empty room
and i’ll tell you how i feel but i don’t want to speak too soon
so i just pray it’s all true

well you don’t know much about me
i’ll explain it as best i can
i’m afraid of getting rich just to find out
it was fools gold in my pan
time is wasted on a boy who is faking
pretending just to be a man
good god i got it bad for you babe

guess i don’t know anything about it
guess i thought you were preaching to an empty room
and i’ll tell you how i feel but i don’t want to speak too soon
so i just pray it’s all true
see wild rivers liveget tickets as low as 103you might also likeoh and i just pray it’s all true

guess i don’t know anything about it
guess i thought you were preaching to an empty room
and i’ll tell you how i feel but i don’t want to speak too soon
so i just pray it’s all trueembed"
