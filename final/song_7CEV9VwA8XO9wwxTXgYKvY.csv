load the car and write the note
grab your bag and grab your coat
tell the ones that need to know
we are headed north
one foot in and one foot back
it dont pay to live like that
so i cut the ties and i jumped the tracks
for never to return

chorus
oh brooklyn brooklyn take me in
are you aware the shape im in
my hands they shake my head it spins
oh brooklyn brooklyn take me in

verse 2
when at first i learned to speak
i used all my words to fight
with him and her and you and me
oh but its just a waste of time
its such a waste of time
that woman shes got eyes that shine
like a pair of stolen polished dimes
she asked to dance i said its fine
ill see you in the morning time
see the avett brothers liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likechorus
oh brooklyn brooklyn take me in
are you aware the shape im in
my hands they shake my head it spins
oh brooklyn brooklyn take me in

bridge
three words that became hard to say
i and love and you
what you were then i am today
look at the things i do

chorus
oh brooklyn brooklyn take me in
are you aware the shape im in
my hands they shake my head it spins
oh brooklyn brooklyn take me in

oh brooklyn brooklyn take me in
are you aware the shape im in oh
my hands they shake my head it spins spins
oh brooklyn brooklyn take me in

verse 3
dumbed down and numbed by time and age
the dreams the catch the world the cage
the highway sets the travelers stage
all exits look the same
outro
three words that became hard to say
i and love and you
i and love and you
i and love and you5embed"
