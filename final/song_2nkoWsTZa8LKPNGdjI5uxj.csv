one more day well spend together
let your eyes look up upon me for the better
oh i know im worse for weather
but my love i wont give up
spend my days cursing my soul
wishing i could paint my scars and make me whole
oh i know i could be better
but my love i wont give up

ill be your strong man ill be your west coast
ill be the sun ill be the waves ill be the one you love the most

ill change my ways if you would stay
and all your tears that you have cried will go away
oh just grant me one more day

i see the future of the ones that ive ignored
i guess i was born to be at war
and my love i wont give up
so my love please dont give up
