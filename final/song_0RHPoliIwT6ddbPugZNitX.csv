high higher than the sun
you shoot me from a gun
i need you to elevate me here
at the corner of your lips
as the orbit of your hips
eclipse you elevate my soul

chorus
ive got no selfcontrol
been living like a mole
now going down excavation
i and i in the sky
you make me feel like i can fly
so high elevation

verse 2
a star lit up like a cigar
strung out like a guitar
maybe you could educate my mind
explain all these controls
i cant sing but ive got soul
the goal is elevation

chorus
a mole digging in a hole
digging up my soul
now going down excavation
i and i in the sky
you make me feel like i can fly
so high elevation
see u2 liveget tickets as low as 450you might also likebridge
love lift me out of these blues
wont you tell me something true
i believe in you

chorus
a mole digging in a hole
digging up my soul
going down excavation
i and i in the sky
you make me feel like i can fly
so high elevation

outro
elevation
elevation
elevation
