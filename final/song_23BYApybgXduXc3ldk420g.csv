hail to the light that my babys watchin me
in the darkness of the window i can hardly get to sleep
wish for the hour that the night time soon shall pass
and the morning dew will bring us to a day our souls can last

chorus
love has a reason theres a meaning to the world
were giving love yeah

verse 2
situation candle light
enough to see the bits around you but its never very bright
stare at a memory you through the grapevine heard the truth
its good to learn from your mistakes but that only works in youth

chorus
love has a reason theres a meaning to the world
were giving love giving love
were giving love giving love

bridge
restless minds curtain calls follow fanfares
troubled hearts just a walk down the hall
restless hearts you take a punch just to land one
troubled minds its only fair after all
see gavin degraw liveget tickets as low as 53you might also likeverse 3
mountin the trail but you got it in sight
sometimes our only way is jumpin
i hope your not afraid of heights
reach in my pocket for a bill that isnt there
to face all of the undoings is still more than i can bear

chorus
love has a reason theres a meaning to the world
were giving love yeah
giving love giving love

interlude
its always been good to me
its always been good to me
its always been good to me
its always been good to me
its always been good to me
its always been good to me

chorus
love has a reason theres a meaning to the world
were giving loveembed"
