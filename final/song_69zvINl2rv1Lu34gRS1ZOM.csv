purple rain purple rain go away
tired of pain and the struggle feeling go away
nowadays i know some people tired of minimum wage
nowadays know some people try to copy the wave
off these drugs tryna kick my ways
lemonade some of these niggas is minute maid
aint have no game remember them hoes used to play
remember them hoes used to play

verse 1
thirtyshot glock no crate box
and i used to sleep in the basement
learned my religion i prayed hard
took that nigga to the graveyard
cant treat my city like spades we not playin cards
stop that car at a red light it dont stay in park
