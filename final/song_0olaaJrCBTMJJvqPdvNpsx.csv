another head hangs lowly
child is slowly taken
and the violence caused such silence
who are we mistaken

prechorus
but you see its not me it’s not my family
in your head in your head they are cryin
with their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
in your head in your head they are cryin

chorus
in your head in your head
zombie zombie zombieieie
what’s in your head in your head
zombie zombie zombieieieie oh

verse 2
another mothers brеakin
heart is takin over
when thе violence causes silence
we must be mistaken

prechorus
its the same old theme since 1916
in your head in your head theyre still fightin
with their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
in your head in your head they are dyin
