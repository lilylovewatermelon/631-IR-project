when i get where im going
on the far side of the sky
the first thing that im gonna do
is spread my wings and fly

verse 2
im gonna land beside a lion
and run my fingers through his mane
or i might find out what its like
to ride a drop of rain

chorus
yeah when i get where im going
therell be only happy tears
i will shed the sins and struggles
i have carried all these years
and ill leave my heart wide open
i will love and have no fear
yeah when i get where im going
dont cry for me down here

verse 3
im gonna walk with my grandaddy
and hell match me step for step
and ill tell him how i missed him
every minute since he left
then ill hug his neck

so much pain and so much darkness
in this world we stumble through
all these questions i cant answer
so much work to do

and i see my makers face
ill stand forever in the light
of his amazing grace
yeah when i get where im going
therell be only happy tears
hallelujah
i will love and have no fear
when i get where im going
yeah when i get where im going6embed"
