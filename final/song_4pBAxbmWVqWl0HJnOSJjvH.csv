and if that youre thinking youre ready to give it a try
and maybe you might want to wait before you give yourself away
or maybe the reasons youre willing are burning inside

and if you say that you want and girl you know you need it
and say that you dont want to be caught between someone else and your love
but till youre older now youve got to get a little bit older now
a little older now youve got to get a little bit older now
a little older now youve got to get a little bit older now
a little older now youve got to get a little bit older now

so when the weekend come yes youll have some fun
then youll drink some wine and youll drink some rum
but before too long when your pressures gone
you know that youre waiting for someone to come yeah
let me know say when you getgo you let go

let me know said if youre willing to let go
witchy womans what she wanted
said if you got the body you should flaunt it flaunt it

and if you say that you want and girl you know you need it
and say that you dont want to be caught between someone else and your love
but till youre older now youve got to get a little bit older now
a little older now youve got to get a little bit older now
a little older now youve got to get a little bit older now
a little older now youve got to get a little bit older now
you might also likeand if you say that you want and girl you know you need it
and say that you dont want to be caught between someone else and your love
but till youre older now youve got to get a little bit older now
a little older now youve got to get a little bit older now
a little older now youve got to get a little bit older now
a little older now youve got to get a little bit older now1embed"
