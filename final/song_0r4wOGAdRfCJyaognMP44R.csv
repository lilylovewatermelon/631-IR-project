when a girl at the party when she backin it

and i dont mean no janitor the way she mopping the flow

man this girl must be a pimp the way im ready to ho
i wanna take you out the ghetto girl around the globe
freaky in the kitchen girl go somehwere around the stove

when the dreadlocks swang and the roof come off
