and if i had a clue id know exactly what to do
if i were the wiser of the two
and if i saw it all so clear id write it down and bend your ear
if i were the clearer of the two

prechorus anthony kiedis
we could take a walk into the canyons of 5th avenue
sing and dance just to name a few

chorus anthony kiedis
all i do
all i do

verse 2 anthony kiedis
and if i heard the angels sing id sing it back to you
and bring sound of heaven ringing just for you
and if i saw the sun fall down id pick it up and make a crown
one that was a perfect fit for you

prechorus anthony kiedis  john frusciante
we could take a walk into the apple orchard by the school
we could make a little residue
we could find a place to stay a secret little hideaway
spend a little time inside of you
