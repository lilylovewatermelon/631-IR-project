sometimes i wanna get away from all the confusion
causin pollution
i know you wish you could run away from this institution
cause theres no solution to survive

verse 1 rasheed
another day when im waking up
i turn my tv on cnn
another homie done bit the dust my best friends back up in the pen
somebody hit the twin towers my boy and the buildings came tumbling down
all we could do was watch in tears
while the people of america wondered how we let it go down
then i heard a sound when i turned around
this old man said pray for me
said ive been in this world for 88 long years and go my knowledge can you stay for me
i looked him in his eyes and gave him a smile and said mister i dont mean no harm
but you aint going nowhere so just pull up a chair
i got greens fresh off the farm
and with that he pulled a bottle from his pocket and said youngin ima give it a try
i said hold up pops i aint forget about the knowledge you promised so pass it by
and then he said

chorus

verse 2 grimm
from dusk to dawn moms always tellin me you must move on
let the past be the last thing to dust you son
and i trust you mom
but the  lust for fun wanna bust my gun
wasnt much to some then you measured up to most started walking down the road
towards that treasure up the coast
you just never fucking know what you gonna see where ya gonna be who you gonna meet
its true you gonna sleepin slip into silence
shotguns firing choppers and sirens
spotlight shinin flashin on the glance
at a boy without a chance and the devil on his ass
you might also likebaby bash
i be sayin though livin my life wishin and hopin
i be sayin though chasin the dreams
i be sayin though same thing that will make you laugh gonna make you cry
thats how it go man why ask why

i be sayin though take me away from my frustration
i be sayin though teach me to use my imagination
i be sayin though same thing that gonna make you laugh gonna make you cry
thats how it go man why ask why
