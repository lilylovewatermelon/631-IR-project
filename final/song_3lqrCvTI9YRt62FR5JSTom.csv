i see you there dont know where you come from
unaware the stare from someone
dont appear to care that i saw you and i want you
whats your name cause i have to know it
you let me in and begin to show it
were terrified cause were heading straight for it might get it

verse 2
youve been the song playing on the background
all along but youre turning up now
and everyone is rising to meet you to greet you
turn around and youre walking toward me
im breaking down and youre breathing slowly
you say the word and i will be your man your man

chorus
say when and my own two hands
will comfort you tonight tonight
say when and my own two arms
will carry you tonight tonight

verse 3
were coming close and then even closer
we bring it in but we go no further
were separate two ghosts in one mirror no nearer
later on if it turns to chaos
hurricane coming all around us
see the crack pull it back from the window you stay low

say when and my own two hands
will comfort you tonight tonight
say when and my own two arms
will carry you tonight tonight

verse 4
i come across you lost and broken
youre coming to but youre slow in waking
you start to shake you still havent spoken what happened
theyre coming back and you just dont know when
you want to cry but theres nothing coming
theyre gonna push until you give in or say when

verse 5
now were here and it turns to chaos
hurricane coming all around us
double crack throws you back from the window you stay low
it all began with the man and country
every plan turns another century
around again another nation has fallen

prechorus
maybe god can be on both sides
of the gun never understood why
some of us never get it so good so good
some of this was here before us
all of this will go after us
it never stops until we give in give in
chorus
say when and my own two hands
will comfort you tonight tonight
say when and my own two arms
will carry you tonight tonight
say when and my own two hands
will comfort you tonight tonight7embed"
