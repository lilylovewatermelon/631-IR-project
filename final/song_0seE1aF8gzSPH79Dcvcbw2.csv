ive these dreams im walking home
home when it used to be
and everything is as it was
frozen in front of me
here i stand 6 feet small
romanticizing years ago
its a bitter sweet feeling
hearing wrapped around your finger on the radio

prechorus
and these days
i wish i was 6 again
oh make me a red cape
i want to be superman

chorus
oh if only my life was more like 1983
all these things would be
more like they were at the start of me
heaven made in 83

verse 2
thinking about my brother ben
i miss him every day
he looks just like his brother john
but on an 18 month delay
see john mayer liveget tickets as low as 99you might also likehere i stand 6 feet small
and smiling because im scared as hell
kind of like my life is like a sequel to a movie
where the actors names have changed oh well
prechorus
and these days
i wish i was 6 again
oh make me a red cape
i want to be superman

chorus
oh if only my life was more like 1983
all these things would be
more like they were at the start of me
heaven made in 83

verse 3
and most my memories have escaped me
or confused themselves with dreams
if heavens all we want it to be
send your prayers to me
care of 1983
you can paint that house a rainbow of colors
rip out the floorboards
replace the shutters but
thats my plastic in the dirt
outro
whatever happened to my
whatever happened to my
whatever happened to my lunchbox
when came the day that it got thrown away
and dont you think i should have had some say in that decision4embed"
