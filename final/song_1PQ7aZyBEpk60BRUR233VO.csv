worn out and faded faded the weakness starts to show to show
they created created the generation that we know we know
washed up and hated and hated the system moves too slow too slow
they give us answers answers to questions they dont even know

and you create create the problems that will never go away

you made it you played it your shit is overrated
you made it you played it your shit is over
