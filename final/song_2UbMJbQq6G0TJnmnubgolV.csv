verse 1 ruby da archangel
ayy sold my soul to the grey became a household name
i claimed my grave and chained my name
im out the game i dont play to win
i dont play at all and win by default
i climbed to the top just to see how far down i would fall yikes
looked up at the heavens and thought it looked small
below me a valley of demons constantly schemin
i look back down thinking fuck all of yall
i came into this world as an accident
blazin trails just to get a whiff of that blackened scent
pull up in the porsche if the benz got in an accident fuck
ima have to get my car wrapped again
im back again back against the wall
tryna live it up before the curtain falls
white knuckle grip holdin up my grey cabal
any questions give one of my managers a call bitch

verse 2 lil apache
used to hide from the pigs now its the irs
wetto still white trash fuck all the alphabets
aint a damn thing changed but the change i got
all these chains came from pain and the blame i rock
just gimme the drop gimme the spot
give me the time give me the place
ringin the nine bringin the mob
keepin the iron by my waist
off of the lines like a race
my decline gave me space
to get my mind to redefine what the fuck im lookin for today
so its fuck an intro fuck what you think you know
crim was better on dope fuck i heard that before
pullin crowds like the pope heard you broke and it shows
i wont say no names though but he got a cameo oh
uicide till the murder show greygrey
been gettin head all around the globe
backstage hoes tell em tallyho maybe oddy though
