i see the gods avert their gaze from me
my fucking form is but a wreck beneath them
and there are always people i can call on
its all so easy for me

chorus
no more taking chances
no more teeth to bite with
no more smiling faces
i am alone again

verse 2
you wanna talk
you wanna talk it out
cause the jokes on me and im laughing too
you want to watch me bleed
cause i bleed so well
its all so easy for me

bridge
eternally eternally
do you like the way it feels
like fire from the heavens
carving past the surface into you
do you like the way it feels
like fire from the heavens
tearing me asunder beside you

its all so easy for me
its all so easy for me4embed"
