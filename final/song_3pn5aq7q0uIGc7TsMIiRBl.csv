chorus
after months of feeling dead
finally feel ill live again
hearing voices in my head
telling me ill heal again

i invested all my trust
and you gave me your ass to kiss yeah
love dont love nobody no im sayin what up though
love dont love nobody love love love
love dont love nobody yeah uh uh uh

verse
fresh out of that bottom cutthroat conniver
dont want my mama crying plus he wildin so i shot him
see the problem is id never do you how you did me
every move i made i tried to consider your feelings
feeling backstabbed and heartbroken
i thought that i was broken i still left my heart open
you told me that your love would last forever id pivot on it
told you all my problems and my past you shitted on it
now you actin bougie and big bad cause that nigga on you
you dont know i ran up me a bag im finna get rid of homie
got me in my feelings im big mad plus im feeling lonely
i dont wanna hear shit about shit all you bitches phony
i know ill never love again but you cant say the same thing
i know ill never trust again and i can say that with ease
you get to live a fairytale dream what about me
i left my heart inside my pocket and threw away the key
see rod wave liveget tickets as low as 85you might also likechorus
after months of feeling dead
finally feel ill live again
hearing voices in my head
telling me ill heal again
i had gave you all my love
gave you all i had to give
i invested all my trust
and you gave me your ass to kiss yeah
love dont love nobody no im sayin what up though
love dont love nobody love love love
love dont love nobody yeah uh uh uh
it dont love nobody it dont love nobody
