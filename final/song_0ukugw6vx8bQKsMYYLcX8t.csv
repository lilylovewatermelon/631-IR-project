it was once a dark lonely summers eve on the lonely streets of sunset
when the lord called upon six crazy mcs
jdog charlie scene johnny 3 tears da kurlzz and tha producer
hey uh man you forgot the homie funny man come on dawg aw

chorus deuce
and i can show you how to hump without making love
the way you look at me i can tell that youre a freak
and ill be laying in the sun bottle and a gun
the way you look at me i can tell that youre a freak

verse 1 funny man  charlie scene
my clothes are always retro
sexual like im hetero
and i play a bitch like nintendo zelda
take her for a ride in my benzo
funny as fuck i should do standup
bust caps at the crowd like i dont give a fuck
got a goldass grill
hit me on the sidekick if you wanna chill
hop in the ride lets roll
im a baritone with the voice so low
itll make your speakers explode
and ill drop your panties to the floor
let me bend you over let me lay you sideways
hop in the back girl its freaky friday
if you got beef then you better step up bitch
hollywood undead aint nothing to fuck with
you might also likechorus deuce
and i can show you how to hump without making love
the way you look at me i can tell that youre a freak
and ill be laying in the sun bottle and a gun
the way you look at me i can tell that youre a freak

verse 2 charlie scene  funny man
girl come and smoke my pole like a marlboro
introduce me to your mom as charles
its charlie scene shake your ass to the bass
wait till you see my face hey bitch
wear them tight jeans that show your asscrack
my first name gives vietnam flashbacks
i get drunk and do the same old same old
take three girls home and call them charlies angels
what you gonna do after we get signed
im gonna lose my mind
get 30inch spinners and pimp my ride
go back in time be there that night and save 2pacs life
then pay my fine for getting caught
fucking on the hollywood sign i got the game on lock
ill have a bottle and a glock with biceps like the rock
buy toms soul back from rupert murdoch

chorus deuce
and i can show you how to hump without making love
