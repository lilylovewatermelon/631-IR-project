i ask god god
why this life you gave so hard
why all the choices that i make leave me with scars
i feel like everyone i meet confuse my heart
i ask god god
why this life you gave so hard
why all the choices that i make tear us apart
i feel like everyone i meet confuse my heart

verse 1
yeah yeah already livin my truths
cant sabotage my love for nothing
member i had to choose lord help me cause i couldnt say nothin
this remind me of them days before i was buzzin
whеn my auntie told me
come insidе the house you make a mess ill kick you out
dont saturate my love for some respect i cannot vouch
judgin from my shoes and all they seein is the couch
my moral what i stand on so i got up and i bounced

chorus
i ask god god
why this life you gave so hard
why all the choices that i make leave me with scars
i feel like everyone i meet confuse my heart
i ask god god
why this life you gave so hard
why all the choices that i make tear us apart
i feel like everyone i meet confuse my heart

ive hit the point where enough is never enough yeah
i gotta see my ceiling with those i trust oohooh
id rather feed my feelings with those i lust oohooh

we was livin on the east side
and i had to pack up my things when my mama was sleep
two kisses to the peace sign
thats when life was on the decline
two bus passes ill be fine

random thoughts in my head
you can blame us
cant get the bad out my head
can you blame us

can you blame us uhhuh uh uh uh
i need a new fixation uhhuh uh uh uh
open the conversations uhhuh uh uh uh
starting to lose my patience uhhuh uh uh uh
inviting new temptations
