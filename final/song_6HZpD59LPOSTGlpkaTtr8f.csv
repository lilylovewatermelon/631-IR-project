remember the day
there was a sign
it was the time
to take me away to your arms

prechorus
i heard your voice you called my name
a single touch would stop my pain
i feel like you in everything i do

chorus
wouldnt it be good to be in your shoes
even if it was for just one day
wouldnt it be good if we could wish ourselves away
wouldnt it be good to be on your side
the grass is always greener over there
wouldnt it be good if we could live without a care

verse 2
the times passing by
i feel like you i always do
youre my place to hide i dont know why
still hear your voice still feel the same
a single kiss can stop the rain
so close to you in everything i do

wouldnt it be good to be in your shoes
even if it was for just one day
wouldnt it be good if we could wish ourselves away
wouldnt it be good to be on your side
the grass is always greener over there
wouldnt it be good if we could live without a care

outro
wouldnt it be good to be in your shoes
even if it was for just one day
wouldnt it be good if we could wish ourselves awayembed"
