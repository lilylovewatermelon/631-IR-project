i dont love you anymore
a pretty line that i adore
five words that ive heard before
cause you keep me on a rope
and tied a noose around my throat
youre gone then back at my door

prechorus
cause if youre gonna leave better leave better do it fast
cant live a little longer sitting on your lap
cause you know what youre doin when youre comin back
and i dont wanna have another heart attack

chorus
oh i cant be your lover on a leash
every other week when you please
oh i cant be the kiss that you dont need
the lie between your teeth

postchorus
the cut that always bleeds
ahahah
the cut that always bleeds
ahahah

and kiss the bruises til theyre gone
bittersweet cause i cant breathe inside your arms

prechorus
cause if youre gonna leave better leave better do it fast
cant live another minute bleedin from my back
cause i dont have another one for you to stab
and i dont wanna have another heart attack

oh i cant be your lover on a leash
every other week when you please
oh i cant be the kiss that you dont need
the lie between your teeth
