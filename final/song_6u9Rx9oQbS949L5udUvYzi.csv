she paints in grey
and she closes her eyes
til fireworks and palm trees almost look alike
she looks up to me and whispers
i wont be here in a year
so i take the long road
to think and wonder why
i cant sleep with all this sunlight
if theres still evidence of us
why cant that be enough

refrain
i dont mean to drag you down
you taste just like you always do

chorus
isabelle hides so i cant find my way
id give anything just to surround your dreams
ohohoh

verse 2
the envy of the dead
the sound of scissors and sleep
i cant believe you dreamed
and pulled all of your clothes off
youre not supposed to drink
with whats inside your purse
and not expect me not to call call you out
im guiding your chin to my lips
using only my fingertips
see pierce the veil liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likerefrain
all we have are parking lots and nowhere to go
if you love me then show me more

chorus
isabelle watches me from far away
id give anything just to surround your dreams
i know you like when
the temperature rises to a boiling heat
the chlorine and wine found
he sees through her nightgown
and everything fades away

bridge
the stars awake
but we cant see them out so why pretend
is there a train
that travels back to yours at 5 am
or are we walking
car alarms and leaves that blow
theyre calling out our names
but its gone too far
your butane mouth
will spit me into flames
why
breakdown
sorry bout it i cant help it
im an anarchist in love
and i forgot to call you
i cant break you down while i
think about honey and the sweet new york sounds

chorus
isabelle hides so i cant find my way
id give anything to carry on and on and on the same way
why
the temperature rises to this boiling heat
the chlorine and wine found
he sees through her nightgown
as saturday burns away
why

outro
back in the days when i was young
im not a kid anymore
but some days i sit and wish i was a kid again
back in the days when i was young
im not a kid anymore
but some days i sit and wish i was a kid again7embed"
