verse 1
sittin all alone
mouth full of gum
in the driveway
my friends arent far
in the back of my car
lay their bodies

prechorus
wheres my mind
wheres my mind

verse 2
theyll be here pretty soon
lookin through my room
for the money
im bitin my nails
im too young to go to jail
its kinda funny

prechorus
wheres my mind
wheres my mind
wheres my mind
wheres my mind
