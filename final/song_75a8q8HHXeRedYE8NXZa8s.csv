woke up in the morning you were not there
where were you baby
all i seen was an imprint of your head

why did i treat you
i shouldve known one day that youd be gone
i should have known
you shouldve known one day that id be gone

you shouldve known one day that wed be

verse 1
why did you have to end this way
baby all you had to say
was that you were sick and tired of the man i began to be
but you planned a great escape
bright and early before i wake
we both knew we had to break
you couldve chose a better way

chorus

all i seen was an imprint of your head
all i seen was an imprint of your
in my pillow weeping willow willow
whyd i treat you so bad treat you so bad
i shouldve known one day that youd be gone
i should have known one day you would be
you shouldve known one day that id be gone
you should have known one day i would be
you shouldve known one day that wed be
