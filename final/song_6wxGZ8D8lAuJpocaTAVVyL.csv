lets take a plane up out to philly
we flying outta dallas
somewhere and i need an alias
used to land on an empty chalice
every land we gon play
an i getting the weed from cali
and rolling it up in philly
smoking weed up all day
we never seem to complain really
and i really need to hear it
it a kryptonite and dont you know
and we would not get near
no ordinary sensimilla
and the only thing they wanted
when the kryptonite is gone
we started smoking supersonic
if you got money to pay
better put your money on it
a passion that go on and on and on and on
and a sight you never believe
what im smoking is semillia
no explanation needed
when im high i dont conceal it
everything is okay

verse 2
smoked up all my weed from philly
and everything from cali
im all up in them palm trees
smoking a pound of mauiwowie
pakalolo grade a
we go to the caribbean
deliver it up by the sea
ya know connections get paid
different strap for every season
if you really need a reason
wed like the kryptonite and an open red bull lightin bs
more than ounce or two of chronic
in the end its what we needed
no artificial type pretender cut
oh no man wed say come and let the music play
full volume and repeat it
perfection that go on and on and on and on
from here or minnesota
from there onto daytona
we came up in new york
now up in cali so pro bono
everything is okay
