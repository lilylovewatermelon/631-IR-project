i wish i could fly
id pick you up and wed go back in time
id write this in the sky
i miss you like it was the very first night

verse 1
and so it goes
every weekend this same party
i never go alone
and i dont seem brokenhearted
my friends all say they know
everything im going through
i drive down different roads
but they all lead back to you

prechorus
cause they dont know about the night in the hotel
they werent ridin in the car when we both fell
didnt read the note on the polaroid picture
they dont know how much i miss you

chorus
i wish i could fly
id pick you up and wed go back in time
id write this in the sky
i miss you like it was the very first night
see taylor swift liveget tickets as low as 172you might also likeverse 2
and so it was
we never saw it comin
not trying to fall in love
but we did like children runnin
back then we didnt know
we were built to fall apart
we broke the status quo
then we broke each others hearts

prechorus
but dont forget about the night out in la
dance in the kitchen chase me down through the hallway
no one knows about the words that we whispered
no one knows how much i miss you

chorus
i wish i could fly
id pick you up and wed go back in time
id write this in the sky
i miss you like it was the very first night

postchorus
take me away take me away
take me away to you to you
take me away take me away
take me away to you to you
bridge
i remember the night at the hotel
i was ridin in the car when we both fell
im the one on the phone as you whisper
do you know how much i miss you

breakdown
i wish that we could go back in time
and id say to you
i miss you like it was the very first night

chorus
i wish i could fly
id pick you up and wed go back in time
id write this in the sky
i miss you like it was the very first night

postchorus
take me away take me take me away take me
take me away take me to you to you
take me away take me take me away take me
take me away take me to you to you31embed"
