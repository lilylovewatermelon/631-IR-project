you always reached out to me
and helped me believe
all those memories we share
i will cherish every one of them
for the truth of it is theres a right way to live
and you showed me
so now you live on in the words of a song
youre a melody

chorus 1
because you stand here with me now yeahx2

verse 2
just when the fear blinded me
you taught me to dream
ill give you everything i am and still fall short of
what youve done for me
in this life that i live
i hope i can give love unselfishly
ive learned the world is bigger than me
youre my daily dose of reality
