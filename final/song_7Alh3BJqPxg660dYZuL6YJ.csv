your fans say you the best ever
cause you dangerous with different stuff
your charisma is unmatched
you make the crowd wanna listen up
you got killer angles deadly freestyles
and your writtens tough
thats partly why fans gave you the wins over clips  lux
but i dont give a fuck tell me why is he so elite
wait a minute i thought this was hollow
yall got me battling tony d
a nigga with a whole first name but his last name is only d
well i dont give a fuck yall getting the same jones from me
eurgh why you amp him up im back with the cannon tucked
its loaded spitting hollow rounds like the black panther lux
remember this
as far as bars hes a poor man version of chilla jones stuff”
well im glad shotty caught on
it was clear from your very first battle in this artform
truth thats word to the pad you copied bars on
you been biting heads right off the bat like ozzy osbourne
tell your posse get they mob on shit its whatever
you ain’t a g you soft as a dutch sweater with plush texture
just estrogen why your thug’s extra with tough gestures
if its hyper tension
ill squeeze arms and have a blood press ya
surgeons pulling fragments out your chest
where the slug entered
now everything coming from the heart like a love letter
whoever praise ya better save ya
‘cause you aint got a trey to blam
think graffiti tony gon get it shaking
before he spray the can
or turn bitch that’s how you switch agenda
without changing plans
son gon see pops in the ring like shane mcmahon
i’ll shank your man watch where you aim the cam
if his blood dry on the lens
theyll see burgundy on the screen like anchorman
i know where they rank you fam
this is where your name shines
they love you here i dont expect cheers when its game time
but when they go back to their flats
and get to rewind these same lines
oh the irony how youll win at home
but lose at home at the same time
my frame of mind why pick me tony
that choice senseless with five 9s im royce reckless
ill pistol whip everyone in your click til your boys neckless
let it ring then i’m coming after tone like a voice message
this a deathwish my killer instinct is so savage bruh
lyrically im a street fighter i scold battlers
a mortal kombating this pen hes no challenger
im way brighter i need a writer of soul calibur
so next year let’s set it up lets get him set up for the upset
ill make a deal wit you an extra buck fifty
i’ll get him cut next
i got a blade you cant stomach money thats a gutcheck
sketch artist that lead drawing ‘ll make him look suspect
i must flex i got a name in the states tony
i could ignore you
shotty and soul got a name in the states too look at all the work they put in for you
after your choke vers’ real deal
dont flop is the only league booking for you
i dont get it ain’t being wanted ‘posed to have everybody looking for you
im putting a whoopin on you
cause you battled dudes who sound like me
but you aint never stood in front of three rounds like these
bosstown
you might also likeround 1 tony d
this weekend they assembled the greats
so props to the staff
cause fans been looking at this schedule amazed
the calibre of battle rapper that have stepped in this place
i’m talking legends
and we get to face some american brays
you man are no longer setting the pace
youve been sleeping
and whats that taught us if anything mate
not to split hairs but you’re no longer ahead in the race
and chilla i confess its a shame
your material denim on a fat bitch it stretches at strains
and i guess in the states that shit connect and it’s flames
but that’s ‘cause they backwards thinking
like a trip down memory lane
this crowd a bit more intelligent mate
cause this is england and now the script read i skin heads
like shane meadows setting the stage
king pen this the end of your reign
cause off top i’m too on point with the tell
aint that a devilish trait
for the hell of it straight rob you for whatever he paid
like “hands up now back down
look like you trying to start a mexican wave
how you stepped in my face
when i’m at the peak of my powers
the plan is to rain down and rock your world
that’s a meteor shower
mr jump to top tier from the proving ground
thats old news
‘cause i’m mr if i spit three rounds i don’t lose
you tweeted you was coming here to smoke tone’s boots
but no you ain’t
and that loose tongue will get its owner laced
youll need your soul replaced
cause hell get worn out like old shoes
youre having second thoughts now i know you
wishing he never answered the call
like colin farrell in phone booth
on this card he act like trouble that’s a code blue
ill split your dome into sections for entertainment like the o2
this cold proof you aint tone’s rapping equal
no antics no gimmicks i’m plain old fashioned lethal
online they over hype you claim you toe tagging people
but don’t force belief in false readings cause they gas you more than they should like a volkswagen diesel
this is evil what i’m performing is torture
punches have you stumbling as he walks to his corner
it’s hard labor he’s left leaning like a corbyn supporter
i’m sick i’ve got a rhyming when i’m talking disorder
and i still cant swim
no check the deffinition i’m still walking on water
wavy i don’t sound like c
i only took this battle to steal your soundbite clean
cause you aint never stood in front of three rounds like these
round two chilla jones
this round you getting fire out the gate like hell’s entrance
with conviction behind these bars minus the jail sentence
your chick say youre a boy
and im a man and thats the real difference
you cant measure up thats why i rule her like twelve inches
but let’s use the metric system
guess i gotta switch the plan
soon as i get sent to meet her
she on her knees unzipping pants
you the head of the house
well ill kill a leader when im clicking cans
and if your mums mum’s there wit’cha ima hit’cha grams
listen fam
you tweeted he was capable of writing with jones
i seen ya sit us in the same tier that aint a lie to condone
now im tight in a zone i brought an l to leave this old man
‘cause he aint know what retire meant holmes
but let him tell it he aint retire
it was his career on a breather
i came here with some ether you prepared for a schemer
freddy krueger vers’ meek mill a nightmare to a dreamer
grip the knife come get a slice like we sharing a pizza
ventilation how i’m airing the heater
or think a cabbie on a slow day bro it’s no fair with the meter
either you shouldve brought your best to me
or backed out scrap
ccause eurgh done put you vers’ a steamroller
now lets see if you can flatout rap
you outmatched
y’all think he super smooth cause he grins a lot
my troopers move gripping glocks to shoot at you
them twins ‘a pop they sends a shot
if you came with a crew of dudes your friendsll drop
you survive they switch the plot
say rubix cube and spins the block
you niggas thought
cause of a few good battles your pens are hot
debatables those are ties we cant tell if they wins or not
defend your spot
cause americans kill you when you begin to fight us
you be on track and then we stop your run
maybe thats why they tend to knight us
you the king of writers
if thats your goal then touch the stage
vers’ the one they think is midas
y’all feeling he got the crown til the k in his mouth
like gingivitis
but you supposed to be a pain in my side
let’s let a pen decide this
we both sick but this a different virus
i spit the nicest ripping cyphers
i chews ‘em up and spits em out
you chews nothing like you indecisive
but yall claim this nigga righteous so tony act pompous
til he slip and inspect a clip like the bond flick
rock him once all fists knock him unconscious
everybody turn and yell “oh” like jaundice
yall pick how yall want his ass to say goodnight
either shots sail or see if he can navigate a right
he tried to phone for help
in that case he had to pay the price
whoever he call ‘a see him covered in blood
like a gladiator fight
good night ‘cause you battled dudes who sound like me
but you aint never stood in front of 3 rounds like these
bosstown
round 2 tony d
ive come to expose your style
make these people wake up
cause you work hard to force lines
like the barber that gave dna his shape up
this what chilla bring to a written
“you need a genie to defeat me and fix you winning
i’ll throw money in a hole well you into wishing
i don’t feel you and i trust my intuition
youre gettin schooled for a fee you in tuition”
then it goes way fuckin left
“scratch that i’ll make your dogs flee like they’re into itching
point at hat big stick make you fly like you into witching
were going hertfordshire after the win to hitchin”
it’s that or shitty word association got him feeling himself
so chilla got some nonsense schemes in store
like keenan and kel
and some reaches as well but that shit easy as hell
if you aint even going to bother to speak how its spelt
youre pulling wool over eyes
thats what your whole career is
i sparked a benson started reflecting
and it hit me youre all smoke and mirrors
they don’t see the deceit in the lies you bring
but the same people claiming your rhymes will win
same people claim fetty wap’s the hypest thing
cause in the land of the blind the oneeyed is the king
that shit’s a crutch it is such simple stuff youre thinking up
makes dumb people feel really smart
but it makes smart people feel really dumb
if you disregard spelling in real life
the way you disregard it in a battle
youd be shit on countdown
ouija boards ’d be hard for you to handle
and youd start a bit of hassle
and cause arguments at scrabble
for instance peeps listen please
and you tell me is this a reach
you know pocahontas ratatouille
well he pronounced that using different speech
he said poker honest and rat a toolie”
just to fit a disney scheme
“rat a toolie” i swear i sat there in disbelief
like did he really j“
and then the crowd cheered and i kicked the screen
that shit is weak we calling it a waste man method
chilla reach with that jordan in spacejam tekkers
you reckless the way you take it further
in the spirit of johnny cochran
no j they let you get away with murder
what i’m fearing is the battlers and fans with less experience
are really starting to take that reach shit serious
cause dot follow your sentences full stop period
but they’re scheming awful bars and reaching awful hard
but i figured black thought will expose the roots
cause that’s when things fall apart
‘cause you don’t stand up to scrutiny you probe and find
that what you kick is air
like bigg k reacting to an opponent’s rhyme
i wont deny it’s funny to me that you’ve got an overbite
when your performance sucks
cause its got no teeth like obie trice
they know i’m nice
so me catching this body come as no surprise
they fucked with me since double p was part of tony’s life
i came out the hood spitting poison that’s a cobra strike
now i hold my own no fucks given that’s a lonely night
and you cant see me and i’m fucking up this room
that’s a poltergeist it’s over time

round three chilla jones
i heard you paid a london chap to scrape up dirt for you
a vip ticket in exchange for some madeup personals
but them lies wont hold weight
theyll make it straight up worse for you
and i designed every line in this round perfect for hurting you
i heard a few things and i was taken aback from that
so this round i’m breaking you down
no punching back to back
now we criticized trex for being a nurse
that be packin straps
well newsflash
turns out trex isnt the only nurse in battle rap
as tony d you be putting on for london
making the city happy
as a nurse you was putting on… scrubs
and changing shitty nappies
as tony d  you was the champ
and nobody could get rid of ya
as a nurse you was amped… to take old ladies to the cinema
give it a rest bruv you the softest tony ever
you think a g bluffing
tony scarface was a thug and drug dealer
that kept keys running
tony soprano was a mob boss
that had everyone in the streets duckin
but tony d a 36yearold black nurse outta east london
you fucking snake
now let me expose how you double crossed
flex hit you for you versus raptor
he even put gemini on the undercard
he told flex eurgh wanted the same battle on a summer card
but he would do it on flex’s platform
cause he aint fuck with yall
am i lying look at the reaction on this nerd’s face
you even accepting that battle
proved youre a rapper with the worst traits
you view this as a white league
you wanted to feel blacker in the worst way
you shoulda known it would be a disaster in the first place
cause that’s a spit in eurgh’s face
and in the states youd be an average colored battler
thats all thats it
you got a little humor some flavor
but i dont think you all that sick
plus the rumor is you still owe flex a little money
and thats who you’re trying to avoid contact with
theres no honor in that behavior
he paid you for labor you decided to fall back quick
now this is an angle and a scheme
you probably won’t get it on the first listen
but i said color humor labor… anyway in the us we spell certain words different
the point is this
against brits that’s the battles that gave you clout
but think about those words tony
all it takes is an american to take you out
what made you doubt i would win this a l he’s getting
i see death in your future i can’t help these visions
long rod ‘ll make sure it’s his self he’s sticking
you get the picture my shit is sicker
and thats why you losing now
against mr jump to top tier from the proving grounds
bosstown

round 3 tony d
so you’re from bosstown
i was gonna do a boston rapper scheme bro
then i realized there’s guru solar’s exboyfriend…
and the guy that was in gangstarr with premo
and benzino
you can tell how i step that i’m on classics
it’s an explosive level in the building like bomb damage
the diss pen’s fire ‘cause this pen fire it dispense fire
cue flames like a bond gadget
i’m cooking and these bars will chargrill your arse chill
it’s a flipping body hands down
it’s all in the air like a cartwheel
i just finished washing the blood off from my last kill
now i brought the big guns out about to rock it for money
like an arms deal
theres skulduggery afoot if i’m on my job
they put the king vers’ i
well to get ahead that’s your neck on the chopping block
theres no bones to pick with tony’s shit
this simple precision
you try muscling on god’s turf
well thats a sin you committing
and i’m too blessed
that’s why he don’t know what to do next
cause his brain cant stomach the idea i aint food yet
we rematch i’ll be the last man standing over two legs
so he losing hard and thats just bar for bar
that’s barring performance
chill a body on ice
you’d swear i come to harvest some organs
now if you got that
and you caught the unifying theme in it properly
it was like blood you know what fuck it watch it back
that’s how you scheme on a body
now if i seem to be cocky it’s cause i’m properly focused
youre getting polished off dusted down
swept up i’m cleaning house
just show i can keep up with the joneses
im mercenary molded i use foresight in the planning stage
this the day of the jackal and i’ve got the gall to assassinate
i woke up just to kill like a manchurian candidate
so you came to the uk for whose name are you sane
you must be close to nuts cause i got you in the pocket that’s loose change
your number’s up bingo and were in front of a full house
to see me put another kid in a box
like when its too good to pull out
see i can read his thoughts so i’ve got to let the people know
he cant beat me fair and square
he swear he should’ve cheated like keyshia cole
they love you in canada
over here different treatment though
cause whats usually organic process getting sprayed
that’s a gmo
so i figured cause you don’t really rap that well
i’ll stick to the plan
and rap circles ‘round you til you tire like the michelin man
now this my hometown
so don’t get annoyed if you cant win
and start hyping up ‘cause i’m poised to just spark him
like i’m boycotting stardom
‘cause if i flip then it’s clips and loaded or loaded and clips
‘cause i’ve got to see money hit the floor
like a coin toss in harlemembed"
