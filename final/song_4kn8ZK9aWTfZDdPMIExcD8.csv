everybody hurts
everybody bleeds
everybody bends to fill a need
everybodys born with their own curse
and im not alone

everybody cries
everybody breathes
everybody wants to feel theyre free
deep inside i know what i am worth
a life of my own

prechorus
it could have been much worse
but it should have been better

chorus
i know id hurt you deserted you
and now i see it clear
i pulled you closer tighter
cause i knew youd disappear

i just cant compromise apologize
theres nothing you can say
we both knew
it would always end this way
see five finger death punch liveget tickets as low as 79you might also likeverse 2
everybody pains
everybody grieves
everybodys making off like thieves
every souls aching for release
youre not alone

everybody lives
everybody leaves
everybody begs best on their knees
everybodys got the same disease
no ones alone

prechorus
it could have been much worse
but it should have been better

chorus
i know id hurt you deserted you
and now i see it clear
i pulled you closer tighter
cause i knew youd disappear

i just cant compromise apologize
theres nothing you can say
we both know
it would always end this way
