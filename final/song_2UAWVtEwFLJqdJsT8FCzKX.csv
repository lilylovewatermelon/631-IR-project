when we were young souls
on the junkyard
now we are stunned minds
full of junkgoods
but i feel your heartbeat
just like mine
i feel your heartbeat
all the time

chorus
and we were bound to the city life
flashlights when were falling into the night
focused on what you feel
just when you were calling her love that day
and we were bound to the city life
flashlights when were falling into the night
focused on what you feel
just when you were calling her love that day
ayeayeayeaye

instrumental interlude
