every now and then i get a little bit lonely
and youre never coming round
turn around
every now and then i get a little bit tired of listening to the sound
of my tears
turn around
every now and then i get a little bit nervous that the best of all the
years have gone by
turn around
every now and then i get a little bit terrified and then
i see the look in your eyes
turn around bright eyes
every now and then i fall apart
turn around bright eyes
every now and then i fall apart
every now and then i get a little bit breathless
and i crave of something right
every now and then i get a little bit helpless and im
lying like a child in your arms
turn around
every now and then i get a little bit angry and i know
ive got to get out of ground
turn around
every now and then i get a little bit terrified but then
i see the look in your eyes
turn around bright eyes
every now and then i fall apart
turn around bright eyes
every now and then i fall apart
and i need you now tonight
and i need you more than ever
and if you only hold me tight
well be holding on forever
and well only be making it right
cause well never be wrong
together we can take it to the end of the line
your love is like a shadow on me all of the time
i dont know what to do
im always in the dark
were living in a power keg
and giving off sparks
i really need you tonight
forevers going to start tonight
forevers going to start tonight
once upon a time i was falling in love
but now im only falling apart
theres nothing i can do
a total eclipse of the heart
