found these old letters from years ago
felt it was fitting to continue that correspondence
cant help im sentimental
thanks for talking with me today
i hope this is helpful for you
i also hope that birdie is happy and healthy
and staying out of trouble to a reasonable extent
what i wrote was sort of my way of finally being able to address how it feels to have…
verse aaron weiss
another brickred room another blacktop town
another misspelled band burning their own houses down
another pinebox tune to fill the cemetery day
another star a touch of orange over purgatory gray
another thorny field to scatter fruitless seed
another song that runs too long god knows no one needs
more misguided ghosts more transparent hands
to drop a nickel in our basket and well do our riot dance
beneath another burning sky behind our painted lips
in scores of catatonic smilecovered anklebitten ships
throw your pedestal of stone in the forgetful sea
as protection from the paperthin perfection you project on me
and when this repetition ends behind the window shades
a semiconscious sorrow sleeping in the bed ive made
that most unrestful bed that most original of sins
and youll say thats what i get when i let ambition win
again id hate to let you down so ill let the waters rise
and drown my dull reflection in the naïve expectation in your eyes
back in a cast bitpart back when i felt most free
i had a butchers heart and no one thought they knew me
so before the regiment resumes before the dreaded sun appears
my drivers waiting so lets make one point crystal clear
you see a floodlit form i see a shirt design
im no savior of yours and youre no friend of mine

youre no friend of mine youre no friend of mine
im no savior of yours and youre no friend of mine
you see a floodlit form i see a shirt design
im no savior of yours and youre no friend of mine

spoken outro aaron weiss
…to see myself in the reflection of peoples eyes
realizing that what they see may not even be close to the image i see in myself
and i think i might actually be more afraid to let my own self down than anything else
i feel like the man in the story who saw a bear floating in the river and thought it was a fur coat
twelve years ago i stood on the shore and jumped in and grabbed the coat
the river was rushing toward a waterfall
and my friend stood on the shore and shouted to let go of the coat and swim back to land
i let go of the coat but the coat wont let go of me
in any case please let me know if theres more i can give you
if nothing comes of it then just know we are grateful9embed"
