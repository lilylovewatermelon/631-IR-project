and its a sad picture the final blow hits you
somebody else gets what you wanted again and
you know its all the same another time and place
repeating history and youre getting sick of it
but i believe in whatever you do
and ill do anything to see it through

chorus
because these things will change
can you feel it now
these walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
this revolution the time will come
for us to finally win
and well sing hallelujah well sing hallelujah
oh oh

verse 2
so weve been outnumbered raided and now cornered
its hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair
were getting stronger now find things they never found
they might be bigger but were faster and never scared
you can walk away say we dont need this
but theres something in your eyes says we can beat this

chorus
cause these things will change
can you feel it now
these walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
this revolution the time will come
for us to finally win
and well sing hallelujah well sing hallelujah
oh oh

tonight we stand get off our knees
fight for what weve worked for all these years
and the battle was long its the fight of our lives
but well stand up champions tonight

chorus
it was the night things changed
can you see it now
these walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
its a revolution throw your hands up
cause we never gave in
and well sing hallelujah we sang hallelujah
