people always tell me their life story
love theyve lost their taste of glory
he sat next to me at the counter in the diner
said i used to be wall street but this is much finer
oh yeah

verse 2
he had a leather look on a steel horse harley
and a darkeyed girlfriend he called charlie
he looked a little lost walking out the door
but i think i knew what he was looking for
freedom sweet freedom

verse 3
i gassed her up climbed back in my cab
to my wife im a husband to my kids im a dad
to the credit card companies im just another sucker
to the irs a longhaul trucker
mm yeah

verse 4
some say that freedoms the power to do what one pleases
you can live like the devil or hold on to jesus
i found the one thing i was born to do
and girl thats why im running back to you
freedom sweet freedom

he climbed up in my truck with his green duffel bag
i knew he was a soldier cause i saw his dog tags
we talked about it we cried about it
then a steel horse harley came roaring on past
i knew it was charlie hanging on real fast
we talked about it we laughed about it

through the joy and pain that living brings
dont we all want the same thing
freedom sweet freedom

verse 6
its what the junkie needs that the needle cant give
the oppressed and forgotten are praying for it
its what the brave and courageous are fighting for
an open sail on a distant shore
freedomembed"
