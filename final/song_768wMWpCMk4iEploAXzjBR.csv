im tied to the wings of a plane
the skies pass the echoes the haze
but yesterdays tired today
ill try to remember my name

chorus
spinnin all my lifes like turning til the wheels brake
dancin on the wind of this merrygoround oh oh oh
spinnin all my lifes like turning while the wheels shake
dancin on the thrill of this merrygoround oh oh oh

verse 2
im stuck on the edge of no place
the walls scream in silence at me
the faces blend into each day
ill try to remember my name

chorus
spinnin all my lifes like turning til the wheels brake
dancin on the wind of this merrygoround oh oh oh
spinnin all my lifes like turning while the wheels shake
dancin on the thrill of this merrygoround oh oh oh

spinnin all my lifes like turning til the wheels brake
dancin on the wind of this merrygoround oh oh oh

chorus
spinnin all my lifes like turning til the wheels brake
dancin on the wind of this merrygoround oh oh oh
spinnin all my lifes like turning while the wheels shake
dancin on the thrill of this merrygoround oh oh oh

spinnin all my lifes like turning til the wheels brake
dancin on the wind of this merrygoround oh oh oh
spinnin all my lifes like turning while the wheels shake
dancin on the thrill of this merrygoround oh oh ohembed"
