can you tell from the look in our eyes were going nowhere
we live our lives like were ready to die were going nowhere
can you tell from the look in our eyes were going nowhere
we live our lives like were ready to die were going nowhere

verse 1
i thought id buried you and covered the tracks
youll have to take this with your cold dead hands
i thought id buried you whats dead can never die
i thought id cut you loose severed the feeling
i slipped through the cracks and you caved in my ceiling
i thought id buried you whats dead can never die fuck

chorus
can you tell from the look in our eyes were going nowhere
we live our lives like were ready to die were going nowhere
you can run but youll never escape over and over again
will we ever see the end were going nowhere

verse 2
this is sempiternal
will we ever see the end
this is sempiternal
over and over again and again
rise from the dead you say
secrets dont sleep till theyre took to the grave
signal the sirens rally the troops
ladies and gentlemen its the moment of truth

can you tell from the look in our eyes were going nowhere
we live our lives like were ready to die were going nowhere
you can run but youll never escape over and over again
will we ever see the end were going nowhere
can you tell from the look in our eyes were going nowhere
we live our lives like were ready to die were going nowhere
you can run but youll never escape over and over again
will we ever see the end were going nowhere

outro
this is sempiternal
will we ever see the end
this is sempiternal
over and over again and again50embed"
