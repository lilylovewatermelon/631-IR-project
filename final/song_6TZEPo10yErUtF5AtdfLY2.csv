well i never once
backed down from a punch
well id take it square on the chin
well i found out fast
a bullys just that
youve got to stand up to him
so i didnt cry when i got a black eye
as bad as it hurt i just grinned

hook
but when tough little boys grow up to be dads
they turn into big babies again

chorus 1
scared me to death
when you took your first steps
and id fall every time you fell down
your first day of school i cried like a fool
and i followed your school bus to town

postchorus
well i didnt cry when old yeller died
at least not in front of my friends

hook
but when tough little boys grow up to be dads
they turn into big babies again
see gary allan liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likeverse 2
well im a grown man
and as strong as i am
sometimes its hard to believe
that one little girl with little blonde curls
can totally terrify me
if you were to ask
my wife would just laugh
shed say i know all about men

hook
how when tough little boys grow up to be dads
they turn into big babies again

chorus 2
well i know one day ill give you away
and im gonna to stand there and smile
but when i get home and im all alone
ill sit in your room for awhile

postchorus
well i didnt cry when old yeller died
at least not in front of my friends

hook
but when tough little boys grow up to be dads
they turn into big babies again
when tough little boys grow up to be dads
they turn into big babies againembed"
