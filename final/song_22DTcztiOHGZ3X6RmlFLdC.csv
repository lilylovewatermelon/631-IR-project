verse 4
its the year 2009 and i done found myself a crib
i aint got no dough but i done found myself a bitch
dollars and success is what my niggas tryna get
young as fuck but fake id gon get me in the vip
i done said fuck school fuck the teachers and the public
id rather count this money with the thuggers and the junkies
the teachers used to tell me boy you aint gon mount to nothin
the only love i felt was from the dealers and the hustlers
we gon do the most so tell them niggas gabos
seen my nigga harvey he went and copped him a ghost
through the windshield the centerfold on the door
ten below on you hoes getting dough on you folks
getting dough on these fours gettin money it show
these checks are looking silly im gettin funny on hoes
funny how im stuntin in somethin flooded in stones
put them hunnids on hold put them runners on go
secure the bag21embed"
