dont wanna be an american idiot
dont want a nation under the new media
and can you hear the sound of hysteria
the subliminal mindfuck america

welcome to a new kind of tension
all across the alienation
where everything isnt meant to be okay

im not a part of a redneck agenda
now everybody do the propaganda
and sing along to the age of paranoia

welcome to a new kind of tension
all across the alienation
where everything isnt meant to be okay
in television dreams of tomorrow
were not the ones whore meant to follow
