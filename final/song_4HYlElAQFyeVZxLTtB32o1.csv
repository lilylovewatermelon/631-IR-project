we got cornbread and catfish and cane poles
them delta blues still kicked out on transistor radios
raised on love of jesus and rock n roll

aint no doubt about it now
i love it deep down in the south
i feel like heavens shining down
when youre deep down in the south

grannys in the kitchen cookin mustard greens
and magnolias bloomin muscadine and pine trees
them boys down in a pasture drinking homemade shine
rolling up a fatty with trouble on their mind

aint no doubt about it now
i love it deep down in the south
its calling me now
deep down in the south

back there in big thicket
you can hear an old hound dog moan
its that same ol lonesome sound
that keeps calling me home

aint no doubt about it now
i love it deep down in the south
i feel like heavens shining down
when youre deep down in the south
when youre deep down in the southsee whiskey myers liveget tickets as low as 56you might also likeembed"
