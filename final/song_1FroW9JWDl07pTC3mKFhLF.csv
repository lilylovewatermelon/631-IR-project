so society just cant let us be
please dont be ashamed
we are not to blame
the futures ours to take
we will make mistakes
scream this loud and proud
we will not back down

prechorus
so lets go and relieve some pressure
anarchy will only make it better
we cant we wont surrender
we cant we wont surrender
were not scared because we like the danger
reality will only make us stronger
we cant we wont surrender
we cant we wont surrender

chorus
dont tell me where i will lay in your cemetery
dont try to silence and bury me
dont push me cause i wont go quietly
id rather die with dignity

verse 2
let them put us down
hope were not around
they pray we go away
but were here to stay
time is on our side
our two worlds collide
these four words might help
just go fuck yourself

so lets go and relieve some pressure
anarchy will only make it better
we cant we wont surrender
we cant we wont surrender
were not scared because we like the danger
reality will only make us stronger
we cant we wont surrender
we cant we wont surrender

chorus
dont tell me where i will lay in your cemetery
dont try to silence and bury me
dont push me cause i wont go quietly
id rather die with dignity
