laying down on the lawn
im tired of trying to get in the house
im thinking out loud
ive been playing dead
my whole life
and i get this feeling whenever i feel good
itll be the last time
refrain
but i feel something when i see you now
i feel something when i see you

verse 2
if youre a work of art
im standing too close
i can see the brush strokes
i hate your mom
i hate it when she opens her mouth
its amazing to me how much you can say
when you dont know what youre talking about

refrain
but i feel something when i see you now
i feel something when i see you
you might also likebridge
i used to light you up
now i cant even get you to play the drums
cause i dont know what i want
until i fuck it up

refrain
but i feel something when i see you now
i feel something

outro
ill climb through the window again
but right now it feels good not to stand
then ill leave it wide open
let the dystopian morning light pour in15embed"
