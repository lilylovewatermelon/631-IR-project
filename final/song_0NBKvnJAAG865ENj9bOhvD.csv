i looked for trouble and i found it son
straight down the barrel of a lawmans gun
i tried to run but i dont think i can
you make one move and youre a dead man friend
aint living long like this
cant live at all like this can i baby

verse 2
he slipped the handcuffs on behind my back
then left me reeling on a steel rail rack
they got em all in the jailhouse baby
aint living long like this
cant live at all like this can i baby

verse 3
grew up in houston off of wayside drive
son of a carhop at some all night dive
dad drove a stock car to an early death
all i remember was a drunk mans breath
aint living long like this
cant live at all like this can i baby

verse 4
you know the story how the wheel goes round
dont let them take you to the man downtown
cant sleep at all in a jailhouse baby
aint living long like this
cant live at all like this can i baby

verse 5
i live with angel shes a roadhouse queen
makes texas ruby look like sandra dee
i want to love her but i dont know how
im at the bottom of the jailhouse now
aint living long like this
cant live at all like this can i baby

verse 6
you know the story about the jailhouse rock
dont want to do it but just dont get caught
they got em all in the jailhouse baby
aint living long like this
cant live at all like this can i baby4embed"
