synopsis
dicaprio 2 is the second studio album following the never story from jid which is a sequel to jids dicaprio an album that didnt lack decent songwriting but wasnt really comfortable to listen to due to its sound

dicaprio 2 on the other hand didnt lack any of these factors with amazing production decent songwriting although some of the songs on the album didnt have it and atmospheric sound of oldschool hiphop rb and jazz mixed into one album

the project talks about jids come up on westbrook about the importance of not taking drugs on off da zoinkys and other topics

although the project did have some problems i personally think that the only features that werent out of the place were joey bada and ella mai and the conceptuality wasnt there many songs didnt have a specific topic which isnt really a bad thing its just that i know jid didnt unlock his potential enough with this record yes the sound of the songs is good and all of that but the range of topics was little there wasnt a lot of difficult rhymeschemes or something like that id say this project really needed something else and with all of that i still dont think it is a bad project yes it maybe lacked something but some of the songs on here were amazing i think jid was adapting to a new sound with this record due to the never story being slowpaced rap almost on all of the tracks but we all know that jid can do better than that
and with all of that i still dont think it is a bad project yes it maybe lacked something but some of the songs on here were amazing i think jid was adapting to a new sound with this record due to the never story being slowpaced rap almost on all of the tracks but we all know that jid can do better than thatembed"
