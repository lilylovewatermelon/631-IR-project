im not ashamed of the things that i dream
i find myself flirting with the verge of obscene
into the unknown i will be bold
im going to places i can be out of control

prechorus
and i dont want to explain tonight
all the things ive tried to hide
i shut myself out from the world so i
can draw the blinds and ill teach myself to fly
i love myself its not a sin
i cant control whats happening

chorus
cause i just discovered
imaginations taking over
another day without a lover
the more i come to understand
the touch of my hand

verse 2
the small of my back the arch of my feet
lately ive been noticing the beautiful me
im all in my skin and im not gonna wait
im into myself in the most precious way

and i dont want to explain tonight
all the things ive tried to hide to hide
i shut myself out from the world so i
can draw the blinds and ill teach myself to fly

chorus
cause i just discovered
imaginations taking over
another day without a lover
the more i come to understand
the touch of my hand

bridge
theres a world undefined
in my body and mind
i wont be left behind
im already here

chorus
cause i just discovered
imaginations taking over
another day without a lover
the more i come to understand
the touch of my hand
cause i just discovered
imaginations taking over
another day without a lover
the more i come to understand
the touch of my hand
