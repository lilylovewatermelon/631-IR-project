yeah

verse 1
im not a victim till i let you take me down
im not a target in the sights of your mercy
i never asked for anything im not asking now
i will not be afraid i will not be afraid

chorus
ive done this on my own
and i dont care what you do to me
i wont hand over what is mine
ive done this for too long
to let you take it away from me
its too late to stop me cause i refuse to die

verse 2
i havent weakened just because ive shown myself
ive taken everything except whats for granted
ill leave hypocrisy for everybody else
i will not be afraid i will not be afraid

chorus
ive done this on my own
and i dont care what you do to me
i wont hand over what is mine
ive done this for too long
to let you take it away from me
its too late to stop me cause i refuse to die
you might also likebridge
im not a problem till you make one out of spite
ill give you hell and consequences for trying
if you dont want an enemy dont fuck with my life
i will not be afraid i will not be afraid

chorus
ive done this on my own
and i dont care what you do to me
i wont hand over what is mine
ive done this for too long
to let you take it away from me
its too late to stop me cause i refuse to die

outro
ive done this on my own
and i dont care what you do to me
i wont hand over
i wont hand over what is mine
ive done this for too long
to let you take it away from me
its too late to stop me cause i refuse
i refuse to die

outro
i refuse to dieembed"
