when they push when they pull
tell me can you hold on
when they say you should change
can you lift your head high and stay strong
will you give up give in
when your hearts crying out that its wrong
will you love you for you at the end of it all

prechorus
now in life theres gonna be times when youre feeling low
and in your mind insecurity seems to take control
we start to look outside ourselves for acceptance and approval
we keep forgettin that the one thing we should know is

chorus
dont be scared to fly alone
find a path that is your own
love will open every door
its in your hands the world is yours
dont hold back and always know
all the answers will unfold
what are you waiting for
spread your wings and soar

verse 2
the boy who wonders is he good enough for them
keeps tryin to please em all but he just never seems to fit in
then theres the girl who thinks shell never ever be
good enough for him
keeps tryin to change and thats a game shell never win oh

in life ooh theres gonna be times when youre feeling low
and in your mind oh insecurity seems to take control

bridge
in the mirror is where she comes face to face with her fears
her own reflection now foreign to her after all these years
all of her life she has tried to be something besides herself
now time has passed and shes ended up someone else with regret
what is it in us that makes us feel the need to keep pretending
gotta let ourselves be

chorus
dont be scared to fly alone
find a path that is your own
love will open every door
see in your hands the world is yours
dont hold back and always know
all the answers you will unfold
what are you waiting for
spread your wings and soar
verse 4
find your road
love will open every door
see in your hands the world is yours
dont look back in the window youll find your way
always know all the answers will unfold
oh dont wait
spread your wings and soar
dont wait no more
youve got to soar
spread your wings and soar
dont wait no more
no dont you wait no more
spread your wings and soar
you can soar

outro

dont wait dont wait
