sick of all these people talking sick of all this noise
tired of all these cameras flashing sick of being poised
now my neck is open wide begging for a fist around it
already choking on my pride so theres no use crying about it

prechorus
agnus dei
agnus dei
agnus dei
agnus dei

chorus
im headed straight for the castle
they wanna make me their queen
and theres an old man sitting on the throne there saying that i probably shouldnt be so mean
im headed straight for the castle
they’ve got the kingdom locked up
and theres an old man sitting on the throne there saying i should probably keep my pretty mouth shut
straight for the castle

verse 2
oh all these minutes passing sick of feeling used
if you wanna break these walls down you’re gonna get bruised
now my neck is open wide begging for a fist around it
already choking on my pride so theres no use crying about it
