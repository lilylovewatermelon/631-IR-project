well i figure ill buy me a motorcycle
wrap her pretty little frame around a telephone pole
ride her off a mountain like old arlo
figure ill buy me a motorcycle

verse 1
well i figure ill walk to the liquor store
thunderbird two bottles
maybe three maybe four
follow my feet down to music row
pour it on the pavement like you would a tombstone
like you would a tombstone
like you would a tombstone
pour it on the pavement like you would a tombstone

verse 2
well i figure im weary of feeling this way
pop another pill hop another train
tell my brothers and my sisters that its keeping me sane
figure im weary of feeling this way

chorus
well i figure ill buy me a motorcycle
wrap her pretty little frame around a telephone pole
ride her off a mountain like old arlo
figure ill buy me a motorcycle
figure ill buy me a motorcycle
figure ill buy me a motorcyclesee colter wall liveget tickets as low as 68you might also likeembed"
