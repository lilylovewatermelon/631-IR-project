all you ever wanted was someone
to care for your—

verse 1
yeah made it out the trenches this type of life i cant get used to
number one on youtube private dinner in malibu
show you how to work your stick
aint nobody gon handle you
put you in a phantom cause you my lil boo
ready for whatever i tie up my boots
everybody goin the same route so i switched up my route
niggas aint be what they talkin bout so i switched up my crew
actin like you love me knowin its flawed so im gon fake it too
what else am i supposed to do
aware of my surroundings i dont fuck with yall dont come around me
baby switched up how that sound like a nigga in his feelings
you cant name somethin i did flawed im a dyin breed of the realest
i aint never worry about another nigga so in that case im the biggest nigga
i been travelin around the world my pivots still aint left the business
she got everything i want aint no need to fuck with these bitches
you can go and have a lil fun i aint gon trip baby i get it
aint bullshit in this game wherever this plane land im the littest nigga there
turn your back on me i aint even care
if you need me im still gon be there
tell me how the fuck is this shit fair
switch on who i went there

california breeze take her out to eat
stop at a lil party
end up at the big house
i cant fuck with shawty cause she got a big mouth
pull up in a rari hop out like a big dawg
get my shit together feel like i done took two years off
bookin on my schedule i aint rich enough to chill out
i watched you turn sour i still dont know how to feel bout it
majority of em folded but im still solid

verse 2
im still out here still dont know how to feel about it
early in the mornin talkin to marquis about it
wonderin should i let it go or we beefin bout it
knowin that ill go cold on you for weeks about it
and it werent even that deep but thats just how it be with me
i cant lie she be fuckin me good but girl you fuck me better
im not surprised that you stereotypin to be a lil guy
but if i can have a second of yo time try to elevate yo mind
we can crush em on every level im tellin you
