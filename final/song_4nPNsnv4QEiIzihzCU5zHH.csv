so this is the new year
and i dont feel any different
the clanking of crystal
explosions off in the distance
in the distance

verse 2
so this is the new year
and i have no resolutions
or selfassigned penance
for problems with easy solutions

bridge
so everybody put your best suit or dress on
lets make believe that we are wealthy for just this once
lighting firecrackers off on the front lawn
as thirty dialogues bleed into one
i wish the world was flat like the old days
then i could travel just by folding the map
no more airplanes or speed trains or freeways
thered be no distance that could hold us back
thered be no distance that could hold us back
thered be no distance that could hold us back

outro
so this is the new year
so this is the new year
so this is the new year
so this is the new yearsee death cab for cutie liveget tickets as low as 147you might also like7embed"
