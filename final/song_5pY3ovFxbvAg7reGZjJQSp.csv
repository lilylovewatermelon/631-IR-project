oh misty eye of the mountain below
keep careful watch of my brothers souls
and should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
keep watching over durins sons

verse 1
if this is to end in fire then we should all burn together
watch the flames climb high into the night
callin out father oh stand by and we will
watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside high

verse 2
and if we should die tonight we should all die together
raise a glass of wine for the last time
callin out father oh prepare as we will
watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
desolation comes upon the sky

chorus
now i see fire inside the mountain
i see fire burnin the trees
and i see fire hollowin souls
i see fire blood in the breeze
and i hope that youll remember me

oh should my people fall then surely ill do the same
confined in mountain halls we got too close to the flame
callin out father oh hold fast and we will
watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
desolation comes upon the sky

chorus
now i see fire inside the mountain
i see fire burnin the trees
and i see fire hollowin souls
i see fire blood in the breeze
and i hope that youll remember me

bridge
and if the night is burning i will cover my eyes
for if the dark returns then my brothers will die
and as the skys fallin down it crashed into this lonely town
and with that shadow upon the ground i hear my people screamin out

chorus
now i see fire inside the mountains
i see fire burnin the trees
i see fire hollowin souls
i see fire blood in the breeze
i see fire oh you know i saw a city burnin out
and i see fire feel the heat upon my skin
and i see fire
and i see fire burn auburn on the mountain side262embed"
