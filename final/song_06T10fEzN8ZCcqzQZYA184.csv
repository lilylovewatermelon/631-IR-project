this time i wonder what it feels like
to find the one in this life
the one we all dream of
but dreams just arent enough
so ill be waiting for the real thing
ill know it by the feeling
the moment when were meeting
will play out like a scene
straight off the silver screen
so ill be holding my breath
right up til the end
until that moment when
i find the one that ill spend forever with

chorus
cause nobody wants to be the last one there
cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
someone to love with my life in their hands
theres gotta be somebody for me like that
cause nobody wants to do it on their own their own
and everyone wants to know theyre not alone not alone
theres somebody else that feels the same somewhere the same somewhere
theres gotta be somebody for me out there

verse 2
tonight out on the street out in the moonlight
and dammit this feels too right
its just like d√©ja vu me standing here with you
so ill be holding my breath
could this be the end
is it that moment when
i find the one that ill spend forever with

ooh you cant give up when youre looking for
a diamond in the rough cause you never know
when it shows up make sure youre holding on
cause it could be the one
the one youre waiting on
