verse 1 azealia banks
im so cold im dripping icicles
i go and take your man that nigga might miss you
spent his whole commission on my neck and ear
to stand around me need to have your winter gear
pay me coats and benzes its that bergice
thats why i do not feel these bitches frostbite
grown money ever since a youngin made my own money
you broke honey and they call me banks cause i can loan money
colder than december my diamonds on anna wintour
so thats fly ice in my life
i dont see no limits so i strive and i shine twice
i ride around and get it just listen for a minute
that was only one thought let me finish
competition ima beat em so relentless
ima be legendary when i end this
they rise when i arrive in this
all hail the supreme ice princess
tell the carriage hurry up and come and get me
tell the haters run along you can miss me
hollywood you can go and alist me
i like a shot of hard whiskey
