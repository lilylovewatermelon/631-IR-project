verse
im smoking loud this that moonrock
they tryna sue me cause im gettin paper
i dropped out of school didnt get no education
my momma she happy cause i finally made it
she living better her house big as fuck
buy her a bentayga bentley truck
with a ap today tomorrow switch it up
honeycomb diamonds vvss cuttin
standing on stage i really came from nothing
i took me a break dont mean im getting rusty
im gaining this weight they say im getting husky
i stand on front line im all about the fuckery
i go where i want nobody better not fuck with me
extended the glizzy shoot it til its empty
i come from the projects jumping over fences
i found me a plug and went and made a killing
i think we in love we should just have some children
them narcs i been sipping got to have me trippin
i didn’t come to play i had to reinvent me
i handled my business now im worth some millions
remember the safe deposit box was empty
them niggas werent fucking with me they werent friendly
if you werent with me then you aint seeing him with me
we like kanye and k you like bobby and whitney
real dope boy i aint nothing like the weirdos
never seen me putting on the weird clothes
it cost a lil more when its real gold
we already up keep the field goal
remember that day that i had lost all that cake
i had to go in the safe
i had to get me a pot and cook that shit up
had em calling me quay
i had got that shit back in like twentysomedays
ain’t no chump change i’m talkin bout 500k
i went straight to the lot and went bought me a wraith
aint no more being humble put it in they face
i wont feed in the drama im loving the hate
but one thing for sure lil baby go crazyyou might also like2embed"
