my legs are weak
im thinking this cause i cant speak
im looking at you
youre looking at me
you must think that im just crazy

if you only knew
what youre putting me through
feels like
a heart attack
youre givin me a heart attack
heart attack
youre givin me a heart attack

must have died and gone to heaven
what a way to go

i cant catch my breath
it must be a dream
but youre the cutest thing ive ever seen
im way past the point
of recovery
youre gonna be the death of me

if you only knew
what youre putting me through
feels like
a heart attack
youre givin me a heart attack
heart attack
youre givin me a heart attack
you might also likemust have died and gone to heaven
what a way to go

heart attack
youre givin me a heart attack
heart attack
youre givin me a heart attackembed"
