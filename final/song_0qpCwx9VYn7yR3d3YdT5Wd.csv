sometimes
sometimes the world gets hard

i wanna be your lake or your bay
and any problems that you have i wanna wash em away
i wanna be your sky
so blue and high
and every time you think of me i wanna blow your mind

verse 2
i wanna be your air
so sweet and fair
so when you feel that you cant breathe

and i wanna be your answer all the time
when you see how i put your life before mine
with no question

chorus
when all the love feels gone
and you cant carry on
