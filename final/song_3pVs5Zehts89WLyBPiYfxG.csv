sitting on the curbside liquor in my cup
well she says goodbye and the phone hangs up
and its kind of got me feeling some type of way
like a sinner left sitting on judgement day

well these empty bottles and motel rooms
dont treat me quite like they used to
and the company man still treats me well
paying for a glorified prison cell

chorus
well she comes and she goes but she always says goodbye
and id give anything just to be by hеr side
i got a bottle and a room and a motel kеy
and a broken heart with no vacancy
broken heart with no vacancy
no vacancy

verse
she said shell call me round half past eight
been a damn long day dont wait up too late
and im sitting like a prisoner in these four walls
watching basic cable drinking alcohol

chorus
well she comes and she goes but she always says goodbye
and id give anything just to be by her side
i got a bottle and a room and a motel key
and a broken heart with no vacancy
broken heart with no vacancy
no vacancy
