verse 1
4 am beside myself
and what i think of mental health
all the things that worry me
all the things you dont believe
ive been told just what to do
where to look and point my view
all the things that i could be
i think i learned in therapy

prechorus
am i just a shadow you drew

chorus
it comes back to you
it comes back to you
all the things that you had lost
will find their way to you
it comes back to you
it comes back to you
looking back into the past
and i can see it through

postchorus
it comes back to you oh
it comes back to you oh
it comes back to you oh
it comes back to you

mocking birds and diamond rings
oh i have thought of greater things
all the things that fly by me
all the lives that i could lead
maybe i was born for that
or maybe i was first to last
you could call it cowardice
but leave me to my studied bliss

prechorus
am i just a shadow you drew

chorus
it comes back to you
it comes back to you
all the things that you had lost
will find their way to you
it comes back to you
it comes back to you
looking back into the past
and i can see it through

postchorus
it comes back to you oh
it comes back to you oh
it comes back to you oh
it comes back to you24embed"
