im going to take a stab at this
surely well be alright
make a decision with a kiss
maybe i have frostbite
and when i shuffled on back home
i made sure all of my tracks in the snow were gone

verse 2
tissue and bones it was a tryst
this isnt a gunfight
checking it off of my list
unable to rewrite
five years countless months and a loan
hope im ready able to make my own good home

outro
they go we go i want you to know
what i did i did
they go we go i want you to know
what i did i did
they go we go i want you to know
what i did i did
they go we go i want you to know
what i did i did
they go we go i want you to know
