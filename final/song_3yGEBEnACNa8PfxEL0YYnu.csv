im bout to whoop on this maggot means nothing bitch
got a cute little face and a tight little switch
getting rich off the chickill never happen in a million
tired just from now cause she a civilian
not a soldier to this armyll make ya change
come up shorter and your face imma rearrange
you was looking strange but your pockets looking stranger
i was bumpin me some ruffin in the changer
swollen eyes busted lips but you know im loving you
in the club shakin hips every day im cussing you
bitch im never trusting you thats because im smart ho

break you like a cash register then put in hearse
conscience to the grave and i hope that you can see
that i must get paid if you wants to fuck with me

verse 3
peter pipper beat the bitch sweeped her in the conflict
through the town spit his game introduced her to a trick
makeup ho like a queen cooking cakes candy rings
feeling up her pussy hole rub her for the dingalings
but the ho didnt meet her quota so i walked out in an order
break away from getting slapped start running for the border
known to whip you out your draws bitch done went and told them laws
got domestic violent charge in the morning out them bars
duck niggas hate this shit catch em going quack quack
try snitching to a bitch trying to hold the mack back
but it aint gone happen cause the playas out here rapping
to these hoes laying down the law while i get the capn
head cracking in a brick wall got me in a midst brawl
showing out in front of folk thatll make me kill yall
muthafuckin ass beat ya down like ya stole something
turn right around hey ho let me hold something

outro
you dont never wanna try this pimp this pimp this pimpembed"
