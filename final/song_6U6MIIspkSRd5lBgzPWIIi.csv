take take all you need
and ill compensate your greed
with broken hearts
sell and ill sell your memories
for fifteen pounds per year
but just the good days

chorus
say itll make you insane
and its bending the truth
youre to blame
for all the life that youll lose and
you watch this space
and im going all the way
and be my slave to the grave
im a priest god never paid ooh

verse 2
hope and i hope youve seen the light
cause no one really cares
theyre just pretending
sell and ill sell your memories
for fifteen pounds per year
but you can keep the bad days

say itll make you insane
and im bending the truth
youre to blame
for all the life that youll lose and
you watch this space
and im going all the way
and be my slave to the grave
im a priest god never paid ooh

chorus
say itll make you insane
and im bending the truth
youre to blame
for all the life that youll lose and
you watch this space
and im going all the way
