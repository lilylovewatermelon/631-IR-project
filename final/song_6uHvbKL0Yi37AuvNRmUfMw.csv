its cold on the floor cold on the floor
this house has never been the same as before
its never felt warm never felt warm
theres something moving through the windows and walls
ive seen it before seen it before
you left me living with a lingering soul
how little you know how little you know

we were standing at the foot of a path
i had to go back had to go back
i chose to travel as a lonely man
so much that i lacked so much that i lacked
im always wishing i was walking that road
its something i hold something i hold
i take it with me all the places i go
how little you know how little you know

i only eat to fill me up
i only sleep to rest
i need a love just like you gave
i havent found it yet found it yet
see where i am is where im wanting to be
i know what i need know what i need
and there are many different places to see
i know how to dream know how to dream
still theres a wound and im moving slow
though it dont show though it dont show
ive got a hole where nothing grows
how little you know little you know
see the paper kites liveget tickets as low as 26you might also likei only eat to fill me up
i only sleep to rest
i need a love just like you gave
i havent found it yet found it yet

maybe wed marry and wed work it out fine
in some other time some other time
and we are happy when im walking that line
its all in my mind all in my mind
i paint the ceiling so that nobody knows
i cover it slow cover it slow
its like youve never even met me before
how little i show little i show
how little i show little i show1embed"
