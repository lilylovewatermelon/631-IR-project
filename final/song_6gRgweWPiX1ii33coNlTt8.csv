if home is where the heart is then were all just fucked
i cant remember i cant remember
and i want it so bad id shoot the sunshine into my veins
i cant remember the good old days

prechorus 1
and its kind of funny
the way were wearing anchors on our shirts
when being anchored aboard
just feels like a curse

chorus
my mind is a safe and if i keep it in we all get rich
my body is an orphanage we take everyone in
doing lines of dust and sweat off last nights stage
just to feel like you

verse 2
the mmmilligrams in my head burning tobacco in the wind
chasing the direction chasing the direction you went
and youre a bottled star the planets align youre just like mars
you shine in the sky you shine in the sky

prechorus 2
and are all the good times getting gone
they come and go and go and come and go oh yeah
ive got a lot of friends who are stars
but some are just black holes

my mind is a safe and if i keep it in we all get rich
my body is an orphanage we take everyone in
doing lines of dust and sweat off last nights stage
just to feel like you oh
