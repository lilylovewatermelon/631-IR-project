give you this give you that
blow a kiss take it back
if i look inside your brain
i would find lots of things
clothes shoes diamond rings
stuff thats driving me insane
you could be preoccupied
different date every night
you just got to say the word
but youre not into them at all
you just want materials
i should know because ive heard the girls say

chorus all louis
i want i want i want but thats crazy
i want i want i want and thats not me
i want i want i want to be loved by you

verse 2 liam
youve got everythin you need
but you want accessories
got to hold it in your hand
