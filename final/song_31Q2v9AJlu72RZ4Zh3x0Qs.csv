there was once in time of old a merchant hight abd alrahmán whom allah had blessed with a son and daughter and for their much beauty and loveliness he named the girl kaubab alsabáh and the boy kamar alzamánfn376 when he saw what allah had vouchsafed the twain of beauty and loveliness brilliancy and symmetry he feared for them the evil eyesfn377 of the espiers and the jibing tongues of the jealous and the craft of the crafty and the wiles of the wicked and shut them up from the folk in a mansion for the space of fourteen years during which time none saw them save their parents and a slavegirl who served them now their father could recite the koran even as allah sent it down as also did his wife wherefore the mother taught her daughter to read and recite it and the father his son till both had gotten it by heart moreover the twain learned from their parents writing and reckoning and all manner of knowledge and polite letters and needed no master when kamar alzaman came to years of manhood the wife said to her husband how long wilt thou keep thy son kamar alzaman sequestered from the eyes of the folk is he a girl or a boy he answered a boy rejoined she an he be a boy why dost thou not carry him to the bazar and seat him in thy shop that he may know the folk and they know him to the intent that it may become notorious among men that he is thy son and do thou teach him to sell and to buy peradventure somewhat may befal thee so shall the folk know him for thy son and he shall lay his hand on thy leavings but an thou die as the case now is and he say to the folk i am the son of the merchant abd alrahman verily they will not believe him but will cry we have never seen thee and we knew not that he had a son wherefore the government will seize thy goods and thy son will be despoiled in like manner the girl i mean to make her known among the folk so may be some one of her own condition may ask her in marriage and we will wed her to him and rejoice in her quoth he i did thus of my fear for them from the eyes of the folk—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the nine hundred and sixtyfourth night

she continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the merchants wife spake to him in such wise he replied i did thus of my fear for them from the eyes of the folk and because i love them both and love is jealous exceedingly and well saith he who spoke these verses

of my sight i am jealous for thee of me  of thyself of thy
            stead of thy destiny
though i shrined thee in eyes by the craze of me  in such
             nearness irk i should never see
though thou wert by my side all the days of me  till doomsday i
             neer had enough of thee

said his wife put thy trust in allah for no harm betideth him whom he protecteth and carry him with thee this very day to the shop then she clad the boy in the costliest clothes and he became a seduction to all who on him cast sight and an affliction to the heart of each lover wight his father took him and carried him to the market whilst all who saw him were ravished with him and accosted him kissing his hand and saluting him with the salam quoth one indeed the sun hath risen in such a place and blazeth in the bazar and another the risingplace of the full moon is in such a quarter and a third the new moon of the festivalfn378 hath appeared to the creatures of allah and they went on to allude to the boy in talk and call down blessings upon him but his father scolded the folk for following his son to gaze upon him because he was abashed at their talk but he could not hinder one of them from talking so he fell to abusing the boys mother and cursing her because she had been the cause of his bringing him out and as he gazed about he still saw the folk crowding upon him behind and before then he walked on till he reached his shop and opening it sat down and seated his son before him after which he again looked out and found the thoroughfare blocked with people for all the passersby going and coming stopped before the shop to stare at that beautiful face and could not leave him and all the men and women crowded in knots about him applying to themselves the words of him who said

thou madest beauty to spoil mans sprite  and saidst o my
           servants fear my reprove
but lovely thou lovest all loveliness  how then shall thy
            servants refrain from love

when the merchant abd alrahman saw the folk thus crowding about him and standing in rows both women and men to fix eyes upon his son he was sore ashamed and confounded and knew not what to do but presently there came up from the end of the bazar a man of the wandering dervishes clad in haircloth the garb of the pious servants of allah and seeing kamar alzaman sitting there as he were a branch of bán springing from a mound of saffron poured forth copious tears and recited these two couplets

a wand uprising from a sandy knoll  like full moon shining
            brightest sheen i saw
and said what is thy name replied he lúlú  what asked
            i lily and he answered lá láfn379
then the dervish fell to walking now drawing near and now moving awayfn380 and wiping his gray hairs with his right hand whilst the heart of the crowd was cloven asunder for awe of him when he looked upon the boy his eyes were dazzled and his wit confounded and exemplified in him was the saying of the poet

while that fairfaced boy abode in the place  moon of
             breakfastfête he lit by his facefn381
lo there came a shaykh with leisurely pace  a reverend trusting
             to allahs grace
                          and ascetic signals his gait displayd
he had studied love both by day and night  and had special
             knowledge of wrong and right
both for lad and lass had repined his sprite  and his form like
            toothpick was lean and slight
                          and old bones with faded skin were oerlaid
in such arts our shaykh was an ajamífn382  with a catamite
             ever in company
in the love of woman a platonist hefn383  but in either
            versed to the full degree
                         and zaynab to him was the same as zaydfn384
distraught by the fair he adored the fair  oer springcamp
           wailed bewept ruins barefn385
dry branch thou hadst deemed him for stress o care  which the
            morning breeze swayeth here and there
                         for only the stone is all hardness made
in the lore of love he was wondrous wise  and wide awake with
            allseeing eyes
its rough and its smooth he had tried and tries  and hugged buck
            and doe in the selfsame guise
                          and with greybeard and beardless alike he
playdfn386
then he came up to the boy and gave him a rootfn387 of sweet basil whereupon his father put forth his hand to his pouch and brought out for him some small matter of silver saying take thy portion o dervish and wend thy ways he took the dirhams but sat down on the masonrybench alongside the shop and opposite the boy and fell to gazing upon him and heaving sigh upon sigh whilst his tears flowed like springs founting the folk began to look at him and remark upon him some saying all dervishes are lewd fellows and other some verily this dervishs heart is set on fire for love of this lad now when abd alrahman saw this case he arose and said to the boy come o my son let us lock up the shop and hie us home for it booteth not to sell and buy this day and may almighty allah requite thy mother that which she hath done with us for she was the cause of all this then said he o dervish rise that i may shut my shop so the dervish rose and the merchant shut his shop and taking his son walked away the dervish and the folk followed them till they reached their place when the boy went in and his father turning to the dervish said to him what wouldst thou o dervish and why do i see thee weep he replied o my lord i would fain be thy guest this night for the guest is the guest of almighty allah quoth the merchant welcome to the guest of god enter o dervish—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the nine hundred and sixtyfifth night

she pursued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the merchant the father of kamar alzaman heard the saying of the dervish i am allahs guest he replied welcome to the guest of god enter o dervish but he said to himself an the beggar be enamoured of the boy and sue him for sin needs must i slay him this very night and bury him secretly but an there be no lewdness in him the guest shall eat his portion then he brought him into a saloon where he left him with kamar alzaman after he had said privily to the lad o my son sit thou beside the dervish when i am gone out and sport with him and provoke him to loveliesse and if he seek of thee lewdness i who will be watching you from the window overlooking the saloon will come down to him and kill him so as soon as kamar alzaman was alone in the room with the dervish he sat down by his side and the old man began to look upon him and sigh and weep whenever the lad bespake him he answered him kindly trembling the while and would turn to him groaning and crying and thus he did till supper was brought in when he fell to eating with his eyes on the boy but refrained not from shedding tears when a fourth part of the night was past and talk was ended and sleeptide came abd alrahman said to the lad o my son apply thyself to the service of thine uncle the dervish and gainsay him not and would have gone out but the dervish cried to him o my lord carry thy son with thee or sleep with us answered the merchant nay my son shall lie with thee haply thy soul may desire somewhat and he will look to thy want and wait upon thee then he went out leaving them both together and sat down in an adjoining room which had a window giving upon the saloon such was the case with the merchant but as to the lad as soon as his sire had left them he came up to the dervish and began to provoke him and offer himself to him whereupon he waxed wroth and said what talk is this o my son i take refuge with allah from satan the stoned o my lord indeed this is a denial of thee which pleaseth thee not avaunt from me o my son so saying the dervish arose and sat down at a distance but the boy followed him and threw himself upon him saying why o dervish wilt thou deny thyself the joys of my possession and i with a heart that loveth thee hereupon the dervishs anger redoubled and he said an thou refrain not from me i will summon thy sire and tell him of thy doings quoth the lad my father knoweth my turn for this and it may not be that he will hinder me so heal thou my heart why dost thou hold off from me do i not please thee answered the dervish by allah o my son i will not do this though i be hewn in pieces with sharpedged swords and he repeated the saying of the poet

indeed my heart loves all the lovely boys  as girls nor am i
             slow to such delight
but though i sight them every night and morn  im neither of
            lots folkfn388 nor wencherwight

then he shed tears and said arise open the door that i may wend my way for i will lie no longer in this lodging therewith he rose to his feet but the boy caught hold of him saying look at the fairness of my face and the cramoisy of my cheeks and the softness of my sides and the lusciousness of my lips moreover he discovered to him calves that would shame wine and cupcarrierfn389 and gazed on him with fixed glance that would baffle enchanter and enchantments for he was passing of loveliness and full of blandishment even as saith of him one of the poets who sang

i cant forget him since he rose and showed with fair design 
          those calves of legs whose pearly shine make light in
            nightly gloom
wonder not an my flesh uprise as though twere judgmentday 
             when every shank shall bared be and that is day of
             doomfn390

then the boy displayed to him his bosom saying look at my breasts which be goodlier than the breasts of maidens and my lipdews are sweeter than sugarcandy so quit scruple and asceticism and cast off devoutness and abstinence and take thy fill of my possession and enjoy my loveliness fear naught for thou art safe from hurt and leave this hebetude for tis a bad habit and he went on to discover to him his hidden beauties striving to turn the reins of his reason with his bendings in graceful guise whilst the dervish turned away his face and said i seek refuge with allah have some shame o my sonfn391 this is a forbidden thing i deem and i will not do it no not even in dream the boy pressed upon him but the dervish got free from him and turning towards meccah addressed himself to his devotions now when the boy saw him praying he left him till he had prayed a twobow prayer and salutedfn392 when he would have accosted him again but the dervish again repeated the intentfn393 and prayed a second twobow prayer and thus he did a third and a fourth and a fifth time quoth the lad what prayers are these art thou minded to take flight upon the clouds thou lettest slip our delight whilst thou passest the whole night in the prayerniche so saying he threw himself upon the dervish and kissed him between the eyes but the shaykh said o my son put satan away from thine estate and take upon thee obedience of the compassionate quoth the other an thou do not with me that which i desire i will call my sire and say to him the dervish is minded to do lewdness with me whereupon he will come in to thee and beat thee till thy bones be broken upon thy flesh all this while abd alrahman was watching with his eyes and hearkening with his ears and he was certified that there was no frowardness in the dervish and he said to himself were he a lewd fellow he had not stood out against all this importunity the boy continued to beguile the dervish and every time he expressed purpose of prayer he interrupted him till at last he waxed wroth with passing wrath and was rough with him and beat him kamar alzaman wept and his father came in and having wiped away his tears and comforted him said to the dervish o my brother since thou art in such case why didst thou weep and sigh when thou sawest my son say me is there a reason for this he replied there is and abd alrahman pursued when i saw thee weep at his sight i deemed evil of thee and bade the boy do with thee thus that i might try thee purposing in myself if i saw thee sue him for sin to come in upon thee and kill thee but when i saw what thou didst i knew thee for one of those who are virtuous to the end now allah upon thee tell me the cause of thy weeping the dervish sighed and said o my lord chafe not a closedfn394 wound but the merchant said there is no help but thou tell me and the other began know thou that i am a dervish who wander in the lands and the countries and take warning by the displayfn395 of the creator of night and day it chanced that one friday i entered the city of bassorah in the undurn—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the nine hundred and sixtysixth night

she resumed it hath reached me o auspicious king that the dervish said to the merchant know then that i a wandering mendicant chanced one friday to enter the city of bassorah in the undurn and saw the shops open and full of all manner of wares and meat and drink but the place was deserted and therein was neither man nor woman nor girl nor boy nor in the markets and the main streets was there dog or cat nor sounded sound nor friend was found i marvelled at this end and said to myself i wonder whither the people of the city be gone with their cats and dogs and what hath allah done with them now i was anhungred so i took hot bread from a bakers oven and going into the shop of an oilman spread the bread with clarified butter and honey and ate then i entered the shop of a sherbetseller and drank what i would after which seeing a coffeeshop open i went in and found the pots on the fire full of coffeefn396 but there was no one there so i drank my fill and said verily this is a wondrous thing it seemeth as though death had stricken the people of this city and they had all died this very hour or as if they had taken fright at something which befel them and fled without having time to shut their shops now whilst pondering this matter lo i heard a sound of a band of drums beating whereat i was afraid and hid myself for a while then looking out through a crevice i saw damsels like moons come walking through the market two by two with uncovered heads and faces displayed they were in forty pairs thus numbering fourscore and in their midst a young lady riding on a horse that could hardly move his legs for that which was upon it of silvern trappings and golden and jewelled housings her face was wholly unveiled and she was adorned with the costliest ornaments and clad in the richest of raiment and about her neck she wore a collar of gems and on her bosom were necklaces of gold her wrists were clasped with bracelets which sparkled like stars and her ankles with bangles of gold set with precious stones the slavegirls walked before her and behind and on her right and left and in front of her was a damsel bearing in baldric a great sword with grip of emerald and tassels of jewelencrusted gold when that young lady came to where i lay hid she pulled up her horse and said o damsels i hear a noise of somewhat within yonder shop so do ye search it lest haply there be one hidden there with intent to enjoy a look at us whilst we have our faces unveiled so they searched the shop opposite the coffeehousefn397 wherein i lay hid whilst i abode in terror and presently i saw them come forth with a man and they said to her o our lady we found a man there and here he is before thee quoth she to the damsel with the sword smite his neck so she went up to him and struck off his head then leaving the dead man lying on the ground they passed on when i saw this i was affrighted but my heart was taken with love of the young lady after an hour or so the people reappeared and every one who had a shop entered it whilst the folk began to come and go about the bazars and gathered around the slain man staring at him as a curiosity then i crept forth from my hiding place by stealth and none took note of me but love of that lady had gotten possession of my heart and i began to enquire of her privily none however gave me news of her so i left bassorah with vitals yearning for her love and when i came upon this thy son i saw him to be the likest of all creatures to the young lady wherefore he reminded me of her and his sight revived the fire of passion in me and kindled anew in my heart the flames of lovelonging and distraction and such is the cause of my shedding tears then he wept with sore weeping till he could no more and said o my lord i conjure thee by allah open the door to me so i may gang my gait accordingly abd alrahman opened the door and he went forth thus fared it with him but as regards kamar alzaman when he heard the dervishs story his heart was taken with love of the lady and passion gat the mastery of him and raged in him longing and distraction so on the morrow he said to his sire all the sons of the merchants wander about the world to attain their desire nor is there one of them but his father provideth for him a stockintrade wherewithal he may travel and traffic for gain why then o my father dost thou not outfit me with merchandise so i may fare with it and find my luck he replied o my son such merchants lack money so they send their sons to foreign parts for the sake of profit and pecuniary gain and provision of the goods of the world but i have monies in plenty nor do i covet more why then should i exile thee indeed i cannot brook to be parted from thee an hour more especially as thou art unique in beauty and loveliness and perfect grace and i fear for thee but kamar alzaman said o my father nothing will serve but thou must furnish me with merchandise wherewithal to travel else will i fly from thee at unawares though without money or merchandise so an thou wish to solace my heart make ready for me a stockintrade that i may travel and amuse myself by viewing the countries of men abd alrahman seeing his son enamoured of travel acquainted his wife with this saying verily thy son would have me provide him with goods so he may fare therewith to far regions albeit travel is travailfn398 quoth she what is there to displease thee in this such is the wont of the sons of the merchants and they all vie one with other in glorifying globetrotting and gain quoth he most of the merchants are poor and seek growth of good but i have wealth galore she replied more of a good thing hurteth not and if thou comply not with his wish i will furnish him with goods of my own monies quoth abd alrahman i fear strangerhood for him inasmuch as travel is the worst of trouble but she said there is no harm in strangerhood for him when it leadeth to gaining good and if we consent not our son will go away and we shall seek him and not find him and be dishonoured among the folk the merchant accepted his wifes counsel and provided his son with merchandise to the value of ninety thousand gold pieces whilst his mother gave him a purse containing forty bezelstones jewels of price the least of the value of one of which was five hundred ducats saying o my son be careful of this jewellery for twill be of service to thee thereupon kamar alzaman took the jewels and set out for bassorah—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say
when it was the nine hundred and sixtyseventh night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that kamar alzaman took the jewels and set out for bassorah after he had laid them in a belt which he buckled about his waist and he stayed not till there remained aught but a days journey between that city and himself when the arabs came out upon him and stripped him naked and slew his men and servants but he laid himself down among the slain and wallowed in their blood so that the wildlings took him for dead and left him without even turning him over and made off with their booty when the arabs had gone their ways kamar alzaman arose having naught left but the jewels in his girdle and fared on nor ceased faring till he came to bassorah it chanced that his entry was on a friday and the town was void of folk even as the dervish had informed him he found the marketstreets deserted and the shops wide open and full of goods so he ate and drank and looked about him presently he heard a band of drums beating and hid himself in a shop till the slavegirls came up when he looked at them and seeing the young lady riding amongst them love and longing overcame him and desire and distraction overpowered him so that he had no force to stand after awhile the people reappeared and the bazars filled whereupon he went to the market and repairing to a jeweller and pulling out one of his forty gems sold it for a thousand dinars wherewith he returned to his place and passed the night there and when morning morrowed he changed his clothes and going to the hamman came forth as he were the full moon then he sold other four stones for four thousand dinars and sauntered solacing himself about the main streets of bassorah clad in the costliest of clothes till he came to a market where he saw a barbers shop so he went in to the barber who shaved his head and clapping up an acquaintance with him said to him o my father i am a stranger in these parts and yesterday i entered this city and found it void of folk nor was there in it any living soul man nor jinni then i saw a troop of slavegirls and amongst them a young lady riding in state and he went on to tell him all he had seen said the barber o my son hast thou told any but me of this and he said no the other rejoined then o my son beware thou mention this before any but me for all folk cannot keep a secret and thou art but a little lad and i fear lest the talk travel from man to man till it reach those whom it concerneth and they slay thee for know o my son that this thou hast seen none ever kenned nor knew in other than this city as for the people of bassorah they are dying of this annoy for every friday forenoon they shut up the dogs and cats to hinder them from going about the marketstreets and all the people of the city enter the cathedralmosques where they lock the doors on themfn399 and not one of them can pass about the bazar nor even look out of casement nor knoweth any the cause of this calamity but o my son tonight i will question my wife concerning the reason thereof for she is a midwife and entereth the houses of the notables and knoweth all the city news so inshallah do thou come to me tomorrow and i will tell thee what she shall have told me with this kamar alzaman pulled out a handful of gold and said to him o my father take this gold and give it to thy wife for she is become my mother then he gave him a second handful saying take this for thyself whereupon quoth the barber o my son sit thou in thy place till i go to my wife and ask her and bring the news of the true state of the case so saying he left him in the shop and going home acquainted his wife with the young mans case saying i would have thee tell me the truth of this citybusiness so i may report it to this young merchant for he hath set his heart on weeting the reason why men and beasts are forbidden the marketstreets every friday forenoon and methinks he is a lover for he is openhanded and liberal and if we tell him what he would trow we shall get great good of him quoth she go back and say to him come speak with thy mother my wife who sendeth her salam to thee and saith to thee thy wish is won accordingly he returned to the shop where he found kamar alzaman sitting awaiting him and repeated him the very words spoken by his spouse then he carried him in to her and she welcomed him and bade him sit down whereupon he pulled out an hundred ducats and gave them to her saying o my mother tell me who this young lady may be said she know o my son that there came a gem to the sultan of bassorah from the king of hind and he was minded to have it pierced so he summoned all the jewellers in a body and said to them i wish you to drill me this jewel whoso pierceth it i will give him whatsoever he shall ask but if he break it i will cut off his head at this they were afraid and said o king of the age a jewel is soon spoilt and there are few who can pierce them without injury for most of them have a flaw so do not thou impose upon us a task to which we are unable for our hands cannot avail to drill this jewel however our shaykhfn400 is more experienced than we asked the king and who is your shaykh and they answered master obayd he is more versed than we in this art and hath wealth galore and of skill great store therefore do thou send for him to the presence and bid him pierce thee this jewel accordingly the king sent for obayd and bade him pierce the jewel imposing on him the condition aforesaid he took it and pierced it to the liking of the king who said to him ask a boon of me o master and said he o king of the age allow me delay till tomorrow now the reason of this was that he wished to take counsel with his wife who is the young lady thou sawest riding in procession for he loveth her with exceeding love and of the greatness of his affection for her he doth naught without consulting her wherefore he put off asking till the morrow when he went home he said to her i have pierced the king a jewel and he hath granted me a boon which i deferred asking till tomorrow that i might consult thee now what dost thou wish that i may ask it quoth she we have riches such as fires may not consume but an thou love me ask of the king to make proclamation in the streets of bassorah that all the townsfolk shall every friday enter the mosques two hours before the hour of prayer so none may abide in the town at all great or small except they be in the mosques or in the houses and the doors be locked upon them and that every shop of the town be left open then will i ride with my slavewomen through the heart of the city and none shall look on me from window or lattice and every one whom i find abroad i will killfn401 so he went in to the king and begged of him this boon which he granted him and caused proclamation to be made amongst the bassorites—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when is was the nine hundred and sixtyeighth night

she continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that the barbers wife said when the jeweller begged his boon the king bade proclamation be made amongst the bassorites but the people objected that they feared for their goods from the cats and dogs wherefore he commanded to shut the animals up till the folk should come forth from the friday prayers so the jewellers wife fell to sallying forth every friday two hours before the time of congregational prayer and riding in state through the city with her women during which time none dareth pass through the marketplace nor look out of casement or lattice this then is what thou wouldest know and i have told thee who she is but o my son was it thy desire only to have news of her or hast thou a mind to meet her answered he o my mother tis my wish to foregather with her quoth she tell me what valuables thou hast with thee and quoth he o my mother i have with me precious stones of four sorts the first worth five hundred dinars each the second seven hundred the third eight hundred and the fourth a thousand ducats she asked art thou willing to spend four of these and he answered i am ready to spend all of them she rejoined then arise o my son and go straight to thy lodging and take a bezelgem of those worth five hundred sequins with which do thou repair to the jewel market and ask for the shop of master obayd the shaykh of the jewellers go thither and thou wilt find him seated in his shop clad in rich clothes with workmen under his hand salute him and sit down on the front shelf of his shopfn402 then pull out the jewel and give it to him saying o master take this stone and fashion it into a sealring for me with gold make it not large a miskálfn403 in weight and no more but let the fashion of it be thy fairest then give him twenty dinars and to each of his prentices a dinar sit with him awhile and talk with him and if a beggar approach thee show thy generosity by giving him a dinar to the intent that he may affect thee and after this leave him and return to thy place pass the night there and next morning take an hundred dinars and bring them and give them to thy father the barber for he is poor quoth kamar alzaman be it so and returning to his caravanserai took a jewel worth five hundred gold pieces and went with it to the jewelbazar there he enquired for the shop of master obayd shaykh of the jewellers and they directed him thereto so he went thither and saw the shaykh a man of austere aspect and robed in sumptuous raiment with four journeymen under his hand he addressed him with peace be upon you and the jeweller returned his greeting and welcoming him made him sit down then he brought out the jewel and said o master i wish thee to make me this jewel into a sealring with gold let it be the weight of a miskal and no more but fashion it excellently then he pulled out twenty dinars and gave them to him saying this is the fee for chasing and the price of the ring shall remainfn404 and he gave each of the apprentices a gold piece wherefore they loved him and so did master obayd then he sat talking with the jeweller and whenever a beggar came up to him he gave him a gold piece and they all marvelled at his generosity now master obayd had tools at home like those he had in the shop and whenever he was minded to do any unusual piece of work it was his custom to carry it home and do it there that his journeymen might not learn the secrets of his wonderful workmanshipfn405 his wife used to sit before him and when she was sitting thus and he looking upon herfn406 he would fashion all manner of marvellously wroughten trinkets such as were fit for none but kings so he went home and sat down to mould the ring with admirable workmanship when his wife saw him thus engaged she asked him what wilt thou do with this bezelgem and he answered i mean to make it into a ring with gold for tis worth five hundred dinars she enquired for whom and he answered for a young merchant who is fair of face with eyes that wound with desire and cheeks that strike fire and mouth like the seal of sulaymán and cheeks like the bloom of numán and lips red as coralline and neck like the antelopes long and fine his complexion is white dashed with red and he is wellbred pleasant and generous and doth thus and thus and he went on to describe to her now his beauty and loveliness and then his perfection and bounty and ceased not to vaunt his charms and the generosity of his disposition till he had made her in love with him for there is no sillier cuckold than he who vaunteth to his wife another mans handsome looks and unusual liberality in money matters so when desire rose high in her she said to him is aught of my charms found in him said he he hath all thy beauties and he is thy counterpart in qualities meseemeth his age is even as thine and but that i fear to hurt thy feelings i would say that he is a thousand times handsomer than thou art she was silent yet the fire of fondness was kindled in her heart and the jeweller ceased not to talk with her and to set out kamar alzamans charms before her till he had made an end of moulding the ring when he gave it to her and she put it on her finger which it fitted exactly quoth she o my lord my heart loveth this ring and i long for it to be mine and will not take it from my finger quoth he have patience the owner of it is generous and i will seek to buy it of him and if he will sell it i will bring it to thee or if he have another such stone i will buy it and fashion it for thee into a ring like this—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the nine hundred and sixtyninth night

she pursued it hath reached me o auspicious king that the jeweller said to his wife have patience the owner of it is generous and i will seek to buy it of him and if he will sell it i will bring it to thee or if he have another such stone i will buy it and fashion it for thee into a ring like this on this wise it fared with the jeweller and his wife but as regards kamar alzaman he passed the night in his lodging and on the morrow he took an hundred dinars and carried them to the old woman the barbers wife saying to her accept these gold pieces and she replied give them to thy father so he gave them to the barber and she asked hast thou done as i bade thee he answered yes and she said go now to the shaykh the jeweller and if he give thee the ring put it on the tip of thy finger and pull it off in haste and say to him o master thou hast made a mistake the ring is too tight he will say o merchant shall i break it and mould it again larger and do thou say it booteth not to break it and fashion it anew take it and give it to one of thy slavewomen then pull out another stone worth seven hundred dinars and say to him take this stone and set it for me for tis handsomer than the other give him thirty dinars and to each of the prentices two saying these gold pieces are for the chasing and the price of the ring shall remain then return to thy lodging for the night and on the morrow bring me two hundred ducats and i will complete thee the rest of the device so the youth went to the jeweller who welcomed him and made him sit down in his shop and he asked him hast thou done my need yes answered obayd and brought out to him the sealring whereupon he set it on his fingertip and pulling it off in haste cried thou hast made a mistake o master and threw it to him saying tis too strait for my finger asked the jeweller o merchant shall i make it larger but he answered not so take it as a gift and give it to one of thy slavegirls its worth is trifling some five hundred dinars so it booteth not to fashion it over again then he brought out to him another stone worth seven hundred sequins and said to him set this for me tis a finer gem moreover he gave him thirty dinars and to each of his workmen two quoth obayd o my lord we will take the price of the ring when we have made itfn407 but kamar alzaman said this is for the chasing and the price of the ring remains over so saying he went away home leaving the jeweller and his men amazed at the excess of his generosity presently the jeweller returned to his wife and said o halimahfn408 never did i set eyes on a more generous than this young man and as for thee thy luck is good for he hath given me the ring without price saying give it to one of thy slavewomen and he told her what had passed adding methinks this youth is none of the sons of the merchants but that he is of the sons of the kings and sultans now the more he praised him the more she waxed in lovelonging passion and distraction for him so she took the ring and put it on her finger whilst the jeweller made another one a little larger than the first when he had finished moulding it she put it on her finger under the first and said look o my lord how well the two rings show on my finger i wish they were both mine said he patience it may be i shall buy thee this second one then he lay that night and on the morrow he took the ring and went to his shop as for kamar alzaman as soon as it was day he repaired to the barbers wife and gave her two hundred dinars quoth she go to the jeweller and when he giveth thee the ring put it on thy finger and pull it off again in haste saying thou hast made a mistake o master this ring is too large a master like thee when the like of me cometh to him with a piece of work it behoveth him to take right measure and if thou hadst measured my finger thou hadst not erred then pull out another stone worth a thousand dinars and say to him take this and set it and give this ring to one of thy slavewomen give him forty ducats and to each of his journeymen three saying this is for the chasing and for the cost of the ring that shall remain and see what he will say then bring three hundred diners and give them to thy father the barber that he may mend his fortune withal for he is a poor man answered kamar alzaman i hear and obey and betook himself to the jeweller who welcomed him and making him sit down gave him the ring he took it and put it on his finger then pulled it off in haste and said it behoveth a master like thee when the like of me bringeth him a piece of work to take his measure hadst thou measured my finger thou hadst not erred but take it and give it to one of thy slave women then he brought out to him a stone worth a thousand sequins and said to him take this and set it in a signetring for me after the measure of my finger quoth obayd thou hast spoken sooth and art in the right and took his measure whereupon he pulled out forty gold pieces and gave them to him saying take these for the chasing and the price of the ring shall remain cried the jeweller o my lord how much hire have we taken of thee verily thy bounty to us is great no harm replied kamar alzaman and sat talking with him awhile and giving a diner to every beggar who passed by the shop then he left him and went away whilst the jeweller returned home and said to his wife how generous is this young merchant never did i set eyes on a more open handed or a comelier than he no nor a sweeter of speech and he went on to recount to her his charms and generosity and was loud in his praise cried she o thou lack tactfn409 since thou notest these qualities in him and indeed he hath given thee two seal rings of price it behoveth thee to invite him and make him an entertainment and entreat him lovingly when he seest that thou affectest him and cometh to our place we shall surely get great good of him and if thou grudge him the banquet do thou bid him and i will entertain him of my monies quoth he dost thou know me to be niggardly that thou sayest this say and quoth she thou art no niggard but thou lackest tact invite him this very night and come not without him an he refuse conjure him by the divorce oath and be persistent with him on my head and eyes answered he and moulded the ring till he had finished it after which he passed the night and went forth on the morrow to his shop and sat there on this wise it was with him but as for kamar alzaman he took three hundred diners and carrying them to the old wife gave them to her for the barber her husband said she most like he will invite thee to his house this day and if he do this and thou pass the night there tell me in the morning what befalleth thee and bring with thee four hundred diners and give them to thy father answered he hearing and obeying and as often as he ran out of money he would sell some of his stones so he repaired to the jeweller who rose to him and received him with open arms greeted him heartily and clapped up companionship with him then he gave him the ring and he found it after the measure of his finger and said to the jeweller allah bless thee o prince of artists the setting is conformable but the stone is not to my liking and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the nine hundred and seventieth night

she resumed it hath reached me o auspicious king that kamar alzaman said to the jeweller the setting is conformable to my wishes but the stone is not to my liking i have a handsomer than this so take the sealring and give it to one of thy slave women then he gave him a fourth stone and an hundred diners saying take thy hire and excuse the trouble we have given thee obayd replied o merchant all the trouble thou hast given us thou hast requited us and hast over whelmed us with thy great bounties and indeed my heart is taken with love of thee and i cannot brook parting from thee so allah upon thee be thou my guest this night and heal my heart he rejoined so be it but needs must i go to my khan that i may give a charge to my domestics and tell them that i shall sleep abroad to night so they may not expect me where dost thou lodge asked the jeweller and he answered in such a khan quoth obayd i will come for thee there and quoth the other tis well so the jeweller repaired to the khan before sundown fearing lest his wife should be anangered with him if he returned home without his guest and carrying kamar alzaman to his house seated him in a saloon that had not its match halimah saw him as he entered and was ravished with him they talked till supper was served when they ate and drank after which appeared coffee and sherbets and the jeweller ceased not to entertain him with talk till eventide when they prayed the obligatory prayers then entered a handmaid with two cupsfn410 of night drink which when they had drunk drowsiness overcame them and they slept presently in came the jewellers wife and seeing them asleep looked upon kamar alzamans face and her wit was confounded at his beauty said she how can he sleep who loveth the fair and turning him over on his back sat astraddle upon his breast then in the mania of her passion for him she rained down kisses on his cheeks till she left a mark upon them and they became exceeding red and his cheek bones shone and she sucked his lips till the blood ran out into her mouth but with all this her fire was not quenched nor her thirst assuaged she ceased not to kiss and clip him and twine leg with leg till the forebrow of morn grew white and the dawn broke forth in light when she put in his pocket four cockalsfn411 and went away then she sent her maid with something like snuff which she applied to their nostrils and they sneezed and awoke when the slavegirl said o my lords prayer is a duty so rise ye and pray the dawnprayer and she brought them basin and ewerfn412 quoth kaman alzamar o master tis late and we have overslept ourselves and quoth the jeweller o my friend verily the air of this room is heavy for whenever i sleep in it this happens to me rejoined kamar alzaman true and proceeded to make the wuzu ablution but when he put the water to his face his cheeks and lips burned him cried he prodigious if the air of the room be heavy and we have been drowned in sleep what aileth my cheeks and lips that they burn me and he said to the jeweller o master my cheeks and lips burn me the other replied i guess this cometh of the mosquito bites strange said kamar alzaman hath this thing happened to thee replied obayd no but whenever i have by me a guest like thee he complaineth in the morning of the mosquito bites and this happeneth only when he is like thee beardless if he be bearded the mosquitoes sting him not and naught hindereth them from me but my beard it seems mosquitoes love not bearded menfn413 rejoined kamar alzaman true then the maid brought them early breakfast and they broke their fast and went out kamar alzaman betook himself to the old woman who exclaimed when she saw him i see the marks of joyance on thy face tell me what thou hast seen said he i have seen nothing only i supped with the house master in a saloon and prayed the night prayer after which we fell asleep and woke not till morning she laughed and said what be those marks on thy cheeks and lips he answered twas the mosquitoes of the saloon that did this with me and she rejoined tis well but did the same thing betide the house master he retorted nay but he told me that the mosquitoes of that saloon molest not bearded men but sting those only who have no hair on face and that whenever he hath for guest one who is beard less the stranger awaketh complaining of the mosquito bites whereas an he have a beard there befalleth him naught of this said she sooth thou speakest but say me sawest thou aught save this and he answered i found four cockals in my pocket quoth she show them to me so he gave them to her and she laughed and said thy mistress laid these in thy pocket he asked how so and she answered  tis as if she said to thee in the language of signsfn414 an thou wert in love thou wouldst not sleep for a lover sleepeth not but thou hast not ceased to be a child and fit for nothing but to play with these cockals so what crave thee to fall in love with the fair now she came to thee by night and finding thee asleep scored thy cheeks with her kisses and left thee this sign but that will not suffice her of thee and she will certainly send her husband to invite thee again to night so when thou goest home with him hasten not to fall asleep and on the morrow bring me five hundred diners and come and acquaint me with what hath passed and i will perfect for thee the device answered he i hear and obey and went back to the khan thus it befel him but as regards the jewellers wife she said to her husband is the guest gone answered he yes but o halimahfn415the mosquitoes plagued him last night and scarified his cheeks and lips and indeed i was abashed before him she rejoined this is the wont of the mosquitoes of our saloon for they love none save the beardless but do thou invite him again to night so he repaired to the khan where the youth abode and bidding him carried him to his house where they ate and drank and prayed the night prayer in the saloon after which the slavegirl entered and gave each of them a cup of night drink and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the nine hundred and seventy first night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the slave girl went in to the twain and gave each of them a cup of night drink and they drank and fell asleep presently in came halimah and said o good for nothing how canst thou sleep and call thy self a lover a lover sleepeth not then she mounted on his breast and ceased not to come down upon him with kisses and caresses biting and sucking his lips and so forth till the morning when she put in his pocket a knife and sent her handmaid to arouse them and when the youth awoke his cheeks were on fire for excess of redness and his lips like coral for dint of sucking and kissing quoth the jeweller did the mosquitoes plague thee last night and quoth the other nay for he now knew the conceit and left complaining then he felt the knife in his pocket and was silent but when he had broken his fast and drunk coffee he left the jeweller and going to the khan took five hundred diners of gold and carried them to the old woman to whom he related what had passed saying i slept despite myself and when i woke at dawn i found nothing but a knife in my pocket exclaimed the old trot may allah protect thee from her this next night for she saith to thee by this sign an thou sleep again i will cut thy throat thou wilt once more be bidden to the jewellers house to nightfn416 and if thou sleep she will slay thee said he what is to be done and said she tell me what thou atest and drankest before sleeping quoth he we supped as was our wont and prayed the night prayer after which there came in to us a maid who gave each of us a cup of night drink which when i had drunk i fell asleep and awoke not till the morning quoth the old woman the mischief is in the cup so when the maid giveth it to thee take it from her but drink not and wait till the master of the house have drunken and fallen asleep then say to her give me a draught of water and she will go to fetch thee the gugglet then do thou empty the cup behind the pillow and lie down and feign sleep so when she cometh back with the gugglet she will deem that thou hast fallen asleep after having drunk off the cup and will leave thee and presently the case will appear to thee but beware of disobeying my bidding answered he i hear and i obey and returned to the khan meanwhile the jewellers wife said to her husband a guests due honour is three nights entertainment so do thou invite him a third time whereupon he betook himself to the youth and inviting him carried him home and sat down with him in the saloon when they had supped and prayed the night prayer behold in came the handmaid and gave each of them a cup her master drank and fell asleep but kamar alzaman forbore to drink whereupon quoth the maid wilt thou not drink o my lord answered he i am athirst bring me the gugglet accordingly she went to fetch it and he emptied the cup behind the pillow and lay down when the slavegirl returned she saw him lying down and going to her mistress said he hath drunk off the cup and fallen asleep whereupon quoth halimah to herself verily his death is better than his life then taking a sharp knife she went in to him saying three times and thou notedst not the sign o foolfn417 so now i will rip up thy maw when he saw her making for him knife in hand he opened his eyes and rose laughing whereupon said she twas not of thine own wit that thou camest at the meaning of the sign but by the help of some wily cheat so tell me whence thou hadst this knowledge from an old woman replied he between whom and me befel such and such and he told her all that had passed quoth she to morrow go thou forth from us and seek her and say hast thou any further device in store and if she answer i have do thou rejoin then do thy best that i may enjoy her publicly but if she say i have no means of doing that and this is the last of my devices put her away from thy thought and to morrow night my husband will come to thee and invite thee do thou come with him and tell me and i will consider what remaineth to be done answered he there is no harm in that then he spent the rest of the night with her in embracing and clipping plying the particle of copulation in concertfn418 and joining the conjunctive with the conjoinedfn419 whilst her husband was as a castout nunnation of constructionfn420 and they ceased not to be thus till morning when she said to him tis not a night of thee that will content me nor a day no nor yet a month nor a year but its my intent to abide with thee the rest of my life wait however till i play my husband a trick which would baffle the keenest witted and win for us our wishes i will cause doubt to enter into him so that he shall divorce me whereupon i will marry thee and go with thee to thine own country i will also transport all his monies and hoards to thy lodging and will contrive thee the ruin of his dwelling place and the blotting out of his traces but do thou hearken to my speech and obey me in that i shall say to thee and gainsay me not he replied i hear and i obey in me there is none opposition then said she go to the khan and when my husband cometh to thee and inviteth thee say to him o my brother a son of adam is apt to be burdensome and when his visits grow over frequent both generous and niggard loathe himfn421 how then shall i go with thee every night and lie i and thee on the saloon an thou wax not chagrined with me thy harim will bear me grudge for that i hinder thee from thine therefore if thou have a mind to my company take me a house beside thine own and we will abide thus now i sitting with thee till the time of sleep and now with me thou then i will go to my place and thou to thy harim and this will be a better rede than that i hinder thee from thy harim every night then will he come to me and take counsel with me and i will advise him to turn out our neighbour for the house wherein he liveth is our house and he renteth it of us and once thou art in the house allah will make easy to us the rest of our scheme and presently she added go now and do as i bid thee answered he i hear and obey whereupon she left him and went away whilst he lay down and feigned to be asleep presently the handmaid came and aroused them and when the jeweller awoke he said to his guest o merchant have the mosquitoes worried thee he replied no and obayd said belike thou art grown used to them then they broke their fast and drank coffee after which they fared forth to their affairs and kamar alzaman betook himself to the old crone and related to her what had passed and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the nine hundred and seventysecond night

she continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when kamar alzaman betook himself to the old crone he related to her what had passed saying she spake to me this and that and i answered her thus and thus now say me hast thou any farther device for bringing me to enjoy her publicly quoth she o my son here endeth my contrivance and now i am at the term of my devices upon this he left her and returned to the khan where as eventide evened the jeweller came to him and invited him he said i cannot go with thee asked the merchant why so i love thee and cannot brook separation from thee allah upon thee come with me the other replied an it be thy wish to continue our comradeship and keep up the friendship betwixt thee and me take me a house by the side of thine own and when thou wilt thou shalt pass the evening with me and i with thee but as soon as the time of sleep cometh each of us shall hie him to his own home and lie there quoth obayd i have a house adjoining mine which is my own property so go thou with me to night and to morrow i will have the house untenanted for thee accordingly he went with him and they supped and prayed the night prayer after which the jeweller drank the cup of druggedfn422 liquor and fell asleep but in kamar alzamans cup there was no trick so he drank it and slept not then came the jewellers wife and sat chatting with him through the dark hours whilst her husband lay like a corpse when he awoke in the morning as of wont he sent for his tenant and said to him o man quit me the house for i have need of it on my head and eyes answered the other and voided the house to him whereupon kamar alzaman took up his abode therein and transported thither all his baggage the jeweller passed that evening with him then went to his own house on the next day his wife sent for a cunning builder and bribed him with money to make her an undergroundwayfn423 from her chamber to kamar alzamans house with a trapdoor under the earth so before the youth was ware she came in to him with two bags of money and he said to her whence comest thou she showed him the tunnel and said to him take these two bags of his money then she sat with him the twain toying and tumbling together till the morning when she said wait for me till i go to him and wake him so he may go to his shop and i return to thee he sat expecting her whilst she went away and awoke her husband who made the wuzu ablution and prayed and went to his shop as soon as he was gone she took four bags and carrying them through the souterrain to kamar alzaman said to him store these up then she sat with him awhile after which she retired to her home and he betook himself to the bazar when he returned at sundown he found in his house ten purses and jewels and much besides presently the jeweller came to him and carried him to his own house where they passed the evening in the saloon till the handmaid came in according to custom and brought them the drink her master drank and fell asleep whilst naught betided kamar alzaman for that his cup was wholesome and there was no trick therein then came halimah who sat down atoying with him whilst the slavegirl transported the jewellers goods to kamar alzamans house by the secret passage thus they did till morning when the handmaid awoke her lord and gave them to drink coffee after which they went each his own way on the third day the wife brought out to him a knife of her husbands which he had chased and wrought with his own hand and which he priced at five hundred diners but there was no knife like it and because of the eagerness with which folk sought it of him he had laid it up in a chest and could not bring himself to sell it to any one in creation quoth she take this knife and set it in thy waist shawl and go to my husband and sit with him then pull out the knife and say to him o master look at this knife i bought to day and tell me if i have the worst or the best of the bargain he will know it but will be ashamed to say to thee this is my knife so he will ask thee whence didst thou buy it and for how much and do thou make answer i saw two levantinesfn424 disputing and one said to the other where hast thou been quoth his companion i have been with my mistress and whenever i foregather with her she giveth me ten dirhams but this day she said to me my hand is empty of silver for thee to day but take this knife of my husbands so i took it and intend to sell it the knife pleased me and hearing his tale i said to him wilt thou sell it to me when he replied buy so i got it of him for three hundred gold pieces and i wonder whether it was cheap or dear and note what he will say to thee then talk with him awhile and rise and come back to me in haste thou wilt find me awaiting thee at the tunnel mouth and do thou give me the knife replied kamar alzaman i hear and i obey and taking the knife set it in his waistshawl then he went to the shop of the jeweller who saluted him with the salam and welcomed him and made him sit down he spied the knife in his waist shawl at which he wondered and said to himself that is my knife who can have conveyed it to this merchant and he fell a musing and saying in his mind i wonder an it be my knife or a knife like it presently kamar alzaman pulled it out and said to him harkye master take this knife and look at it obayd took it and knew it right well but was ashamed to say this is my knife and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the nine hundred and seventythird night

she pursued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the jeweller took the knife from kamar alzaman he knew it but was ashamed to say this is my knife so he asked where didst thou buy it kamar alzaman answered as halimah had charged him and the jeweller said the knife was cheap at that price for it is worth five hundred diners but fire flamed in his heart and his hands were tied from working at his craft kamar alzaman continued to talk with him whilst he was drowned in the sea of solicitudes and for fifty words wherewith the youth bespoke him he answered him but one for his heart ached and his frame was racked and his thoughts were troubled and he was even as saith the poet

i have no words though folk would have me talk  and who bespeak
             me find me thought waylaid
plunged in the careseas undiscovered depths  nor aught of
             difference see twixt man and maid

when kamar alzaman saw his case thus changed he said to him belike thou art busy at this present and leaving him returned in hottest haste to his own house where he found halimah standing at the passage door awaiting him quoth she hast thou done as i bade thee and quoth he yes she asked what said he to thee and he answered he told me that the knife was cheap at that price for that it was worth five hundred diners but i could see that he was troubled so i left him and know not what befel him after that cried she give me the knife and reck thou not of him then she took the knife and restoring it to its place sat down now after kamar alzamans departure fire flamed in the jewellers heart and suspicion was sore upon him and he said to himself needs must i get up and go look for the knife and cut down doubt with certainty so he rose and repaired to his house and went in to his wife snorting like a dragonfn425 and she said to him what mattereth thee o my lord he asked where is my knife and she answered in the chest and smote hand upon breast saying o my grief belike thou hast fallen out with some one and art come to fetch the knife to smite him withal said he give me the knife let me see it but said she not till thou swear to me that thou wilt not smite any one therewith so he swore this to her and she opened the chest and brought out to him the knife and he fell to turning it over saying verily this is a wondrous thing then quoth he to her take it and lay it back in its place and she tell me the meaning of all this he answered i saw with our friend a knife like this and told her all that had passed between himself and the youth adding but when i saw it in the chest my suspicion ended in certainty said she haply thou misdoubtedest of me and deemedst that i was the levantines mistress and had given him the knife he replied yes i had my doubts of this but when i saw the knife suspicion was lifted from my heart rejoined she o man there is now no good in thee and he fell to excusing himself to her till he appeased her after which he fared forth and returned to his shop next day she gave kamar alzaman her husbands watch which he had made with his own hand and whereof none had the like saying go to his shop and sit by his side and say to him i saw again to day him whom i saw yesterday he had a watch in his hand and said to me wilt thou buy this watch quoth i whence hadst thou it and quoth he i was with my mistress and she gave me this watch so i bought it of him for eightandfifty gold pieces look at it is it cheap at that price or dear note what he shall say to thee then return to me in haste and give me the watch so kamar alzaman repaired to the jeweller and did with him as she had charged him when obayd saw the watch he said this is worth seven hundred ducats and suspicion entered into him then the youth left him and returning to the wife gave her back the watch presently her husband suddenly came in snorting and said to her where is my watch said she here it is and he cried give it to me so she brought it to him and he exclaimed there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great and she too exclaimed o man there is something the matter with thee tell me what it is he replied what shall i say verily i am bewildered by these chances and he recited these coupletsfn426

although the merciful be doubtless with me
yet am i sore bewildered for new griefs
have compassed me about or ere i knew it
i have endured till patience self became
impatient of my patience—i have endured
waiting till heaven fulfil my destiny—
i have endured till een endurance owned
how i bore up with her a thing more bitter
than bitter aloes yet though a bitterer thing
is not than is that drug it were more bitter
to me should patience leave me unsustained

then said he to his wife o woman i saw with the merchant our friend first my knife which i knew for that its fashion was a device of my own wit nor cloth its like exist and he told me of it a story that troubled the heart so i came back and found it at home again to day i see him with the watch whose fashion also is of my own device nor is there the fellow of it in bassorah and of this also he told me a story that saddened my heart wherefore i am bewildered in my wit and know not what is to come to me quoth she the purport of thy speech is that thou suspectedst me of being the friend of that merchant and his leman and eke of giving him thy good so thou camest to question me and make proof of my perfidy and had i not shown thee the knife and the watch thou hadst been certified of my treason but since o man thou deemest me this ill deme henceforth i will never again break with thee bread nor drain with thee drink for i loathe thee with the loathing of prohibitionfn427 so he gentled her and excused himself till he had appeased her and returned repenting him of having bespoken her thus to his shop where he sat and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the nine hundred and seventyfourth night

she resumed it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the jeweller quitted his wife he repented having bespoken her thus and returning to his shop he sat there in disquiet sore and anxiety galore between belief and unbelief about eventide he went home alone not bringing kamar alzaman with him whereupon quoth his wife where is the merchant and quoth he in his lodgings she asked is the friendship between thee and him grown cold and he answered by allah i have taken a dislike to him because of that which hath betided me from himfn428 quoth she go fetch him to please me so he arose and went in to kamar alzaman in his house where he saw his own goods strewn about and knew them at this sight fire was kindled in his heart and he fell asighing quoth the youth how is it that i see thee melancholy obayd was ashamed to say here are my goods in thy house who brought them hither so he replied only a vexation hath betided me but come thou with me to my house that we may solace ourselves there the other rejoined let me be in my place i will not go with thee but the jeweller conjured him to come and took him to his house where they supped and passed the evening together kamar alzaman talking with the jeweller who was drowned in the sea of solicitude and for a hundred words wherewith the guest bespoke him answered him only one word presently the handmaid brought them two cups of drink as usual and they drank whereupon the jeweller fell asleep but the youth abode on wake because his cup was not drugged then came halimah and said to her lover how deemest thou of yonder cornuted who is drunken in his heedlessness and weeteth not the wiles of women there is no help for it but that i cozen him into divorcing me tomorrow i will disguise myself as a slavegirl and walk after thee to his shop where do thou say to him o master i went today into the khan of alyasirjiyah where i saw this damsel and bought her for a thousand diners look at her for me and tell me whether she was cheap at that price or dear then uncover to him my face and breasts and show all of me to him after which do thou carry me back to thy house whence i will go to my chamber by the secret passage so i may see the issue of our affair with him then the twain passed the night in mirth and merriment converse and good cheer dalliance and delight till dawn when she returned to her own place and sent the handmaid to arouse her lawful lord and her lover accordingly they arose and prayed the dawnprayer and brake their fast and drank coffee after which obayd repaired to his shop and kamar alzaman betook himself to his own house presently in came halimah to him by the tunnel in the guise of a slavegirl and indeed she was by birth a slavegirlfn429 then he went out and she walked behind him till he came to the jewellers shop and saluting him sat down and said o master i went into the khan of alyasirjiyah today to look about me and saw this damsel in the brokers hands she pleased me so i bought her for a thousand diners and i would have thee look upon her and see if she be cheap at that price or no so saying he uncovered her face and the jeweller saw her to be his own wife clad in her costliest clothes tricked out in her finest trinkets and kohld and hennad even as she was wont to adorn herself before him in the house he knew with full knowledge her face and dress and trinkets for those he had wrought with his own hand and he saw on her fingers the seal rings he had newly made for kamar al zaman whereby he was certified with entire assurance that she was indeed his very wife so he asked her what is thy name o slavegirl and she answered halimah naming to him her own name whereat he was amazed and said to the youth for how much didst thou buy her he replied for a thousand diners and the jeweller rejoined thou hast gotten her gratis for her rings and clothes and trinkets are worth more than that said kamar alzaman may allah rejoice thee with good news since she pleaseth thee i will carry her to my house and obayd said do thy will so he took her off to his house whence she passed through the secret passage to her own apartment and sat there meanwhile fire flamed in the jewellers heart and he said to himself i will go see my wife if she be at home this slave girl must be her counterpart and glory be to him who alone hath no counterpart but if she be not at home tis she herself without a doubt then he set off running and coming to his house found his wife sitting in the same clothes and ornaments he had seen upon her in the shop whereupon he beat hand upon hand saying there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great o man asked she art thou mad or what aileth thee tis not thy wont to do thus and needs must it be that something hath befallen thee answered he if thou wilt have me tell thee be not vexed quoth she say on so he said our friend the merchant hath bought a slavegirl whose shape is as thy shape and her height as thy height more over her name is even as thy name and her apparel is the like of thine apparel brief she resembleth thee in all her attributes and on her fingers are seal rings like thy seal rings and her trinkets are as thy trinkets so when he displayed her to me methought it was thyself and i was perplexed concerning my case would we had never seen this merchant nor companied with him and would he had never left his own country and we had not known him for he hath troubled my life which before was serene causing ill feeling to succeed good faith and making doubt to enter into my heart said she look in my face belike i am she who was with him and he is my lover and i disguised myself as a slavegirl and agreed with him that he should display me to thee so he might lay a snare for thee he replied what words are these indeed i never suspected that thou wouldst do the like of this deed now this jeweller was unversed in the wiles of women and knew not how they deal with men nor had he heard the saying of him who said

a heart bore thee off in chase of the fair  as fled youth and
           came age wi his hoary hair
laylá troubles me and love joys are far  and rival and risks
           brings us cark and care
an wouldst ask me of woman behold i am  in physic of womankind
           wise and ware
when grizzleth mans head and his monies fail  his lot in their
           love is a poor affair
nor that of anotherfn430

gainsay women he obeyeth allah best who saith them nay and he
           prospers not who giveth them his bridle rein to sway
for theyll hinder him from winning to perfection in his gifts
           though a thousand years he study seeking after wisdoms
           way
and a third

women satans are made for woe of man  to allah i fly from
           such satanesses
whom they lure by their love he to grief shall come  and lose
             bliss of world and the faith that blesses

said she here am i sitting in my chamber so go thou to him forthright and knock at the door and contrive to go in to him quickly an thou see the damsel with him tis a slavegirl of his who resembleth me and glory be to him who hath no resemblancefn431 but an thou see no slavegirl with him then am i myself she whom thou sawest with him in the shop and thine ill thought of me will be stablished true answered obayd and went out leaving her whereupon she passed through the hidden passage and seating herself by kamar alzaman told him what had passed saying open the door quickly and show me to him now as they were talking behold there came a knocking at the door quoth kamar alzaman who is at the door and quoth the jeweller i thy friend thou displayedst to me thy slave girl in the bazar and i rejoiced for thee in her but my joy in her was not completed so open the door and let me look at her again rejoined he so be it and opened the door to him whereupon he saw his wife sitting by him she rose and kissed their hands and he looked at her then she talked with him awhile and he saw her not to be distinguished from his wife in aught and said allah createth whatso he will then he went away more disheartened than before and returned to his own house where he saw his wife sitting for she had foregone him thither by the souterrain and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the nine hundred and seventyfifth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the young lady forewent her spouse by the souterrain as he fared through the door and sat down in her upper chamberfn432 so as soon as he entered she asked him what hast thou seen and he answered i found her with her master and she resembleth thee then said she off to thy shop and let this suffice thee of ignoble suspicion and never again deem ill of me said he so be it accord me pardon for what is past and she allah grant thee gracefn433 whereupon he kissed her right and left and went back to his shop then she again betook herself to kamar alzaman through the underground passage with four bags of money and said to him equip thyself at once for the road and be ready to carry off the money without delay against i devise for thee the device i have in mind so he went out and purchased mules and loaded them and made ready a travelling litter he also bought mamelukes and eunuchs and sending without let or hindrance the whole without the city returned to halimah and said to her i have made an end of my affairs quoth she and i on my side am ready for i have transported to thy house all the rest of his monies and treasures and have left him nor little nor much whereof he may avail himself all this is of my love for thee o dearling of my heart for i would sacrifice my husband to thee a thousand times but now it behoveth thou go to him and farewell him saying i purpose to depart after three days and am come to bid thee adieu so do thou reckon what i owe thee for the hire of the house that i may send it to thee and acquit my conscience note his reply and return to me and tell me for i can no more i have done my best by cozening him to anger him with me and cause him to put me away but i find him none the less infatuated with me so nothing will serve us but to depart to thine own country and quoth he o rare an but swevens prove truefn434 then he went to the jewellers shop and sitting down by him said to him o master i set out for home in three days time and am come to farewell thee so i would have thee reckon what i owe thee for the hire of the house that i may pay it to thee and acquit my conscience answered obayd what talk is this verily tis i who am indebted to thee by allah i will take nothing from thee for the rent of the house for thou hast brought down blessings upon us however thou desolatest me by thy departure and but that it is forbidden to me i would certainly oppose thee and hinder thee from returning to thy country and kinsfolk then he took leave of him whilst they both wept with sore weeping and the jeweller went with him and when they entered kamar alzamans house there they found halimah who stood before them and served them but when obayd returned home he found her sitting there nor did he cease to see her thus in each house in turn for the space of three days when she said to kamar alzaman now have i transported to thee all that he hath of monies and hoards and carpets and things of price and there remaineth with him naught save the slavegirl who used to come in to you with the night drink but i cannot part with her for that she is my kinswoman and she is dear to me as a confidante so i will beat her and be wroth with her and when my spouse cometh home i will say to him i can no longer put up with this slavegirl nor stay in the house with her so take her and sell her accordingly he will sell her and do thou buy her that we may carry her with us answered he no harm in that so she beat the girl and when the jeweller came in he found her weeping and asked her why she wept quoth she my mistress hath beaten me he then went in to his wife and said to her what hath that accursed girl done that thou hast beaten her she replied o man i have but one word to say to thee and tis that i can no longer bear the sight of this girl so take her and sell her or else divorce me quoth he i will sell her that i may not cross thee in aught and when he went out to go to the shop he took her and passed with her by kamar alzaman no sooner had he gone out than his wife slipped through the under ground passage to kamar alzaman who placed her in the litter before the shaykh her husband reached him when the jeweller came up and the lover saw the slavegirl with him he asked him what girl is this and the other answered tis my slavegirl who used to serve us with the night drink she hath disobeyed her mistress who is wroth with her and hath bidden me sell her quoth the youth an her mistress have taken an aversion to her there is for her no abiding with her but sell her to me that i may smell your scent in her and i will make her handmaid to my slave halimah good answered obayd take her asked kamar alzaman what is her price but the jeweller said i will take nothing from thee for thou hast been bountiful to us so he accepted her from him and said to halimah kiss thy lords hand accordingly she came out from the litter and kissing obayds hand remounted whilst he looked hard at her then said kamar alzaman i commend thee to allah o master obayd acquit my conscience of responsibilityfn435 answered the jeweller allah acquit thee and carry thee safe to thy family then he bade him farewell and went to his shop weeping and indeed it was grievous to him to part from kamar al zaman for that he had been friend and friendship hath its debtorship yet he rejoiced in the dispelling of the doubts which had befallen him anent his wife since the young man was now gone and his suspicions had not been stablished such was his case but as regards kamar alzaman the young lady said to him an thou wish for safety travel with me by other than the wonted way and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the nine hundred and seventysixth night

she continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when halimah said to kamar alzaman an thou wish for safety travel with me by other than the wonted way he replied hearing and obeying and taking a road other than that used by folk fared on without ceasing from region to region till he reached the confines of egyptlandfn436 and sent his sire a letter by a runner now his father the merchant abd alrahman was sitting in the market among the merchants with a heart on fire for separation from his son because no news of the youth had reached him since the day of his departure and while he was in such case the runner came up and cried o my lords which of you is called the merchant abd alrahman they said what wouldst thou of him and he said i have a letter for him from his son kamar alzaman whom i left at alaríshfn437 at this abd alrahman rejoiced and his breast was broadened and the merchants rejoiced for him and gave him joy of his sons safety then he opened the letter and read as follows from kamar alzaman to the merchant abd alrahman and after peace be upon thee and upon all the merchants an ye ask concerning us to allah be the praise and the thanks indeed we have sold and bought and gained and are come back in health wealth and weal whereupon abd alrahman opened the doorfn438 of rejoicing and made banquets and gave feasts and entertainments galore sending for instruments of music and addressing himself to festivities after rarest fashion when kamar alzaman came to alsálihiyahfn439 his father and all the merchants went forth to meet him and abd alrahman embraced him and strained him to his bosom and sobbed till he swooned away when he came to himself he said oh tis a boon day o my son whereon the omnipotent protector hath reunited us with thee and he repeated the words of the bard

the return of the friend is the best of all boons  and the joy
           cup circles o morns and noons
so well come welcome fair welcome to thee  the light of the
          time and the moon o full moons

then for excess of joy he poured forth a flood of tears from his eyes and he recited also these two couplets

the moon o the timefn440 shows unveilèd light  and his
          journey done at our door cloth alight
his locks as the nights of his absence are black  and the sun
          upstands from his collarsfn441 white

then the merchants came up to him and saluting him saw with him many loads and servants and a travelling litter enclosed in a spacious circlefn442 so they took him and carried him home and when halimah came forth from the litter his father held her a seduction to all who beheld her so they opened her an upper chamber as it were a treasure from which the talismans had been loosedfn443 and when his mother saw her she was ravished with her and deemed her a queen of the wives of the kings so she rejoiced in her and questioned her and she answered i am wife to thy son and the mother rejoined since he is wedded to thee we must make thee a splendid marriage feast that we may rejoice in thee and in my son on this wise it befel her but as regards the merchant abd alrahman when the folk had dispersed and each had wended his way he foregathered with his son and said to him o my son what is this slavegirl thou hast brought with thee and for how much didst thou buy herfn444 kamar alzaman said o my father she is no slavegirl but tis she who was the cause of my going abroad asked his sire how so and he answered tis she whom the dervish described to us the night he lay with us for indeed my hopes crave to her from that moment and i sought not to travel save on account of her the arabs came out upon me by the way and stripped me and took my money and goods so that i entered bassorah alone and there befel me there such and such things and he went on to relate to his parent all that had befallen him from commencement to conclusion now when he had made an end of his story his father said to him o my son and after all this didst thou marry her no but i have promised her marriage is it thine intent to marry her an thou bid me marry her i will do so otherwise i will not marry her thereupon quoth his father an thou marry her i am quit of thee in this world and in the next and i shall be incensed against thee with sore indignation how canst thou wed her seeing that she hath dealt thus with her husband for even as she did with her spouse for thy sake so will she do the like with thee for anothers sake because she is a traitress and in a traitor there is no trusting wherefore an thou disobey me i shall be wroth with thee but an thou give ear to my word i will seek thee out a girl handsomer than she who shall be pure and pious and marry thee to her though i spend all my substance upon her and i will make thee a wedding without equal and will glory in thee and in her for tis better that folk should say such an one hath married such an ones daughter than that they say he hath wedded a slavegirl sans birth or worth and he went on to persuade his son to give up marrying her by citing in support of his say proofs stories examples verses and moral instances till kamar alzaman exclaimed o my father since the case is thus tis not right and proper that i marry her and when his father heard him speak on such wise he kissed him between the eyes saying thou art my very son and as i live o my son i will assuredly marry thee to a girl who hath not her equal then the merchant set obayds wife and her handmaid in a chamber high up in the house and before locking the door upon the twain he appointed a black slavegirl to carry them their meat and drink and he said to halimah ye shall abide imprisoned in this chamber thou and thy maid till i find one who will buy you when i will sell you to him an ye resist i will slay ye both for thou art a traitress and there is no good in thee answered she do thy will i deserve all thou canst do with me then he locked the door upon them and gave his harim a charge respecting them saying let none go up to them nor speak with them save the black slavegirl who shall give them their meat and drink through the casement of the upper chamber so she abode with her maid weeping and repenting her of that which she had done with her spouse meanwhile abd alrahman sent out the marriage brokers to look out a maid of birth and worth for his son and the women ceased not to make search and as often as they saw one girl they heard of a fairer than she till they came to the house of the shaykh alislamfn445 and saw his daughter in her they found a virgin whose equal was not in cairo for beauty and loveliness symmetry and perfect grace and she was a thousand fold handsomer than the wife of obayd so they told abd alrahman of her and he and the notables repaired to her father and sought her in wedlock of him then they wrote out the marriage contract and made her a splendid wedding after which abd alrahman gave bride feasts and held open house forty days on the first day he invited the doctors of the law and they held a splendid nativityfn446 and on the morrow he invited all the merchants and so on during the rest of the forty days making a banquet every day to one or other class of folk till he had bidden all the olema and emirs and antientsfn447 and magistrates whilst the kettle drums were drummed and the pipes were piped and the merchant sat to greet the guests with his son by his side that he might solace himself by gazing on the folk as they ate from the trays each night abd alrahman illuminated the street and the quarter with lamps and there came every one of the mimes and jugglers and mountebanks and played all manner play and indeed it was a peerless wedding on the last day he invited the fakirs the poor and the needy far and near and they flocked in troops and ate whilst the merchant sat with his son by his sidefn448 and among the paupers behold entered shaykh obayd the jeweller and he was naked and weary and bare on his face the marks of wayfare when kamar alzaman saw him he knew him and said to his sire look o my father at yonder poor man who is but now come in by the door so he looked and saw him clad in worn clothes and on him a patched gownfn449 worth two dirhams his face was yellow and he was covered with dust and was as he were an offcast of the pilgrimsfn450 he was groaning as groaneth a sick man in need walking with a tottering gait and swaying now to the right and then to the left and in him was realized his saying who saidfn451

lackgold abaseth man and cloth his worth away even as the
            setting sun that pales with ended day
he passeth mongst the folk and fain would hide his head and
            when alone he weeps with tears that never stay
absent none taketh heed to him or his concerns present he hath
            no part in life or pleasance aye
by allah whenas men with poverty are cursed but strangers midst
            their kin and countrymen are they

and the saying of another

the poor man fares by everything opposed  on him to shut the
            door earth neer shall fail
thou seest men abhor him sans a sin  and foes he finds tho none
            the cause can tell
the very dogs when sighting wealthy man  fawn at his feet and
            wag the flattering tail
yet an some day a pauper loon they sight  all at him bark and
            gnashing fangs assail

and how well quoth a third

if generous youth be blessed with luck and wealth 
             displeasures fly his path and perils fleet
his enviers pimp for him and parsitewise  een without tryst
           his mistress hastes to meet
when loud he farts they say how well he sings  and when he
             fizzlesfn452 cry they oh how sweet

—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the nine hundred and seventyseventh night

she pursued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when his son said to abd alrahman look at yonder pauper he asked o my son who is this and kamar alzaman answered this is master obayd the jeweller husband of the woman who is imprisoned with us quoth abd alrahman is this he of whom thou toldest me and quoth his son yes and indeed i wot him right well now the manner of obayds coming thither was on this wise when he had farewelled kamar alzaman he went to his shop and thence going home laid his hand on the door whereupon it opened and he entered and found neither his wife nor the slavegirl but saw the house in sorriest plight quoting in mute speech his saying who saidfn453

the chambers were like a bee hive well stocked  when their bees quitted it they became empty

when he saw the house void he turned right and left and presently went round about the place like a madman but came upon no one then he opened the door of his treasure closet but found therein naught of his money nor his hoards whereupon he recovered from the intoxication of fancy and shook off his infatuation and knew that it was his wife herself who had turned the tables upon him and outwitted him with her wiles he wept for that which had befallen him but kept his affair secret so none of his foes might exult over him nor any of his friends be troubled knowing that if he disclosed his secret it would bring him naught but dishonour and contumely from the folk wherefore he said in him self o obayd hide that which hath betided thee of affliction and ruination it behoveth thee to do in accordance with his saying who said

if a mans breast with bane he hides be straitenèd  the breast that tells its hidden bale is straiter still 

then he locked up his house and making for his shop gave it in charge of one of his apprentices to whom said he my friend the young merchant hath invited me to accompany him to cairo for solacing ourselves with the sight of the city and sweareth that he will not march except he carry us with him me and my wife so o my son i make thee my steward in the shop and if the king ask for me say thou to him he is gone with his harim to the holy house of allahfn454 then he sold some of his effects and bought camels and mules and mamelukes together with a slave girlfn455 and placing her in a litter set out from bassorah after ten days his friends farewelled him and none doubted but that he had taken his wife and gone on the pilgrimage and the folk rejoiced in this for that allah had delivered them from being shut up in the mosques and houses every friday quoth some of them allah grant he may never return to bassorah so we may no more be boxed up in the mosques and houses every friday for that this usage had caused the people of bassorah exceeding vexation quoth another methinks he will not return from this journey by reason of the much praying of the people of bassorah against himfn456 and yet another an he return twill not be but in reversed casefn457 so the folk rejoiced with exceeding joy in the jewellers departure after they had been in mighty great chagrin and even their cats and dogs were comforted when friday came round however the crier proclaimed as usual that the people should repair to the mosques two hours before prayer time or else hide themselves in their houses together with their cats and dogs whereat their breasts were straitened and they assembled in general assembly and betaking themselves to the kings divan stood between his hands and said o king of the age the jeweller hath taken his harim and departed on the pilgrimage to the holy house of allah so the cause of our restrains hath ceased to be and why therefore are we now shut up quoth the king how came this traitor to depart without telling me but when he cometh back from his journey all will not be save wellfn458 so go ye to your shops and sell and buy for this vexation is removed from you thus far concerning the king and the bassorites but as for the jeweller he fared on ten days journey and as he drew near baghdad there befel him that which had befallen kamar alzaman before his entering bassorah for the arabsfn459 came out upon him and stripped him and took all he had and he escaped only by feigning himself dead as soon as they were gone he rose and fared on naked as he was till he came to a village where allah inclined to him the hearts of certain kindly folk who covered his shame with some old clothes and he asked his way begging from town to town till he reached the city of cairo the god guarded there burning with hunger he went about alms seeking in the market streets till one of the townsfolk said to him o poor man off with thee to the house of the wedding festival and eat and drink for to day there is open table for paupers and strangers quoth he i know not the way thither and quoth the other follow me and i will show it to thee he followed him till he brought him to the house of abd alrahman and said to him this is the house of the wedding enter and fear not for there is no doorkeeper at the door of the festival accordingly he entered and kamar al zaman knew him and told his sire who said o my son leave him at this present belike he is anhungered so let him eat his sufficiency and recover himself and after we will send for him so they waited till obayd had eaten his fill and washed his hands and drunk coffee and sherbets of sugar flavoured with musk and ambergris and was about to go out when abd alrahman sent after him a page who said to him come o stranger and speak with the merchant abd alrahman who is he asked obayd and the man answered he is the master of the feast thereupon the jeweller turned back thinking that he meant to give him a gift and coming up to abd alrahman saw his friend kamar alzaman and went nigh to lose his senses for shame before him but kamar al zaman rose to him and embracing him saluted him with the salam and they both wept with sore weeping then he seated him by his side and abd alrahman said to his son o destitute of good taste this is no way to receive friends send him first to the hammam and despatch after him a suit of clothes of the choicest worth a thousand dinarsfn460 accordingly they carried him to the bath where they washed his body and clad him in a costly suit and he became as he were consul of the merchants meanwhile the bystanders questioned kamar alzaman of him saying who is this and whence knowest thou him quoth he this is my friend who lodged me in his house and to whom i am indebted for favours without number for that he entreated me with exceeding kindness he is a man of competence and condition and by trade a jeweller in which craft he hath no equal the king of bassorah loveth him dearly and holdeth him in high honour and his word is law with him and he went on to enlarge before them on his praises saying verily he did with me thus and thus and i have shame of him and know not how to requite him his generous dealing with me nor did he leave to extol him till his worth was magnified to the bystanders and he became venerable in their eyes so they said we will all do him his due and honour him for thy sake but we would fain know the reason why he hath departed his native land and the cause of his coming hither and what allah hath done with him that he is reduced to this plight replied kamar al zaman o folk marvel not for a son of adam is still subject to fate and fortune and what while he abideth in this world he is not safe from calamities indeed he spake truly who said these couplets

the world tears man to shreds so be thou not  of those whom
           lure of rank and title draws
nay ware of slips and turn from sin aside  and ken that bane
           and bale are worldly laws
how oft high fortune falls by least mishap  and all things bear
            inbred of change a cause

know that i entered bassorah in yet iller case and worse distress than this man for that he entered cairo with his shame hidden by rags but i indeed came into his town with my nakedness uncovered one hand behind and another before and none availed me but allah and this dear man now the reason of this was that the arabs stripped me and took my camels and mules and loads and slaughtered my pages and serving men but i lay down among the slain and they thought that i was dead so they went away and left me then i arose and walked on mother naked till i came to bassorah where this man met me and clothed me and lodged me in his house he also furnished me with money and all i have brought back with me i owe to none save to allahs goodness and his goodness when i departed he gave me great store of wealth and i returned to the city of my birth with a heart at ease i left him in competence and condition and haply there hath befallen him some bale of the banes of time that hath forced him to quit his kinsfolk and country and there happened to him by the way the like of what happened to me there is nothing strange in this but now it behoveth me to requite him his noble dealing with me and do according to the saying of him who saith

o who praises time with the fairest appraise  knowest thou
            what time hath made and unmade
what thou dost at least be it kindly donefn461  for with pay
            he pays shall man be repaid

as they were talking and telling the tale behold up came obayd as he were consulfn462 of the merchants whereupon they all rose to salute him and seated him in the place of honour then said kamar alzaman to him o my friend verily thy dayfn463 is blessed and fortunate there is no need to relate to me a thing that befel me before thee if the arabs have stripped thee and robbed thee of thy wealth verily our money is the ransom of our bodies so let not thy soul be troubled for i entered thy city naked and thou clothedst me and entreatedst me generously and i owe thee many a kindness but i will requite thee—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the nine hundred and seventyeighth night

she resumed it hath reached me o auspicious king that kamar alzaman said to master obayd the jeweller verily i entered thy city naked and thou clothedst me and i owe thee many a kindness but i will requite thee and do with thee even as thou didst with me nay more so be of good cheer and eyes clear of tear and he went on to soothe him and hinder him from speech lest he should name his wife and what she had done with him nor did he cease to ply him with saws and moral instances and verses and conceits and stories and legends and console him till the jeweller saw his drift and took the hint and kept silence concerning the past diverting himself with the tales and rare anecdotes he heard and repeating in himself these lines

on the brow of the world is a writ an thereon thou look  its
            contents will compel thine eyes tears of blood to rain
for the world never handed to humans a cup with its right  but
            with left it compelled them a beaker of ruin to drain

then kamar alzaman and his father took obayd and carrying him into the saloon of the harim shut themselves up with him and abd alrahman said to him we did not hinder thee from speaking before the folk but for fear of dishonour to thee and to us but now we are private so tell me all that hath passed between thee and thy wife and my son so he told him all from beginning to end and when he had made an end of his story abd alrahman asked him was the fault with my son or with thy wife he answered by allah thy son was not to blame for men must needs lust after women and tis the bounder duty of women to defend themselves from men so the sin lieth with my wife who played me false and did with me these deedsfn464 then abd alrahman arose and taking his son aside said to him o my son we have proved his wife and know her to be a traitress and now i mean to prove him and see if he be a man of honour and manliness or a wittolfn465 how so asked kamar alzaman and abd al rahman answered i mean to urge him to make peace with his wife and if he consent thereto and forgive her i will smite him with a sword and slay him and kill her after her and her maid for there is no good in the life of a cuckold and a queenfn466 but if he turn from her with aversion i will marry him to thy sister and give him more of wealth than that thou tookest from him then he went back to obayd and said to him o master verily the commerce of women requireth patience and magnanimity and whoso loveth them hath need of fortitude for that they order themselves viper wise towards men and evilly entreat them by reason of their superiority over them in beauty and loveliness wherefore they magnify themselves and belittle men this is notably the case when their husbands show them affection for then they requite them with hauteur and coquetry and harsh dealing of all kinds but if a man be wroth whenever he seeth in his wife aught that offendeth him there can be no fellowship between them nor can any hit it off with them who is not magnanimous and long suffering and unless a man bear with his wife and requite her foul doing with forgiveness he shall get no good of her conversation indeed it hath been said of them were they in the sky the necks of men would incline themwards and he who hath the power and pardoneth his reward is with allah now this woman is thy wife and thy companion and she hath long consorted with thee wherefore it behoveth that thou entreat her with indulgence which in fellowship is of the essentials of success furthermore women fail in wit and faithfn467 and if she have sinned she repenteth and inshallah she will not again return to that which she whilome did so tis my rede that thou make peace with her and i will restore thee more than the good she took and if it please thee to abide with me thou art welcome thou and she and ye shall see naught but what shall joy you both but an thou seek to return to thine own land for that which falleth out between a man and his wife is manifold and it behoveth thee to be indulgent and not take the way of the violent said the jeweller o my lord and where is my wife and said abd alrahman she is in that upper chamber go up to her and be easy with her for my sake and trouble her not for when my son brought her hither he would have married her but i forbade him from her and shut her up in yonder room and locked the door upon her saying in myself haply her husband will come and i will hand her over to him safe for she is fair of favour and when a woman is like unto this one it may not be that her husband will let her go what i counted on is come about and praised be allah almighty for thy reunion with thy wife as for my son i have sought him another woman in marriage and have married him to her these banquets and rejoicings are for his wedding and tonight i bring him to his bride so here is the key of the chamber where thy wife is take it and open the door and go in to her and her handmaid and be buxom with her there shall be brought you meat and drink and thou shalt not come down from her till thou have had thy fill of her cried obayd may allah requite thee for me with all good o my lord and taking the key went up rejoicing the other thought his words had pleased him and that he consented thereto so he took the sword and following him unseen stood to espy what should happen between him and his wife this is how it fared with the merchant abd alrahman but as for the jeweller when he came to the chamber door he heard his wife weeping with sore weeping for that kamar alzaman had married another than her and the handmaid saying to her o my lady how often have i warned thee and said thou wilt get no good of this youth so do thou leave his company but thou heededst not my words and spoiledst thy husband of all his goods and gayest them to him after the which thou forsookest thy place of thine fondness and infatuation for him and camest with him to this country and now he hath cast thee out from his thought and married another and hath made the issue of thy foolish fancy for him to be durance vile cried halimah be silent o accursed though he be married to another yet some day needs must i occur to his thought i cannot forget the nights i have spent in his company and in any case i console myself with his saying who said

o my lords shall he to your mind occur  who recurs to you only
             sans other mate
grant heaven you neer shall forget his state  who for state of
            you forgot own estate

it cannot be but he will bethink him of my affect and converse and ask for me wherefore i will not turn from loving him nor change from passion for him though i perish in prison for he is my love and my leachfn468 and my reliance is on him that he will yet return to me and deal fondly with me when the jeweller heard his wifes words he went in to her and said to her o traitress thy hope in him is as the hope of iblisfn469 in heaven all these vices were in thee and i knew not thereof for had i been ware of one single vice i had not kept thee with me an hour but now i am certified of this in thee it behoveth me to do thee die although they put me to death for thee o traitress and he clutched her with both hands and repeated these two couplets

o fair ones forth ye cast my faithful love  with sin nor had
            ye aught regard for right
how long i fondly clung to you but now  my love is loathing and
            i hate your sight

then he pressed hardly upon her windpipe and brake her neck whereupon her handmaid cried out alas my mistress said he o harlot tis thou who art to blame for all this for that thou knewest this evil inclination to be in her and toldest me notfn470 then he seized upon her and strangled her all this happened while abd alrahman stood brand in hand behind the door espying with his eyes and hearing with his ears now when obayd the eweller had done this apprehension came upon him and he feared the issue of his affair and said to himself as soon as the merchant learneth that i have killed them in his house he will surely slay me yet i beseech allah that he appoint the taking of my life to be while i am in the true belief and he abode bewildered about his case and knew not what to do but as he was thus behold in came abd alrahman from his lurking place without the door and said to him no harm shall befal thee for indeed thou deserves safety see this sword in my hand twas in my mind to slay thee hadst thou made peace with her and restored her to favour and i would also have slain her and the maid but since thou hast done this deed welcome to thee and again welcome and i will reward thee by marrying thee to my daughter kamar alzamans sister then he carried him down and sent for the woman who washed the dead whereupon it was bruited abroad that kamar alzaman had brought with him two slavegirls from bassorah and that both had deceased so the people began to condole with him saying may thy head live and may allah compensate thee and they washed and shrouded them and buried them and none knew the truth of the matter then abd alrahman sent for the shaykh alislam and all the notables and said o shaykh draw up the contract of marriage between my daughter kaukab alsalahfn471 and master obayd the jeweller and set down that her dowry hath been paid to me in full so he wrote out the contract and abd alrahman gave the company to drink of sherbets and they made one wedding festival for the two brides the daughter of the shaykh alislam and kamar alzamans sister and paraded them in one litter on one and the same night after which they carried kamar alzaman and obayd in procession together and brought them in to their bridesfn472 when the jeweller went in to abd alrahmans daughter he found her handsomer than halimah and a thousand fold lovelier so he took her maidenhead and on the morrow he went to the hammam with kamar alzaman then he abode with them awhile in pleasance and joyance after which he began to yearn for his native land so he went in to abd alrahman and said to him o uncle i long for my own country for i have there estates and effects which i left in charge of one of my prentices and i am minded to journey thither that i may sell my properties and return to thee so wilt thou give me leave to go to my country for that purpose answered the merchant o my son i give thee leave to do this and there be no fault in thee or blame to thee for these words for love of mother land is a part of religion and he who hath not good in his own country hath none in other folks country but haply an thou depart without thy wife when thou art once come to thy native place it may seem good to thee to settle there and thou wilt be perplexed between returning to thy wife and sojourning in thine own home so it were the righter rede that thou carry thy wife with thee and after an thou desire to return to us return and welcome to you both for we are folk who know not divorce and no woman of us marrieth twice nor do we lightly discard a manfn473 quoth obayd uncle i fear me thy daughter will not consent to journey with me to my own country replied abd alrahman o my son we have no women amongst us who gainsay their spouses nor know we a wife who is wroth with her man the jeweller cried allah bless you and your women and going in to his wife said to her i am minded to go to my country what sayst thou quoth she indeed my sire had the ordering of me whilst i was a maid and when i married the ordering all passed into the hands of my lord and master nor will i gainsay him quoth obayd allah bless thee and thy father and have mercy on the womb that bare thee and the loins that begat thee then he cut his thongsfn474 and applied himself to making ready for his journey his fatherin law gave him much good and they took leave each of other after which tile jeweller and his wife journeyed on without ceasing till they reached bassorah where his kinsmen and comrades came out to meet him doubting not but that he had been in alhijaz some rejoiced at his return whilst others were vexed and the folk said one to another now will he straiten us again every friday as before and we shall be shut up in the mosques and houses even to our cats and our dogs on such wise it fared with him but as regards the king of bassorah when he heard of his return he was wroth with him and sending for him upbraided him and said to him why didst thou depart without letting me know of thy departure was i unable to give thee somewhat wherewith thou mightest have succoured thyself in thy pilgrimage to the holy house of allah replied the jeweller pardon o my lord by allah i went not on the pilgrimage but there have befallen me such and such things then he told him all that had befallen him with his wife and with abd alrahman of cairo and how the merchant had given him his daughter to wife ending with these words and i have brought her to bassorah said the king by the lord did i not fear allah the most high i would slay thee and marry this noble lady after thy death though i spent on her mints of money because she befitteth none but kings but allah hath appointed her of thy portion and may he bless thee in her so look thou use her well then he bestowed largesse on the jeweller who went out from before him and abode with his wife five years after which he was admitted to the mercy of the almighty presently the king sought his widow in wedlock but she refused saying o king never among my kindred was a woman who married again after her husbands death wherefore i will never take another husband nor will i marry thee no though thou kill me then he sent to her one who said dost thou seek to go to thy native land and she answered an thou do good thou shalt be requited therewith so he collected for her all the jewellers wealth and added unto her of his own after the measure of his degree lastly he sent with her one of his wazirs a man famous for goodness and piety and an escort of five hundred horse who journeyed with her till they brought her to her father and in his home she abode without marrying again till she died and they died all so if this woman would not consent to replace her dead husband with a sultan how shall she be compared with one who replaced her husband whilst he was yet alive with a youth of unknown extraction and condition and especially when this was in lewd carriage and not by way of lawful marriage so he who deemeth all women alikefn475 there is no remedy for the disease of his insanity and glory be to him to whom belongeth the empire of the seen and the unseen and he is the living who dieth not and among the tales they tell o auspicious king is one of

fn375 lane rejects this tale because it is extremely objectionable far more so than the title might lead me to expect but he quotes the following marginal note by his shaykh —many persons women reckon marrying a second time amongst the most disgraceful of actions this opinion is commonest in the countrytowns and villages and my mothers relations are thus distinguished so that a woman of them when her husband dieth or divorceth her while she is young passeth in widowhood her life however long it may be and disdaineth to marry a second time i fear that this state of things belongs to the good old days now utterly gone by and the loose rule of the stranger especially the english in egypt will renew the scenes which characterised sind when sir charles napier hanged every husband who cut down an adulterous wife i have elsewhere noticed the ignorant idea that moslems deny to women souls and seats in paradise whilst mohammed canonised two women in his own family the theory arose with the fathers of the christian church who simply exaggerated the misogyny of st paul st ambrose commenting on corinthians i ii boldly says—feminas ad imaginem dei factas non esse st thomas aquinas and his school adopted the aristotelian view mulier est erratum naturae et mas occasionatus et per accidens generatur atque ideo est monstrum for other instances see bayle s v gediacus revd simon of brandebourg who in 1695 published a defensio sexus muliebris a refutation of an antisocinian satire or squib disputatio perjucunda mulieres homines non esse parisiis 1693 but when islam arose in the seventh century the christian learned cleverly affixed the stigma of their own misogyny upon the moslems ad captandas foeminas and in southern europe the calumny still bears fruit mohammed koran chapt xxiv commands for the first time in the sixth year of his mission the veiling and by inference the seclusion of women which was apparently unknown to the badawin and if practised in the cities was probably of the laxest nor can one but confess that such modified separation of the sexes which it would be impossible to introduce into european manners has great and notable advantages it promotes the freest intercourse between man and man and thus civilises what we call the lower orders in no moslem land from morocco to china do we find the brutals without manners or morals which are bred by european and especially by english civilisation for the same reason it enables women to enjoy fullest intimacy and friendship with one another and we know that the best of both sexes are those who prefer the society of their own as opposed to quite the ladys man and quite the gentlemans woman it also adds an important item to social decorum by abolishing eg such indecencies as the ballroom flirtation—a word which must be borrowed from us not translated by foreigners and especially it gives to religious meetings a tone which the presence of women modifies and not for the better perhaps the best form is that semiseclusion of the sex which prevailed in the heroic ages of greece rome and india before the moslem invasion and which is perpetuated in christian armenia and in modern hellas it is a something between the conventual strictness of alislam and the liberty or rather licence of the anglosaxon and the angloamerican and when england shall have cast off that peculiar insularity which makes her differ from all civilised peoples she will probably abolish three gross abuses timehonoured scandals which bear very heavily on women and children the first is the britons right to will property away from his wife and offspring the second is the action for breach of promise salving the broken heart with pounds shillings and pence it should be treated simply as an exaggerated breach of contract the third is the procedure popularly called crim con and this is the most scandalous of all the offence is against the rights of property like robbery or burglary and it ought to be treated criminally with fine imprisonment and in cases with corporal punishment after the sensible procedure of moslem law
