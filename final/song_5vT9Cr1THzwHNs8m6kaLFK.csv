down in mississippi
its a perfect time of year
to break out the jumper cables
and try to crank this ol john deere

verse 2
well i cant wait to fire it up
and put er into gear
i know i should be hurtin
but im smilin ear to ear

chorus
cause im mowin down the roses
im mowin down the roses
im mowin down the roses
that you planted in our yard

verse 3
i poured out your purty perfume
straight down the toilet bowl
and i ripped your face straight off the wall
left nothin but some holes

verse 4
i loaded up your closets
into fifteen garbage bags
and i smoked em with your potpourri
on a burn pile in the back
you might also likechorus
now im mowin down the roses
im mowin down the roses
im mowin down the roses
that you planted in our yard

verse 5
down in mississippi
its gettin perfectly clear
that anything you used to love
just aint gon grow round here

chorus
im mowin down the roses
that you planted in our yard

outro
im mowin down the roses
im mowin down the roses
im mowin down the rosesembed"
