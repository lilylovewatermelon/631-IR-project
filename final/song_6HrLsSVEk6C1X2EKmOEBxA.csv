verse 3 drake
whoa all these broken hearts on that pole
man if pole dancings an art you know how many fuckin artists i know
got some new bills in the mail got some big favors i owe
got some good things ahead of me when these bad bitches let go
well girl lets go walk your broken heart through that door
sit your sexy ass on that couch
wipe that lipstick off of your mouth
i take it slow
she in love with my crew
she said make enough so i can try some
i thought taking drugs just aint you be you
yeah girl just be you
and i do this shit for my hometown it been going down it aint new
thats that north north that up top
that ovo and that xo
your girlfriend at our next show
but its all good dont stress though
first night fuck never really planned it
take a deep breath no one need to panic
lips so french ass so spanish
she dont really like attention i dont know if she gon manage out here
but she got me all up in my zone
said she like the view i got in this place shit i did all of that on my own
