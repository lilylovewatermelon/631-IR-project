ayy
turn my beat up a little bit yeah
for real i was— i was—
oh its gonna get louder
aight cool

verse 1
she keep on gettin played like its recess break her hearts a reflex
she wanna hit the beach and show her titties down in key west
someone leave her cryin all the time and now she finally outta kleenex
sick of dudes not givin her the respect
cause really she a genius a ceo
tryin to be on top alone she dont keep them close
she been waitin for the opportunity to be a boss
tough bitch probably wouldve thought she played lacrosse
sick of bein soft with her heart broken all the time
want some money too fuckin dudes
and fallin all in love with who was nothin new
only comin through to bust a nut or two
she just need her family like the huxtables
and now she on the road left them home to takeover
get rich and have her crib made over
but she gon do it partyin with her cup full
aint gon trust you but she gon fuck you haha

she wants diamonds she wants gold
but shes scared to let you get too close

and they’ve been lookin so they been findin
cause she aint runnin she aint hidin
until she find her way back home
and then shes finally all alone

verse 2
she gon be rich as fuck
in high school they were callin her a slut
but now she comin up louis vuitton and juicy on her butt
see the bitches that be hatin like what’s up
cause they aint doin nothin and she out here stuntin
middle finger to them hoes all them bitches had it comin haha
yeah on top of the world she lookin down
invite you to the crib let you look around
just a fuckin tease tryna get your cheese
invite you out to dinner cause she wanna eat for free
she could pay it if she wanted to she wont though
go home she got more dough haha

chorus
she wants diamonds she wants gold
but shes scared to let you get too close

and theyve been lookin so they been findin
cause she aint runnin she aint hidin
until she find her way back home
and then shes finally all alone
