it was 2016 pittsburgh
back of the bus when i first heard
ma gave me the first word
ambulance at the house said shes concerned
she goes to the door to investigate
said it doesnt look good feel her hesitate
medics worked and they tried to resuscitate
by the time they arrived it was too late

verse 2 eric vanlerberghe
was your breathing getting shallow
was the darkness getting darker
while the demons that you hide from
held you underneath the water
im at a loss for words but you know it
did you make it out to mount st joseph
i keep open doors that need closing
its done nothing but let the cold in

verse 3 brian burkheiser
you know i wouldnt mind
coulda spent a little time
but i guess you made your mind up
guess ill never know the why
or the pain you had inside
but it really fucks me up that
see i prevail liveget tickets as low as 72you might also likeoutro brian burkheiser and eric vanlerberghe
you never said goodbye
you never said goodbye
you never said goodbye
you never said you never said
you never said goodbye
you never said you never said2embed"
