verse 1
i came to rock right now
im the best and i came to get down
ive been known to rock a microphone
she got a boyfriend but left him home
see i got style so yes i brag
the things i do just make them mad
download new pics to my ipad
while your girlfriend look like shes dressed in drag
you a fad this is forever ladies in love with my agenda
my names somethin these girls remember
she write hers down return to sender
i dont need it vicky she can keep her secrets
one night only thats how i treat this
sleep in bitch please make me some breakfast
and then leave haha
