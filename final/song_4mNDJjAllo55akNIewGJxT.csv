feel feel feel the beat of the drum
move like you really wanna be number one
you can you can you can beat out the comp
run like you really wanna be at the top
stop
adrenaline rush cause you have been identified as a hustler
topic of discussion but beat it like a percussioner
and chuck the deuce up and tell em its just love

refrain
whoop whoop
damn diggitydog
let them bums stay mad cause we livin it up
whoop whoop
shelltops is on
and im popping like im popping like im popping some corn

prechorus
and now i dont wanna take you
if we fall down dont get upset
and now is just the beginning
and well figure it out somehow

chorus
right now masquerade
master the merrygoround
right now masquerade
master the merrygoround
right now
its something you create
its never ever too late
its never ever too late
right now
okay to make a mistake
yeah baby this is your day
its time to masquerade

never ever fold under pressure
desperate times get desperate measure
