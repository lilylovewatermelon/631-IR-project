verse 1
sometimes i feel like i dont have a partner
sometimes i feel like my only friend
is the city i live in the city of angels
lonely as i am together we cry

verse 2
i drive on her streets cause shes my companion
i walk through her hills cause she knows who i am
she sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
well i never worry now that is a lie

i dont ever wanna feel like i did that day
take me to the place i love take me all the way
i dont ever wanna feel like i did that day
take me to the place i love take me all the way
