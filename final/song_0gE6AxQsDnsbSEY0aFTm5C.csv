oh gimme just one more puff of that worry be gone
im plannin on feelin much better before too long
i got a world of trouble i need to forget
im on my way but i aint there yet
so gimme just one more puff of that worry be gone

verse 1
well everywhere i look trouble is all i see
cant listen to the radio and i hate tv
theres trouble with the air trouble with the water
people aint treatin one another like they oughta

chorus
so gimmе just one more puff of that worry be gonе

verse 2
well i dont wanna hear no preacher preachin
no more politician bitchin

well i cant suffer fools wastin my time
