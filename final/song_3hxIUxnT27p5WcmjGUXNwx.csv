i just want to rewind i havent seen you in a long time
you got me feeling so lonely
even when you come through i can tell
that it isnt you so baby bring it in closely
hate the way i love you but you so sweet
i always find a way to say the wrong things
i wish that we were laying in the same sheets
but lately youve been acting like you hardly know me

chorus
baby come home home so baby wont you say some
baby come home home
baby come home home so baby wont you say some
baby come home home so baby wont you say some

i wish that we were laying in the same sheets
but lately youve been acting like you hardly know me

ive only recently begun to fall
i feel the need to go and waste it all
i tried to numb away the pain
i hope someone is watching me watching me watching me

chorus
baby come home home so baby wont you say some
baby come home home
baby come home home so baby wont you say some
