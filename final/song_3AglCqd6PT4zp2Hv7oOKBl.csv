some say were never meant to grow up
im sure they never knew enough
i know the pressures wont go away
its too late
find out the difference somehow
its too late to even have faith
dont think things will ever change
you must be dreaming

chorus
think before you make up your mind you dont seem to realize
i can do this on my own and if i fall ill take it all
its so easy after all

verse 2
believe me cause nows the time to try
dont wait the chance will pass you by
times up to figure it out
you cant say its too late
seems like everything we knew
turned out were never even true
dont trust things will never change
you must be dreaming dreaming

chorus
think before you make up your mind you dont seem to realize
i can do this on my own and if i fall ill take it all
its so easy after all

verse 3
some say were better off without
knowing what life is all about
im sure theyll never realize the way
its too late
somehow its different every day
in some ways it never fades away
seems like its never gonna change
i must be dreaming dreaming dreaming

chorus
think before you make up your mind you dont seem to realize
i can do this on my own think before you make up your mind
you dont seem to realize i can do this on my own
and if i fall ill take it all its so easy after all
believe me its alright its so easy after all
believe me its alright its so easy after all
