born a life 9 to 5
gonna work til you die
gonna hurt gonna learn to take it like a man
find a girl make a wife
dig a fence paint it white
what if i had another plan

chorus kane brown
but what if i was made for the stage
what if i was made for the lights
what if i was chosen to write the stories
wasnt built to work the line
oh what if i was different
whoa whoa whoa
would i wanna be different
whoa whoa whoa

verse 2 blake shelton
man its cold crack a dawn
hear that old rooster crow
coffees on and aint it never gonna change
another night the same fight
same girl same guy
what if i wanna break the mundane

what if i was made for the lights
what if i was chosen to write the stories

without them mad at me but im breaking down
