tell me that you love me
say well always work it out
i know its kinda scary but its only temporary doubt
ive done a lot of stupid things
but promise that youre gonna stay long enough
to grow old with me

verse 2
were gonna see the good times
love each other through the bad
its gonna hurt like hell when we lose our moms and dads
so let my shoulder hold your tears
walk beside me through the years
baby lets see where this love can lead

chorus
lets hold hands on your favorite beach
fix up a house that we found in the city limits
tangled up in a satin sheet
and get a little loud when weve had too much to drink
and learn to love from a church pew
laugh about all the times we counted pennies
buy some land with a good view to start family
baby grow old with me

its gonna take a little time
well have to work at it every day
were gonna lose a lot of sleep
and learn to eat out of a microwave
you know well probably never have it all
but thats part of buildin up the wall
strong enough to stand up through the rain

chorus
well make some love on your favorite beach
add to the house that we found in the city limits
talk our babies through the bad dreams
when they get a little older well tell them not to drink
book a church when she finds a groom
laugh about all the times theyll count the pennies
give em land with a good view to start a family

verse 4
and baby you know we might
take a turn on a bad road
maybe go where the wind blows baby
but end up right where we were meant to be yeah
back and forth on a porch swing
hard not to smile thinkin how it dont get much better
our babys babys turnin 18
what a family hmmm
outro
baby grow old with me
baby grow old with me
baby grow old with me
tell me that you love me
say well always work it out2embed"
