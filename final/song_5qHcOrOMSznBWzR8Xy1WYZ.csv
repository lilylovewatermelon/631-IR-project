verse 3 big sean
is this what you want the baddest
i know what you want without askin
i hit once had to have it
i hit twice its a habit dont get caught up in traffic
i heard that its hazardous stormin outside lets do that on the mattress
i just keep askin is it real is it real look tell me is it real
yep real enough to go and get it tatted
give you flowers now you look like youre on a pageant
i can take you to the crib condo or the cabin whats up
if you make it i can make it happen i can grant it
dont you take my grant it though for granted
i know thats not your intent we aint even campin
and to leave this bed imma need a fuckin ransom
man i got her screamin finally famous when we fly around
never lie to you less i lie you down
i put the writin on the wall but you dont understand it all like we in chinatown
we one and one both one of ones and when you put the twos together
thats not twentytwo its forever i promise 2020 couldnt even make it clearer
i swear sean don
