ive been hiding for so long
these feelings theyre not gone
can i tell anyone
afraid of what theyll say
so i push them away
im acting so strange

chorus
theyre so pretty it hurts
im not talking bout boys im talking bout girls
theyre so pretty with their buttonup shirts

verse 2
i shouldnt be feeling this
but its too hard to resist
soft skin and soft lips
i should be into this guy
but its just a waste of time
hes really not my type
i know what i like
no this is not a phase
or a coming of age
this will never change

chorus
theyre so pretty it hurts
im not talking bout boys im talking bout girls
theyre so pretty with their buttonup shirts
theyre so pretty it hurts
im not talking bout boys im talking bout girls
theyre so pretty with their buttonup shirts

chorus
theyre so pretty it hurts
im not talking bout boys im talking bout girls
theyre so pretty with their buttonup shirts
and theyre so pretty it hurts
im not talking bout boys im talking bout girls
theyre so pretty it hurts45embed"
