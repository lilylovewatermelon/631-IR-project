nickels and dimes
sticks to my mind
i want more than
you have my friends

verse 1
got a thing for nickel plated nines and pretty dimes
mac11 i squeeze like lemon limes
squirt obey your thirst fashion lines
tween beauty and beast i walk the line
johnny cash im a real g
i cut myself today to see if i still bleed
success is so sublime
gotta do that time to time so i dont lose my mind
something bout the struggle so divine
this sort of love is hard to define
when you scratching for every nickel and dime
got me itching to do this shit for my mom
do this shit for my town
leave the door open hoping they kick it down
the purest form of giving is anonymous to anonymous
we gon make it there i promise this

nickels and dimes
sticks to my mind
i want more than
you have my friends

sometimes i feel survivors guilt
i gave some money to this guy he got high as hell
now im part of the problem far as i could tell
did i do it for him or do it for myself
cant lie to myself
i love my niggas more than my own blood
i die for my niggas and i love my cub hope thats not fucked up
i got a problem with the handouts i took the man route
ill give an opportunity though thats the plan now
no guilt in giving clear a nigga conscience out
no guilt in receiving every thing within reason
cant see it taking food out my little monsters mouth
thatll drive me gaga
run up in your mommas house two nickels one dime
manslaughter charges the lawyer knocked it down
im just trying to find common ground
fore mr belafonte come and chop a nigga down
mr day o major fail
respect these youngins boy its my time now
hublot homie two door homie
you dont know all the shit i do for the homies
hook gonjasufi
nickels and dimes
sticks to my mind
i want more than
you have my friends
bridge gonjasufi
it all depends
how the story is
nickels and dimes
tickle my mind

verse 3
pardon my hubris stanley kubrick
with eyes wide shut i could cook up two bricks
turn nickels to dime turn dimes to quarters
turn wives from daughters oh im clear as water
and just for clarity my presence is charity
my flow is a gift philanthropist
everybody round me rich or will be
baby boy i promise you this or kill me
and when a nigga go as the old adage go
you die rich and you die disgraced so just let me grow
watch me cook throw no looks
like magic in his prime when kareem sky hooked yeah
yall not worthy sometimes i feel like
yall dont deserve me my flow unearthly
the greatest form of giving is anonymous to anonymous
so here yall go i promise this
hook gonjasufi
nickels and dimes
sticks to my mind
i want more than
you have my friends26embed"
