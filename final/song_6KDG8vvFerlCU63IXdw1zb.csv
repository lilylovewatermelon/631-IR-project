were caught in a trap i cant walk out
because i love you too much baby
why cant you see what youre doin to me
when you dont believe a word i say

chorus
we cant go on together
with suspicious minds with suspicious minds
and we cant build our dreams
on suspicious minds

verse 2
so if an old friend i know stops by to say hello
would i still see suspicion in your eyes
here we go again asking where ive been
you cant see the tears are real im cryin yes im cryin

chorus
we cant go on together
with suspicious minds with suspicious minds
and we cant build our dreams
on suspicious minds

bridge
oh let our love survive
ill dry the tears from your eyes
lets dont let a good thing die
when honey you know ive never lied to you
mmm yeah yeah
