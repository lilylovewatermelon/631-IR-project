its over when its over
aint it baby aint it
rips ya like a dagger
cant it baby cant it
wish we could do it over
damn it baby damn it
we had it in the air we just couldnt land it

verse 1
its the first snap of the last straw
where regrets outlast the alcohol
its a cold sweat in an empty bed
and dreams are like a knife
when youre hanging by a thread
aint no maybe we can make it if we just play the right cards

chorus
its over when its over
aint it baby aint it
rips ya like a dagger
cant it baby cant it
wish we could do it over
damn it baby damn it
we had it in the air we just couldnt land it
see eric church liveget tickets as low as 200you might also likeverse 2
its a white flag
its a stop sign
its the last long drag on a marlboro light
its a long night beating up the past
know when the first lie is going to hit you back
this aint no gone for good drill
or no goodbye false alarm its over
yeah its overx2

there aint no better way
we could make it work
its a blank page
when youre outta words
yeah its a flat line
its a heart attack
yeah its too far gone to be shocked back
its a one way with nowhere to turn
its a no brakes baby crash and burn
aint no map going to ever bring us back
from where we are

chorus
its over when its over
aint it baby aint it
rips ya like a dagger
cant it baby cant it
wish we could do it over
damn it baby damn it
we had it in the air we just couldnt land it3embed"
