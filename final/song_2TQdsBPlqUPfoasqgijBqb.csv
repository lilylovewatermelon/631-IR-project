the sun still hangin in the sky
and the world is wide awake outside
and i know theres things we need to do
but i just wanna draw the blinds and

chorus
say goodnight
oh wont you let me pull you into me
go wherever all these kisses lead
turn down the bed
turn out the lights
and say goodnight

verse 2
whats the point of trying to pretend
that we dont wanna just give in
why are we holdin onto this day
lets just let it fade away and

chorus
say goodnight
oh wont you let me pull you into me
go wherever all these kisses lead
turn down the bed
turn out the lights
and say goodnight

oh wont you let me pull you into me
oh go wherever all these kisses lead
