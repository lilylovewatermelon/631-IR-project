and im chained to the couch
and my brain spits bad ideas out of my mouth
like a thousand words
circuits burst
crowds scream and here comes the hearse
and im jumpin now
outta my chest
as the crowds begin to scream
and the winos wade into the barrooms
to drink away the dreams
and i can hear years worth of traffic
outside on that dirty street
i can see the lights turn
from red to black to blue to brown to green
and i been starin for so long
my eyes begin to bleed
yes i been starin for so long
my eyes begin to bleed

when i was a young one
they told me i left my rights at the door
ana as i grow older this becomes true more and more
now im just starin out that open door
i should be screamin
but i aint got no tears no more
i aint got no tears aint got no tears no more
i aint got no tears aint got no tears no more
you might also likeguess i lost a few things that were dear to me
like my arms and my legs and my body and my soul and my will to speak
now theyre just slidin fast towards that ocean floor beneath
tryin to not be pulled under by the waves and the weeds
rain on the roof fit together so click like a tailor made suit
its like pull aim click bang soar and shoot
and the rain and wind they lick my skin
til its freezin smooth
and they heal over years of a thousand bloody wounds
oh yes they heal over years of a thousand bloody wounds
