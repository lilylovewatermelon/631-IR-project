here it comes millennium
and everybodys talkin bout jerusalem

and if youre in the mood to take a ride a ride
then strap on a suit and get inside

we dont need all these prophecies
tellin us whats a sign whats a sign
cause paranoia aint the way to live your life from day to day
no no no
so leave your doubts and your fears behind
dont be afraid at all
cause up in outer space theres no gravity to fall
put your mind and your body to the test
cause up in outer space its like the wild wild west

chorus nsync
if you wanna fly
come and take a ride
take a space ride with the cowboy baby
if you wanna fly
come and take a ride
take a space ride with the cowboy baby

there it is yo
its time we put some funk on this track
and im not talkin about that stale stuff

verse 3 lisa left eye lopes
sonic boom and never let you try to stop me
born to fly sky high up to the top see
nothing to fear no doubts and no tears
millennium sound to motivate the future years
and you can either be scared or get prepared
against all odds i bet you never wouldve dared
to make these moves and take flight like me
to come through for the world prophecy
space connect to overthrow your interception
ready or not make it hot
that aint no question
get nsync and put your head to the sky
keep the faith
one love from left eye left eye
