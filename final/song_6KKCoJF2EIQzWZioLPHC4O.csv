seems like were holding on forever
i gotta let it go
times up you pushed me to surrender tonight
who knows what happens now whatever
wherever the wind blows
and im there as long as were together
alright

chorus
lets have the time of our lives
like theres no one else around
just throw your hands up high
even when they try to take us down
well have the time of our lives
til the lights burn out
lets laugh until we cry
life is only what you make it now
lets have the time of our lives

verse 2
dreamers dont care if its right
i think im really into you
restless lets leave it all behind
tonight
crazy when you cross my mind
oh the trouble we could get into
so what letâ€™s just give this a try
alright

lets have the time of our lives

looking back what are we waiting for
take that chance nows all we got for sure
