nothin new
cause this is exactly what i do uh
what up e hahaha
good weeds lit up on this one yea
ridin by myself
yea uh

verse 1
the world turning the weed burning
them haters talking i keep earning
know some who say lifes a bitch
well i’mma keep flirting
and fuck that bitch for the money and louis v purchases
old folks jock my car cause they know just what this is
niggas flexin’ hard with no bars they got weak service
keep verses mortal kombat
look at my ring if i aint ballin’ bitch then what you call that
nothing but net aint back cause i never left
i did everything right nigga better yet
rolling bomb for the niggas thats around us
something like a contractor built it from the ground up
now just twist up this weed
realize that you are in the presence of a g
don’t fuck up my paper meaning my cheese
or the ones i use to roll up my trees
fuck it you know what i mean
see wiz khalifa liveget tickets as low as 73you might also likehook
i’m riding round smoking my music up loud
gotta do my thing no disrespect to the niggas before me
some smile up in your face but then they hate on the low
now i just stunt on my own
now i just stunt on my own
i’m in a race and taking the winners place
no foot on the brakes
one of the best homie thats what they call me
it’s lonely at the top aint no company so
now i just stunt on my own
now i just stunt on my own

verse 2
see me when i’m alone wishing they could fuck with me
my ex calling my phone wishing she could stunt with me
but i’m just riding dawg doing a buck fifty
stunting like jet li boat houses and jet skis
thirty on the flight ice like the gretzkys
my dime pieces only recognize the best trees
treat ‘em like i don’t need ‘em boy you best believe
you in her face i let her breathe
from debated on to waited on
from hated on to the nigga they put cake up on
cause we are young movie stars
cause we are young movie stars
hook
i’m riding round smoking good music aloud
gotta do my thing no disrespect to the niggas before me
some smile up in your face but then they hate on the low
now i just stunt on my own
now i just stunt on my own
i’m in a race and taking the winners place
no foot on the brakes
one of the best homie thats what they call me
it’s lonely at the top aint no company so
now i just stunt on my own
now i just stunt on my own

bridge
ooooooh oooh ooooooooooh
ooooooh oooh ooooooooooh
ooooooh oooh ooooooooooh

verse 3
oooooh now i just stunt on my own
bitches aint say shit to me
but now they won’t leave me alone
used to walk the other way
but now they all come to my home
and they calling my phone cause my paper is looong
nothing they aint singing my song
get hired up if they want then i bring them along
we flying up no you wont need a ticket at all
need a ticket at all tell a bitch i’ma ball
and i’ma buy a new crib for my niggas and all
cause i remember days we’d sit and pictured it all
nigga swear i’d leave or pictured i’d fall
counting reasons why they hate your bitch think i’m a star
cause we are young gifted
not to mention out here making muthafuckin millions
yeah i said it muthafuckin millions
got my money up i’m in the building
hook
i’m riding round smoking my music aloud
gotta do my thing no disrespect to the niggas before me
some smile up in your face but then they hate on the low
now i just stunt on my own
now i just stunt on my own
i’m in a race and taking the winners place
no foot on the brakes
one of the best homie thats what they call me
it’s lonely at the top aint no company so
now i just stunt on my own
now i just stunt on my own32embed"
