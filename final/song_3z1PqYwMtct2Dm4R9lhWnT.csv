county road 233 under my feet
nothing on this white rock but little olâ€™ me
ive got two miles till he makes bail
and if im right were headed straight for hell

chorus
im going home gonna load my shotgun
wait by the door and light a cigarette
if he wants a fight well now hes got one
and he aint seen me crazy yet
he slapped my face and he shook me like a rag doll
dont that sound like a real man
im gonna show him what little girls are made of
gunpowder and lead

verse 2
well its half past ten another sixpack in
and i can feel the rumble like a cold black wind
he pulls in the drive the gravel flies
he dont know whats waitin here this time

chorus
hey im going home gonna load my shotgun
wait by the door and light a cigarette
if he wants a fight well now hes got one
and he aint seen me crazy yet
he slapped my face and he shook me like a rag doll
dont that sound like a real man
im gonna show him what little girls are made of
gunpowder and lead
bridge
his fist is big but my guns bigger
hell find out when i pull the trigger

chorus
im going home gonna load my shotgun
wait by the door and light a cigarette
if he wants a fight well now hes got one
and he aint seen me crazy yet
he slapped my face and he shook me like a rag doll
dont that sound like a real man
im gonna show him what little girls are made of
gunpowder and gunpowder and lead
