oh shes only seventeen
whine and whine and whine weep over everything
bloody mary breakfast busting up the scene
brothers fighting whens a baby gonna sleep
hidden ship that sails away

verse
said its a culmination of a story
and a goodbye session
its a tick of our time and the tick in her head
that made me feel so strange
so i could call you baby i could call you dammit
its a one in a million
oh its the rolling of your spanish tongue
that made me wanna stay

chorus
oh shes only seventeen
whine and whine and whine weep over everything
bloody mary breakfast busting up the scene
brothers fighting whens a baby gonna sleep
hidden ship that sails away
