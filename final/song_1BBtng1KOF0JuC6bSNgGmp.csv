you see the world in black and white
no colour or light
you think youll never get it right
but youre wrong you might
the sky could fall could fall on me
the parting of the seas the seas the seas the seas
but you mean more mean more to me to me to me to me
than any colour i can see

chorus
all you ever wanted was love
but you never looked hard enough
its never gonna give itself up
all you ever wanted to be
livin in perfect symmetry
nothin is as down or up
as us

verse 2
you see the world in black and white
not painted right
you see no meaning to your life
you should try
you should try
see coldplay liveget tickets as low as 113you might also likechorus
and all you ever wanted was love
but you never looked hard enough
its never gonna give itself up
and all you ever wanted to be
livin in perfect symmetry
nothin is as down or up

bridge
and dont you wanna see it come soon
floatin in a big white balloon
or given on your own silver spoon
dont you wanna see it come down
there for throwin your arms around
and say “youre not a moment too soon”
