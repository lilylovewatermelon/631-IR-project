things been goin pretty damn good
hell of a lot better than i thought they would
when her last goodbye came on back
i swore then itd be the last time i ever let her down
cause what i didnt know then i sure know now

chorus
im gonna love her like shes leaving
like shes packed up her heart
like theres no tomorrow
so she dont get too far
i wont give her one good reason
ill be the me that she believes in
im gonna love her
im gonna love her like shes leaving

verse 2
an empty bottle and an empty bed
missing her memories poundin my head
the thought of her with someone else
how could i do that to myself
watchin her walk out that front door
is somethin i dont wanna see no more

chorus
yeah im gonna love her like shes leaving
like shes packed up her heart
like theres no tomorrow
so she dont get too far
i wont give her one good reason
ill be the me that she believes in
im gonna love her
im gonna love her like shes leaving oh
im gonna love her
im gonna love her like shes leaving
