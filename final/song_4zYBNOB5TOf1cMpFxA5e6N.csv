im gonna pull you in close gonna wrap you up tight
gonna play with the braids that you came here with tonight
im gonna hold your face and toast the snow that fell
because friends dont waste wine when theres words to sell

verse 2
i feel like love is in the kitchen with a culinary eye
i think hes making something special and im smart enough to try
if you dont trust yourself for at least one minute each day
well you should trust in this girl cause loving is coming our way

prechorus
if you can fix me up girl youll go a long way
if you can fix me up girl youll go a long way

chorus 1
ill stand by all this drinking if it helps me through these days
take my love in these small doses
it takes a long time just to get this all straight
take my love in these small doses
ill showcase on route 7 when i find the right place
take my love in these small doses
it takes a long time just to get this all straight
take my love in these small doses
in my mind
this is my free time

if you can fix me up girl youll go a long way
if you can fix me up girl youll go a long way

it takes a long time just to get this all straight
