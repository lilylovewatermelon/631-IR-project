are you sitting at home all alone trying to fall asleep
are you staring a hole through your phone praying that it rings
are you watching a movie that youve seen a thousand times
or maybe playing some mayer getting lost in your favorite lines

prechorus
well if youre anything like me
you just might be doing whatever it takes
to drown out the noise
but i just wanna hear your voice

chorus
iâ€™m one number away
from calling to you
i said i was through
but im dying inside
got my head in a mess
girl i confess
i lied when i said
im leaving and not coming back
might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
but everywhere i go i see your face
in my brain dial it up everything i wanna say
but im still one number away
see luke combs liveget tickets as low as 33you might also likeverse 2
are you stuck at a red light with a marlboro light on your lips
does the smoke in your mirror get clearer without my kiss
are you changing the station replacing our favorite songs
well maybe its a mistake hit the brakes on the moving on

prechorus 2
well if youre anything like me
you just might be doing whatever it takes
to outrun the storm
but im almost out that door

chorus
and im one number away
from calling to you
i said i was through
but im dying inside
got my head in a mess
girl i confess
i lied when i said
im leaving and not coming back
might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
but everywhere i go i see your face
in my brain dial it up everything i wanna say
but im still one number away
bridge
will you pick up when i call
or just forget we loved at all
we dont have to talk
i just wanna hear your voice

chorus
and im one number away
from calling you
i said i was through
but im dying inside
got my head in a mess
girl i confess
i lied when i said
im leaving and not coming back
might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
but everywhere i go i see your face
in my brain dial it up everything i wanna say
but im still one number away

outro
away away
yeah im still one number away17embed"
