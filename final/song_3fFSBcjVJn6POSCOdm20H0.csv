i got no money in my pockets
i got a hole in my jeans
i had a job and i lost it
but it wont get to me

verse 2
cause im riding with my baby
and its a brand new day
were on the wheels of an angel
flying away

chorus
and the sun is shining
this road keeps winding
through the prettiest country
from georgia to tennessee
and i got the one i love beside me
my troubles behind me
im alive and im free
who wouldnt wanna be me

verse 3
now shes strumming on my sixstring
across her pretty knees
shes stomping out a rhythm
and singing to me the sweetest song
see keith urban liveget tickets as low as 4you might also likechorus
and the sun is shining
and this road keeps winding
through the prettiest country
from georgia to tennessee
and i got the one i love beside me
my troubles behind me
im alive and im free
who wouldnt wanna be me
