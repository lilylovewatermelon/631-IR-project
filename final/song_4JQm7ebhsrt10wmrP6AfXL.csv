how long does it take where do you write what are the circumstances do you start with music do you start with lyrics and my answer is always that it happens differently every time and thats why im still so in love with song writing
so what ive done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started different ways
so ill explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how i put songs together

i sent this voice memo to ryan tedder because id always wanted to work with him and finally we scheduled some studio time
so i always wanna be prepared
i wanted to send him the idea that i was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said i cant stand that i wanna work on something else think of something else
so i just sat down with the piano put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where i wanted to go with the song how i saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called i know places
so this was the voice memo that i sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song

okay so this is kind of this rough idea thing

uhuhuhoh ohohohi
ohohoh ohohohi
ohohohoh ohohohiii

na na na na waiting at the back door
theyre around and the vultures come around
and you know that they wont they wont us
say what they want bout say what they want bout us
and you come and sing and listen
i would not think about it but im not done
every know that a thing or two about it thing or two about it i

cause they got the cages they got the boxes
and guns
they are the hunters we are the foxes
and we run
baby i know some places we wont be found
and theyll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
cause i i know places we can hide
i know places i know places

uhuhuhi uhuhuhi ohohi uhuhuhi know places

or whatever
i dont know but thats basically just like a dark really dark lyric like bridge thing and its about like everybodys like trying to get into and ruin a love or whatever and its like you just whatever you know and the chorus would just go to that major and just be like ooh chorus
so i hope you like it it wouldnt be a piano thing
it would be like vocalizing
like very like beat now im just making weird sounds
