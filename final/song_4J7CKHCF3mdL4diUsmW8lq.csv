i might be anyone
a lone fool out in the sun
your heartbeat of solid gold
i love you youll never know

prechorus
when the daylight comes you feel so cold you know
im too afraid of my heart to let you go

chorus
waitin for the fire to light
feelin like we could do right
be the one that makes tonight
cause freedom is a lonely road
were under control

build

drop
were under control
