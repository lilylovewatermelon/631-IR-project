livin hard was easy when i was young and bulletproof
i had no chains to bind me just a guitar and a roof
emptied every bottle when i poured i never missed
i had blood shot eyes at twentyfive or was it twentysix

verse 2
didnt seem to matter what price i had to pay
cause anything worth havin i’d just lose anyway
friends worried about me they’d asked if i was sick
thought i wouldn’t die at twentyfive or was it twentysix

chorus
those two years run together like whiskey over ice
meltin into memories like somebody elses life
i’m glad to say i’ve come around
but if i could have one wish
i’d like another try at twentyfive
or was it twentysix

verse 3
met a girl from georgia smart and pretty college grad
i thought my luck was changin but then it all went bad
i guess i fell in love with her all it took was just one kiss
but then she said goodbye at twentyfive or was it twentysix

those two years run together like whiskey over ice
meltin into memories like somebody elses life
i’m glad to say i’ve come around
but if i could have one wish
i’d like another try at twentyfive
or was it twentysix

verse 4
ive been down that road before almost as far as hell
deception or redemption i guess only time will tell
i have faith and the knowledge that god gave us a gift
i couldnt hide at twentyfive or was it twentysix

chorus
those two years run together like whiskey over ice
meltin into memories like somebody elses life
i’m glad to say i’ve come around
but if i could have one wish
i’d like another try at twentyfive
or was it twentysixembed"
