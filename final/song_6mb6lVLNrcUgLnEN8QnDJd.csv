ive been staring at the edge of the water
long as i can remember never really knowing why
i wish i could be the perfect daughter
but i come back to the water no matter how hard i try

prechorus
every turn i take every trail i track
every path i make every road leads back
to the place i know where i cannot go
where i long to be

chorus
see the line where the sky meets the sea it calls me
and no one knows how far it goes
if the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
one day ill know
if i go theres just no telling how far ill go

verse 2
i know everybody on this island seems so happy on this island
everything is by design
i know everybody on this island has a role on this island
so maybe i can roll with mine

prechorus
i can lead with pride i can make us strong
ill be satisfied if i play along
but the voice inside sings a different song
what is wrong with me

see the light as it shines on the sea its blinding
but no one knows how deep it goes
and it seems like its calling out to me so come find me
and let me know
whats beyond that line will i cross that line
see the line where the sky meets the sea it calls me
and no one knows how far it goes
if the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
one day ill know
how far ill go33embed"
