and all that but i be representin for the ladies and
we got somethin to say
weve been quiet too long
ladylike very patient
we aint get mad when prince had his ass out
we thought he was gonna turn around to the front
and have the front out too
but you know that didnt happen
we always had to deal with— with the guys
you know talkin about how they gon wear us out on records
and— and you know so i had to do records that was strictly
representin for my ladies and— and how to keep your man
keep his eyes from wandering looking around
and sex is not a topic that we should always sweep under the rug
im not sayin go out and do it but if you do
strap it up before you smack it up flip it slow it down oh no
