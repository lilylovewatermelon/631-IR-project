ive got the jitters from all this black coffee
and i wont eat and i wont sleep
ive been too addicted to this guitar
and gazing at the stars
no point of sleeping when life awake is a dream

these scared grounds are therapy to me
these sacred grounds mean the world to me

ive found what ive been looking for
in our underground town
if we could help our brothers and sisters to be free
wed be helping everyone out
ive been happy and ive been stoned
that ill never be alone
and i dont wanna be any place but here
cause home is here home is here

these scared grounds are therapy to me
these sacred grounds mean the world to me

joey johnny ricky and mr natural
whorhaigh ryan and jennifer glee and rainbow

and jodanna and christina deserie and marie
