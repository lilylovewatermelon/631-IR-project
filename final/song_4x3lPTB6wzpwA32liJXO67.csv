im your pole and all youre wearing is your shoes
you got soul you know what to do to turn me on until
i write a song about you
and you have your own engaging style
and youve got the knack to vivify
and you make my slacks a little tight you may unfasten them if you like
thats if you crash and spend the night
but you dont fold you dont fade
youve got everything you need especially me
sister youve got it all
you make the call to make my day
in your message say my name
your talk is all the talk sister youve got it all
curl your upper lip up and let me look around
ride your tongue along your bottom lip and bite down
and bend your back and ask those hips if i can touch
because theyre the perfect jumping off point of getting closer to your
butterfly
well you float on by
oh kiss me with your eyelashes tonight
or eskimo your nose real close to mine
and lets mood the lights and finally make it right
but you dont fold you dont fade youve got everything you need
especially me
