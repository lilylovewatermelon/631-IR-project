saw an old friend last night i hadnt seen in a couple years
stopped in a galatoires had a couple beers
and talked about the price of oysters the coach at lsu
and then like i knew it would the conversation turned to you

verse 2
he had to go and i looked at my watch it was 145
i headed down canal the quarter was comin alive
a man on the corner told me that jesus was comin soon
but i was lost in the music and the crowd
and the smell of cheap perfume

chorus
its not good for a a man to be alone but
a woman needs someone that that she can count on and i
i walked down by the river in the cold gray dawn
but love is like the mississippi when shes gone shes gone

verse 3
the line was long at cafe du monde so i walked out on the pier
i thought about the winds and turns mistakes that got me here
i might as well try to change the course that this old river takes
than go back in time when you were mine pretend its not late

chorus
its not good for a a man to be alone but
a woman needs someone that that she can count on and
what id give to go back but the currents just too strong
and love is like the mississippi when shes gone shes gone
see brooks  dunn liveget tickets as low as 30you might also likechorus
its not good for a a man to be alone but
a woman needs someone that that she can count on and
what id give to go back but the currents just too strong
and love is like the mississippi when shes gone shes gone
