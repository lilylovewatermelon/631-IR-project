my heart your hands gentle my friend
break me neatly numb me sweetly

chorus
say you would say you could
say youd come and stop the rain
say youd try and hold me tight
and you just give me away
make me high on lullabies
a melody for me to sway
say you would say you could
and you dont do anything

verse 2
come down heavy try and steady
precious ladies love you love me

chorus
say you would say you could
say youd come and stop the rain
say youd try and hold me tight
and you just give me away
make me high on lullabies
a melody for me to sway
say you would say you could
and you dont do anything

hold my head up to the lies that you feed me
ill fall under the spell you cast as you let me down

chorus
say you would say you could
say youd come and stop the rain
say youd try and hold me tight
and you just give me away
make me high on lullabies
a melody for me to sway
make me high on lullabies
a melody for me to sway
say you would say you could
say youd come and stop the rain
say youd try and hold me tight
and you just give me away
make me high on lullabies
a melody for me to sway
say you would say you could
and you dont do anything

outro
say youd come and stop the rain
say youd come and stop the rain
say youd come and stop the rain
say youd come and stop the rainembed"
