yo luca where you at
i think its too late
they be getting high i be livin high
bullets fly to the wind hit it to your top
but you dont listen to people who get high to

chorus
they be getting high ive been living high
i see my life flash in the corner of my eye
when you— when you wake up got to boot up with me got to match my high
rock chanel yeah chanene with the chrome heart on my eye
yeah yall gon rock marc jacobs im gon rock margelly
got a stomach ache i rub the hunnids on my belly
if you do me wrong don’t matter who you is bitch i’ll turn to mеlly
couple months ago was shipping za then shit got sticky shit got smelly
yеah canary yellow diamonds pissed on em like r kelly
this whole lifestyle aint cheap i wanna know who told you that
i be dead like a mummy i still wont go for that

verse
i bought the trackhawk just to see two hundred on the dash
did a lot of wrong inside my life but i dont have no regrets
i leveled up i bought the cayenne and bought the jet
i dont give no fucks bout what you talking bout im not impressed
and you still live at your mommys house id be depressed
you cant do shit on your own like i got to tell you to get dressed
you could choose to live like me and die or live like all the rest
i risked my life a million times for no accomplishments
i just wake up then get high then get to popping shit
you aint risk nothing at all you dont deserve to ball
you dont deserve pointers in the watch you deserve to trip and fall
i can end the things that let you watch the world with one call
couple exes couple haters know they waiting on me to fall
ill take every last season if i dont got legs then ima crawl
indepent than you and richer than all of yall
and my bizzy deserve the world waiting on you to call
i just ripped off all my chains i had to take it off
i dont got to say shit id rather not say at all
that lil bullshit yall be fakin you got say it all
this shit got you mad but you try to play it off
id rather lose every time than not play at all
didnt i tell you exactly how it was gon happen it paid off
do you want a bad bitch or long money thats the trade off
you might also likebridge
bullets fly to the wind now its time to see
i be dealin with my life like you should see
when i hit her from the side she be like yeah thats it
i rather die than be alive but i see at all
yo luca i think its too late
they be getting high i be livin high
bullets fly to the wind hit it to your top
but you dont listen to people who get high to

chorus
they been getting high ive been living high
i see my life flash in the corner of my eye
when you— when you wake up got to boot up with me got to match my high
