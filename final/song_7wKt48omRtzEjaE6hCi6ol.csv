this goes out to you and you and you
you know who you are

verse 1 mariah carey
when glory days turn to stormy nights
you must have been so petrified
— didnt you didnt you feel so cold
you against the world in a losing fight
captive of your demons inside
so you sought an enemy
— im not your enemy he lives in you you know its true
like times before to mock ignorantly
— but the lord said love your enemy so just
take heed to the word its time
check proverbs 1929 dont cry

chorus mariah carey
i wish you well i wish you well
i wish you well i wish you well
i wish you well

verse 2 mariah carey
i truly wanted solidarity
still wearing my blinders back then
— so much i didnt see
i weep for what i dreamed we all could be i still weep still weep still weep
ill keep you in prayer till the end oh still bruised
still bruised still walk on eggshells
same frightened child hide to protect myself
— cant believe i still need to protect myself from you
but you cant manipulate me like before no
examine 1 john 44

and i wish you well i wish you well
i wish you well i wish you well
i wish you well
— be strong in the lord and the power of his might

bridge mariah carey
if my shows of gratitude are minuscule
inside your mind sorry
im so sorry please forgive me
theres only so much i can do
i love you and i did all that i could
i did all that i could

verse 3 mariah carey
maybe when youre cursing me
you dont feel so incomplete
but weve all made mistakes
felt the guilt and selfhate
i know that youve been there for plenty
maybe still got love for me
but let him without sin cast the first stone brethren
but who remains standing then
not you not i see phillipians 49
— put it into practice and the god of peace
will be with you
chorus mariah carey
so i wish you well
i wish you well
i wish you well
— he who the son sets free is free indeed

outro mariah carey  bishop clarence keaton
no weapon formed against me
shall prosper
— what time im afraid i will trust in the lord
surely god is my salvation
i will trust and not be afraid
the lord the lord is my salvation
i will trust in him
yes i know that i know that i know that i know that i know that i know
but i have had gods help to this very day
and so i stand here and testify to small and great alike
so the more you curse me the more youre blessing me
the word said it
love your enemies
do good to those who curse you
pray for those who mistreat you
psalms 1292
they have greatly oppressed me from my youth
but they have not gained victory over me
— in jesus name
i wish you well
— he that keeps his mind state on the lord
— he will keep them in perfect peaceembed"
