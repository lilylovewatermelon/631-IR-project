im leaving behind this world
and all the things i am the things i am
im tearing away from it
because i know i can
im pushing away from you
and all the things you are the things you are
dont need the memory
i already wear the scars

prechorus
there is no yesterday yesterday
tomorrows far away

chorus
i i gave you everything
and in return you gave me nothing
show me a sign sign
please give me anything
i will not hide from whats inside of me
my nemesis

verse 2
im turning away from me
and all the things ive known the things ive known
i dont need your help no more
i can do this on my own
im taking all the blame
resent what ive become what ive become
i regret everything and
theres nowhere left to run
