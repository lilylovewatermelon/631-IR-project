well im changing all my strings
im gonna write another traveling song
about all the billion highways
and the cities at the break of dawn
well i guess the best that i can do now
is pretend that ive done nothing wrong
and to dream about a train thats gonna
take me back where i belong

verse 2
well now the ocean speaks and spits
and i can hear it from the interstate
and im screaming at my brother on a cell phone
he is far away
im saying nothing in the past or future
ever will feel like today
until were parking in an alley
just hoping that our shit is safe

chorus 1
so i go back and forth forever
all my thoughts they come in pairs
oh i will i wont i doubt i dont
im not surprised but i never feel quite prepared

now im hunched over a typewriter
i guess you call that painting in a cave
and theres a word i cant remember
and a feeling i cannot escape
and now my ashtrays overflowing
im still staring at a clean white page
oh and mornings at my window
she is sending me to bed again

verse 4
well i dream of dark on the horizon
i dream a desert where the dead lay down
i dream a prostituted child touching an old man
in a fast food crowd
oh yeah i dreamt a ship was sinking
there was people screaming all around
and i awoke to my alarm clock
it was a pop song it was playing loud

chorus 2
so i will find my fears and face them
or i will cower like a dog
i will kick and scream or kneel and plead
ill fight like hell to hide that ive given up7embed"
