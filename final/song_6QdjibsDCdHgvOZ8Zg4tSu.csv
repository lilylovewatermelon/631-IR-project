the year was getting on towards its end october november had gone december had come and brought with it a little snow and then a freeze and after that a thaw and some soft pleasant days that had in them a feeling of spring

it wasnt this mild weather a bit christmasy irene redfield was thinking as she turned out of seventh avenue into her own street she didnt like it to be warm and springy when it should have been cold and crisp or grey and cloudy as if snow was about to fall the weather like people ought to enter into the spirit of the season here the holidays were almost upon them and the streets through which she had come were streaked with rills of muddy water and the sun shone so warmly that children had taken off their hats and scarfs it was all as soft as like april as possible the kind of weather for easter certainly not for christmas

though she admitted reluctantly she herself didnt feel the proper christmas spirit this year either but that couldnt be helped it seemed any more than the weather she was weary and depressed and for all her trying she couldnt be free of that dull indefinite misery which with increasing tenaciousness had laid hold of her the mornings aimless wandering through the teeming harlem streets long after she had ordered the flowers which had been her excuse for setting out was but another effort to tear herself loose from it

she went up the cream stone steps into the house and down to the kitchen there were to be people in to tea but that she found after a few words with sadie and zulena need give her no concern she was thankful she didnt want to be bothered she went upstairs and took off her things and got into bed

she thought bother those people coming to tea

she thought if i could only be sure that at bottom its just brazil

she thought  whatever it is if i only knew what it was i could manage it

brian again unhappy restless withdrawn and she who had prided herself on knowing his moods their causes and their remedies had found it first unthinkable and then intolerable that this so like and yet so unlike those other spasmodic restlessness of his should be to her incomprehensible and elusive

he was restless and he was not restless he was discontented yet there were times when she felt he was possessed of some intense secret satisfaction like a cat who had stolen the cream he was irritable with the boys especially junior for ted who seemed to have an uncanny knowledge of his fathers periods of off moods kept out of his way when possible they got on his nerves drove him to violent outbursts of temper very different from his usual gently sarcastic remarks that constituted his idea of discipline for them on the other hand with her he was more than customarily considerate and abstemious and it had been weeks since she had felt the keen edge of his irony

he was like a man marking time waiting but what was he waiting for it was extraordinary that after all these years of accurate perception she now lacked the talent to discover what that appearance of waiting meant it was the knowledge that for all her watching all her patient study the reason for his humour still eluded her which filled her with foreboding dread that guarded reserve of his seemed to her unjust inconsiderate and alarming it was as if he had stepped out beyond her reach into some section strange and walled where she could not get at him
she closed her eyes thinking what a blessing it would be if she could get a little sleep before the boys came in from school she couldnt of course though she was so tired having had of late so many sleepless nights nights filled with questionings and premonitions

but she did sleep for several hours

she wakened to find brian standing at her bedside looking down at her an unfathomable expression in his eyes

she said i must have dropped off to sleep and watched a slender ghost of his old amused smile pass over his face

its getting on to four he told her meaning she knew that she was going to be late again

she fought back the quick answer that rose to her lips and said instead im getting right up it was good of you to think to call me she sat up

he bowed always the attentive husband you see

yes indeed thank goodness everythings ready

except you oh and clares downstairs

clare  what a nuisance  i didnt ask her purposely

i see might a mere man ask why or is the reason so subtly feminine that it wouldnt be understood by him

a little of his smile had come back

irene who was beginning to shake off some of her depression under his familiar banter said almost gaily not at all it just happens that this party happens to be for hugh and that hugh happens not to care a great deal for clare therefore i who happen to be giving the party didnt happen to ask her nothing could be simpler could it
nothing its so simple that i can easily see beyond your simple explanation and surmise that clare probably just never happened to pay hugh the admiring attention that he happens to consider no more than his just due simplest thing in the world

irene exclaimed in amazement why i thought you liked hugh  you dont you cant believe anything so idiotic

well hugh does think hes god you know

that irene declared getting out of bed is absolutely not true he thinks ever so much better of himself than that as you who know and have read him ought to be able to guess if you remember what a low opinion he has of god you wont make such a silly mistake

she went into the closet for her things and coming back hung her frock over the back of a chair and placed her shoes on the floor beside it then she sat down before her dressingtable

brian didnt speak he continued to stand beside the bed seeming to look at nothing in particular certainly not at her true his gaze was on her but in it there was some quality that made her feel that at that moment quality was no more to him than a pane of glass through which he stared at what she didnt know couldnt guess and this made her uncomfortable piqued her

she said it just happens that hugh prefers intelligent women

plainly he was startled dyou mean that you think clare is stupid he asked regarding her with lifted eyebrows which emphasized the disbelief of his voice

she wiped the cold cream from her face before she said no i dont she isnt stupid shes intelligent enough in a purely feminine way eighteenthcentury france would have been a marvellous setting for her or the old south if she hadnt made the mistake of being born a negro

i see intelligent enough to wear a tight bodice and keep bowing swains whispering compliments and retrieving dropped fans rather a pretty picture i take it though as slightly feline in its implication

well then all i can say is that you take it wrongly nobody admires clare more
than i do for the kind of intelligence she has as well as for her decorative qualities but shes not— she isnt— she hasnt— oh i cant explain it take bianca for example or to keep to the race felise freeland looks and brains real brains that can hold their own with  anybody clare has got brains of a sort the kind that are useful too acquisitive you know but shed bore a man like hugh to suicide still i never thought that even clare would come to a private party to which she hadnt been asked but its like her


for a minute there was silence she completed the bright red arch of her full lips brian moved towards the door his hand was on the knob he said im sorry irene its my fault entirely she seemed so hurt at being left out that i told her i was sure youd forgotten and to just come along
irene cried out but brian i—  and stopped amazed at the fierce anger that had blazed up in her

brians head came round with a jerk his brows lifted in an odd surprise

her voice she realized had gone queer but she had an instinctive feeling that it hadnt been the whole cause of his attitude and that little straightening motion of the shoulders hadnt it been like that of a man drawing himself up to receive a blow her fright was like a scarlet spear of terror leaping at her heart

clare kendry so that was it impossible it couldnt be

in the mirror before her she saw that he was still regarding her with that air of slight amazement she dropped her eyes to the jars and bottles on the table and began to fumble among them with hands whose fingers shook slightly

of course she said carefully im glad you did and in spite of my recent remarks clare does add to any party shes so easy on the eyes

when she looked again the surprise had gone from his face and the expectancy from his bearing

yes he agreed well i guess ill run along one of us ought to be down i spose

youre right one of us ought to she was surprised that it was in her normal tones she spoke caught as she was by the heart since that dull indefinite fear had grown suddenly into sharp panic ill be down before you know it she promised

all right but he still lingered youre quite certain you dont mind my asking her not awfully i mean i see now that i ought to have spoken to you trust women to have their reasons for everything

she made a little pretense at looking at him managed a tiny smile and turned away clare how sickening

yes dont they she said striving to keep her voice casual within her she felt a hardness from feeling not absent but repressed and that hardness was rising swelling why didnt he go why didnt he

he had opened the door at last you wont be long he asked admonished

she shook her head unable to speak for there was a choking in her throat and the confusion in her mind was like the beating of wings behind her she heard the gentle impact of the door as it closed behind him and knew that he had gone down to clare

for a long minute she sat in strained stiffness the face in the mirror vanished from her sight blotted out by this thing which had so suddenly flashed across her groping mind impossible for her to put it immediately into words or give it outline for prompted by some impulse of selfprotection she recoiled from exact expression

she closed her unseeing eyes and clenched her fists she tried not to cry but her lips tightened and no effort could check the hot tears of rage and shame that sprang into her eyes and flowed down her cheeks so she laid her face in her arms and wept silently

when she was sure that she had done crying she wiped away the warm remaining tears and got up after bathing her swollen face in cold refreshing water and carefully applying a stinging splash of toilet water she went back to the mirror and regarded herself gravely satisfied that there lingered no betraying evidence of weeping she dusted a little powder on her darkwhite face and again examined it carefully and with a kind of ridiculing contempt

i do think she confided to it that youve been something â€” oh very much— of a damned fool

downstairs the ritual of tea gave her some busy moments and that she decided was a blessing she wanted no empty spaces of time in which her mind would immediately return to that horror which she had not yet gathered sufficient courage to face pouring tea properly and nicely was an occupation that required a kind of wellbalanced attention

in the room beyond a clock chimed a single sound fifteen minutes past five oclock that was all  and yet in the short space of half an hour all of life had changed lost its colour its vividness its whole meaning no she reflected it wasnt that that had happened life about her apparently went on exactly as
before

oh mrs runyon  so nice to see you    two    really    how exciting    yes i think tuesdays all right   

yes life went on precisely as before it was only she that had changed knowing stumbling on this thing had changed her it was as if in a house long dim a match had been struck showing ghastly shapes where had been only blurred shadows

chatter chatter chatter someone asked her a question she glanced up with what she felt was a rigid smile

yes    brian picked it up last winter in haiti terribly weird isnt it  it is rather marvellous in its own hideous way   practically nothing i believe a few cents   

hideous a great weariness came over her even the small exertion of pouring golden tea into thin old cups seemed almost too much for her she went on pouring made repetitions of her smile answered questions manufactured conversation she thought i feel like the oldest person in the world with the longest stretch of life before me

josephine baker    no ive never seen her    well she might have been in shuffle along when i saw it but if she was i dont remember her    oh but youre wrong i  i do think ethel waters is awfully good 

there were the familiar little tinkling sounds of spoons striking against frail cups the soft running sounds of inconsequential talk punctuated now and then with laughter in irregular small groups disintegrating coalescing striking just the right note of disharmony disorder in the big room which irene had furnished with a sparingness that was almost chaste moved the guests with that slight familiarity that makes a party a success on the floor and the walls the sinking sun threw long fantastic shadows

so like many other teaparties she had had so unlike any of those others but she mustnt think yet time enough for that after all the time in the world she had a seconds flashing knowledge of what those words might portend time with brian time without him it was gone leaving in its place an almost uncontrollable impulse to laugh to scream to hurl things about she wanted suddenly to shock people to hurt them to make them notice her to be aware of her suffering

hello dave    felise    really your clothes are the despair of half the women in harlem    how do you do it   lovely is it worth or lanvin    oh a mere babani 

merely that felise freeland acknowledged come out of it irene whatever it is you look like the second gravedigger

thanks for the hint felise im not feeling quite up to par the weather i guess

buy yourself an expensive new frock child it always helps any time this child gets the blues it means money out of daves pocket howre those boys of yours

the boys for once shed forgotten them

they were she told felise very well felise mumbled something about that being awfully nice and said shed have to fly because for a wonder she saw mrs bellew sitting by herself and ive been trying to get her alone all afternoon i want her for a party isnt she stunning today

clare was irene couldnt remember ever having seen her look better she was wearing a superlatively simple cinnamonbrown frock which brought out all her vivid beauty and a little golden bowl of a hat around her neck hung a string of amber beads that would easily have made six or eight like one irene owned yes she was stunning

the ripple of talk flowed on the fire roared the shadows stretched longer

across the room was hugh he wasnt irene hoped being too bored he seemed as he always did a bit aloof a little amused and somewhat weary and as usual he was hovering before the bookshelves but he was not she noticed looking at the book he had taken down instead his dull amber eyes were held by something across the room they were a little scornful well hugh had never cared for clare kendry for a minute irene hesitated then turned her head though she knew what it was that held hughs gaze clare who had suddenly clouded all her days brian the father of ted and junior

clares ivory face was what it always was beautiful and caressing or maybe today a little masked unrevealing unaltered and undisturbed by any emotion within or without brians seemed to irene to be pitiably bare or was it too as it always was that halfeffaced seeking look did he always have that queer that now she didnt know couldnt recall then she saw him smile and the smile made his face all eager and shining impelled by some inner urge of loyalty to herself she glanced away but only for a moment and when she turned towards them again she thought that the look on his face was the most melancholy and yet the most scoffing that she had ever seen upon it

in the next quarter of an hour she promised herself to bianca wentworth in sixtysecond street jane tenant at seventh avenue and a hundred and fiftieth street and the dashields in brooklyn for dinner all on the same evening and at almost the same hour

oh well what did it matter she had no thoughts at all now and all she felt was a great fatigue before her tired eyes clare kendry was talking to dave freeland scraps of their conversation in clares husky voice floated over to her    always admired you so much about you long ago    everybody says so  no one but you    and more of the same the man hung rapt on her words though he was the husband of felise freeland and the author of novels that revealed a man of perception and a devastating irony and he fell for such pishposh and all because clare had a trick of sliding down ivory lids over astonishing black eyes and then lifting them suddenly and turning on a caressing smile men like dave freeland fell for it and brian

her mental and physical languor receded brian what did it mean how would it affect her and the boys the boys she had a surge of relief it ebbed vanished a feeling of absolute unimportance followed actually she didnt count she was to him only the mother of his sons that was all alone she was nothing rage boiled up in her

there was a slight crash on the floor at her feet lay the shattered cup dark stains dotted the bright rug spread the chatter stopped went on before her zulena gathered up the white fragments

as from a distance hugh wentworths dipt voice came to her though he was she was aware somehow miraculously at her side sorry he apologized must have pushed you clumsy of me dont tell me its priceless and irreplaceable

it hurt dear god how the thing hurt but she couldnt think of that now not with hugh sitting there mumbling apologies and lies the significance of his words the power of his discernment stirred in her a sense of caution her pride revolted damn hugh something would have to be done about him now she couldnt it seemed help his knowing it was too late for that but she could and would keep him from knowing that she knew she could she would bear it shed have to there were the boys her whole body went taut in that second she saw that she could bear anything but only if no one knew that she had anything to bear it hurt it frightened her but she could bear it

she turned to hugh shook her head raised innocent dark eyes to his concerned pale ones oh no she protested you didnt push me cross your heart hope to die and ill tell you how it happened

done

did you notice that cup well youre lucky it was the ugliest thing that your ancestors the charming confederates ever owned ive forgotten how many thousands of years ago it was that brians greatgreatgranduncle owned it but it has or had a good old hoary history it was brought north by way of the subway oh all right  be english if you want to and call it the underground what im coming to is the fact that ive never figured out a way of getting rid of it until about five minutes ago i had an inspiration i had only to break it and i was rid of it for ever so simple and id never thought of it before

hugh nodded and his frosty smile spread over his features had she convinced him

still she went on with a little laugh that didnt she was sure sound the least bit forced im perfectly willing for you to take the blame and admit that you pushed me at the wrong moment what are friends for if not to help bear our sins brian will certainly be told that it was your fault

more tea clare  i havent had a minute with you    yes it is a nice party   youll stay to dinner i hope    oh too bad    ill be alone with the boys    theyll be sorry brians got a medical meeting or something    nice frock youre wearing    thanks    well goodbye see you soon i hope

the clock chimed one two three four five six was it could it be only a little over an hour since she had come down to tea one little hour

must you go    goodbye    thank you so much  so nice to see you    yes wednesday    my love to madge    sorry but fm filled up for tuesday    oh really    yes   goodbye    goodbye   

it hurt it hurt like hell but it didnt matter if no one knew if everything could go on as before if the boys were safe

it did hurt

but it didnt matter


two

but it did matter it mattered more than anything had ever mattered before

what bitterness  that the one fear the one uncertainty that she had felt brians ache to go somewhere else should have dwindled to a childish triviality  and with it the quality of the courage and resolution with which she had met it from the visions and dangers which she now perceived she shrank away for them she had no remedy or courage desperately she tried to shut out the knowledge from which had risen this turmoil which she had no power to moderate or still within her and half succeeded

for she reasoned what was there what had there been to show that she was even half correct in her tormenting notion nothing she had seen nothing heard nothing she had no facts or proofs she was only making herself unutterably wretched by an unfounded suspicion it had been a case of looking for trouble
and finding it in good measure merely that

with this selfassurance that she had no real knowledge she redoubled her efforts to drive out of her mind the distressing thought of faiths broken and trusts betrayed which every mental vision of clare of brian brought with them she could not she would not go again through the tearing agony that lay just behind
her

she must she told herself be fair in all their married life she had had no slightest cause to suspect her husband of any infidelity of any serious flirtation even if—and she doubted it—he had had his hours of outside erratic conduct they were unknown to her why begin now to assume them and on nothing more concrete than an idea that had leapt into her mind because he had told her that he had invited a friend a friend of hers to a party in his own house and at a time when she had been it was likely more asleep than awake how could she without anything done or said or left undone or unsaid so easily believe him guilty how be so ready to renounce all confidence in the worth of their life together

and if perchance there were some small something—well what could it mean nothing there were the boys there was john bellew the thought of these three gave her some slight relief but she did not look the future in the face she wanted to feel nothing to think nothing simply to believe that it was all silly invention on her part yet she could not not quite

christmas with its unreality its hectic rush its false gaiety came and went irene was thankful for the confused unrest of the season its irksomeness its crowds its inane and insincere repetitions of genialities pushed between her and the contemplation of her growing unhappiness

she was thankful too for the continued absence of clare who john bellew having returned from a long stay in canada had withdrawn to that other life of hers remote and inaccessible but beating against the walled prison of irenes thoughts was the shunned fancy that though absent clare kendry was still present that she was close

brian too had withdrawn the house contained his outward self and his belongings he came and went with his usual noiseless irregularity he sat across from her at table he slept in his room next to hers at night but he was remote and inaccessible no use pretending that he was happy that things were the same as they had always been he wasnt and they werent however she assured herself it neednt necessarily be because of anything that involved clare it was it must be another manifestation of the old longing

but she did wish it were spring march so that clare would be sailing out of her life and brians though she had come almost to believe that there was nothing but generous friendship between those two she was very tired of clare kendry she wanted to be free of her and of her furtive comings and goings if something would only happen something that would make john bellew decide on an earlier departure or that would remove clare anything she didnt care what not even if it were that clares margery were ill or dying not even if bellew should discover”

she drew a quick sharp breath and for a long time sat staring down at the hands in her lap strange she had not before realized how easily she could put clare out of her life she had only to tell john bellew that his wife” no not that but if he should somehow learn of these harlem visits—why should she hesitate why spare clare

but she shrank away from the idea of telling that man clare kendrys white husband anything that would lead him to suspect that his wife was a negro nor could she write it or telephone it or tell it to someone else who would tell him

she was caught between two allegiances different yet the same herself her race race  the thing that bound and suffocated her whatever steps she took or if she took none at all something would be crushed a person or the race clare herself or the race or it might be all three nothing she imagined was
ever more completely sardonic

sitting alone in the quiet livingroom in the pleasant firelight irene redfield wished for the first time in her life that she had not been born a negro for the first time she suffered and rebelled because she was unable to disregard the burden of race it was she cried  silently enough to suffer as a woman an individual on ones own account without having to suffer for the race as well it was a brutality and undeserved surely no other people so cursed as hams dark children

nevertheless her weakness her shrinking her own inability to compass the thing did not prevent her from wishing fervently that in some way with which she had no concern john bellew would discover not that his wife had a touch of the tarbrush—irene didnt want that—but that she was spending all the time that he was out of the city in black harlem only that it would be enough to rid her forever of clare kendry


three

as if in answer to her wish the very next day irene came face to face with bellew

she had gone downtown with fellse freeland to shop the day was an exceptionally cold one with a strong wind that had whipped a dusky red into felises smooth golden cheeks and driven moisture into irenes soft brown eyes

clinging to each other with heads bent against the wind they turned out of the avenue into fiftyseventh street a sudden bluster flung them around the corner with unexpected quickness and they collided with a man

pardon irene begged laughingly and looked up into the face of clare kendrys husband

mrs redfield

his hat came off he held out his hand smiling genially

but the smile faded at once surprise incredulity and—was it understanding—passed over his features

he had irene knew become conscious of felise golden with curly black negro hair whose arm was still linked in her own she was sure now of the understanding in his face as he looked at her again and then back at felise and displeasure

he didnt however withdraw his outstretched hand not at once

but irene didnt take it instinctively in the first glance of recognition her face had become a mask now she turned on him a totally uncomprehending look a bit questioning seeing that he still stood with hand outstretched she gave him the cool appraising stare which she reserved for mashers and drew felise on

felise drawled aha been passing have you well ive queered that

yes im afraid you have

why irene redfield you sound as if you cared terribly im sorry

i do but not for the reason you think i dont believe ive ever gone native in my life except for the sake of convenience restaurants theatre tickets and things like that never socially i mean except once youve just passed the only person that ive ever met disguised as a white woman

awfully sorry be sure your sin will find you out and all that tell me about it

id like to it would amuse you but i cant

felises laughter was as languidly nonchalant as her cool voice can it possible that the honest irene has—oh do look at that coat there the red one isnt it a dream

irene was thinking i had my chance and didnt take it i had only to speak and to introduce him to felise with the casual remark that he was clares husband only that fool fool that instinctive loyalty to a race why couldnt she get free of it why should it include clare clare whod shown little enough consideration for her and hers what she felt was not so much resentment as a dull despair because she could not change herself in this respect could not separate individuals from the race herself from clare kendry

lets go home felise im so tired i could drop

why we havent done half the things we planned

i know but its too cold to be running all over town but you stay down if you want to

i think ill do that if you dont mind

and now another problem confronted irene she must tell clare of this meeting warn her but how she hadnt seen her for days writing and telephoning were equally unsafe and even if it was possible to get in touch with her what good would it do if bellew hadnt concluded that hed made a mistake if he was certain of her identity—and he was nobodys fool—telling clare wouldnt avert the results of the encounter besides it was too late whatever was in store for clare kendry had already overtaken her irene was conscious of a feeling relieved thankfulness at the thought that she was probably rid of clare and without having lifted a finger or uttered one word

but she did mean to tell brian about meeting john bellew

but that it seemed was impossible strange something held her back each time she was on the verge of saying i ran into clares husband on the street downtown today im sure he recognized me and felise was with me she failed to speak it sounded too much like the warning she wanted it to be not even in the presence of the boys at dinner could she make the bare statement

the evening dragged at last she said goodnight and went upstairs the words unsaid

she thought why didnt i tell him why didnt i if trouble comes from this ill never forgive myself ill tell him when he comes up

she took up a book but she could not read so oppressed was she by a nameless foreboding

what if bellew should divorce clare could he there was the rhinelander case but in france in paris such things were very easy if he divorced her—if clare were free—but of all the things that could happen that was the one she did not want she must get her mind away from that possibility she must

then came a thought which she tried to drive away if clare should die  then—oh it was vile to think yes to wish that she felt faint and sick but the thought stayed with her she could not get rid of it

she heard the outer door open close brian had gone out she turned her face into her pillow to cry but no tears came

she lay there awake thinking of things past of her courtship and marriage and juniors birth of the time they had bought the house in which they had lived so long and so happily of the time ted had passed his pneumonia crisis and they knew he would live and of other sweet painful memories that would never come again

above everything else she had wanted had striven to keep undisturbed the pleasant routine of her life and now clare kendry had come into it and with her the menace of impermanence

dear god she prayed make march come quickly

by and by she slept

chapter four

the next morning brought with it a snowstorm that lasted throughout the day

after a breakfast which had been eaten almost in silence and which she was relieved to have done with irene redfield lingered for a little while in the downstairs hall looking out at the soft flakes fluttering down she was watching them immediately fill some ugly irregular gaps left by the feet of hurrying pedestrians when zulena came to her saying the telephone mrs redfield its mrs bellew take the message zulena please though she continued to stare out of the window irene saw nothing now stabbed as she was by fear â€” and hope had anything happened between clare and bellew and if so what and was she to be freed at last from the aching anxiety of the past weeks or was there to be more and worse she had a wrestling moment in which it seemed that she must rush after zulena and hear for herself what it was that clare had to say but she waited

zulena when she came back said she says maam that shell be able to go to mrs freelands tonight shell be here some time between eight and nine

thank you zulena

the day dragged on to its end

at dinner brian spoke bitterly of a lynching that he had been reading about in the evening paper

dad why is it that they only lynch coloured people ted asked

because they hate em son

brian  irenes voice was a plea and a rebuke

ted said oh and why do they hate em

because they are afraid of them

but what makes them afraid of em

because—

brian

it seems son that is a subject we cant go into at the moment without distressing the ladies of our family he told the boy with mock seriousness but well take it up some time when were alone together

ted nodded in his engaging grave way i see maybe we can talk about it tomorrow on the way to school

thatll be line

brian

mother junior remarked thats the third time youve said brian like that

but not the last junior never you fear his father told him

after the boys had gone up to their own floor irene said suavely i do wish brian that you wouldnt talk about lynching before ted and junior it was really inexcusable for you to bring up a thing like that at dinner therell be time enough for them to learn about such horrible things when theyre older

youre absolutely wrong if as youre so determined theyve got to live in this damned country theyd better find out what sort of thing theyre up against as soon as possible the earlier they learn it the better prepared theyll be

i dont agree i want their childhood to be happy and as free from the knowledge of such things as it possibly can be

very laudable was brians sarcastic answer very laudable indeed all things considered but can it

certainly it can if youll only do your part

stuff  you know as well as i do irene that it cant what was the use of our trying to keep them from learning the word nigger and its connotation they found out didnt they and how because somebody called junior a dirty nigger

just the same youre not to talk to them about the race problem i wont have it

they glared at each other

i tell you irene theyve got to know these things and it might as well be now as later

they do not she insisted forcing back the tears of anger that were threatening to fall

brian growled  i cant understand how anybody as intelligent as you like to think you are can show evidences of such stupidity he looked at her in a puzzled harassed way

stupid she cried is it stupid to want my children to be happy her lips were quivering

at the expense of proper preparation for life and their future happiness yes and id feel i hadnt done my duty by them if i didnt give them some inkling of whats before them its the least i can do i wanted to get them out of this hellish place years ago you wouldnt let me i gave up the idea because you objected dont expect me to give up everything

under the lash of his words she was silent before any answer came to her he had turned and gone from the room

sitting there alone in the forsaken diningroom unconsciously pressing the hands lying in her lap tightly together she was seized by a convulsion of shivering for to her there had been something ominous in the scene that she had just had with her husband over and over in her mind his last words dont expect me to give up everything repeated themselves what had they meant what could they mean clare kendry

surely she was going mad with fear and suspicion she must not work herself up she must not  where were all the selfcontrol the common sense that she was so proud of now if ever was the time for it

clare would soon be there she must hurry or she would be late again and those two would wait for her downstairs together as they had done so often since that first time which now seemed so long ago had it been really only last october why she felt years not months older

drearily she rose from her chair and went upstairs to set about the business of dressing to go out when she would far rather have remained at home during the process she wondered for the hundredth time why she hadnt told brian about herself and fellse running into bellew the day before and for the hundredth time she turned away from acknowledging to herself the real reason for keeping back the information

when clare arrived radiant in a shining red gown irene had not finished dressing but her smile scarcely hesitated as she greeted her saying i always seem to keep c p time dont i we hardly expected you to be able to come felise will be pleased how nice you look

clare kissed a bare shoulder seeming not to notice a slight shrinking

i hadnt an idea in the world myself that id be able to make it but jack had to run down to philadelphia unexpectedly so here i am

irene looked up a flood of speech on her lips philadelphia thats not very far is it clare i—

she stopped one of her hands clutching the side of her stool the other lying clenched on the dressingtable why didnt she go on and tell clare about meeting bellew why couldnt she

but clare didnt notice the unfinished sentence she laughed and said lightly its far enough for me anywhere away from me is far enough im not particular

irene passed a hand over her eyes to shut out the accusing face in the glass before her with one corner of her mind she wondered how long she had looked like that drawn and haggard and â€” yes frightened or was it only imagination

clare she asked have you ever seriously thought what it would mean if he should find you out yes

oh you have and what youd do in that case

yes and having said it clare kendry smiled quickly a smile that came and went like a flash leaving untouched the gravity of her face

that smile and the quiet resolution of that one word yes filled irene with a primitive paralysing dread her hands were numb her feet like ice her heart like a stone weight even her tongue was like a heavy dying thing there were long spaces between the words as she asked and what should you do

clare who was sunk in a deep chair her eyes far away seemed wrapped in some pleasant impenetrable reflection to irene sitting expectantly upright it was an interminable time before she dragged herself back to the present to say calmly id do what i want to do more than anything else right now id come up here to live harlem i mean then id be able to do as i please when i please

irene leaned forward cold and tense and what about margery her voice was a strained whisper

margery clare repeated letting her eyes flutter over irenes concerned face just this rene if it wasnt for her id do it anyway shes all that holds me back but if jack finds out if our marriage is broken that lets me out doesnt it

her gentle resigned tone her air of innocent candour appeared to her listener spurious a conviction that the words were intended as a warning took possession of irene she remembered that clare kendry had always seemed to know what other people were thinking her compressed lips grew firm and obdurate well she wouldnt know this time

she said do go downstairs and talk to brian hes got a mad on

though she had determined that clare should not get at her thoughts and fears the words had sprung unthought of to her lips it was as if they had come from some outer layer of callousness that had no relation to her tortured heart and they had been she realized precisely the right words for her purpose

for as clare got up and went out she saw that that arrangement was as good as her first plan of keeping her waiting up there while she dressed—or better she would only have hindered and rasped her and what matter if those two spent one hour more or less alone together one or many now that everything had happened between them

ah  the first time that she had allowed herself to admit to herself that everything had happened had not forced herself to believe to hope that nothing irrevocable had been consummated  well it had happened she knew it and knew that she knew it

she was surprised that having thought the thought conceded the fact she was no more hurt cared no more than during her previous frenzied endeavours to escape it and this absence of acute unbearable pain seemed to her unjust as if she had been denied some exquisite solace of suffering which the full acknowledgment should have given her

was it perhaps that she had endured all that a woman could endure of tormenting humiliation and fear or was it that she lacked the capacity for the acme of suffering no no she denied fiercely im human like everybody else its just that rm so tired so worn out i cant feel any more but she did not really believe that

security was it just a word if not then was it only by the sacrifice of other things happiness love or some wild ecstasy that she had never known that it could be obtained and did too much striving too much faith in safety and permanence unfit one for these other things

irene didnt know couldnt decide though for a long time she sat questioning and trying to understand yet all the while in spite of her searchings and feeling of frustration she was aware that to her security was the most important and desired thing in life not for any of the others or for all of them would she exchange it she wanted only to be tranquil only unmolested to be allowed to direct for their own best good the lives of her sons and her husband

now that she had relieved herself of what was almost like a guilty knowledge admitted that which by some sixth sense she had long known she could again reach out for plans could think again of ways to keep brian by her side and in new york for she would not go to brazil she belonged in this land of rising towers she was an american she grew from this soil and she would not be uprooted not even because of clare kendry or a hundred clare kendrys

brian too belonged here his duty was to her and to his boys

strange that she couldnt now be sure that she had ever truly known love not even for brian he was her husband and the father of her sons but was he anything more had she ever wanted or tried for more  in that hour she thought not

nevertheless she meant to keep him her freshly painted lips narrowed to a thin straight line true she had left off trying to believe that he and clare loved and yet did not love but she still intended to hold fast to the outer shell of her marriage to keep her life fixed certain brought to the edge of distasteful reality her fastidious nature did not recoil

better far better to share him than to lose him completely oh she could close her eyes if need be she could bear it she could bear anything and there was march ahead march and the departure of clare

horribly clear she could now see the reason for her instinct to withhold—omit rather—her news of the encounter with bellew if clare was freed anything might happen

she paused in her dressing seeing with perfect clearness that dark truth which she had from that first october afternoon felt about clare kendry and of which clare herself had once warned her—that she got the things she wanted because she met the great condition of conquest sacrifice if she wanted brian clare wouldnt revolt from the lack of money or place it was as she had said only margery kept her from throwing all that away and if things were taken out of her hands—even if she was only alarmed only suspected that such a thing was about to occur anything might happen anything

no  at all costs clare was not to know of that meeting with bellew nor was brian it would only weaken her own power to keep him

they would never know from her that he was on his way to suspecting the truth about his wife and she would do anything risk anything to prevent him from finding out that truth how fortunate that she had obeyed her instinct and omitted to recognize bellew 

ever go up to the sixth floor clare brian asked as he stopped the car and got out to open the door for them

why of course  were on the seventeenth

i mean did you ever go up by niggerpower

thats good clare laughed ask rene my father was a janitor you know in the good old days before every ramshackle flat had its elevator but you cant mean weve got to walk up  not here 

yes here and fellse lives at the very top irene told her

what on earth for

i believe she claims it discourages the casual visitor

and shes probably right hard on herself though

brian said yes a bit but she says shed rather be dead than bored

oh a garden and how lovely with that undisturbed snow i

yes isnt it but keep to the walk with those foolish thin shoes you too irene

irene walked beside them on the cleared cement path that split the whiteness of the courtyard garden she felt a something in the air something that had been between those two and would be again it was like a live thing pressing against her in a quick furtive glance she saw clare clinging to brians other arm she was looking at him with that provocative upward glance of hers and his eyes were fastened on her face with what seemed to irene an expression of wistful eagerness

its this entrance i believe she informed them in quite her ordinary voice

mind brian told clare you dont fall by the wayside before the fourth floor they absolutely refuse to carry anyone up more than the last two flights

dont be silly irene snapped

the party began gaily

dave freeland was at his best brilliant crystal clear and sparkling felise too was amusing and not so sarcastic as usual because she liked the dozen or so guests that dotted the long untidy livingroom brian was witty though irene noted his remarks were somewhat more barbed than was customary even with him and there was ralph hazelton throwing nonsensical shining things into the pool of talk which the others even clare picked up and flung back with fresh adornment

only irene wasnt merry she sat almost silent smiling now and then that she might appear amused

whats the matter irene someone asked taken a vow never to laugh or something youre as sober as a judge

 no its simply that the rest of you are so clever that im speechless absolutely stunned

no wonder dave freeland remarked that youre on the verge of tears you havent a drink whatll you take

thanks if i must take something make it a glass of gingerale and three drops of scotch the scotch first please then the ice then the ginger ale

heavens dont attempt to mix that yourself dave darling have the butler in fellse mocked

yes do and the footman irene laughed a little then said it seems dreadfully warm in here mind if i open this window with that she pushed open one of the long casementwindows of which the freelands were so proud

it had stopped snowing some two or three hours back the moon was just rising and far behind the tall buildings a few stars were creeping out irene finished her cigarette and threw it out watching the tiny spark drop slowly down to the white ground below

someone in the room had turned on the phonograph or was it the radio she didnt know which she disliked more and nobody was listening to its blare the talking the laughter never for a minute ceased why must they have more noise

dave came with her drink you ought not he told her to stand there like that youll take cold come along and talk to me or listen to me gabble taking her arm he led her across the room they had just found seats when the doorbell rang and felise called over to him to go and answer it

in the next moment irene heard his voice in the hall carelessly polite your wife sorry im afraid youre wrong perhaps next—

then the roar of john bellews voice above all the other noises of the room im not wrong ive been to the redfields and i know shes with them youd better stand out of my way and save yourself trouble in the end

what is it dave felise ran out to the door

and so did brian irene heard him saying im redfield what the devils the matter with you

but bellew didnt heed him he pushed past them all into the room and strode towards clare they all looked at her as she got up from her chair backing a little from his approach

so youre a nigger a damned dirty nigger his voice was a snarl and a moan an expression of rage and of pain
everything was in confusion the men had sprung forward felise had leapt between them and bellew she said quickly careful youre the only white man here and the silver chill of her voice as well as her words was a warning
clare stood at the window as composed as if everyone were not staring at her in curiosity and wonder as if the whole structure of her life were not lying in fragments before her she seemed unaware of any danger or uncaring there was even a faint smile on her full red lips and in her shining eyes

it was that smile that maddened irene she ran across the room her terror tinged with ferocity and laid a hand on clares bare arm one thought possessed her she couldnt have clare kendry cast aside by bellew she couldnt have her free

before them stood john bellew speechless now in his hurt and anger beyond them the little huddle of other people and brian stepping out from among them

what happened next irene redfield never afterwards allowed herself to remember never clearly

one moment clare had been there a vital glowing thing like a flame of red and gold the next she was gone

there was a gasp of horror and above it a sound not quite human like a beast in agony nig my god nig

a frenzied rush of feet down long flights of stairs the slamming of distant doors voices

irene stayed behind she sat down and remained quite still staring at a ridiculous japanese print on the wall across the room

gone  the soft white face the bright hair the disturbing scarlet mouth the dreaming eyes the caressing smile the whole torturing loveliness that had been clare kendry that beauty that had torn at irenes placid life gone the mocking daring the gallantry of her pose the ringing bells of her laughter

irene wasnt sorry she was amazed incredulous almost

what would the others think that clare had fallen that she had deliberately leaned backward certainly one or the other not—

but she mustnt she warned herself think of that she was too tired and too shocked and indeed both were true she was utterly weary and she was violently staggered but her thoughts reeled on if only she could be as free of mental as she was of bodily vigour could only put from her memory the vision of her hand on clares arm 

it was an accident a terrible accident she muttered fiercely it was

people were coming up the stairs through the still open door their steps and talk sounded nearer nearer

quickly she stood up and went noiselessly into the bedroom and closed the door softly behind her

her thoughts raced ought she to have stayed should she go back out there to them but there would be questions she hadnt thought of them of afterwards of this she had thought of nothing in that sudden moment of action

it was cold icy chills ran up her spine and over her bare neck and shoulders

in the room outside there were voices dave freelands and others that she did not recognize

should she put on her coat felise had rushed down without any wrap so had all the others so had brian brian he mustnt take cold she took up his coat and left her own at the door she paused for a moment listening fearfully she heard nothing no voices no footsteps very slowly she opened the door the room was empty she went out

in the hall below she heard dimly the sound of feet going down the steps of a door being opened and closed and of voices far away

down down down she went brians great coat clutched in her shivering arms and trailing a little on each step behind her

what was she to say to them when at last she had finished going down those endless stairs she should have rushed out when they did what reason could she give for her dallying behind even she didnt know why she had done that and what else would she be asked there had been her hand reaching out towards clare what about that

in the midst of her wonderings and questionings came a thought so terrifying so horrible that she had had to grasp hold of the banister to save herself from pitching downwards a cold perspiration drenched her shaking body her breath came short in sharp and painful gasps

what if clare was not dead

she felt nauseated as much at the idea of the glorious body mutilated as from fear

how she managed to make the rest of the journey without fainting she never knew but at last she was down just at the bottom she came on the others surrounded by a little circle of strangers they were all speaking in whispers or in the awed discreetly lowered tones adapted to the presence of disaster in the first instant she wanted to turn and rush back up the way she had come then a calm desperation came over her she braced herself physically and mentally

heres irene now dave freeland announced and told her that having only just missed her they had concluded that she had fainted or something like that and were on the way to find out about her felise she saw was holding on to his arm all the insolent nonchalance gone out of her and the golden brown of her handsome face changed to a queer mauve colour

irene made no indication that she had heard freeland but went straight to brian his face looked aged and altered and his lips were purple and trembling she had a great longing to comfort him to charm away his suffering and horror but she was helpless having so completely lost control of his mind and heart

she stammered is she—is she—

it was felise who answered instantly we think

irene struggled against the sob of thankfulness that rose in her throat choked down it turned to a whimper like a hurt childs someone laid a hand on her shoulder in a soothing gesture brian wrapped his coat about her she began to cry rackingly her entire body heaving with convulsive sobs he made a slight perfunctory attempt to comfort her

there there irene you mustnt

youll make yourself sick shes— his voice broke suddenly

as from a long distance she heard ralph hazeltons voice saying i was looking right at her she just tumbled over and was gone before you could say jack robinson fainted i guess lord it was quick quickest thing i ever saw in all my life

its impossible i tell you i absolutely impossible 

it was brian who spoke in that frenzied hoarse voice which irene had never heard before her knees quaked under her

dave freeland said just a minute brian irene was there beside her lets hear what she has to say

she had a moment of stark craven fear 0h god she thought prayed help me

a strange man official and authoritative addressed her youre sure she fell her husband didnt give her a shove or anything like that as dr redfield seems to think

for the first time she was aware that bellew was not in the little group shivering in the small hallway what did that mean as she began to work it out in her numbed mind she was shaken with another hideous tremblingnot that oh not that

no no she protested im quite certain that he didnt i was there too as close as he was she just fell before anybody could stop her i—

her quaking knees gave way under her she moaned and sank down moaned again through the great heaviness that submerged and drowned her she was dimly conscious of strong arms lifting her up then everything was dark

centuries after she heard the strange man saying death by misadventure im inclined to believe lets go up and have another look at that windowembed"
