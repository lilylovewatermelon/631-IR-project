oooh oooh
dont make me call the police
oooh oooh
its a crime the way you bend them knees
from the table to the floor
spin it up and do it slow
give it up to all my niggas
on the corners spending dough like
game nothing but money to me
so sweet but you aint nothing but hunnies to me
shorty get you sexy there sipping on the cavasier
stylin up in the vip plannin to roll out with me
knowing that shes gonna come back
as if shes up on my reindeer
you know that shell never wanna come back
so i add her to my hall of fame here
bet your man cant do it like this tell the truth girl
bet your man cant do it like this its all on you girl

chorus

and put a puncture in your liver

let me be your teacher baby
girl cause you in the wrong class
