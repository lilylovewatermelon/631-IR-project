he who makes a beast out of himself
gets rid of the pain of being a man

verse 1
caught here in a fiery blaze wont lose my will to stay
i tried to drive all through the night
the heat stroke ridden weather the barren empty sights
no oasis here to see
the sand is singing deathless words to me

chorus
cant you help me as im starting to burn all alone
too many doses and im starting to get an attraction
my confidence is leaving me on my own all alone
no one can save me and you know i dont want the attention

verse 2
as i adjust to my new sights
the rarely tired lights will take me to new heights
my hand is on the trigger im ready to ignite
tomorrow might not make it but everythings all right
mental fiction follow me
show me what its like to be set free

chorus
cant you help me as im starting to burn all alone
too many doses and im starting to get an attraction
my confidence is leaving me on my own all alone
no one can save me and you know i dont want the attention

so sorry youre not here ive
been sane too long my visions so unclear
now take a trip with me but
dont be surprised when things arent what they seem

bridge
caught here in a fiery blaze wont lose my will to stay
these eyes wont see the same after i flip today

verse 3
sometimes i dont know why wed rather live than die
we look up towards the sky for answers to our lives
we may get some solutions but most just pass us by
dont want your absolution cause i cant make it right

hook
ill make a beast out of myself
gets rid of all the pain of being a man

chorus
cant you help me as im starting to burn all alone
too many doses and im starting to get an attraction
my confidence is leaving me on my own all alone
no one can save me and you know i dont want the attention

so sorry youre not here ive

outro
ive known it from the start all
these good ideas will tear your brain apart
scared but you can follow me im
too weird to live but much too rare to die23embed"
