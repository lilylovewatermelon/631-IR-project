my problem isnt that i miss you
cause i dont
my problem isnt that i kissed you whoa
i figured out
that youre nothing that i thought youre about
youre just caught in a place
that soon time will erase in my heart

chorus
youre my type of guy i guess
if i was stuck in east northumberland high for the rest of my life
but people change thank god i did
just because i liked you back then
it doesnt mean i like you now
just because i liked you back then
it doesnt mean i like you

verse 2
your problems not for lack of trying
cause you do
its just that youre at your best when youre lying whoaoh
now youre standing here
and saying things you think i wanted to hear
but youve got it all wrong ive already moved on my dear

youre my type of guy i guess
if i was stuck in east northumberland high for the rest of my life
but people change thank god i did
just because i liked you back then
it doesnt mean i like you now
just because i liked you back then
it doesnt mean i like you

bridge
when youre standing near me
i dont see so clearly
the feelings are still palpable
but when i take two steps away
it sheds some light on my day
yeah you cant go back its all in the past
guess you got to laugh at it

chorus
youre my type of guy i guess
if i was stuck in east northumberland high for the rest of my life
but people change thank god i did
and if theres some confusion
let me tell you youre just delusional get a clue
cause people change thank god i did
thank god i did
thank god i did
outro
just because i liked you back then
it doesnt mean i like you now
just because i liked you back then
it doesnt mean i like you doesnt mean i like you
just because i liked you back then
it doesnt mean i like you now
