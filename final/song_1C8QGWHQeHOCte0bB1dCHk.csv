its another night in hell another child wont live to tell
can you imagine what its like to starve to death
and as we sit free and well another soldier has to yell
tell my wife and children i love them in his last breath

chorus
come on now amen amen
amen amen

verse 2
habitual offenders scumbag lawyers with agendas
ill tell you sometimes people i dont know whats worse
natural disasters all these wolves in sheep clothes pastors
now god damn it im scared to send my children to church
and how can we seek salvation when our nations a race relations
got me feelin guilty of being white
but faith in human nature our creator and our savior
im no saint but i believe in what is right

chorus
come on now amen amen
i said amen amen

verse 3
stop pointin fingers and take some blame
pull your future away from the flame
open up your mind and start to live
stop shortchangin your neighbors
and livin off handouts and favors
and maybe give a little bit more than you got to give got to give
simplify testify identify rectify
and if i get high stop bein so uptight
its only human nature and i am not a stranger
so baby wont you stay with me tonight
and when it calls away theyll break a sign
im better now and i dont need someone
oh to be someone
here just sittin down and and holdin back
ill hold the door and wont and they dont say child
i wanna say yeah

verse 4
somewhere you got a brother sister friend grandmother niece or nephew
just dyin to be with you

so just hold on cause you know its true
and if you can take the pain
and you can withstand anything
and one day stand hand in hand with the truth

chorus

i said amen amen
and i said amen amen
