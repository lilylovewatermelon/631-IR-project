every time i look at you i fall in love
all over again
every time i think of you it all begins
all over again

prechorus
one little dream at night and i can dream all day
it only takes a memory to thrill me
one little kiss from you and i just fly away
pour me out your love until you fill me

chorus
i want to fall in love beginning from the start
all over again
show me how you stole away my heart
all over again
