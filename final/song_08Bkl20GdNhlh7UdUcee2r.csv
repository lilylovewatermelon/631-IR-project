i wanna be outrageous
but inside i know im plain
so plain

bridge
just plain
boring and plain

chorus
silently obsessed with death
just like anyone i guess
tryin for the perfect life
end up bein in denial

verse 2
i wanna be somebody
wanna be somebody like you
like you
like you

bridge
like you
instead of me

chorus
silently obsessed with death
just like anyone i guess
tryin for the perfect life
end up being in denialsee the strokes liveget tickets as low as 122you might also like5embed"
