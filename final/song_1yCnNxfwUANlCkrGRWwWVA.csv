i just want to lay next to you for a while
you look so beautiful tonight
your eyes are so lovely
your mouth is so sweet
a lot of people misunderstand me
thats because they dont know me at all
i just want to touch you
and hold you
i need you god i need you
i love you so much

verse 1 michael  siedah
each time the wind blows i hear your voice so i call your name
whispers at morning our love is dawning
heavens glad you came
you know how i feel this thing cant go wrong
im so proud to say i love you
your loves got me high i long to get by
this time is forever love is the answer
i hear your voice now you are my choice now
the love you bring
heavens in my heart at your call
i hear harps and angels sing
you know how i feel this thing cant go wrong
i cant live my life without you
i just cant hold on i feel we belong
my life aint worth living if i cant be with you
