floating on an ocean and confused
winds are whipping waves up like skyscrapers
and the harder they hit me the less i seem to bruise

and when i find the controls
ill go where i like
ill know where i want to be
but maybe for now
ill stay right here
on a silent sea
on a silent sea

i was happy in my harbour when you cut me loose
floating on an ocean and confused

and when i find the controls
ill go where i like
ill know where i want to be
but maybe for now
ill stay right here
on a silent sea
on a silent sea

ill stay right here
on a silent sea
on a silent sea

ill go where i like
ill know where i want to be
but maybe for now
ill stay right here
on a silent seaembed"
