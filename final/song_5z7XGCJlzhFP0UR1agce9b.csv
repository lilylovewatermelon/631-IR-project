this motivational idea to better self begins much before adulthood this drive need to or remove deficits to oneself originate in the unconscious can enter the conscious level and is an ongoing and back and forth process one way of understanding this motivation is called the ego ideal  not only do we seek out ways for selfimprovement but we also unconsciously  consciously seek out others to fulfill our perceived flaws we may have desires to become more protective outgoing tender loving socially refined wealthy altruistic fun exciting dangerous strong beautiful  handsome empathetic proactive sexual confident etc conquering and catching is also part of the deficit equation the ego ideal can fulfill those imperfections however our ego ideal sets the bar at unrealistic heights so that practically no one can attain this perfection even though we fall short time after time we still head down the same road einstein once said something to the effect that “making the same mistake over and over again and expecting a different result is insane” as this drive is often at the unconscious level our blinders illusions defense mechanisms and distortions interfere with reality

an individual might be initially drawn to another idealized object   in order to fulfill ego completion or ego improvement what’s apparently missing or absent this unknowing male is  drawn to  the idealized object  with some desired qualities that he lacks or that merges well with his personality characteristics  somewhat sometimes but not always  “opposites attract “ this often sets the stage for the beginning of romance during this initial phase there is typically a desire to possess and to unite or join as one the “i “merges and becomes a “we” or an “us  “the brilliant shakespeare in his romeo and juliet play addressed what is considered a significant part of usthe name it is the expression of the separated personality which now has no meaning juliet speaks
tis but thy name that is mine enemy
thou art myself though not a montague
o be some other name

shakespeare added further the idea of merging in this play merging can be considered a most tender form of taking possession of anotherit also encompasses the surrender of oneself while this is going on the individual thinks about the idealized object incessantly and cannot live without her the memory and idea of the person interferes with the ability to concentrate the anxiety and excitement builds with anticipation of future meetings the individual’s life is changed dramatically and he cannot help sharing this with others it’s as if she is now the center of his universe all sense of rational reason and control seem unimportant he becomes more impulsive driven it’s like a snowball going down the mountain becoming larger and larger no one can stop it further that love is about giving and the pleasure is being able to give to the other as opposed to receiving in romeo and juliet shakespeare has juliet saying
… as boundless as the sea
my love as deep the more i give thee
the more i have for both are infinite


this love becomes the fulfillment of one’s ego ideal but is not endless in duration on the one hand we initially experience admiration tenderness happiness infatuation and passion which is a necessary feeling of incipient love one difficulty is that the unconscious admiration of another’s qualities has a limited time duration and when it hits home consciously it begins to expose the others deficits when this occurs this can lead to discontent irritation jealousy hostility and even hatred so very often there is a dance or a battle that begin in the unconscious this is like a fight an encounter with the other and then a retreat it’s like pushpull tugofwar fight or flight the expression of hostility becomes merged with tenderness and as that dynamic becomes more conscious it plays out  we havelovers quarrels violent behaviors interrupting tenderness etc although this romantic love is not endless there is also no length of time that defines it

romantic love is on shaky ground when one individuals perception image fantasy of the object changes of the idealized object this process takes place as the components in the unconscious usually rise to the conscious level of awareness this conscious awareness soon leads to the individual seeing more clearly blemishes and flaws of the object  of course the blemishes and flaws were always there however now they are clearly seen and cannot be avoided even what was once perceived unconsciously as a strength or a positive now becomes a negative there is additional pulling away emotionally withdrawing affection expressing irritation and displeasure with the other –indifference while this is happening the ego ideal is greatly affected and so is romantic love and emotionally and behaviorally without affection and tenderness results in a relationship that is severely threatened once again we’re talking about perception and the change in perception and going from the depths of the unconscious to conscious levels of awareness of course the other in the equation also experiences and reacts to the changes of the other partner the perceptual and awareness changes that take  place between the two lovers   is like being on a rocky canoe in the middle the ocean it becomes very tipsy and goes from side to side can the canoe right itself to become stable it’s important to remember that changes in perception lead to consonant changes in thinking emotion and behavior

whether or not this signifies the end of the relationship with the idealized object is dependent upon numerous variables such as age emotional maturity previous relationships dependency socioeconomic and external factors as well as the ability to understand self and other and more importantly the resolution of the battle within the ego ideal and the idealized object requires an ending or a different beginning  the very same variables apply to the other person remember romantic love is not identical with mature love and if we were actually in touch with the depth of our unconscious we would have better clues as to our ego ideal idealized object and emotional potentialities of both players however that is not the case and mistakes are made    additional ideas’ about love and mature love dynamics to follow2embed"
