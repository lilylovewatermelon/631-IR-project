verse 1 jack met
its kinda funny how i paid for college
when youtube was an option
but then i wouldve had to spend
my best years
skipping ads and readin comments
and when the hell did advertisements get so good
theyre like narcotics
so now im spendin every penny i own
i should have allotted to finishing college

instrumental break

verse 2 jack met adam met  ryan met
its kinda funny how i keep debating
if someones shy or if they hate me
i feel like everyone i know right now
is hooking up and getting wasted without me
and maybe sex is overrated
but were too shy to ever say it say it
so we pretend were all amazing
its 3 am i should be sleeping sleeping

its kinda funny how you vote for someone

verse 4 jack met
isnt this obvious am i insane
lets blame our parents cause they taught us their ways
stay out of politics stay on the fence
stay out of all of it to keep half your fans
isnt this obvious am i insane
there might be two sides to everything that you say
its all a bit cloudy but theres one thing i know
that if youre fuckin racist then dont come to my show
no we have to do one more
