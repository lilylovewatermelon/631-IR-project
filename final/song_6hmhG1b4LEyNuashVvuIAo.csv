i used to be so happy but without you here i feel so low
i watched you as you left but i can never seem to let you go
cause once upon a time you were my everything
its clear to see that time hasnt changed a thing
its buried deep inside me but i feel theres somethin you should know

chorus zara larsson
i will never forget you
you will always be by my side
from the day that i met you
i knew that i would love you til the day i die
and i will never want much more
and in my heart i will always be sure
i will never forget you
and you will always be by my side til the day i die

verse 2 mnek
funny how we both end up here but everything seems so right
i wonder what would happen if we went back and put up a fight
cause once upon a time you were my everything
its clear to see that time hasnt changed a thing
so what in this world do you think could ever take you off my mind take you off my mind
