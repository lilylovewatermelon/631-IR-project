one night in a disco
chillin with my friends
feelin kind of low
i was sitting on a fence
suddenly i saw her
dancing on the scene
just like in a dream
she would set my heart on fire

chorus
i feel so high
dancing all night
you blow my mind
cause youre so fine

verse 2
she had such a swing
anyone could see
her body meaning things
that look so good to me
music got my head
spinning all around
she got me in a trance
just by the way she danced

dancing all night

cause youre so fine
i feel so high
dancing all night
you blow my mind
cause youre so fine
