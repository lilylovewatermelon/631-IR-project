so at my show on monday i was hoping someday
youd be on your way to better things
its not about your makeup or how you try to shape up
to these tiresome paper dreams
paper dreams honey
so now you pour your heart out youre telling me youre far out
not about to lie down for your cause
but you dont pull my strings
cause im a better man moving on to better things

chorus
well uhoh oh i love her because she moves in her own way
well uhoh oh she came to my show just to hear about my day

verse 2
and at the show on tuesday she was in her mindset
tempered furs and spangled boots
looks are deceiving make me believe it
and these tiresome paper dreams
paper dreams honey yeah
so wont you go far tell me youre a keeper
not about to lie down for your cause
and you dont pull my strings
cause im a better man moving on to better things

yes i wish that we never made it through all the summers
and kept them up instead of kicking us back down to the suburbs
