verse 1
bored stoned sittin in your basement
all alone cause your little conversations got around
and lookie what we all found out lookie what we found
lookie here we all found out that you have got a set of loose lips
twisting stories all because youre jealous
now i know exactly what youre all about what youre all about
this is what youre all about

chorus
girl youre such a backstabber ​stabber
youre such a backstabber
oh girl youre such a shittalker
and everybody knows it and everybody knows it
girl girl youre such a backstabber stabber
youre such a backstabber
run your mouth more than anyone ive ever known
and everybody knows it and everybody knows it
