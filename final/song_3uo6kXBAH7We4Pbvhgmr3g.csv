jesus said to them
 in his home town
among his relatives and in his own house
he is a prophet with no 
he could not do any  but just stare
and he was amazed at their lack of faith
people
where does a lack of fear come from

verse 1
huh i want it like hey girl gimme that
tryin to milk the game like my label made of similac
lyric bunks are similar to semi automatic paperback
flip through the pages watch bullets givin you heart attacks
i want the paper stacked keep my liquidity
blend out time inna different type of liberty
family proud of me so i dont need your validity
tongue change the ecosystem flood it with humidity
hot second guessing me is just stupidity
you dont have no credit much less any credibility
liar lie down youre just a liability
dont need them new friends with unpredictability
falsing on my business find a piss in your vicinity
konvict conquering your conscious facility
watch me prophesize for a piece of the profitability
doin this my only disabilititity
you might also likehook
i am an alien
im an illegal alien
im a rude boy with rude boy talk
im an alien
sometimes i feel like an alien
im a rude boy thats from t dot

verse 2
i approach my life with a certain sensibility
tell it like it is i dont cover with gentility
hand full of fam so we move with mobility
hand full of grands so there is no availability
livin with no sin is an impossibility
but dont let the good life cloud your visibility
lettin me in the game was an inevitability
dont follow them cats with no identity
kardinal steppin up on your territory
see me civil or wrestle you inside the cemetery
looking up dont believe in luck i believe in love
and you get stung if you stop me before my time done
associate of cannon the son of a big gun
african at heart when i do my bank run
my man chuck d said my uzi weighs a ton
heavy thoughts weigh nothing each one teach one
hook
i am an alien
im an illegal alien
im a rude boy with rude boy talk
im an alien
sometimes i feel like an alien
im a rude boy thats from t dot

verse 3
huh dangerous bustin every hater caught the vapors
i dont watch no face bredren lets get papers
i call it a fade kobe oh call it a taper
feelin like al capone goin on a caper
never would i harm a girl never even drape her
let my sister treat her like chris rock and shake her
mayday mayday mr morgan break her break her
we get money in an instant like shareholders of quaker
just a trouble joiner i am not a trouble maker
from the days of the real sweet love anita baker
id rather have a real home sittin on an acre
than owing about a hundred grand to my jewelry maker
kardinal call me the immigrant translator
or the poor peoples permanent position vindicator
kardinal call me the immigrant translator
or the poor peoples permanent position vindicator

i am an alien
im an illegal alien
im a rude boy with rude boy talk

sometimes i feel like an alien
im a rude boy thats from t dotembed"
