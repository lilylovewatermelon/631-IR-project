i know you think i think too much
but i dont know if its enough
dirty love all i want are your eyes on mine
and underneath of it all
i dream of our fall six shooters
hallelujahs arent able to save us

chorus
but did i ever want love
or did i ask too much
young dirty love come get us drunk
lets cover up what we really want

verse 2
and all you see and all you feel
are skin and bones they dont hold the soul like real love
no you cant control who you really are or what you really want
so i met you in the hotel dim lit lobby
iâ€™ve been on the road since you last saw me
and i dont need a reason to bleed until were even

chorus
but did i ever want love
or did i ask too much
young dirty love come get us drunk
lets cover up what we really want
see mt joy liveget tickets as low as 35you might also likeoutro
oh is it any wonder our love
isnt what we thought it was
is it any wonder our love
isnt what we thought it was
is it any wonder oh lord
is it any wonder our love
isnt what we thought it was
when all we do is hurt ourselves3embed"
