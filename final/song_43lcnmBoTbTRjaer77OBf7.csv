raise high monolithic statues so fragile as they fall
i am ever enthralled
gaze lie and smirk in time your arrogance will suit you well
til fashion is dispelled

prechorus
as waves of plastic fame go out of fashion
youre going out going out forever unknown
these waves of plastic fame go out of fashion
these waves of plastic fame are drying up and i smile
youre going out going out
because youre dying to become forever unknown unknown

chorus
from above a rain of ashes descends
like anathema i will remain forever will remain
from below in my seclusion
look up to the sky to see paper wings and watch them burn

verse 2

no life but nothings died
no lights but quite the show

all motion is pantomime

as waves of plastic fame go out of fashion
youre going out going out forever unknown
these waves of plastic fame go out of fashion
these waves of plastic fame are drying up and i smile
youre going out going out
because youre dying to become forever unknown unknown

chorus
from above a rain of ashes descends
like anathema i will remain forever will remain
from below in my seclusion
look up to the sky to see paper wings and watch them burn

bridge
dancing in the rain of descending ash
dancing on your grave ill see you all falling
dancing in the rain of descending ash
dancing in your dust ill see you all falling

bridge 2
id stop it had you a heart your heart
id stop it had you a heart your heart

chorus
from above a rain of ashes descends
like anathema i will remain forever will remain
from below in my seclusion
look up to the sky to see paper wings and watch them burn
from above a rain of ashes descends
like anathema i will remain forever will remain
from below in my seclusion
look up to the sky to see paper wings and watch them burnembed"
