branded
scorned is the one who ran
what do you do when your branded and you know youre a man
wherever you go for the rest of your life
you must prove youre a man

verse 1 busta rhymes
see now im back wit the force read about the kid
from the front to the back of the source
you see me back on the course
scream on every beat untill my voice get crackled and horse
front seat niggas never sit in the back wit a boss
fuck the fact that it cost the pricetag of the porche
will cost ya life have ya motha feel an immaculate loss
breath but of course come and speak to the best
and watch me spit a jewel sharper to carve the meat of your flesh
you lookin weak in the chest you see the street is a test
women on the stoop smokin holdin a seed to they breast
you see the street is a mess
strugglin holdin a couple pounds of weed then the rest
now i proceed to the rest of my niggas keepin it fresh
though we must stay on the grind i supersceded the stress
we always seem to finesse from the east to the west
you know we wwwe keep the teflon from the street to the vest
kill that nigga slow like how you get defeated in chess
got you under pressurehairline receaded effects
hot air niggas i only feel the heat from your breath
rap niggas beef in they album probably needed the press
and as a man i never found the slightest need to impress
another man because im proud and i believe that im blessed
but yo i always found the need to adress these weaker niggas
that speak to the street always keepin the people abreast

verse 2 busta rhymes
higher science and im changin the crime in
watch my son cuz youd be fuckin wit the child of a giant
im in a place stuck between bein lovin and violent voice switch
becomin more of a threat when i move subtle and silent
then set it off to be the only one to quiet the riot
my destinys the only thing between the sky and the pilot
relate its like bustin a 38
be late i be takin most of the brick leavin a pile outta shape
i never quit watchin these niggas try to hide they mistake
takin a shit watchin they body floatin by in the lake
make it quick you weak niggas better try to escape
and create the quickest way to reach the fire escape
snitch niggas always quick to go and lie on a tape
but its ok cuz super hero niggas die wit a cape
its so great to watch them finally break stand aside from the fake
street niggas gotta slide for the take
bein broke and not bein able to buy me a steak
stackin my paper so see now i can buy an estate
so i rely on the love and i reply to the hate
so much pain in the struggle my whole bodyll achecome on
from the gates so awake that was the plan of my fate
now im straightgot me my own knife and fork on my plate
wanna scorch a debate waitdo me a favor nigga jus remember
