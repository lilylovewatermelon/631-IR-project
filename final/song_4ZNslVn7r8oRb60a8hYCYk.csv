cheap boat six pack of some light
a fireball burning up a blue sky
mercury 93 wasnt even half past noon
our first taste of freedom after high school
breaking hearts and curfews and mama’s rules
i just laugh thinking ’bout all the shit we got into
yeah those were the days we thought wed never lose

chorus
but we did
and we miss
how it was when we were just kids
looking back
on the past
wasn’t much but its what we had
just a couple buds and a good buzz thats all it was
but thats what memories are made of

verse 2
its been so long since me and katie first met
we lost touch as all of the years went flying past fading fast
wishing i could make her mine
theres some things that seem to take you right back
i see her face every time i hear that
lynyrd skynyrd bottle spin
im in her arms in my mind
yeah those were the days we thought wed never lose never lose
see luke combs liveget tickets as low as 33you might also likechorus
but we did
and we miss
how it was when we were just kids
looking back
on the past
wasn’t much but its what we had
just a good buzz from a summer love was all it was
yeah thats what memories are made of

bridge
yeah those were the days we thought wed never lose

chorus
but we did
and we miss
how it was when we were just kids
looking back
on the past
wasn’t much but its what we had
just a couple buds and a good buzz thats all it was
yeah a summer love was all it was
yeah thats what memories are made ofembed"
