im always gonna be part of the game
i vibe with it im nothin like them other lames
ive got so much shit inside of me ay ay ay
theres so much in stored for me its time to shape out my own reality
im acsendin to legend status theres just no stoppin me
im not a one hit wonder theres just no one like me
devoted my life to this shit no one does it better than me
i dont need autotune for my voice its just not for me
rеspect to the fallen goat rеst in peace nipsey
im tryna prove its ok to beleive im goin forward even if the legends dont notice me
i dont got shit to prove the only one i need to prove  is only to me
findin beats for my vision this is new vybez three
im gonna go harder than ever this shit just seems to fit me
givin recognition to my favorite rappers here are my top 3
roddy ricch lil baby and polo g
theyre my biggest inspiration the influencers that shaped me
im tryna inspire greatness so the next generation can be free
broken hearted to the soul there is no gold rose
got me mentally unstable but thats just how life goes
embracin my better side known as alex snow
things are crystal clear i just had to go with the flow
fightin for my dream  doin everythin that i know
fightin a nigga whos stalkin his girlfriends cellphone
got me feelin uneasy glad im alone
less shit to deal with cant forger that so
so its time to better myself i need more time to roam
ive been rappin since i was 17 so much time has gone
im at war with my emotions they seemed to be all over the place
but i always seem to get through it so i know its somethin i can face
im still losin sleep im cryin over this deep pain
im done with the games let the blood cloud rain
im bleedin so hard that its drivin me insane
insane cause i have no control and no longer in my lane
got toxins inside my body got me feelin like bane
im covered in a mask feelin rich like bruce wayne
instead of focusin on what i lost i need to focus on what i gain
im gonna clean up my flow and forget about the fame
theres unmarked potential i can feel it corsin through my veins
i got a few tricks under me make a move im ready for cardplay
im always gonna go off im the master of my fateyou might also likeembed"
