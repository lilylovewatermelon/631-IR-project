you know gettin money becomin a young millionaire
you can lose sight of the things that is important to you
id never trade my old girl for all the money in the world
id never trade my daughter toy for all the money in the world
id never trade my only boy for all the money in the world
i put my last name first

verse 1 rick ross
i can hear my daddy sayin lil nigga go get em
passed in 99 cancer all in his liver
shit different since we last spoke his sons a lil richer
id never rap again if i could tell him that i miss him
why the fuck i own the world when i cant share it with him
bust his ass his whole life just want to break bread with him
cryin in my mansion as im holdin on his picture
its a cold and lonely world im flyin solo on you niggas
bein the only boy definition of a man
all the money in the world still not a big enough advance
still all the money in the world still not big enough advance
for me to turn my back on me bein the man that i am

momma gettin older feelin pains in her shoulder
i gotta stay focused and remain her little soldier
brace a few wishfuls and the streets begin the whisper
prayin for you niggas still stockin up my pistols
lil nigga gettin murdered and buried in allwhite
eighth grade school yall figure thats alright
tryna figure out where im goin with my life
as im steppin on the brake and hangin a sharp right
did my thing in the streets seen in the streets
see me at the park on the swing with my niece
watch chipped up still wont switch up
first time singin so you gotta turn that bitch up

hook rick ross  raphael saadiq

verse 3 raphael saadiq
oh man when i close my eyes
i can see you about a million times
its true over and over over and over
yeah but then again it kinda makes me laugh
cause youre the one that put me on this path
i guess i gotta keep rollin strong
i feel i cant go wrong
cause i can hear you walkin with me
i can hear you talkin to me
i know you hear them sayin lala la la la lala
come on now
