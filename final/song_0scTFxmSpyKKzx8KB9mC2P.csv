verse 1
i just parked the rental be patient im on my way now
backyard at grandma house with my cousins that was my playground
shawty zipped em then he flooded the scene still aint no face found
mike amiri denim my jeans facetime a jake called
switch the diamonds out the jacob
one mistake thats what erased him
switch out the diamonds change my placement
i see me a bigger payment
shell cases bought a casement
dirty choppers come in cases
catch me foottofoot i talk jamaican
but i think that they fakin
watch the streets and argue with my ho she can pack her shit and go
i can spend my money on more lawyers for to win in court
pull up get the bag then go
aint no time to kick it
im not laughin with these fake niggas
bitch get you some business
stand on business we tote semis it go blatt
stop at dealers get me a new hat

verse 2
why you keep that pole like a shotter i dont know

set up work and do damage
drive to work and this could work if you do not do no panickin
dope be white morgan hamilton

when its nightfall dogs out hitters out you know that its time
ill be hustlin til they take me out to the other side
they plenty trouble i be thuggin i dont even know why
come from the gutter where the pastor they be tellin you lies4embed"
