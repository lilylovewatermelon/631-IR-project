just waking up in the morning
and to be well
quite honest with ya
i aint really sleep well
ya ever feel like your train of thoughts been derailed
thats when you press on  lee nails
half the populations just waitin to see me fail
yeah right youre better off trying to freeze hell
some of us do it for the females
and others do it for the retail

but i do it for the kids life threw the towel in on
everytime you fall its only making your chin strong
and ill be in your corner like mick baby til the end
or when you hear a song from that big lady

bridge
until the referee rings the bell
until both your eyes start to swell
until the crowd goes home
what we gonna do yall

chorus  ryan tedder
give em hell turn their heads
gonna live life til were dead
give me scars give me pain
then theyll say to me say to me say to me
there goes the fighter there goes the fighter
here comes the fighter
thats what theyll say to me say to me say to me
this ones a fighter
you might also likeverse 2
and if i can last thirty rounds
theres no reason you should ever have your head down
six foot five two hundred and twenty pounds
hailing from rock bottom loserville nothing town

text book version of a kid going nowhere fast
and now im yelling kiss my ass
its gonna take a couple right hooks a few left jabs
for you to recognize you really aint got it bad

bridge
until the referee rings the bell
until both your eyes start to swell
until the crowd goes home
what we gonna do yall

chorus  ryan tedder
give em hell turn their heads
gonna live life til were dead
give me scars give me pain
then theyll say to me say to me say to me
there goes the fighter there goes the fighter
here comes the fighter
thats what theyll say to me say to me say to me
this ones a fighter
everybody put yo hands up
what we gonna do x6 yall

if you fall pick yourself up off the floor get up
and when your bones cant take no more cmon
just remember what youre here for
cause i know imma damn sure

give em hell turn their heads
gonna live life til were dead
give me scars give me pain
then theyll say to me say to me say to me
there goes the fighter there goes the fighter
here comes the fighter
thats what theyll say to me say to me say to me
this ones a fighter

til the referee rings the bell
til both ya eyes start to swell
til the crowd goes home
what we gonna do kidembed"
