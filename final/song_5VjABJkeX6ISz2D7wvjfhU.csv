i aint gonna lie girl
i know sometimes i can be crazy
but i can see it in your eyes
im the only guy thats driving you wild so wild
call it what you wanna but you know i wanna call you my lady
all this on and off and on again
and i wish you would make up your mind
cause its time

chorus
and im tired of playing these games
yeah you say that its over
and then you tell me come over
its like fire and then its like rain
yeah were hot and were colder
you get me drunk and then sober
tell me its on if you want it to be
if youre moving on then i think you should leave
im tired of playing these games so i wont
baby love me or dont

verse 2
i could keep your little red dress that you left on the floor girl
hang it in the closet cause i know youre gonna want it next time next time
you can come here and kiss me or walk out the door
i can hold you for good girl or not anymore
