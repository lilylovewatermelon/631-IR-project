watch them all lie down
watch the eyeless gain control
gain control
they could never blind me
chorus
i clench the fist and overtake it all
i navigate the endless rise and fall
you push my back against the wall
when i attack im taking all
im taking it all
rise and fall
verse 2
one more fits inside the mold
one last chance to break the hold
break the hold
chorus
i clench the fist and overtake it all
i navigate the endless rise and fall
you push my back against the wall
when i attack im taking all
taking it all
rise and fall

i clench the fist and overtake it all

you push my back against the wall
when i attack im taking all
im taking it all
