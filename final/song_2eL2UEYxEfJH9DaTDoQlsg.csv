it reflects against a can wet with condensation
his baby left
she’s going back to school again
and learning fifty ways to kill the conversation
cause if you can’t be good
you drink in the name of art
and as the sun sets on sunset again
the stars come out so it don’t get dark
on the king of echo park

the king of echo park

now she’s playing pool
at the little joy
just a little drunk
she sees her little boy
and as they smoked outside
she wondered how long she’d have to wait
until it wouldn’t be too soon
to take him back to her place
cause if you can’t go home cant go home
if you cant go home cant go home
with the one you love
you go home with someone
and it’s never too soon
and it’s never too late
cause when you’re royalty babe
you never have to work
and he’s the king of echo park
you might also likethe king of echo park

now he’s walking home
in the very same clothes
as the night before
except youd never know
and all the girls he’s bagged
they just can’t stay mad
they just wave their hands at no ordinary jerk

but who’s afraid of a little cliché
as he sipped iced tea in the palm tree shade
and as he looked around and everything was right
but as he closed his eyes he dreamt he was in new york
the king of echo park
