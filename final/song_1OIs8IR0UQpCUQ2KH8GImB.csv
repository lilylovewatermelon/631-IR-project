hitherto in our interpretation of dreams we have come upon the element of absurdity in the dreamcontent so frequently that we must no longer postpone the investigation of its cause and its meaning we remember of course that the absurdity of dreams has furnished the opponents of dreaminterpretation with their chief argument for regarding the dream as merely the meaningless product of an attenuated and fragmentary activity of the psyche

i will begin with a few examples in which the absurdity of the dreamcontent is apparent only disappearing when the dream is more thoroughly examined these are certain dreams which  accidently sic one begins by thinking  are concerned with the dreamers dead father

1 here is the dream of a patient who had lost his father six years before the date of the dream

his father had been involved in a terrible accident he was travelling by the night express when the train was derailed the seats were telescoped and his head was crushed from side to side the dreamer sees him lying on his bed from his left eyebrow a wound runs vertically upwards the dreamer is surprised that his father should have met with an accident since he is dead already as the dreamer adds in relating his dream his fathers eyes are so clear

according to the prevailing standards of dreamcriticism this dreamcontent would be explained as follows at first while the dreamer is picturing his fathers accident he has forgotten that his father has already been many years in his grave in the course of the dream this memory awakens so that he is surprised at his own dream even while he is dreaming it analysis however tells us that it is quite superfluous to seek for such explanations the dreamer had commissioned a sculptor to make a bust of his father and he had inspected the bust two days before the dream it is this which seems to him to have come to grief the german word means gone wrong or met with an accident the sculptor has never seen his father and has had to work from photographs on the very day before the dream the son had sent an old family servant to the studio in order to see whether he too would pass the some judgment upon the marble bust namely that it was too narrow between the temples and now follows the memory material which has contributed to the formation of the dream the dreamers father had a habit whenever he was harassed by business cares or domestic difficulties of pressing his temples between his hands as though his head was growing too large and be was trying to compress it when the dreamer was four years old he was present when a pistol was accidentally discharged and his fathers eyes were blackened his eyes are so clear when his father was thoughtful or depressed he had a deep furrow in his forehead just where the dream shows his wound the fact that in the dream this wrinkle is replaced by a wound points to the second occasion for the dream the dreamer had taken a photograph of his little daughter the plate had fallen from his hand and when he picked it up it revealed a crack which ran like a vertical furrow across the childs forehead extending as far as the eyebrow he could not help feeling a superstitious foreboding for on the day before his mothers death the negative of her portrait had been cracked

thus the absurdity of this dream is simply the result of a carelessness of verbal expression which does not distinguish between the bust or the photograph and the original we are all accustomed to making remarks like dont you think its exactly your father the appearance of absurdity in this dream might of course have been easily avoided if it were permissible to form an opinion on the strength of a single case one might be tempted to say that this semblance of absurdity is admitted or even desired

ii

here is another example of the same kind from my own dreams i lost my father in the year 1896

after his death my father has played a part in the political life of the magyars and has united them into a political whole and here i see indistinctly a little picture a number of men as though in the reichstag a man is standing on one or two chairs there are others round about him i remember that on his deathbed he looked so like garibaldi and i am glad that this promise has really come true

certainly this is absurd enough it was dreamed at the time when the hungarians were in a state of anarchy owing to parliamentary obstruction and were passing through the crisis from which koloman szell subsequently delivered them the trivial circumstance that the scenes beheld in dreams consist of such little pictures is not without significance for the elucidation of this element the customary visual dreamrepresentations of our thoughts present images that impress us as being lifesize my dreampicture however is the reproduction of a woodcut inserted in the text of an illustrated history of austria representing maria theresa in the reichstag of pressburg the famous scene of moriamur pro rege nostro82 like maria theresa my father in my dream is surrounded by the multitude but he is standing on one or two chairs stuhlen and is thus like a stuhlrichter presiding judge he has united them here the intermediary is the phrase we shall need no judge those of us who stood about my fathers deathbed did actually notice that he looked very like garibaldi he had a postmortem rise of temperature his cheeks shone redder and redder involuntarily we continue and behind him in unsubstantial radiance lay that which subdues us all the common fate

this uplifting of our thoughts prepares us for the fact that we shall have to deal with this common fate the postmortem rise in temperature corresponds to the words after his death in the dream content the most agonizing of his afflictions had been a complete paralysis of the intestines obstruction during the last few weeks of his life all sorts of disrespectful thoughts associate themselves with this one of my contemporaries who lost his father while still at the gymnasium upon which occasion i was profoundly moved and tendered him my friendship once told me derisively of the distress of a relative whose father had died in the street and had been brought home when it appeared upon undressing the corpse that at the moment of death or post mortem an evacuation of the bowels stuhlentleerung had taken place the daughter was deeply distressed by this circumstance because this ugly detail would inevitably spoil her memory of her father we have now penetrated to the wish that is embodied in this dream to stand after ones death before ones children great and undefiled who would not wish that what now has become of the absurdity of this dream the appearance of absurdity was due only to the fact that a perfectly permissible figure of speech in which we are accustomed to ignore any absurdity that may exist as between its components has been faithfully represented in the dream here again we can hardly deny that the appearance of absurdity is desired and has been purposely produced

the frequency with which dead persons appear in our dreams as living and active and associating with us has evoked undue astonishment and some curious explanations which afford conspicuous proof of our misunderstanding of dreams and yet the explanation of these dreams is close at hand how often it happens that we say to ourselves if my father were still alive what would he say to this the dream can express this if in no other way than by his presence in a definite situation thus for instance a young man whose grandfather has left him a great inheritance dreams that the old man is alive and calls his grandson to account reproaching him for his lavish expenditure what we regard as an objection to the dream on account of our better knowledge that the man is already dead is in reality the consoling thought that the dead man does not need to learn the truth or satisfaction over the fact that he can no longer have a say in the matter
another form of absurdity found in dreams of deceased relatives does not express scorn and derision it serves to express the extremest repudiation the representation of a suppressed thought which one would like to believe the very last thing one would think of dreams of this kind appear to be capable of solution only if we remember that a dream makes no distinction between desire and reality for example a man who nursed his father during his last illness and who felt his death very keenly dreamed some time afterwards the following senseless dream his father was again living and conversing with him as usual but and this was the remarkable thing he had nevertheless died though he did not know it this dream is intelligible if after he had nevertheless died we insert in consequence of the dreamers wish and if after but he did not know it we add that the dreamer had entertained this wish while nursing him the son had often wished that his father was dead that is he had had the really compassionate thought that it would be a good thing if death would at last put an end to his sufferings while he was mourning his fathers death even this compassionate wish became an unconscious reproach as though it had really contributed to shorten the sick mans life by the awakening of the earliest infantile feelings against his father it became possible to express this reproach as a dream and it was precisely because of the extreme antithesis between the dreaminstigator and the day thoughts that this dream had to assume so absurd a form83

as a general thing the dreams of a deceased person of whom the dreamer has been fond confront the interpreter with difficult problems the solution of which is not always satisfying the reason for this may be sought in the especially pronounced ambivalence of feeling which controls the relation of the dreamer to the dead person in such dreams it is quite usual for the deceased person to be treated at first as living then it suddenly appears that he is dead and in the continuation of the dream he is once more living this has a confusing effect i at last divined that this alternation of death and life is intended to represent the indifference of the dreamer it is all one to me whether he is alive or dead this indifference of course is not real but wished its purpose is to help the dreamer to deny his very intense and often contradictory emotional attitudes and so it becomes the dreamrepresentation of his ambivalence for other dreams in which one meets with deceased persons the following rule will often be a guide if in the dream the dreamer is not reminded that the dead person is dead he sets himself on a par with the dead he dreams of his own death the sudden realization or astonishment in the dream but he has long been dead is a protest against this identification and rejects the meaning that the dreamer is dead but i will admit that i feel that dreaminterpretation is far from having elicited all the secrets of dreams having this content

iii

in the example which i shall now cite i can detect the dream work in the act of purposely manufacturing an absurdity for which there is no occasion whatever in the dreammaterial it is taken from the dream which i had as a result of meeting count thun just before going away on a holiday i am driving in a cab and i tell the driver to drive to a railway station of course i cant drive with you on the railway track itself i say after the driver had reproached me as though i had worn him out at the same time it seems as though i had already made with him a journey that one usually makes by train of this confused and senseless story analysis gives the following explanation during the day i had hired a cab to take me to a remote street in dornbach the driver however did not know the way and simply kept on driving in the manner of such worthy people until i became aware of the fact and showed him the way indulging in a few derisive remarks from this driver a train of thought led to the aristocratic personage whom i was to meet later on for the present i will only remark that one thing that strikes us middle class plebeians about the aristocracy is that they like to put themselves in the drivers seat does not count thun guide the austrian car of state the next sentence in the dream however refers to my brother whom i thus also identify with the cab driver i had refused to go to italy with him this year of course i cant drive with you on the railway track itself and this refusal was a sort of punishment for his accustomed complaint that i usually wear him out on this tour this finds its way into the dream unchanged by rushing him too quickly from place to place and making him see too many beautiful things in a single day that evening my brother had accompanied me to the railway station but shortly before the carriage had reached the western station of the metropolitan railway he had jumped out in order to take the train to purkersdorf i suggested to him that he might remain with me a little longer as he did not travel to purkersdorf by the metropolitan but by the western railway this is why in my dream i made in the cab a journey which one usually makes by train in reality however it was the other way about what i told my brother was the distance which you travel on the metropolitan railway you could travel in my company on the western railway the whole confusion of the dream is therefore due to the fact that in my dream i replace metropolitan railway by cab which to be sure does good service in bringing the driver and my brother into conjunction i then elicit from the dream some nonsense which is hardly disentangled by elucidation and which almost constitutes a contradiction of my earlier speech of course i cannot drive with you on the railway track itself but as i have no excuse whatever for confronting the metropolitan railway with the cab i must intentionally have given the whole enigmatical story this peculiar form in my dream

but with what intention we shall now learn what the absurdity in the dream signifies and the motives which admitted it or created it in this case the solution of the mystery is as follows in the dream i need an absurdity and something incomprehensible in connection with driving fahren  riding driving because in the dreamthoughts i have a certain opinion that demands representation one evening at the house of the witty and hospitable lady who appears in another scene of the same dream as the housekeeper i heard two riddles which i could not solve as they were known to the other members of the party i presented a somewhat ludicrous figure in my unsuccessful attempts to find the solutions they were two puns turning on the words nachkommen to obey orders offspring and vorfahren to drive forefathers ancestry they ran i believe as follows

the coachman does it
at the masters behests
everyone has it
in the grave it rests
vorfahren
a confusing detail was that the first halves of the two riddles were identical

the coachman does it
at the masters behests
not everyone has it
in the cradle it rests
nachkommen
when i saw count thun drive up vorfahren in state and fell into the figarolike mood in which one finds that the sole merit of such aristocratic gentlemen is that they have taken the trouble to be born to become nachkommen these two riddles became intermediary thoughts for the dreamwork as aristocrats may readily be replaced by coachmen and since it was once the custom to call a coachman herr schwager brotherinlaw the work of condensation could involve my brother in the same representation but the dreamthought at work in the background is as follows it is nonsense to be proud of ones ancestors vorfahren i would rather be an ancestor vorfahr myself on account of this opinion it is nonsense we have the nonsense in the dream and now the last riddle in this obscure passage of the dream is solved namely that i have driven before vorher gefahren vorgefaltren with this driver

thus a dream is made absurd if there occurs in the dream thoughts as one of the elements of the contents the opinion that is nonsense and in general if criticism and derision are the motives of one of the dreamers unconscious trains of thought hence absurdity is one of the means by which the dream work represents contradiction another means is the inversion of material relation between the dreamthoughts and the dream content another is the employment of the feeling of motor inhibition but the absurdity of a dream is not to be translated by a simple no it is intended to reproduce the tendency of the dreamthoughts to express laughter or derision simultaneously with the contradiction only with this intention does the dream work produce anything ridiculous here again it transforms a part of the latent content into a manifest form84
herr ludwig ist ein grosser poet
und singt er so sturzt apollo
vor ihm auf die knie und bittet und fleht
halt ein ich werde sonst toll oh
as a matter of fact we have already cited a convincing example of this significance of an absurd dream the dream interpreted without analysis of the wagnerian performance which lasted until 745 am and in which the orchestra is conducted from a tower etc see this chapter d is obviously saving it is a crazy world and an insane society he who deserves a thing doesnt get it and he who doesnt care for it does get it in this way the dreamer compares her fate with that of her cousin the fact that dreams of a dead father were the first to furnish us with examples of absurdity in dreams is by no means accidental the conditions for the creation of absurd dreams are here grouped together in a typical fashion the authority proper to the father has at an early age evoked the criticism of the child and the strict demands which he has made have caused the child in self defence to pay particularly close attention to every weakness of his fathers but the piety with which the fathers personality is surrounded in our thoughts especially after his death intensifies the censorship which prevents the expression of this criticism from becoming conscious

iv

here is another absurd dream of a deceased father

i receive a communication from the town council of my native city concerning the cost of accommodation in the hospital in the year 1851 this was necessitated by a seizure from which i was suffering i make fun of the matter for in the first place i was not yet born in 1851 and in the second place my father to whom the communication might refer is already dead i go to him in the adjoining room where he is lying in bed and tell him about it to my surprise he remembers that in the year 1851 he was once drink and had to be locked up or confined it was when he was working for the firm of t then you too used to drink i ask you married soon after i reckon that i was born in 1856 which seems to me to be immediately afterwards

in the light of the foregoing exposition we shall translate the insistence with which this dream exhibits its absurdities as a sure sign of a particularly embittered and passionate polemic in the dreamthoughts all the greater then is our astonishment when we perceive that in this dream the polemic is waged openly and that my father is denoted as the person who is made a laughingstock such frankness seems to contradict our assumption of a censorship controlling the dreamwork the explanation is that here the father is only an interposed figure while the quarrel is really with another person who appears in the dream only in a single allusion whereas a dream usually treats of revolt against other persons behind whom the father is concealed here it is the other way about the father serves as the man of straw to represent another and hence the dream dares to concern itself openly with a person who is usually hallowed because there is present the certain knowledge that he is not in reality intended we learn of this condition of affairs by considering the occasion of the dream it was dreamed after i had heard that an older colleague whose judgment was considered infallible had expressed disapproval and astonishment on hearing that one of my patients had already been undergoing psychoanalytic treatment at my hands for five years the introductory sentences of the dream allude in a transparently disguised manner to the fact that this colleague had for a time taken over the duties which my father could no longer perform statement of expenses accommodation in the hospital and when our friendly relations began to alter for the worse i was thrown into the same emotional conflict as that which arises in the case of a misunderstanding between father and son by reason of the part played by the father and his earlier functions the dream thoughts now bitterly resent the reproach that i am not making better progress which extends itself from the treatment of this patient to other things does my colleague know anyone who can get on any faster does he not know that conditions of this sort are usually incurable and last for life what are four or five years in comparison to a whole lifetime especially when life has been made so much easier for the patient during the treatment

the impression of absurdity in this dream is brought about largely by the fact that sentences from different divisions of the dreamthoughts are strung together without any reconciling transition thus the sentence i go to him it the adjoining room etc leaves the subject from which the preceding sentences are taken and faithfully reproduces the circumstances under which i told my father that i was engaged to be married thus the dream is trying to remind me of the noble disinterestedness which the old man showed at that time and to contrast this with the conduct of another newlyintroduced person i now perceive that the dream is allowed to make fun of my father because in the dreamthoughts in the full recognition of his merits he is held up as an example to others it is in the nature of every censorship that one is permitted to tell untruths about forbidden things rather than the truth the next sentence to the effect that my father remembers that he was once drink and was locked up in consequence contains nothing that really relates to my father any more the person who is screened by him is here a no less important personage than the great meynert in whose footsteps i followed with such veneration and whose attitude towards me after a short period of favouritism changed into one of undisguised hostility the dream recalls to me his own statement that in his youth he had at one time formed the habit of intoxicating himself with chloroform with the result that he had to enter a sanatorium and also my second experience with him shortly before his death i had an embittered literary controversy with him in reference to masculine hysteria the existence of which he denied and when i visited him during his last illness and asked him how he felt he described his condition at some length and concluded with the words you know i have always been one of the prettiest cases of masculine hysteria thus to my satisfaction and to my astonishment he admitted what he so long and so stubbornly denied but the fact that in this scene of my dream i can use my father to screen meynert is explained not by any discovered analogy between the two persons but by the fact that it is the brief yet perfectly adequate representation of a conditional sentence in the dream thoughts which if fully expanded would read as follows of course if i belonged to the second generation if i were the son of a professor or a privy councillor i should have progressed more rapidly in my dream i make my father a professor and a privy councillor the most obvious and most annoying absurdity of the dream lies in the treatment of the date 1851 which seems to me to be indistinguishable from 1856 as though a difference of five years meant nothing whatever but it is just this one of the dreamthoughts that requires expression four or five years that is precisely the length of time during which i enjoyed the support of the colleague mentioned at the outset but it is also the duration of time i kept my fiance waiting before i married her and by a coincidence that is eagerly exploited by the dream thoughts it is also the time i have kept my oldest patient waiting for a complete cure what are five years ask the dream thoughts that is no time at all to me that isnt worth consideration i have time enough ahead of me and just as what you wouldnt believe came true at last so i shall accomplish this also moreover the number 51 when considered apart from the number of the century is determined in yet another manner and in an opposite sense for which reason it occurs several times over in the dream it is the age at which man seems particularly exposed to danger the age at which i have seen colleagues die suddenly among them one who had been appointed a few days earlier to a professorship for which he had long been waiting

v

another absurd dream which plays with figures

an acquaintance of mine herr m has been attacked in an essay by no less a person than goethe and as we all think with unjustifiable vehemence herr m is of course crushed by this attack he complains of it bitterly at a dinnerparty but his veneration for goethe has not suffered as a result of this personal experience i try to elucidate the temporal relations a little as they seem improbable to me goethe died in 1832 since his attack upon m must of course have taken place earlier m was at the time quite a young man it seems plausible to me that he was 18 years old but i do not know exactly what the date of the present year is and so the whole calculation lapses into obscurity the attack by the way is contained in goethes well known essay on nature

we shall soon find the means of justifying the nonsense of this dream herr m with whom i became acquainted at a dinnerparty had recently asked me to examine his brother who showed signs of general paralysis the conjecture was right the painful thing about this visit was that the patient gave his brother away by alluding to his youthful pranks though our conversation gave him no occasion to do so i had asked the patient to tell me the year of his birth and had repeatedly got him to make trifling calculations in order to show the weakness of his memory which tests by the way he passed quite well now i can see that i behave like a paralytic in the dream i do not know exactly what the date of the present year is other material of the dream is drawn from another recent source the editor of a medical periodical a friend of mine had accepted for his paper a very unfavourable crushing review of the last book of my berlin friend fl the critic being a very youthful reviewer who was not very competent to pass judgment i thought i had a right to interfere and called the editor to account he greatly regretted his acceptance of the review but he would not promise any redress i thereupon broke off my relations with the periodical and in my letter of resignation i expressed the hope that our personal relations would not suffer as a result of the incident the third source of this dream is an account given by a female patient it was fresh in my memory at the time of the psychosis of her brother who had fallen into a frenzy crying nature nature the physicians in attendance thought that the cry was derived from a reading of goethes beautiful essay and that it pointed to the patients overwork in the study of natural philosophy i thought rather of the sexual meaning in which even our less cultured people use the word nature and the fact that the unfortunate man afterwards mutilated his genitals seems to show that i was not far wrong eighteen years was the age of this patient at the time of this access of frenzy

if i add further that the book of my so severely criticized friend one asks oneself whether the author or oneself is crazy had been the opinion of another critic treats of the temporal conditions of life and refers the duration of goethes life to the multiple of a number significant from the biological point of view it will readily be admitted that in my dream i am putting myself in my friends place i try to elucidate the temporal relations a little but i behave like a paretic and the dream revels in absurdity this means that the dreamthoughts say ironically naturally he is the fool the lunatic and you are the clever people who know better perhaps however it is the other way about now the other way about is abundantly represented in my dream inasmuch as goethe has attacked the young man which is absurd while it is perfectly possible even today for a young fellow to attack the immortal goethe and inasmuch as i reckon from the year of goethes death while i made the paretic reckon from the year of his birth
but i have further promised to show that no dream is inspired by other than egoistical motives accordingly i must account for the fact that in this dream i make my friends cause my own and put myself in his place my critical conviction in waking life would not justify my doing so now the story of the eighteen yearold patient and the divergent interpretations of his cry nature allude to the fact that i have put myself into opposition to the majority of physicians by claiming a sexual aetiology for the psychoneuroses i may say to myself you will meet with the same kind of criticism as your friend indeed you have already done so to some extent so that i may now replace the he in the dreamthoughts by we yes you are right we two are the fools that mea res agitur is clearly shown by the mention of the short incomparably beautiful essay of goethes for it was a popular lecture on this essay which induced me to study the natural sciences when i left the gymnasium and was still undecided as to my future

vi

i have to show that yet another dream in which my ego does not appear is none the less egoistic in chapter v d i referred to a short dream in which professor m says my son the myopic and i stated that this was only a preliminary dream preceding another in which i play a part here is the main dream previously omitted which challenges us to explain its absurd and unintelligible wordformation

on account of something or other that is happening in rome it is necessary for the children to flee and this they do the scene is then laid before a gate a double gate in the ancient style the porta romana in siena as i realize while i am dreaming i am sitting on the edge of a well and i am greatly depressed i am almost weeping a woman a nurse a nun brings out the two boys and hands them over to their father who is not myself the elder is distinctly my eldest son but i do not see the face of the other boy the woman asks the eldest boy for a parting kiss she is remarkable for a red nose the boy refuses her the kiss but says to her extending her his hand in parting auf geseres and to both of us or to one of us auf ungeseres i have the idea that this indicates a preference

this dream is built upon a tangle of thoughts induced by a play i saw at the theatre called das neue ghetto the new ghetto the jewish question anxiety as to the future of my children who cannot be given a fatherland anxiety as to educating them so that they may enjoy the privileges of citizens all these features may easily be recognized in the accompanying dream thoughts

by the waters of babylon we sat down and wept siena like rome is famous for its beautiful fountains in the dream i have to find some sort of substitute for rome cf chapter v b from among localities which are known to me near the porta romana of siena we saw a large brightlylit building which we learned was the manicomio the insane asylum shortly before the dream i had heard that a coreligionist had been forced to resign a position which he had secured with great effort in a state asylum

our interest is aroused by the speech auf geseres where one might expect from the situation continued throughout the dream auf wiedersehen au revoir and by its quite meaningless antithesis auf ungeseres un is a prefix meaning not

according to information received from hebrew scholars geseres is a genuine hebrew word derived from the verb goiser and may best be rendered by ordained sufferings fated disaster from its employment in the jewish jargon one would take it to mean wailing and lamentation ungeseres is a coinage of my own and is the first to attract my attention but for the present it baffles me the little observation at the end of the dream that ungeseres indicates an advantage over geseres opens the way to the associations and therewith to understanding this relation holds good in the case of caviar the unsalted kind is more highly prized than the salted caviar to the general noble passions herein lies concealed a jesting allusion to a member of my household of whom i hope for she is younger than i that she will watch over the future of my children this too agrees with the fact that another member of my household our worthy nurse is clearly indicated by the nurse or nun of the dream but a connectinglink is wanting between the pair salted unsalted and geseres ungeseres this is to be found in gesauert and ungesauert leavened and unleavened in their flight or exodus from egypt the children of israel had not time to allow their dough to become leavened and in commemoration of this event they eat unleavened bread at passover to this day here too i can find room for the sudden association which occurred to me in this part of the analysis i remembered how we my friend from berlin and myself had strolled about the streets of breslau a city which was strange to us during the last days of easter a little girl asked me the way to a certain street i had to tell her that i did not know it i then remarked to my friend i hope that later on in life the child will show more perspicacity in selecting the persons whom she allows to direct her shortly afterwards a sign caught my eye dr herod consulting hours i said to myself i hope this colleague does not happen to be a childrens specialist meanwhile my friend had been developing his views on the biological significance of bilateral symmetry and had begun a sentence with the words if we had only one eye in the middle of the forehead like cyclops this leads us to the speech of the professor in the preliminary dream my son the myopic and now i have been led to the chief source for geseres many years ago when this son of professor ms who is today an independent thinker was still sitting on his schoolbench he contracted an affection of the eye which according to the doctor gave some cause for anxiety he expressed the opinion that so long as it was confined to one eye it was of no great significance but that if it should extend to the other eye it would be serious the affection subsided in the one eye without leaving any ill effects shortly afterwards however the same symptoms did actually appear in the other eye the boys terrified mother immediately summoned the physician to her distant home in the country but the doctor was now of a different opinion took the other side what sort of geseres is this you are making he asked the mother impatiently if one side got well the other will too and so it turned out

and now as to the connection between this and myself and my family the schoolbench upon which professor ms son learned his first lessons has become the property of my eldest son it was given to him by the boys mother and it is into his mouth that i put the words of farewell in the dream one of the wishes that may be connected with this transference may now be readily guessed this schoolbench is intended by its construction to guard the child from becoming shortsighted and onesided hence myopia and behind it the cyclops and the discussion about bilateralism the fear of onesidedness has a twofold significance it might mean not only physical onesidedness but intellectual onesidedness also does it not seem as though the scene in the dream with all its craziness were contradicting precisely this anxiety when on the one hand the boy has spoken his words of farewell on the other hand he calls out the very opposite as though to establish an equilibrium he is acting as it were in obedience to bilateral symmetry

thus a dream frequently has the profoundest meaning in the places where it seems most absurd in all ages those who have had something to say and have been unable to say it without danger to themselves have gladly donned the cap and bells he for whom the forbidden saying was intended was more likely to tolerate it if he was able to laugh at it and to flatter himself with the comment that what he disliked was obviously absurd dreams behave in real life as does the prince in the play who is obliged to pretend to be a madman and hence we may say of dreams what hamlet said of himself substituting an unintelligible jest for the actual truth i am but mad northnorthwest when the wind is southerly i know a hawk from a handsaw act ii sc ii85

thus my solution of the problem of absurdity in dreams is that the dreamthoughts are never absurd at least not those of the dreams of sane persons and that the dreamwork produces absurd dreams and dreams with individually absurd elements when the dreamthoughts contain criticism ridicule and derision which have to be given expression my next concern is to show that the dreamwork is exhausted by the cooperation of the three factors enumerated and of a fourth which has still to be mentioned that it does no more than translate the dreamthoughts observing the four conditions prescribed and that the question whether the mind goes to work in dreams with all its intellectual faculties or with only part of them is wrongly stated and does not meet the actual state of affairs but since there are plenty of dreams in which judgments are passed criticisms made and facts recognized in which astonishment at some individual element of the dream appears and explanations are attempted and arguments adduced i must meet the objections deriving from these occurrences by the citation of selected examples

my answer is as follows everything in dreams which occurs as the apparent functioning of the critical faculty is to be regarded not as the intellectual performance of the dreamwork but as belonging to the substance of the dreamthoughts and it has found its way from these as a completed structure into the manifest dreamcontent i may go even farther than this i may even say that the judgments which are passed upon the dream as it is remembered after waking and the feelings which are aroused by the reproduction of the dream belong largely to the latent dream content and must be fitted into place in the interpretation of the dream

1 one striking example of this has already been given a female patient does not wish to relate her dream because it was too vague she saw a person in the dream and does not know whether it was her husband or her father then follows a second dream fragment in which there occurs a manurepail with which the following reminiscence is associated as a young housewife she once declared jestingly in the presence of a young male relative who frequented the house that her next business would be to procure a new manurepail next morning one was sent to her but it was filled with lilies of the valley this part of the dream served to represent the phrase not grown on my own manure86 if we complete the analysis we find in the dreamthoughts the aftereffect of a story heard in youth namely that a girl had given birth to a child and that it was not clear who was the father the dreamrepresentation here overlaps into the waking thought and allows one of the elements of the dreamthoughts to be represented by a judgment formed in the waking state of the whole dream

2 a similar case one of my patients has a dream which strikes him as being an interesting one for he says to himself immediately after waking i must tell that to the doctor the dream is analysed and shows the most distinct allusion to an affair in which he had become involved during the treatment and of which he had decided to tell me nothing87

3 here is a third example from my own experience

i go to the hospital with p through a neighbourhood in which there are houses and gardens thereupon i have an idea that i have already seen this locality several times in my dreams i do not know my way very well p shows me a way which leads round a corner to a restaurant indoor here i ask for frau doni and i hear that she is living at the back of the house in a small room with three children i go there and on the way i meet an undefined person with my two little girls after i have been with them for a while i take them with me a sort of reproach against my wife for having left them there

on waking i am conscious of a great satisfaction whose motive seems to be the fact that i shall now learn from the analysis what is meant by i have already dreamed of this88 but the analysis of the dream tells me nothing about this it shows me only that the satisfaction belongs to the latent dreamcontent and not to a judgment of the dream it is satisfaction concerning the fact that i have had children by my marriage ps path through life and my own ran parallel for a time now he has outstripped me both socially and financially but his marriage has remained childless of this the two occasions of the dream give proof on complete analysis on the previous day i had read in the newspaper the obituary notice of a certain frau dona a y which i turn into doni who had died in childbirth i was told by my wife that the dead woman had been nursed by the same midwife whom she herself had employed at the birth of our two youngest boys the name dona had caught my attention for i had recently met with it for the first time in an english novel the other occasion for the dream may be found in the date on which it was dreamed this was the night before the birthday of my eldest boy who it seems is poetically gifted

4 the same satisfaction remained with me after waking from the absurd dream that my father after his death had played a political role among the magyars it is motivated by the persistence of the feeling which accompanied the last sentence of the dream i remember that on his deathbed he looked so like garibaldi and i am glad that it has really come true followed by a forgotten continuation i can now supply from the analysis what should fill this gap it is the mention of my second boy to whom i have given the baptismal name of an eminent historical personage who attracted me greatly during my boyhood especially during my stay in england i had to wait for a year before i could fulfil my intention of using this name if the next child should be a son and with great satisfaction i greeted him by this name as soon as he was born it is easy to see how the fathers suppressed desire for greatness is in his thoughts transferred to his children one is inclined to believe that this is one of the ways by which the suppression of this desire which becomes necessary in the course of life is effected the little fellow won his right to inclusion in the text of this dream by virtue of the fact that the same accident that of soiling his clothes quite pardonable in either a child or in a dying person had occurred to him compare with this the allusion stuhlrichter presiding judge and the wish of the dream to stand before ones children great and undefiled

5 if i should now have to look for examples of judgments or expressions of opinion which remain in the dream itself and are not continued in or transferred to our waking thoughts my task would be greatly facilitated were i to take my examples from dreams which have already been cited for other purposes the dream of goethes attack on herr m appears to contain quite a number of acts of judgment i try to elucidate the temporal relations a little as they seem improbable to me does not this look like a critical impulse directed against the nonsensical idea that goethe should have made a literary attack upon a young man of my acquaintance it seems plausible to me that he was 18 years old that sounds quite like the result of a calculation though a silly one and the i do not know exactly what is the date of the present year would be an example of uncertainty or doubt in dreams

but i know from analysis that these acts of judgment which seem to have been performed in the dream for the first time admit of a different construction in the light of which they become indispensable for interpreting the dream while at the same time all absurdity is avoided with the sentence i try to elucidate the temporal relations a little i put myself in the place of my friend who is actually trying to elucidate the temporal relations of life the sentence then loses its significance as a judgment which objects to the nonsense of the previous sentences the interposition which seems improbable to me belongs to the following it seems plausible to me with almost these identical words i replied to the lady who told me of her brothers illness it seems improbable to me that the cry of nature nature was in any way connected with goethe it seems much more plausible to me that it has the sexual significance which is known to you in this case it is true a judgment was expressed but in reality not in a dream and on an occasion which is remembered and utilized by the dreamthoughts the dreamcontent appropriates this judgment like any other fragment of the dreamthoughts

the number 18 with which the judgment in the dream is meaninglessly connected still retains a trace of the context from which the real judgment was taken lastly the i do not know exactly what is the date of the present year is intended for no other purpose than that of my identification with the paralytic in examining whom this particular fact was established

in the solution of these apparent acts of judgment in dreams it will be well to keep in mind the abovementioned rule of interpretation which tells us that we must disregard the coherence which is established in the dream between its constituent parts as an unessential phenomenon and that every dreamelement must be taken separately and traced back to its source the dream is a compound which for the purposes of investigation must be broken up into its elements on the other hand we become alive to the fact that there is a psychic force which expresses itself in our dreams and establishes this apparent coherence that is the material obtained by the dream work undergoes a secondary elaboration here we have the manifestations of that psychic force which we shall presently take into consideration as the fourth of the factors which co operate in dreamformation

6 let us now look for other examples of acts of judgment in the dreams which have already been cited in the absurd dream about the communication from the town council i ask the question you married soon after i reckon that i was born in 1856 which seems to me to be directly afterwards this certainly takes the form of an inference my father married shortly after his attack in the year 1851 i am the eldest son born in 1856 so this is correct we know that this inference has in fact been falsified by the wishfulfilment and that the sentence which dominates the dreamthoughts is as follows four or five years that is no time at all that need not be counted but every part of this chain of reasoning may be seen to be otherwise determined from the dream thoughts as regards both its content and its form it is the patient of whose patience my colleague complains who intends to marry immediately the treatment is ended the manner in which i converse with my father in this dream reminds me of an examination or crossexamination and thus of a university professor who was in the habit of compiling a complete docket of personal data when entering his pupils names you were born when 1856 patre then the applicant gave the latin form of the baptismal name of the father and we students assumed that the hofrat drew inferences from the fathers name which the baptismal name of the candidate would not always have justified hence the drawing of inferences in the dream would be merely the repetition of the drawing of inferences which appears as a scrap of material in the dreamthoughts from this we learn something new if an inference occurs in the dreamcontent it assuredly comes from the dreamthoughts but it may be contained in these as a fragment of remembered material or it may serve as the logical connective of a series of dreamthoughts in any case an inference in the dream represents an inference taken from the dreamthoughts89

it will be well to continue the analysis of this dream at this point with the inquisition of the professor is associated the recollection of an index in my time published in latin of the university students and further the recollection of my own course of study the five years allowed for the study of medicine were as usual too little for me i worked unconcernedly for some years longer my acquaintances regarded me as a loafer and doubted whether i should get through then suddenly i decided to take my examinations and i got through in spite of the postponement a fresh confirmation of the dreamthoughts with which i defiantly meet my critics even though you wont believe it because i am taking my time i shall reach the conclusion german schluss  end conclusion inference it has often happened like that

in its introductory portion this dream contains several sentences which we can hardly deny are of the nature of an argument and this argument is not at all absurd it might just as well occur in my waking thoughts in my dream i make fun of the communication from the town council for in the first place i was not yet born in 1851 and in the second place my father to whom it might refer is already dead not only is each of these statements perfectly correct in itself but they are the very arguments that i should employ if i received such a communication we know from the foregoing analysis that this dream has sprung from the soil of deeply embittered and scornful dreamthoughts and if we may also assume that the motive of the censorship is a very powerful one we shall understand that the dreamthought has every occasion to create a flawless refutation of an unreasonable demand in accordance with the pattern contained in the dreamthoughts but the analysis shows that in this case the dreamwork has not been required to make a free imitation but that material taken from the dreamthoughts had to be employed for the purpose it is as though in an algebraic equation there should occur besides the figures plus and minus signs and symbols of powers and of roots and as though someone in copying this equation without understanding it should copy both the symbols and the figures and mix them all up together the two arguments may be traced to the following material it is painful to me to think that many of the hypotheses upon which i base my psychological solution of the psychoneuroses which will arouse scepticism and ridicule when they first become known for instance i shall have to assert that impressions of the second year of life and even the first leave an enduring trace upon the emotional life of subsequent neuropaths and that these impressions although greatly distorted and exaggerated by the memory may furnish the earliest and profoundest basis of a hysterical symptom patients to whom i explain this at a suitable moment are wont to parody my explanation by offering to search for reminiscences of the period when they were not yet born my disclosure of the unsuspected part played by the father in the earliest sexual impulses of female patients may well have a similar reception cf the discussion in chapter v d nevertheless it is my wellfounded conviction that both doctrines are true in confirmation of this i recall certain examples in which the death of the father occurred when the child was very young and subsequent incidents otherwise inexplicable proved that the child had unconsciously reserved recollections of the person who had so early gone out of its life i know that both my assertions are based upon inferences whose validity will be attacked it is the doing of the wishfulfilment that precisely the material of those inferences which i fear will be contested should be utilized by the dreamwork for establishing incontestable conclusions

7 in one dream which i have hitherto only touched upon astonishment at the subject emerging is distinctly expressed at the outset

the elder brucke must have set me some task or other strangely enough it relates to the preparation of the lower part of my own body the pelvis and legs which i see before me as though in the dissectingroom but without feeling the absence of part of my body and without a trace of horror louise n is standing beside me and helps me in the work the pelvis is eviscerated now the upper now the lower aspect is visible and the two aspects are commingled large fleshy red tubercles are visible which even in the dream make me think of haemorrhoids also something lying over them had to be carefully picked off it looked like crumpled tinfoil90 then i was once more in possession of my legs and i made a journey through the city but i took a cab as i was tired to my astonishment the cab drove into the front door of a house which opened and allowed it to pass into a corridor which was broken off at the end and eventually led on into the open91 finally i wandered through changing landscapes with an alpine guide who carried my things he carried me for some distance out of consideration for my tired legs the ground was swampy we went along the edge people were sitting on the ground like red indians or gypsies among them a girl until then i had made my way along on the slippery ground in constant astonishment that i was so well able to do so after making the preparation at last we came to a small wooden house with an open window at one end here the guide set me down and laid two planks which stood in readiness on the windowsill so as to bridge the chasm which had to be crossed from the window now i grew really alarmed about my legs instead of the expected crossing i saw two grownup men lying upon wooden benches which were fixed on the walls of the hut and something like two sleeping children next to them as though not the planks but the children were intended to make the crossing possible i awoke with terrified thoughts

anyone who his been duly impressed by the extensive nature of dreamcondensation will readily imagine what a number of pages the exhaustive analysis of this dream would fill fortunately for the context i shall make this dream only the one example of astonishment in dreams which makes its appearance in the parenthetical remark strangely enough let us consider the occasion of the dream it is a visit of this lady louise n who helps me with my work in the dream she says lend me something to read i offer her she by rider haggard a strange book but full of hidden meaning i try to explain the eternal feminine the immortality of our emotions here she interrupts me i know that book already havent you something of your own no my own immortal works are still unwritten well when are you going to publish your socalled latest revelations which you promised us even we should be able to read she asks rather sarcastically i now perceive that she is a mouthpiece for someone else and i am silent i think of the effort it cost me to make public even my work on dreams in which i had to surrender so much of my own intimate nature the best that you know you cant tell the boys the preparation of my own body which i am ordered to make in my dream is thus the selfanalysis involved in the communication of my dreams the elder brucke very properly finds a place here in the first years of my scientific work it so happened that i neglected the publication of a certain discovery until his insistence forced me to publish it but the further trains of thought proceeding from my conversation with louise n go too deep to become conscious they are sidetracked by way of the material which has been incidentally awakened in me by the mention of rider haggards she the comment strangely enough applies to this book and to another by the same author the heart of the world and numerous elements of the dream are taken from these two fantastic romances the swampy ground over which the dreamer is carried the chasm which has to be crossed by means of planks come from she the red indians the girl and the wooden house from the heart of the world in both novels a woman is the leader and both treat of perilous wanderings she has to do with an adventurous journey to an undiscovered country a place almost untrodden by the foot of man according to a note which i find in my record of the dream the fatigue in my legs was a real sensation from those days probably a weary mood corresponded with this fatigue and the doubting question how much farther will my legs carry me in she the end of the adventure is that the heroine meets her death in the mysterious central fire instead of winning immortality for herself and for others some related anxiety has mistakably arisen in the dream thoughts the wooden house is assuredly also a coffin that is the grave but in representing this most unwishedfor of all thoughts by means of a wishfulfilment the dreamwork has achieved its masterpiece i was once in a grave but it was an empty etruscan grave near orvieto a narrow chamber with two stone benches on the walls upon which were lying the skeletons of two adults the interior of the wooden house in the dream looks exactly like this grave except that stone has been replaced by wood the dream seems to say if you must already sojourn in your grave let it be this etruscan grave and by means of this interpolation it transforms the most mournful expectation into one that is really to be desired unfortunately as we shall learn the dream is able to change into its opposite only the idea accompanying an affect but not always the affect itself hence i awake with thoughts of terror even after the idea that perhaps my children will achieve what has been denied to their father has forced its way to representation a fresh allusion to the strange romance in which the identity of a character is preserved through a series of generations covering two thousand years

8 in the context of another dream there is a similar expression of astonishment at what is experienced in the dream this however is connected with such a striking farfetched and almost intellectual attempt at explanation that if only on this account i should have to subject the whole dream to analysis even if it did not possess two other interesting features on the night of the eighteenth of july i was travelling on the southern railway and in my sleep i heard someone call out hollthurn 10 minutes i immediately think of holothuria of a natural history museum that here is a place where valiant men have vainly resisted the domination of their overlord yes the counter reformation in austria as though it were a place in styria or the tyrol now i see indistinctly a small museum in which the relics of the acquisitions of these men are preserved i should like to leave the train but i hesitate to do so there are women with fruit on the platform they squat on the ground and in that position invitingly hold up their baskets i hesitated in doubt as to whether we have time but here we are still stationary i am suddenly in another compartment in which the leather and the seats are so narrow that ones spine directly touches the back92 i am surprised at this but i may have changed carriages while asleep several people among them an english brother and sister a row of books plainly on a shelf on the wall i see the wealth of nations and matter and motion by maxwell thick books bound in brown linen the man asks his sister about a book of schillers whether she has forgotten it these books seem to belong now to me now to them at this point i wish to join in the conversation in order to confirm or support what is being said i wake sweating all over because all the windows are shut the train stops at marburg

while writing down the dream a part of it occurs to me which my memory wished to pass over i tell the brother and sister in english referring to a certain book it is from but i correct myself it is by the man remarks to his sister he said it correctly

the dream begins with the name of a station which seems to have almost waked me for this name which was marburg i substitute hollthurn the fact that i heard marburg the first or perhaps the second time it was called out is proved by the mention of schiller in the dream he was born in marburg though not the styrian marburg93 now on this occasion although i was travelling first class i was doing so under very disagreeable circumstances the train was overcrowded in my compartment i had come upon a lady and gentleman who seemed very fine people and had not the good breeding or did not think it worth while to conceal their displeasure at my intrusion my polite greeting was not returned and although they were sitting side by side with their backs to the engine the woman before my eyes hastened to preempt the seat opposite her and next to the window with her umbrella the door was immediately closed and pointed remarks about the opening of windows were exchanged probably i was quickly recognized as a person hungry for fresh air it was a hot night and the atmosphere of the compartment closed on both sides was almost suffocating my experience as a traveller leads me to believe that such inconsiderate and overbearing conduct marks people who have paid for their tickets only partly or not at all when the conductor came round and i presented my dearly bought ticket the lady exclaimed haughtily and almost threateningly my husband has a pass she was an imposing looking person with a discontented expression in age not far removed from the autumn of feminine beauty the man had no chance to say anything he sat there motionless i tried to sleep in my dream i take a terrible revenge on my disagreeable travelling companions no one would suspect what insults and humiliations are concealed behind the disjointed fragments of the first half of the dream after this need has been satisfied the second wish to exchange my compartment for another makes itself felt the dream changes its scene so often and without making the slightest objection to such changes that it would not have seemed at all remarkable had i at once from my memories replaced my travelling companions by more agreeable persons but here was a case where something or other opposes the change of scene and finds it necessary to explain it how did i suddenly get into another compartment i could not positively remember having changed carriages so there was only one explanation i must have left the carriage while asleep an unusual occurrence examples of which however are known to neuropathologists we know of persons who undertake railway journeys in a crepuscular state without betraying their abnormal condition by any sign whatever until at some stage of their journey they come to themselves and are surprised by the gap in their memory thus while i am still dreaming i declare my own case to be such a case of automatisme ambulatoire

analysis permits of another solution the attempt at explanation which so surprises me if i am to attribute it to the dreamwork is not original but is copied from the neurosis of one of my patients i have already spoken in another chapter of a highly cultured and kindly man who began shortly after the death of his parents to accuse himself of murderous tendencies and who was distressed by the precautionary measures which he had to take to secure himself against these tendencies his was a case of severe obsessional ideas with full insight to begin with it was painful to him to walk through the streets as he was obsessed by the necessity of accounting for all the persons he met he had to know whither they had disappeared if one of them suddenly eluded his pursuing glance he was left with a feeling of distress and the idea that he might possibly have made away with the man behind this obsessive idea was concealed among other things a cainphantasy for all men are brothers owing to the impossibility of accomplishing this task he gave up going for walks and spent his life imprisoned within his four walls but reports of murders which had been committed in the world outside were constantly reaching his room by way of the newspapers and his conscience tormented him with the doubt that he might be the murderer for whom the police were looking the certainty that he had not left the house for weeks protected him for a time against these accusations until one day there dawned upon him the possibility that he might have left his house while in an unconscious state and might thus have committed murder without knowing anything about it from that time onwards he locked his front door and gave the key to his old housekeeper strictly forbidding her to give it into his hands even if he demanded it

this then is the origin of the attempted explanation that i may have changed carriages while in an unconscious state it has been taken into the dream readymade from the material of the dream thoughts and is evidently intended to identify me with the person of my patient my memory of this patient was awakened by natural association my last night journey had been made a few weeks earlier in his company he was cured and we were going into the country together to his relatives who had sent for me as we had a compartment to ourselves we left all the windows open throughout the night and for as long as i remained awake we had a most interesting conversation i knew that hostile impulses towards his father in childhood in a sexual connection had been at the root of his illness by identifying myself with him i wanted to make an analogous confession to myself the second scene of the dream really resolves itself into a wanton phantasy to the effect that my two elderly travelling companions had acted so uncivilly towards me because my arrival on the scene had prevented them from exchanging kisses and embraces during the night as they had intended this phantasy however goes back to an early incident of my childhood when probably impelled by sexual curiosity i had intruded into my parents bedroom and was driven thence by my fathers emphatic command

i think it would be superfluous to multiply such examples they would all confirm what we have learned from those already cited namely that an act of judgment in a dream is merely the repetition of an original act of judgment in the dreamthoughts in most cases it is an unsuitable repetition fitted into an inappropriate context occasionally however as in our last example it is so artfully applied that it may almost give one the impression of independent intellectual activity in the dream at this point we might turn our attention to that psychic activity which though it does not appear to cooperate constantly in the formation of dreams yet endeavours to fuse the dreamelements of different origin into a flawless and significant whole we consider it necessary however first of all to consider the expressions of affect which appear in dreams and to compare these with the affects which analysis discovers in the dreamthoughts

82 we die for our king i have forgotten in what author i found a reference to a dream which was overrun with unusually small figures the source of which proved to be one of the engravings of jacques callot which the dreamer had examined during the day these engravings contain an enormous number of very small figures a whole series of them deals with the horrors of the thirty years war

84 here the dreamwork parodies the thought which it qualifies as ridiculous in that it creates something ridiculous in relation to it heine does the same thing when he wishes to deride the bad rhymes of the king of bavaria he does it by using even worse rhymes

85 this dream furnishes a good example in support of the universally valid doctrine that dreams of the same night even though they are separated in the memory spring from the same thoughtmaterial the dreamsituation in which i am rescuing my children from the city of rome moreover is distorted by a reference back to an episode of my childhood the meaning is that i envy certain relatives who years ago had occasion to transplant their children to the soil of another country
