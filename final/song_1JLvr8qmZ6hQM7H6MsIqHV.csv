they stay
strange ways
verse 1 mf doom
wreak havoc beep beep its mad traffic
sleek and lavish people speak and leak it to the maverick
he see it as just another felony drug arrest
any day could be the one he pick the wrong thug to test
slug through the vest shot in the street
for pulling heat on a father whose babys gotta eat
and when they get hungry it aint shit funny
paid to interfere with how a brother get his money
now whos the real thugs killers and gangsters
set the revolution let the things bust and thank us
when the smoke clear you can see the sky again
there will be the chopped off heads of leviathan

interlude sample and mf doom
my friend they call em strangers
anybody talk to him end up in some danger
theyll never change
they stay
strange ways
cant reform em
you might also likeverse 2 mf doom
they pray four times a day they pray five
who ways is strange when its time to survive
some will go of they own free will to die
others take them with you when they blow sky high
whats the difference all you get is lost children
while the bosses sit up behind the desks it cost billions
to blast humans in half into captured arms
only one side is allowed to have bombs
its like making a soldier drop his weapon
shooting him and telling him to get to stepping
obviously they came to portion up his fortune
sounds to me like that old robberyextortion

interlude sample and mf doom
theyll never change
they stay
same game
strange ways
ya cant reform em
outro sample
that mary was goin around with an old flame
that burned me up because i know he was just feeding her a line
but the guy really spent his money like water
i think he was connected so i left
outside it was raining cats and dogs
i was feelin mighty blue and everything looked black
but i carried on34embed"
