so pretty so smart
such a waste of a young heart
what a pity what a sham
whats the matter with you man

verse 2
dont you see its wrong cant you get it right
out of mind and outta sight
call on all your girls dont forget the boys
put a lid on all that noise

chorus
im a satellite heart
lost in the dark
im spun out so far
you stop i start
but ill be true to you

verse 3
i hear youre living out of state
runnin in a whole new scene
you know i havent slept in weeks
youre the only thing i see

chorus
im a satellite heart
lost in the dark
im spun out so far
you stop i start
but ill be true to you
im a satellite heart
lost in the dark
im spun out so far
you stop i start
but ill be true to you
no matter what you do
yeah ill be true to you
