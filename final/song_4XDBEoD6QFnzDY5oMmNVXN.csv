run desire run sexual being
run him like a blade to and through the heart
no conscience one motive
to cater to the hollow

chorus
screaming feed me here
fill me up again
and temporarily pacify this hungering

verse 2
so grow libido throw
dominoes of indiscretions down
falling all around in cycles in circles
constantly consuming conquer and devour

bridge
cause its time to bring the fire down
bridle all this indiscretion
long enough to edify
and permanently fill this hollow
