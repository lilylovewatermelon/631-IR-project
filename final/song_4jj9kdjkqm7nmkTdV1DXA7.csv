hey hey
look closer and you can see how i been running it
i got a dollar bill in the cockpit
surprised being white is a black hole
i got another job at the liquor store damn
oh well im bone broke

verse 2
they got a white pony in the stable
and ride him when the doggie isnt able
but he dont really care because they pay him
but still a black suit is going to shake him down
oh well im bone broke
yeah broke as ill ever be

chorus
look another way girl im telling ya
god gave seven minutes right to ya
and your mother put her money into platinum
and now you never have to pay attention
do ya do ya

verse 3
yeah
im leaning on a brick with my nails
im sending in the moneys in the mail
keep showing that my bones never fake it
but now the brick bank is gonna break it down
oh well im bone broke
