oh nothing you can tell us they get jealous when we show up show up
make you feel like a little girl again but fuck you like a grown up
high as you could be its like a dream you never woke from
my lifes like a movie get ready for your close up
pour a bottle and toast up
your man in your phone trying to see what your plans is
so what you still turn up my songs soon as they playing it
know what the saying is money talks and you aint saying shit
im a call you soon as i land
probably roll some weed right up on the beach while you tan
party every weekend you hardly would speak
but now you got my phone taking pictures
laughing smoking chilling yeah

now were on the top floor top floor

we dont hear nobody talk
probably cause were in the sky sky sky sky
when we really take off
and i tell her hold on
cause she say she never been this high
we dont hear nobody talk
probably cause were in the sky sky sky sky
when we really take off
and i tell her hold on
cause she say she never been this high4embed"
