stop me if you think that youve heard this one before
stop me oh oh oh stop me
stop me if you think that youve heard this one before

cause nothings changed
i still love you oh i still love you
only slightly only slightly less than i used to my love

i was delayed i was waylaid
an emergency stop
i saw the last ten seconds of life
i crashed down on the crossbar
and the pain was enough to make
a shy bald buddhist reflect
and plan a mass murder yeah
who said i lied to her
who said i lied cause i never never
who said i lied because i never

i was detained i was restrained
broke my knee and broke my spleen
and then he really laid into me yeah
friday night in outpatients
who said i lied to her
who said i lied cause i never never
who said i lied to her
you might also likeso i drank one it became four
and when i fell on the floor i drank more

stop me oh oh oh stop me
stop me if you think that youve heard this one before
stop me oh i said stop me
stop me if you think that youve heard this one before

cause nothings changed
i still love you oh i still love you
only slightly only slightly less than i used to my love

set free me why dont you
get out my life why dont you
cause you dont really love me no
you just keep me hangin on

set me free why dont you girl
get out my life why dont you girl
cause you dont really love me no no no
you just keep me hangin onembed"
