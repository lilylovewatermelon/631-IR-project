well this is a good idea
he wouldnt do it if it wasnt
he wouldnt do it if it wasnt one
well my friend fancies you
oh what a way to begin it all
you said theyre always exciting words to hear

chorus
and they woke up together not quite realising how
awkwardly stretching and yawning
its always hard in the morning
and i suppose thats the price you pay
well oh it isnt what it was
shes thinking he looks different today
and now theres nothing left to guess now

verse 2
they left before the lights came on
because they didnt want to ruin what it was that was brewing
before they absolutely had to
and how can you wake up with someone you dont love
and not feel slightly fazed by it
oh he had a struggle

chorus
and they woke up together not quite realising how
awkwardly stretching and yawning
its always hard in the morning
and i suppose thats the price you pay
well oh it isnt what it was
shes thinking he looks different today
and now theres nothing left to guess now
you might also likebridge
well quick lets leave before the lights come on
cause then you dont have to see
cause then you dont have to see what youve done
well quick lets leave before the lights come on
cause then you dont have to see
cause then you dont have to see what youve done

outro
ill walk you up what times the bus come
ill walk you up what times the bus come
ill walk you up what times the bus come
ill walk you up16embed"
