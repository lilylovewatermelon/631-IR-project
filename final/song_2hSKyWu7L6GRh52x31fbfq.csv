just here doin what i can
no i dont want a family who would damn me
and resent everything i am
i dont need to prove to all the ones who
feel that i need to fit in
no i wont ever tell you that i failed you
id rather start life over again

no im sorry to say
therell be no sacrifice today

no i can see it clearly
why you feel me
why you got to bring me down
no i dont want to fight you
just to spite you
but im not afraid to take you out

no im sorry to say
therell be no sacrifice today

everybody expects me to break
but ill never break down again
everybody expects me to give up
but youll never see me givin in
everybody wants me to lose
but ill never lose who i am
you might also likeno im sorry to say
therell be no sacrifice today x2

everybody expects me to break
but ill never break down again
everybody expects me to give up
but youll never see me givin in
everybody wants me to lose
but ill never lose who i am

no im sorry to say
therell be no sacrifice today x2

no sacrifice today x2embed"
