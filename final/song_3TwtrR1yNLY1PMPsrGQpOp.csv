i cant stand to fly
im not that naive
im just out to find
the better part of me

chorus
im more than a bird im more than a plane
im more than some pretty face beside a train
and its not easy to be me

verse 2
i wish that i could cry
fall upon my knees
find a way to lie
bout a home ill never see

chorus
it may sound absurd but dont be naive
even heroes have the right to bleed
i may be disturbed but won’t you concede
even heroes have the right to dream
and its not easy to be me

bridge
up up and away away from me
well its alright
you can all sleep sound tonight
im not crazy or anything

i cant stand to fly
im not that naive
men werent meant to ride
with clouds between their knees

chorus
im only a man in a silly red sheet
diggin for kryptonite on this one way street
only a man in a funny red sheet
lookin for special things inside of me

outro
inside of me
inside of me
yeah inside of me
inside of me
i’m only a man in a funny red sheet
i’m only a man lookin for a dream
i’m only a man in a funny red sheet
and its not easy hoo hoo hoo
its not easy to be me11embed"
