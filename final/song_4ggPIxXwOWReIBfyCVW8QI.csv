we were as young as we were dumb
when we piled in an old pile of junk
it was one for all and all for one
a bunch of outlaws without a gun
shootin bad booze outta dixie cups
chasin every girl that wasnt fast enough
no matter how bad the break or how bad the luck
or how bad the day we still had us

chorus
blood brothers closer than your next to kin
thick as thieves and the best of friends
take a bullet for each other
yeah brothers like that dont come cheap
you fight you cry you lie you bleed
and you lean on one another
blood brothers

verse 2
i got a scar on my cheek from a bar room brawl
wasnt meant for me but i took the fall
its a cowboy code its an unwrote law
when you mess with one you gotta take us all

chorus
blood brothers closer than your next to kin
thick as thieves and the best of friends
take a bullet for each other
yeah brothers like that dont come cheap
you fight you cry you lie you bleed
and you lean on one another
blood brothers yeah yeah uh huh

chorus
blood brothers closer than your next to kin
thick as thieves and the best of friends

yeah brothers like that dont come cheap

and you lean on one another
