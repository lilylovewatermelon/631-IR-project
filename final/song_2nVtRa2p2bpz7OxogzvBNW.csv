dear saint we miss you so
where do all the legends go
dear saint we miss you so
where do all the legends go
we were told youll reap what you sow

chorus
who would you die for who would you die for
list their names in the stars
who would you lie for who would you lie for
is she layin in your arms
in sweet summer sweat like you could never forget
im gonna figure this out
before we all close our eyes and drift into the night

verse 2
its been said he was the bravest elephant
dont let em fool ya or try to school ya
just be yourself and no one else
and when we meet again ill be the bravest elephant

chorus
who would you die for who would you die for
list their names in the stars
who would you lie for who would you lie for
is she laying in your arms
sweet summer sweat like you could never forget
im gonna figure this out
before we all close our eyes and drift into the night

list their names in the stars
who would you lie for who would you lie for

sweet summer sweat like you could never forget

before we all close our eyes and drift into the night
