front porch of this old house
lighting bugs in a mason jar
theres a fourlane coming through
they break down at the end of june
the countys takin half my yard

it dont matter too much anyway
in the scheme of things
i still get more than i should

its all good
its alright
lord its always a good day
when youre glad to be alive
everything i need
aint to hard to find
so i dont waste my time complaining
cause i dont see how i could
its all good

another bill in the box today
new boats gonna have to wait
my pickup truck just broke down
grass needs mowin
i hear the plans closin
but it wont be the end of this town
folks round here see things in a different way
and thatll never change
theres one thing thats understood
you might also likeits all good
its alright
lord its always a good day
when youre glad to be alive
everything i need
aint to hard to find
so i dont waste my time complaining
cause i dont see how i could
its all good

its all good
its alright
lord its always a good day
when youre glad to be alive
everything i need
aint to hard to find
cause i dont see how i could
its all good
oh
i dont waste my time complaining
its all goodembed"
