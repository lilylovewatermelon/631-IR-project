i left a note in the hallway
by the time you read it ill be far away
im far away
but i aint fucking with nobody
lets have a toast to the good life
suicide before you see this tear fall down my eyes
me and my baby we gon be alright
we gon live a good life
big homie better grow up
me and my whoadies bout to stroll up
i see them boppers in the corner
they sneaking out the back door
he only want me when im not there
he better call becky with the good hair
he better call becky with the good hair91embed"
