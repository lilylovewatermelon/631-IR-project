government test climate best if youre looking for no rest
and at midnight you can grab your keys and slip into your bulletproof dress
television comes to life and it works the street tonight
sirens the song and its remixed long into the broad daylight
sleeping with the only one you cant outrun

prechorus
gotta run before the sun catches up to me
days they go too slow im blinded
seein only what i wanna see

chorus
in this enchanted land of a thousand chances
you only get just one and its gone

verse 2
well im just another creep in that town that never sleeps
met the one i adore at a liquor store and she gave up counting sheep
and she explained to me what waitress really means
that most ignore what shes waiting for while earning an honest keep
shes acting out tinsel towns most hated scene

prechorus
gotta run before the sun catches up to me
days they go too slow im blinded
seein only what i wanna see
see smash mouth liveget tickets as low as 56you might also likechorus
in this enchanted land of a thousand chances
you only get just one and its gone

outro
disenchanted in this land of a thousand chances
