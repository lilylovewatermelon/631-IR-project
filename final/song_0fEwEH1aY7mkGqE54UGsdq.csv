just ask me nice and ill be nice
we kiss and say we will but we dont mean it
and all the girls like you they tell me their secrets

chorus
cause im nothing girl and nothing hurts
when youre with me
and youre broken boy
and all your dreams are broken toys
and ill take your love
and turn it into nothingness like me

what have you done that you should feel so guilty
if youre not happy here
darkness will follow you anywhere
they might have the money and the fame
but they cant hold a candle to my flame

repeat chorus
i can be whatever you want me to be
just ask me nice and ill be nice
chorus 2x
i can be whatever you want me to beyou might also likeembed"
