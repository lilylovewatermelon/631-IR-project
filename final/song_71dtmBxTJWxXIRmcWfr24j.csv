dont come to me with your problems i dont need them
your conscience is a weight that i wont hold
youd rather be the only one who pretends
is it cause youve been bought and sold so young

verse 1
dont ask me questions cause i dont got the answers
if you only knew what time will tell
its all a test and lessons that you cant learn
youll know when you spend your time in hell

chorus
so as your bloods running thin your times running out
no one will be listening not even when you shout
when your angels turn to devils youll finally figure out
that no one will be with you in the end

verse 2
a hypocrite youre just a contradiction
wrapped up in your lies who knows whats real
well this is it your lonely life of fiction
do you even know how to feel

chorus
so as your bloods running thin your times running out
no one will be listening not even when you shout
when your angels turn to devils youll finally figure out
that no one will be with you in the end

chorus
so as your bloods running thin your times running out
no one will be listening not even when you shout
when your angels turn to devils youll finally figure out
that no one will be with you in the end the end the end the endembed"
