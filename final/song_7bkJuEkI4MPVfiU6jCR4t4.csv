if you were me what would you do
always a lie and never the truth

youll always be my baby

chorus ashanti
baby i just gotta let you go for now
thought i could take it for a while
maybe you will make it back around
baby i just gotta live my life for now
cant see me changing for a while
hope i can make it back around

verse 1 ashanti
anything that i want i can get it boy
you know you turn me on and on
thats why i switch my frame of mind
of being there when you call im always on time
im looking to spread my wings and party
everything and for everybody
need my space my time alone
its like our hearts dont match no more
still everything that you want you can get it boy
you know i still got love for you

verse 2 ashanti
when you was cheating you was probably thinking
i wont sense a thing
but love got a funny way of catching up to lies
and your lies cant look me straight in the eyes
im not surprised that you would hurt me baby
though why me baby
just let me breathe
and ill fly freely

verse 3 ja rule
yo yo why in the world would you wanna leave me girl
is there something out there
that you feel is better than whats here at home
and i know a bitch can do better on her own
youre not alone the way you hurt me baby
shit why me baby
i feel your pain a little but i know that love is real
and as long as i let you go that you feel
the need to come back to me baby
who else gon hold you and sex you crazy
