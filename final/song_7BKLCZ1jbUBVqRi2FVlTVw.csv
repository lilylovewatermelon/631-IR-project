hey i was doing just fine before i met you
i drink too much and thats an issue but im okay
hey you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
but i hope i never see them again

prechorus andrew taggart
i know it breaks your heart
moved to the city in a brokedown car
and four years no calls
now youre lookin pretty in a hotel bar
and iii cant stop
no iii cant stop

chorus andrew taggart
so baby pull me closer
in the backseat of your rover
that i know you cant afford
bite that tattoo on your shoulder
pull the sheets right off the corner
of the mattress that you stole
from your roommate back in boulder
we aint ever gettin older

drop andrew taggart
we aint ever gettin older
we aint ever gettin older
