ill dive right in
break through the waves
straight to the ocean floor
and although my hands are shaking
i lie perfectly still
cause im determined to let myself sink down
and i know im buried too far down
to feel the warmth from the sun again
i could wave my arms and swim away
but never reach the shore
but for now i will lay face first in the sand
with the wreckage from ships that lost their way
and i know im buried too far down
to feel the warmth from the sun again
and i know im buried too far down
to feel the warmth from the sun again
and although my hands are shaking
i lie perfectly still
cause im determined to let myself sink down
and i know im buried too far down
to feel the warmth from the sun againyou might also likeembed"
