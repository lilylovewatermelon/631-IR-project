yeah yeah yeah yeah

verse 1
fever dream high in the quiet of the night
you know that i caught it oh yeah youre right i want it
bad bad boy shiny toy with a price
you know that i bought it oh yeah youre right i want it

prechorus
killing me slow out the window
im always waiting for you to be waiting below
devils roll the dice angels roll their eyes
what doesnt kill me makes me want you more

chorus
and its new the shape of your body
its blue the feeling ive got
and its ooh woahoh
its a cruel summer
its cool thats what i tell em
no rules in breakable heaven
but ooh woahoh
its a cruel summer with you

verse 2
hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
im not dying oh yeah youre right i want it
we say that well just screw it up in these trying times
were not trying oh yeah youre right i want it

and if i bleed youll be the last to know oh

chorus
its new the shape of your body

im drunk in the back of the car
and i cried like a baby comin home from the bar oh
said im fine but it wasnt true
i dont wanna keep secrets just to keep you
and i snuck in through the garden gate
every night that summer just to seal my fate oh
and i scream for whatever its worth
i love you aint that the worst thing you ever heard
he looks up grinnin like a devil
chorus
its new the shape of your body
its blue the feeling ive got
and its ooh woahoh
its a cruel summer
its cool thats what i tell em
no rules in breakable heaven
but ooh woahoh
its a cruel summer with you

outro
im drunk in the back of the car
and i cried like a baby comin home from the bar oh
said im fine but it wasnt true
i dont wanna keep secrets just to keep you
and i snuck in through the garden gate
every night that summer just to seal my fate oh
and i scream for whatever its worth
i love you aint that the worst thing you ever heard
