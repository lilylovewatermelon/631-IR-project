i feel stupid
but i know it wont last for long
and ive been guessing
and i could have been guessing wrong
you dont know me now
i kinda thought that you should some how
does that whole mad season got you down

verse 2
well i feel stupid
but its something that comes and goes
and ive been changing
i think its funny how no one knows
we dont talk about
the little things that we do without
when that whole mad season comes around

prechorus
so why ya gotta stand there looking like the answer now
it seems to me youll come around

chorus
i need you now do you think you can cope
you figured me out that im lost and im hopeless
im bleeding and broken though ive never spoken
i come undone in this mad season
see matchbox twenty liveget tickets as low as 77you might also likeverse 3
i feel stupid
but i think ive been catching on
i feel ugly
but i know i still turn you on
youve grown colder now
torn apart angry turned around
what that whole mad season knock you down

prechorus
so are you gonna stand there are you gonna help me out
we need to be together now

chorus
i need you now do you think you can cope
you figured me out that im lost and im hopeless
im bleeding and broken though ive never spoken
i come undone in this mad season

bridge
and now im crying isnt that what you want
and im trying to live my life on my own but i wont no
at times i do believe i am strong
so someone tell me why why why
do i i i
feel stupid
and i come undone
well i come undone
chorus
i need you now do you think you can cope
you figured me out that im lost and im hopeless
im bleeding and broken though ive never spoken

chorus
well i need you now do you think you can cope
you figured me out im a child and im hopeless
im bleeding and broken though ive never spoken
i come oh i come undone in this mad season

outro
in this mad season
its been a mad season
been a mad seasonembed"
