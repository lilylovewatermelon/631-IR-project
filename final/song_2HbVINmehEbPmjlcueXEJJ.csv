all my life ive been searchin for somethin
somethin never comes never leads to nothin
nothin satisfies but im gettin close
closer to the prize at the end of the rope
all night long i dream of the day
when it comes around then its taken away
leaves me with the feelin that i feel the most
feel it come to life when i see your ghost

verse 1
come down dont you resist
youve such a delicate wrist
and if i give it a twist
somethin to hold when i lose my grip
will i find somethin in there
to give me just what i need
another reason to bleed
one by one hidden up my sleeve
one by one hidden up my sleeve

chorus
hey dont let it go to waste
i love it but i hate the taste
weight keepin me down
hey dont let it go to waste
i love it but i hate the taste
weight keepin me down
see foo fighters liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likeverse 2
will i find a believer
another one who believes
another one to deceive
over and over down on my knees
if i get any closer
and if you open up wide
and if you let me inside
on and on i got nothin to hide
on and on i got nothin to hide

chorus
hey dont let it go to waste
i love it but i hate the taste
weight keepin me down
hey dont let it go to waste
i love it but i hate the taste
weight keepin me down

refrain
all my life ive been searchin for somethin
somethin never comes never leads to nothin
nothin satisfies but im gettin close
closer to the prize at the end of the rope
all night long i dream of the day
when it comes around then its taken away
leaves me with the feelin that i feel the most
feel it come to life when i see your ghost
