running out of ways to run
i cant see i cant be
over and over and under my skin
all this attention is doing me in

fuck it all fuck this world
fuck everything that you stand for
dont belong dont exist
dont give a shit
dont ever judge me

picking through the parts exposed
taking shape taking shag
over and over and under my skin
all this momentum is doing me in

fuck it all fuck this world
fuck everything that you stand for
dont belong dont exist
dont give a shit
dont ever judge me

and dont you fuckin judge me
pain
see slipknot liveget tickets as low as 85you might also likeyou got all my love livin in your own hate
drippin hole man hard step no fate
show you nothin but i aint holdin back
every damn word i say is a sneak attack
when i get my hands on you
aint a fucking thing you can do
get this cause youre never gonna get me
i am the very disease you pretend to be
i am the push that makes you move
i am the push that makes you move
i am the push that makes you move
i am the push that makes you move

fuck it all fuck this world
fuck everything that you stand for
dont belong dont exist
dont give a shit
dont ever judge me
fuck it all fuck this world
fuck everything that you stand for
dont belong dont exist
dont give a shit
dont ever judge meembed"
