the beat is ready and i ride it
when i come around they excited
they all want a key to the garden
so i put it up and i light it light it
tell me how you like it
get me on the wheel imma drive it
but they wanna raise up the mileage

prechorus
well i dont like to turn my back
and so i work and give back
me i just try to dey my lane
i got the gang behind now
listen when they call they call my name
i found the voice within me
no man can curse what god has madе

chorus
so i can beat your pain
when the dark is closing in
see thеy want to love me now
when they tried to take me down
well be flying off the ground
when the world is going out
when the earth is falling in

prechorus

their heat is getting cold
their eyes are slowly closing
their chains they cannot hold me
under the open sky
theyre looking for a way
but i will keep you safe
