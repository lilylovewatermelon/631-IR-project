my ship went down
in a sea of sound
when i woke up alone
i had everything
a handful of moments
i wish i could change
and a tongue like a nightmare that cut like a blade
in a city of fools
i was careful and cool
but they tore me apart like a hurricane
a handful of moments i wish i could change but i was carried away

chorus
give me therapy
im a walking travesty
but im smiling at everything
therapy you were never a friend to me
and you can keep all your misery

verse 2
my lungs gave out
as i faced the crowd
i think that keeping this up could be dangerous
im flesh and bone
im a rolling stone
and the experts say im delirious

arrogant boy love yourself so no one has to
theyre better off without you theyre better off without you
arrogant boy cause a scene like youre supposed to
theyll fall asleep without you
youre lucky if your memory remains

chorus
give me therapy
im a walking travesty
but im smiling at everything
therapy you were never a friend to me
you can take back your misery
therapy im a walking travesty
but im smiling at everything
therapy you were never a friend to me
you can choke on your misery41embed"
