i have to paint myself a hole and fall inside
and if its far enough in sight and rhyme
i get to wear another dress and count in time

oh wont you do me the favor man
of forgiving my
polymorphing opinion here
and your vague outline
find myself another burning gate
a pretty face a vague idea i cant relate
and this is get what you get for pulling pins
out of the hole inside the hole youre in

its like im perched on the handlebars
of a blind mans bike
no straws to grab just the rushing wind
on a rolling mind

theyll want you to decide
eventually it happens
some gather on one side
with all their pearlys snapping
they close the basement door
that sets our teeth to chatter
you never saw it before
but now that hardly matters
you might also likeyoure old enough boy
too many summers youve enjoyed
so spin the wheel well set you up
with some odd convictions
as youre finally golden boy

its like im perched on the handlebars
of a blind mans bike
no straws to grab just the rushing wind
on a rolling mind1embed"
