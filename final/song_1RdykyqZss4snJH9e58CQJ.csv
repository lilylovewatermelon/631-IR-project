id stroll into a bank and put a ski mask on
and walk out with a million bucks
then id burn it in a pile out on your front lawn
just to prove it didnt mean that much
id sell everything i own take a pile of cash
walk into the casino bet it all on black
then blow all of my winnings on a limousine
to make out with you in the back hey

prechorus
i’m not afraid to look insane
cause i’m crazy about ya

chorus
theres nothing that i won’t do
just to make you love me love me love me
throw away my pride for you
just to make you love me want me trust me baby
i know im all but shameless
just need you and i could care less
if everyone knows that im your fool
girl theres nothing i won’t do
just to make you love me love me love me hey

verse 2
id buy a couple redeye oneway tickets
to paris to our first class ride
then id carry your body to the top of the tower
to kiss your lips at midnight
then we’ll wander through the streets and drink champagne
get drunk and start singing in the pouring rain
ill acapella karaoke “sexy thing”
cause baby i feel no shame
say this whole world can know youre all i need
cause baby some day ill drop and hit one knee and tell ya
prechorus
im not afraid to change your name
cause i’m crazy about ya

girl theres nothing i won’t do
just to make you love me love me love me hey
