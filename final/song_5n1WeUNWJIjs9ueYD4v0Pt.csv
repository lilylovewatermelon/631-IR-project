baby have you got no soul
is your heart a gaping hole
how come i didnt see that in you
how come i can forgive you
and if you loved me youd never do this
no if you loved me you wouldnt put me through it

chorus
that makes you a killer a killer a killer
that makes you a killer a killer a killer

verse 2
forever is for dreamers for dreamers
and its foolish to not know youre a schemer
its silly i think of our unborn children
cause all im thinking about right now is how i’ll never know em
and if you loved me you would never do this
our futures battered and bloody youre so fucking ruthless

chorus
that makes you a killer a killer a killer
that makes you a killer a killer a killer
that makes you a killer a killer a killer
that makes you a killer that makes you a killeryou might also like14embed"
