im holding back right now
cause im numb to whats around
i miss the life i used to have with you right here
now everything has turned to grey
and im blacking out the shades for now

chorus brian burkheiser
let me be sad
even for a little while
just a chance to catch my breath
let me be sad
even for a little while
cause its all that i have left
when all i see are the memories i dont want to lose a thing
let me be sad let me be sad

verse 2 eric vanlerberghe
can you see it in my eyes ive been distant
cause i cant tell if its the end or the beginning
i know i havent been myself ill admit it
and i put up walls so if i burned any bridges just know
im doing everything i can to try and fix it
but knowing me ill probably miss it
these voices get so vicious
feels like im rippin stitches
i wish some days i could go back
before life changed it was so fast
that time is gone and i know that
so please
