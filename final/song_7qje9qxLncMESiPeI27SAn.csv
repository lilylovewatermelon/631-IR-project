this shit was all i knew you and me only
i did it all for you still you were lonely
we couldve worked it out uh but i guess things change
its funny how someone elses success brings pain
when youre no longer involved that person has it all
and you just stuck standin there but
im gon need you to say something baby
saysay something baby
say something babe say something
im gon need you to say something baby
im gon need you to say something baby ohhwhoa

verse 1 timbaland
yeah it really sucks but ever since i’ve been long gone
i traded in my señorita for a microphone
i hate the way you fell apart girl its sad to see
your life is good but me and you we a catastrophe
if i was unsuccessful would you be satisfied
i need a paramedic girl i’m feeling paralyzed
if i could choose you will always be a friend to me
the more money i made you acting like my enemy its crazy
i can’t help it if you feel ashamed
thought the pressure would turn you into my diamond babe
how can something so familiar be so strange
closest friends get estranged when the status change huh
is it my mistake thinking that where i am and where you at
and my homeboy larry live is the only one that had my back
you were the perfect pair and now it seems that we don’t match
is it the money want me to give it back

verse 2 drake
uh i am the topic of conversation this is celebration
lets toast to the fact that ive moved out my mamas basement
to a condo downtown cause its all about location
i sit and drink wine and watch californication to life
you shoulda been here to kick it with me
we could have split this whole thing up 5050
but now im at the 4040 getting bitches tipsy
killing shit the everso talented mr ripley
how i go from being the man that you argue with
to me and dwayne carter putting out the hardest shit
i should wanna go back to the one i started with
but im addicted to this life its gon be hard to quit
yeah just ask me how things are coming along
you could tell me that youve never heard none of my songs
long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
cause whats a star when its most important fan is missing
chorus drake
this shit was all i knew you and me only
i did it all for you still you were lonely
we couldve worked it out uh but i guess things change
