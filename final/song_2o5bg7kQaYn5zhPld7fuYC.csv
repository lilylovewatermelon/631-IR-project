yeah
thats how you had it yeah
pretty sure
it is it goes clapping a bit
so interesting that way
alright here we go
gonna go an octave down this time

verse 1
im writing the future
im writing it out loud
we dont talk about the past
we dont talk about the past now
so im writing the future
im leaving a key here
something wont always be missing
you wont always feel emptier

break
ahah mmmm
ahahahah mmmm

verse 2
just think of the future
and think of your dreams
youll get away from here
youll get away eventually
so just think of the future
think of a new life
and dont get lost in the memories
keep your eyes on a new prize
