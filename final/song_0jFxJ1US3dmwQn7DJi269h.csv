uh close your eyes

verse 1 mac miller  iman omari
so watch her do the macarena somewhere out by pasadena
love a drug that everybody here just tryna get a taste of
you a waster of the space that you take up
livin this time around im not kiddin
i had an intuition bout these women and suspicion
got me lookin at shit different how a man in my position
cant start slippin down these slopes cause its all just downhill from there
as a kid i didnt learn that but now im aware
when you a youngin you just tryna live your life and have some fun
in a world where you have yet to see how evil its become
its hard to have a dream when you deep inside of one
and i know you hate them spirits so i keep em in my lungs
im a beatle to these young kids
but sometimes i be feelin like a needle to these young kids
you had the world you bout to leave it to these young kids
and we gon show you what the love is

chorus iman omari  mac miller

and i keep a couple most dope homies by me
so there aint too many times its me myself and irene
we stay smokin through the night wake up do some taichi
homie cant you see im chillin please dont fuck up my chi
yeah my jacket y3 recently been up on fashion
waste a bunch of money kinda stinks of satisfaction
fell asleep at hollywood woke up in manhattan
ballin like im jordan but im fresh as mars blackmon
a penny for your thoughts a dollar for your dreams
a price on a idea we never can agree
they tell you what to know but its better to believe
so why you tryna act like what you never gonna be
still i tell em fuck what you know im feelin comfortable
just continue livin life cause enough of em dont
you spent your days countin every single penny made
better start now cause we comin for you anyways

chorus iman omari  mac miller

ugh i told you it wont stop cause

verse 3 kendrick lamar
sometimes i wake up up in the morning make her
wrap this much makeup off my bed soon as shes yawnin take up
hours upon days just to find power shit to say
but you wont hear it even if your ears was pierced with beats by dre i mean
the sun is slowly fallin we all surely should die eventually
so whats your calling oh you left your phone behind
identity crisis break mirrors vices steer us through wickedness
jesus christ is right near us and devil said you owe ten percent
sold your soul i know sold your soul and youre hopeless
my focus stare at elopin on boats that float in the open of oceans
that coast the line on the margins i rhyme you chokin or soakin up game
im hopin you picked the second one shame
the emotion of jealousy that youre holdin youre tellin me
that youre golden but really cubic zirconia let me see
ill break you down like a pound of fire whenever
your tactics are mighty clever but even if youre mayweather you

chorus iman omari  mac miller
you cant fight the feeling
feeling
you cant fight the feeling no
it wont stop
you cant fight the feeling
feeling
you cant fight the feeling no
outro
fuck me
i want you to fuck me i want you to fuck me
i want you to fuck me oh yeah
oh fuck
oh fuck
oh fuck
