you sure look real pretty in your glass house
you probably think youre too good to take the trash out
well are you dumb are you blind
cause its a real fine line
between tellin a joke and turning the knife
dont wreck my reputation
let me wreck my own

chorus
step off step off
yeah youre getting too close to me
with all your negativity
just get lost
just try to make a little difference
heres why you gotta interfere
just keep climbing that mountain of dirty tricks
and when you finally get to the top
step off yeah

verse 2
you screwed everybody over in this town
cause there aint nothing between you and the cold hard ground
keep running your mouth and stretching the truth
you just might find a hole in your parachute
cause whatever gets you high
will always bring you down
you might also likechorus
so step off step off
yeah youre getting too close to me
with all your negativity
just get lost
just try to make a little difference
heres why you gotta interfere
just keep climbing that mountain of dirty tricks yeah
and when you finally get to the top
mm step off

bridge
sticks and stones may build a throne ah ah
but youll be up there all alone
so step off
yeah yeah
step off

outro
and keep climbing that mountain of dirty tricks yeah
when you finally get to the top
step off
mm just step off
step off3embed"
