eddie waited til he finished high school
he went to hollywood got a tattoo
he met a girl out there with a tattoo too
the future was wide open
they moved into a place they both could afford
he found a night club he could work at the door
she had a guitar and she taught him some chords
the sky was the limit

chorus
into the great wide open
under them skies of blue
out in the great wide open
a rebel without a clue

verse 2
the papers said ed always played from the heart
he got an agent and a roadie named bart
they made a record and it went in the charts
the sky was the limit
his leather jacket had chains that would jingle
they both met movie stars partied and mingled
their ar man said i dont hear a single
the future was wide open oh

into the great wide open
under them skies of blue
out in the great wide open
a rebel without a clue
into the great wide open
under them skies of blue
into the great wide open
a rebel without a clue ayy2embed"
