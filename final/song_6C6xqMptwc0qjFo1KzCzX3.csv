held on to hope like a noose like a rope
god and medicine take no mercy on him
poisoned his blood and burned out his throat
enough is enough hes a long way from home

verse 2
days of my youth wasted on a selfish fool
who ran for the hills from the hand you were dealt
i flew far away as far as i could go
your time is running out
and im a long way from home

verse 3
laid up in bed you were laid up in bed
holding the pain like youre holding your breath
i prayed you could sleep sleep like a stone
youre right next to me
but youre a long way from home

verse 4
hospital gowns never fit like they should
we yelled at the nurse didnt do any good
“more morphine” the last words you moaned
at last i was sure
that you werent far away from homeyou might also like2embed"
