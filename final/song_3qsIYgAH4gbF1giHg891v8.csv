goodbye 1989
i wanna be the one in control
rock my white shoes bolo tie
the next big thing for five years running

prechorus
its not your turn
its not your turn yet

chorus
back off you little shits
gnawing at my bits
i see they breed you by the boatload
back off you little whores
get em on all fours
and let me beat you to the fucking punch

refrain
my bodys not even cold
my act is just getting old
