woo
alright boys

verse
yeah here you come knockin on my door baby
tell me what you got on your mind
i guess those college boys all went home for the summertime
yeah you’re looking right looking good looking like a woman should
so why is it so hard to find
a place to lay your pretty little head down once in a while

prechorus
you run on a little tough luck baby ha
don’t you sweat it
everything is waiting inside for you
you know i got it
come and get it

chorus
who’s your daddy who’s your baby
who’s your buddy who’s your friend
and who’s the one guy that you come running to
when your love life starts tumbling
i got the money if you got the honey
let’s cut a deal let’s make a plan
who’s your daddy who’s your baby
who’s your buddy who’s your man
