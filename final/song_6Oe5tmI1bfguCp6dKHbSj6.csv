ive been riding around with my blunt on my lips
with the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
paranoia on my mind got my mind on the fritz
but a lot of niggas dyin so my 9 with the shits
ive been riding around with my blunt on my lips
with the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
paranoia on my mind got my mind on the fritz
but a lot of niggas dyin so my 9 with the shits
verse 1 chance the rapper
move to the neighborhood i bet they dont stay for good watch
somebodyll steal daddys rollie call it the neighborhood watch
pray for a safer hood when my paper good watch
captain saveahood hood savior baby boy
still getting idd for swishers mama still wash my clothes
still with the save money militia ima still watch my bros
trapped in the middle of the map
with a littlebitty rock and a little bit of rap
that with a literary knack
and a little shitty mac and like literally jack

chorus chance the rapper

they murking kids they murder kids here
why you think they dont talk about it they deserted us here
where the fuck is matt lauer at
somebody get katie couric in here
probably scared of all the refugees
look like we had a fuckin hurricane here
theyll be shooting whether its dark or not
i mean the days is pretty dark a lot
down here its easier to find a gun
than it is to find a fucking parking spot
no love for the opposition specifically a cop position
cause theyve never been in our position
getting violations from the nation correlating you dry snitchin

verse 3 chance the rapper
it just got warm out this the shit ive been warned bout
i hope that it storm in the mornin i hope that its pourin out
i hate crowded beaches i hate the sound of fireworks
and i ponder whats worse
between knowing its over and dyin first
cause everybody dies in the summer
wanna say your goodbyes tell them while its spring
i heard everybodys dying in the summer
so pray to god for a little more spring

outro chance the rapper
i know you scared
you should ask us if we scared too
if you was there
then wed just knew you cared too1embed"
