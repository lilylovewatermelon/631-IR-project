listen to the world out on the outside pressing in
are you ready on my mark
fingers given names and with the last word they ascend
on the comfort of their well
being
in arms
into something they cant stop but wish that they could kill
youre the answer to their prayers

prechorus
in your last hour stand
youll notice the one that you have loved in dreams
is here among the others
chase its you i want

chorus
but if i cant have her
then why should i spend any more time
in a world thats gonna end pretty soon
i need you now more than i ever did
ill hand myself over for you
this comlinks lost its frequency
and i feel that were coming home short
here take me instead
id rather not see her off alone

scattered amongst the killing streets the children slate defense
is gods work to have us fail
rivered blood streams out the dead as bodies foul the air
ill make peace when this is done
in arms
we storm
slowly the streets begin to fill with new flesh bound to bone
armed and ready it begins again

prechorus
in your last hour stand
youll notice the one that you have loved in dreams
is here among the others
chase its you i want

chorus
but if i cant have her
then why should i spend any more time
in a world thats gonna end pretty soon
i need you now more than i ever did
ill hand myself over for you
this comlinks lost its frequency
and i feel that were coming home short
here take me instead
id rather not see her off alone
postchorus
tonight we storm
tonight

bridge
deliver a favor to my love
deliver a favor to my love
deliver a favor to my love
deliver a favor to my love

prechorus
in your last hour stand youll notice
the one that you have loved in dreams
is here among the others
chase its you i want

chorus
but if i cant have her
then why should i spend any more time
in a world thats gonna end pretty soon
i need you now more than i ever did
ill hand myself over for you
this comlinks lost its frequency
and i feel that were coming home short
here take me instead
id rather not see her off aloneembed"
