verse 1
angel eyes long hair i see you cryin—whats wrong there
he did what he fucked who we know the story—whats new
see i could probably rush you tell you that he shoulda loved you
take advantage fuck you tell you ill do all the shit he wouldnt do
but the truth is we all the same on different teams but its all a game
the objective tryna score you got a wife you find a whore
you fuck her fast she find her drawers pull up her pants you find the door
you drive her home she mop you off you bust again and drop her off
then repeat like an episode why we cheat ill never know
is it cause we rap heavens no lotta niggas rap though never blow
like heterosexuals girl you fine from head to toe
could it be cause my father let me know that he cheated and somehow
i never told i never told

interlude 1

ok thats what it is i see the game the hoes come the seasons change
the hoes go we rearrange fuck up her life shell never be the same
the ogs that beat the game forever young peter pan
35 still playing child support still paying
juggling bill paying been running round field daying
wine and dine meal paying with hopes that shell lay in
the bed and get wet then give head then you bet man
the same girl who said we just met man game colder than the fucking dead man
one night stands no best man no bridesmaids or reverends
cause wolverines depressed and dont wanna be your exman
cause cupid aims and throw the darts there go the sparks and broken hearts
who wanna build noahs ark just to have that shit torn apart

interlude 2
