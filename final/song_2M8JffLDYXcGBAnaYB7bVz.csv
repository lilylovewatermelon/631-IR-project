what what if i said im tryna make it up
for all of the names thats playing games with you
you deserve better love
where where are the places that they aint take you
give me the book between your destinations
so i can book the flight and reservations

chorus noah cyrus ant clemons  both
what would you do if i asked you to choose
would you keep pickin on me
or am i the guy just for drunken nights
and while youre sober you dont need me
while youre sober you dont need me
while youre sober you dont know me

verse 2 ant clemons both  noah cyrus
what if i ran into all my obligations
and ran out your nerves and then make you go complacent
what if i fuck up your metime listen to me now

oh what would you do
if i made you number two
aint that what you want me to do

chorus noah cyrus ant clemons  both
what would you do if i asked you to choose
would you keep pickin on me
or am i the guy just for drunken nights
and while youre sober you dont need me
while youre sober you dont know me
