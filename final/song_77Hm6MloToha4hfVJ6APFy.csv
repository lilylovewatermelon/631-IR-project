because ive been sitting around all day with the blues
i know how it looks but dont misunderstand
its just that i can tell a storms about to brew
cause theres thunder inside my mind
theres lightning behind these eyes
theres a lull and the wind is dying down
dont let it fool you the storm aint done
flood waters rolling in and my hearts gonna drown
our love wilted like a flower that aint got enough sun

well the thunder in my head might go away
and the river of pain will flow back to the sea
if you would only come back home to stay
itd bring a stop to the rain and happiness to me
well if you would just come back id be so grateful
and the storm would be over
the world wouldnt seem so mean and hateful
and id lay you down on a bed of yellow cloveryou might also likeembed"
