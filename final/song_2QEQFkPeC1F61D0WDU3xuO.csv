theres a live oak tree you can still see off all 129
you can see the scars its missing bark
where it stopped my truck that night
they say i took a swing at my best friend
for trying to take my keys
next thing i knew i was upside down
thinking this is it for me

chorus
when you see life flash before your eyes
the good the bad the wrong the right
fade into a bright white line
shining down on you
your hanging on by a thread
wondering which ones your last breath
knowing theres so much you have left to do
live your life a better man
when youve been halfway to heaven

verse 2
first thing i did was hug my momma
i even hugged my dad
told them both how much i love them
never saw daddy cry like that
started hanging out with my little brother
man i never missed a game
im in church every sunday morning
i pray everyday

when you see life flash before your eyes
the good the bad the wrong the right
fade into a bright white line
shining down on you
your hanging on by a thread
wondering which ones your last breath
knowing theres so much you have left to do
live your life a better man
when youve been halfway to heaven

bridge
i wont waste one minute
yeah my lifes changed
and im going to live it

chorus
like im hanging on by a thread
wondering which ones my last breath
knowing theres so much i have left to do
i live my life a better man
i live my life a better man
cause ive been halfway to heavenembed"
