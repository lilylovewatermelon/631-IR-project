oh the razorblade thats what i call love
i bet youd pick it up and mess around with it if i put it down
it gets extremely complicated
anything to forget everything
youve got to take me out at least once a week
whether im in your arms or im at your feet
i know exactly what youre thinking
you wont say it now but in your heart its loud

chorus
oh no my feelings are more important than yours
oh drop dead i dont care i wont worry there you go

verse 2
oh the razorblade wish it would snap this rope
the world is in your hand or its at your throat
at times its not that complicated
anything to forget everything
he would never talk but he was not shy
she was a streetsmart girl but she could not lie
they were perfect for each other
say it now cause in your heart its loud

chorus
oh no my feelings are more important than yours
oh drop dead i dont care i wont worry hey

before i saw you

outro
sweetheart your feelings are more important of course

everyone that wanted everything that we would take from them
