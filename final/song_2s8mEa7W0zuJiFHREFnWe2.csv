organic shampoos with the lavender scrub
out the shower hair drippin while im raveling blunts
granola with the almonds hundred candles make it calmer
sunny days blinds closed bones never was a charmer
sesh
you talk about them commas all i see is whips and bottles
we maintain our drugs in water smoke and call it aquaponics
a selfsustaining home with tempered glass when it gets hotter
seven filters on the septic clean water for the garden
my compost fills stretching looking at the hills
coring apples cuttin carrots washing berries rippin peels

chorus
i stretch i breathe real deep
i eat i sleep i stretch
i breathe i eat i sleep
i sesh i stretch
i sesh i stretch
