ever since i can remember
cats been comin up and askin how did i
get to be where im at with my whole style
and got the nerve to ask would i
change anything about it
say its too clean or too crowded
but see thats just the thing
cause thats something that i
dont worry myself too much about because im
gonna do it the way that ive been doin it
since the first day that i started doin it
maybe fine tune it just a little but just enough
cause i dont wanna fuck up and ruin it
i take this thing too seriously
my style is the fuckin point of me
but see cats just dont get it
cause niggas always gotta find a label
or some kind of category sayin
yo this kid gotta be this
and he gotta be that and he gotta be whatever
yo i just gotta be whatever you want
and need me to be to make your life better
