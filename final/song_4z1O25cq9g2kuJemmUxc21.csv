youre just a small bump unborn
in four months youre brought to life
you might be left with my hair
but youll have your mothers eyes
ill hold your body in my hands be as gentle as i can
but for now youre a scan of my unmade plans
a small bump in four months youre brought to life

prechorus
and ill whisper quietly
ill give you nothin but truth
if youre not inside me
ill put my future in you

chorus
you are my one and only
and you can wrap your fingers round my thumb
and hold me tight
oh you are my one and only
you can wrap your fingers round my thumb
and hold me tight
and youll be all right

verse 2
ooh youre just a small bump unknown youll grow into your skin
with a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin
finger nails the size of a half grain of rice
and eyelids closed to be soon opened wide
a small bump in four months youll open your eyes

and ill hold you tightly
ill tell you nothin but truth
if youre not inside me
ill put my future in you

chorus
you are my one and only
and you can wrap your fingers round my thumb
and hold me tight
oh you are my one and only
you can wrap your fingers round my thumb
and hold me tight
and youll be all right

bridge
and you can lie with me
with your tiny feet
when youre half asleep
ill leave you be
right in front of me
for a couple weeks
so i can keep you safe

chorus
cause you are my one and only
you can wrap your fingers round my thumb
and hold me tight
oh you are my one and only
you can wrap your fingers round my thumb
and hold me tight
and youll be all right
outro
cause you were just a small bump unborn
for four months then torn from life
maybe you were needed up there
but were still unaware as why43embed"
