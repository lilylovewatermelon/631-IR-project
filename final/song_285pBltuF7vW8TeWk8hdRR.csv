chorus
i still see your shadows in my room
cant take back the love that i gave you
its to the point where i love and i hate you
and i cannot change you so i must replace you oh
easier said than done i thought you were the one
listenin to my heart instead of my head
you found another one but i am the better one
i wont let you forget me
i still see your shadows in my room
cant take back the love that i gave you
its to the point where i love and i hate you
and i cannot change you so i must replace you oh
easier said than done i thought you were the one
listenin to my heart instead of my head
you found another one but i am the better one
i wont let you forget me

verse
you left me falling and landing inside my grave
i know that you want me dead
i take prescriptions to make me feel aokay
i know its all in my head
i have these lucid dreams where i cant move a thing
thinking of you in my bed
you were my everything
thoughts of a wedding ring
now im just better off dead uh uh uh
ill do it over again
i didnt want it to end
i watch it blow in the wind
i shouldve listened to my friends
leave this shit in the past but i want it to last
you were made outta plastic fake
i was tangled up in your drastic ways
who knew evil girls had the prettiest face
you gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
i gave you my heart and you made heartbreak
you might also likebridge
you made my heart break
you made my heart ache i still see your shadows in my room
you made my heart break
you made my heart ache cant take back the love that i gave you
you made my heart break were made outta plastic fake
you made my heart ache i still see your shadows in my room
you made my heart break again i was tangled up in your drastic ways
who knew evil girls had the prettiest face

chorus
i still see your shadows in my room
cant take back the love that i gave you
its to the point where i love and i hate you
and i cannot change you so i must replace you oh
easier said than done i thought you were the one
listenin to my heart instead of my head
you found another one but i am the better one
i wont let you forget me
i still see your shadows in my room
cant take back the love that i gave you
its to the point where i love and i hate you
and i cannot change you so i must replace you oh
easier said than done i thought you were the one
listenin to my heart instead of my head
you found another one but i am the better one
i wont let you forget me
outro
leave this shit in the past but i want it to last
you were made outta plastic fake
i was tangled up in your drastic ways
who knew evil girls had the prettiest face
easier said than done i thought you were—
—instead of my head
you found another— better one
