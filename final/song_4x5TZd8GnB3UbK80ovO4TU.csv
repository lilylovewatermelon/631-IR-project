crawl back to life
its been far too long
crystallized
round interstellar moons
seed of light into your atmosphere
whats your world like

prechorus
is the house we built still here
girl you know

chorus
when the beat of my drum
meets the beat of your heart
you know i couldnt love
any other any other
this is where i come from
this is where i belong
with the beat of your drum
not any other

verse 2
fall through the sky
little specks below
magnify the further down i go
i feel it in my bones
can you feel it too
is this the world ive known
you might also likeprechorus
is the house we built still here
is the human race sincere

chorus
when the beat of my drum
meets the beat of your heart
you know i couldnt love
any other any other
this is where i come from
this is where i belong
with the beat of your drum
not any other

verse 3
feel the force of time
weighing down my mind
tears you cry screaming at the sky
come outside the rays are shining bright

bridge
not any other
feels like home
where i belong
im home
chorus
when the beat of my drum
meets the beat of your heart
you know i couldnt love
any other any other
this is where i come from
this is where i belong
with the beat of your drum
not any other9embed"
