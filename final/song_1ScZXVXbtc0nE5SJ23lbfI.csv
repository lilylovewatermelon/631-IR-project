praying for visions to show me the way

show me the way to forgive you
allow me to let it go
allow me to be forgiven
show me the way to let go

show me the way to forgive you
allow me to let it go
youll allow me to be forgiven
and then show me the way to let go

bridge
illuminate me
illuminate me
and illuminate the way
im just praying for you to show me where im to begin

hoping to reconnect to you
