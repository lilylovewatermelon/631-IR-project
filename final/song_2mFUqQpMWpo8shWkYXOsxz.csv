want you to stay in a subtle way
like youre walking again all on me
step slowly you know that you fall between
dark places what a simple web we weave

chorus
weve seen the nightmare of the lies that you speak
the beast that i lie beneath is coming in
weve seen the nightmare of the lies that you speak
the beast that i lie beneath is coming in

refrain
know my soul soul
know my soul

verse 2
well all hail the prison queen
iron bars iron heart
iron bars everything
a hundred years old
a hundred years old
last on the village scene
fall apart iron heart
more alive than youve ever been
you might also likechorus
weve seen the nightmare of the lies that you speak
the beast that i lie beneath is coming in
weve seen the nightmare of the lies that you speak
the beast that i lie beneath is coming in

hook
well its a dull life its a dull life
its a dull life its a dark place
its a dull life its a dull life
its a dull life its a dull life

refrain
know my soul

bridge
weve seen the nightmare of your lies
weve seen the nightmare of your lies
weve seen the nightmare of your lies
weve seen the nightmare of your lies
weve seen the nightmare of your lies
weve seen the nightmare of your lies

chorus
weve seen the nightmare of the lies that you speak
the beast that i lie beneath is coming in
weve seen the nightmare of the lies that you speak
the beast that i lie beneath is coming in
