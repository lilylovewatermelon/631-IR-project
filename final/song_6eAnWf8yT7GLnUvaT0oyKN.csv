all the strings attached girl
and all the strings attached girl oh yeah

verse 1
met this girl when i was three years old
we were holding hands tight so i’m told
and it felt like an eternity
said it felt like an eternity
cause i knew back then we were more than friends
twosides of the story it all depends
and ill say it once and ill say it again
itll only end up hurting me
years flew by i was less than twelve
long division i need your help
can you come on over and work with me
any time you like i’ll make it work for me
cause i knew back when if i get you close
when the times is right maybe ill propose
baby climb on up
show me the ropes

chorus

i love it when you look at me like that
and youre the only girl that brings me back

i wont let a moment pass
and when im with you i feel better
i want all the strings all the strings attached
