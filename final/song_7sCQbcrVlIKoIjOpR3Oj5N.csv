im undefeated

verse 1
hands on my neck foot on my back
closing in from every side
bleeding me dry im fading fast

prechorus 1
left for dead but i will rise up on my own
i could make it alone i got all that i need to survive
all that i need to survive
through the sweat and the blood i know what im made of
its the hunger that keeps me alive
keeps me alive
this time im coming like a hurricane this time

chorus
i came to fight for the love of the game unstoppable
thats why i im undefeated
off the leash out of the cage an animal
thats why i im undefeated
i i i know i can beat it
wont give up cause i believe it
fight for the love of the game unstoppable
thats why i im undefeated

here at the edge losing my ground
stare into the great divide
pushing me over pulling me down

prechorus 2
almost dead but i will rise up on my own
no im never alone and its all that i need to survive

through the sweat and the blood if i fall ill get up
its the hunger that keeps me alive
keeps me alive
this time im coming like a hurricane this time

chorus
