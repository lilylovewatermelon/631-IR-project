children sleeping
snow is softly falling
dreams are calling
like bells in the distance
we were dreamers
not so long ago
but one by one we
all had to grow up

prechorus
when it seems the magic slipped away
we find it all again on christmas day

chorus
believe in what your heart is saying
hear the melody thats playing
theres no time to waste
theres so much to celebrate
believe in what you feel inside
and give your dreams the wings to fly
you have everything you need
if you just believe

verse 2
trains move quickly
to their journeys end
destinations
are where we begin again
ships go sailing
far across the sea
trusting starlight
to get where they need to be

when it seems that we have lost our way
we find ourselves again on christmas day

chorus
believe in what your heart is saying
hear the melody thats playing
theres no time to waste
theres so much to celebrate
believe in what you feel inside
and give your dreams the wings to fly
you have everything you need
if you just believe

outro
if you just believe
if you just believe
if you just believe
just believe
