i believed in god back in eight grade
he could smoke an eighth on a school day
remember when you laughed at my last name
now i go by met is that less lame of a last name

verse 1
i believed in god back in 09
always down to hang he had no time
yeah but in a couple of years ill be so outta here
ill have a lotta new friends and i wont even care

chorus
i dont ever think of you 
i got too much stuff to do
should have left you back in school
joseph do you think im
i dont ever think of you 
look at all this stuff i do
ivе played shows in belarus now joe do you think im cool

verse 2
i could makе a joke but it feels strange
every time she laughed it would feel fake
but you could make her 
laugh in a real way
yeah i still use your jokes 
and they go great
it took a little while but i found love found love
i thought youd reply you just thumbed up thumbed up
i play a lot of shows but you dont come dont come
i dont even mind this is so dumb so dumb

i got friends all up the coast
proud of all the songs i wrote
but i cant take this backpack off

and i wont change your name at all

and youll tell me how cool i got13embed"
