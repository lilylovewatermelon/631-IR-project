oh yeah

chorus kanye west
drug dealin just to get by
stack your money til it get sky high
we wasnt sposed to make it past twentyfive
jokes on you we still alive
throw your hands up in the sky and say
we dont care what people say yeah yeah yeah uh

verse 1 kanye west
if this is your first time hearin this
you are about to experience somethin so cold man
we never had nothin handed took nothin for granted
took nothin from no man man im my own man
but as a shorty i looked up to the dope man
only adult man i knew that wasnt broke man
flicking starter coats man—man you dont know man
we dont care what people say
this is for my niggas outside all winter
cause this summer they aint finna say next summer im finna
sittin in the hood like community colleges
this dope money here is lil treys scholarship
cause aint no tuition for having no ambition
and aint no loans for sittin your ass at home
so we forced to sell crack rap and get a job
you gotta do somethin man your ass is grown

verse 2 kanye west
this second verse is for my dogs working nine to five that still hustle
cause a nigga cant shine off 655
and everybody sellin makeup jacobs
and bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up
we put shit on layaway then come back
we claim other people kids on our income tax
we take that money cop work then push packs to get paid
and we dont care what people say
mama say she wanna move south
scratching lottery tickets eyes on a new house
round the same time doe ran up in dude house
couldnt get a job
so since he couldnt get work he figured hed take work
the drug game bulimic its hard to get weight
so niggas money is homo its hard to get straight
but we gon keep bakin til the day we get cake
and we dont care what people say my niggas—
chorus kanye west  choir kanye west

verse 3 kanye west
you know the kids gon act a fool
when you stop the programs for after school
and they dcfs some of em dyslexic
they favorite 50 cent song 12 questions
we scream rocks blow weed park see now we smart
we aint retards the way teachers thought
hold up hold fast we make more cash
now tell my mama i belong in that slow class
its bad enough we on welfare
you tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair
im tryna get the car with the chromey wheels here
you tryna cut our lights out like we dont live here
look what was handed us fathers abandoned us
when we get them hammers go on call the ambulance
sometimes i feel no one in this world understands us
but we dont care what people say my niggas—
chorus kanye west  choir kanye west
drug dealin just to get by
stack your money til it get sky high
kids sing kids sing
we wasnt sposed to make it past twentyfive
jokes on you we still alive
throw your hands up in the sky and say
we dont care what people say
