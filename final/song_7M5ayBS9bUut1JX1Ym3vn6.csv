i feel like
i would like to be somewhere else doing something that matters
and ill admit here while i sit here
my mind wastes away and my doubts start to gather
whats the purpose it feels worthless
so unwanted like ive lost all my value
i cant find it not in the least bit
and im just scared so scared that ill fail you

prechorus
and sometimes i think that im not any good at all
and sometimes i wonder why why im even here at all
but then you assure me

chorus
im a little more than useless
and when i think that i cant do this
you promise me that ill get through this
and do something right do something right for once

verse 2
so i say if i cant do something significant
ill opt to leave most opportunities wasted
and nothing trivial that life can give me will
measure up to what might have replaced it
too late look my date book
is packed full of days that were empty and now gone
and i bet that regret
will prove to get me to improve in the long run
you might also likeprechorus
sometimes i think that im not any good at all
sometimes i wonder why why im even here at all
but then you assure me

chorus
im a little more than useless
and when i think that i cant do this
you promise me that ill get through this
and do something right do something right for once
im a little more than useless
and i never knew i knew this
was gonna the day gonna be the day
that i will do something right do something right for once

bridge
i noticed i know this
week is a symbol of how i use my time
resent it i spent it
convincing myself the worlds doing just fine
without me without me
doing anything of any consequence
without me without me
showing any sign of ever making sense
of my time its my life
and my right to use it like i should
like he would for the good
of everything that i would ever know
chorus
im a little more than useless
and when i think that i cant do this
you promise me that ill get through this
and do something right do something right for once
im a little more than useless
and i never knew i knew this
was gonna the day gonna be the day
that i will do something right do something right for onceembed"
