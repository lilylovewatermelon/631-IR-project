so pretty and savage she opened her bag im swear that shes bad as can be
and all of them bothers they throwing them dollars but shes only fucking with me
she so smooth shes so classy so ratchet so sassy so nasty so fancy and trashy yeah
so independent she dont need shit from me no she dont need nothing at all
they aint fucking with her when it come to money man she gon outhustle them all
shes so fine shes so sweet shes all mine she smokes weed she goes long i go deep
on that drink shеs so street

prechorus
late night shes on a mission
she only dancеs with ghosts only dance with ghosts
sits in the dark and listens to writings on the wall writings on the wall

chorus
shes just looking for something to hold
she be getting high but laying low
shes so afraid that shes gon be alone
she gon grip em til they let her go only dance with ghosts

postchorus

shes so afraid that shes gon be alone
she gon grip em til they let her go only dance with ghosts

postchorus
