i’m breathing black and white let it fool
caught by your linen eyes let them fool

chorus
but i don’t know where we went
my dear don’t unfold me and call it all pretend
be here and be holy
i don’t know where we went
my dear don’t unfold me
i’m coloured in again in you

verse 2
green where my red love lies was it all
don’t wear your winning prize let it fool

chorus
but i don’t know where we went
my dear don’t unfold me and call it all pretend
be here and be holy
i don’t know where we went
my dear don’t unfold me
i’m coloured in again in you

outro
oh what a waste i’ll be locked in your heaven always
oh what a way to be living with all of your pain
oh what a way to be locking your heaven away
oh what a wave you have madesee novo amor liveget tickets as low as 454embed"
