maybe in time ill understand
what is the reason for the emptiness you feel
when im trying everything i can

my love is running deeper than the night
stronger than the north wind blowing
its a fire burning bright
and its always been this way

can you hear me
am i really coming through
why do your eyes seem to dance away
i know whats right for you havent i always
i need you more than i can say

my love is running deeper than the night
stronger than the north wind blowing
its a fire burning bright
and its always been this way

my love is running deeper than the night
stronger than the north wind blowing
its a fire burning bright
and its always been this way
you might also likeand ill never ever change
in my lifetime ill stay the same
yes ill never ill never change
ill love you ill stay the same

my love is running deeper than the night
stronger than the north wind blowing
fire burning bright and it keeps on growing
keeps on growingembed"
