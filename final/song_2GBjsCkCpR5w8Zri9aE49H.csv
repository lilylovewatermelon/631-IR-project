im not angry anymore
well sometimes i am
i dont think badly of you
well sometimes i do

chorus
it depends on the day
the extent of all my worthless rage
im not angry anymore

verse 2
im not bitter anymore
im syrupy sweet
i rot your teeth down to their core
if im really happy

chorus
depends on the day
if i wake up in a giddy haze
well im not angry
im not totally angry
im not all that angry anymoresee paramore liveget tickets as low as 211you might also like11embed"
