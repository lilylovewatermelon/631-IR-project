lets turn off our phones tonight
and rely on the stars
weve been so lost lately
we forgot who we are
but i got everything i need baby
in the palms of your touch
in a world of dark distractions
it can all get too much

chorus
so lets sit by an english river
til the water runs dry
can we light a cigarette
and talk about days gone by
were neither saints or sinners
so leave your history behind
lets grab a bottle and take it one day at a time
take it one day at a time

verse 2
i know youre feelin weighed down tonight
and you cant find the breaks
every day is too long for you
you are sworn to your fate
but we got everything we need baby
in the memories we make
in a world of reinventions
its never too late

so lets sit by an english river
til the water runs dry
can we light a cigarette
and talk about days gone by
were neither saints or sinners
so leave your history behind
lets grab a bottle and take it one day at a time
take it one day at a time mmm
oh so lets sit by an english river
til the water runs dry
there is nothin that weve done wrong
that cant be made right
were neither saints or sinners
so leave your history behind
lets grab a bottle and take it
grab a bottle and take it
grab a bottle and take it one day at a time1embed"
