theres a hole in the wall
where a nail used to be
a nail that held a picture of
the one that once held me
now that walls tellin me
what i dont wanna hear
im tired of the word fool
ringin in my ears

chorus
oh i guess a saner man
would simply paint it
but im not sane and after all
its my wall aint it
ive got this hammer in my hand
and when im through
therell be a hole in that wall
big enough to drive a truck through

bridge
when you lose the greatest love
youve ever had
a little hole in the wall
is enough to drive you mad

oh i guess a saner man
would simply paint it
but im not sane and after all
its my wall aint it
ive got this hammer in my hand
and when im through
therell be a hole in that wall
big enough to drive a truck through

outro
oh ive got this hammer in my hand
and when im through
therell be a hole in that wall
big enough to drive a truck throughembed"
