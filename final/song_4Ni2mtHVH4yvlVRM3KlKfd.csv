yeah
yes battlegrounds right here
its a mans world
come on
gotta get ready for this right here
hey yo

verse 1 lotus juice
fears awake anger beats loud
face reality
never beat charity
the enemy youre fighting
covers all society damn right
mommys not here gotta fight all night
right here shadow ten oclock direction
seize the moment they destroy the nation
your rhyme slow motion give me motivation
freaked out now and dead on arrival what
round up around spit out all over
rhyme like a rolling stone coming a crowd
watch out they move they diss you loud
guess what this sound it bombs whole ground so round up
dont ease your pace cause enemys brutal
moment of truth there aint no truce
youre the only one one world one love
but the battle goes on
shadows of mass destruction
