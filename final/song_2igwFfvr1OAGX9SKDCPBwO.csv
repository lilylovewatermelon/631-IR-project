lights is blinding girls need blinders
or they could step out of bounds quick the side lines is
lined with casualties who sip the life casually
then gradually become worse—dont bite the apple eve

into the winter gets cold en vogue with your skin out
city of sin is a pity on a whim
good girls gone bad the citys filled with them
mami took a bus trip now she got her bust out
everybody ride her just like a bus route
hail mary to the city youre a virgin
and jesus cant save you life starts when the church end
came here for school graduated to the high life

the city never sleeps come on better slip you a ambien
