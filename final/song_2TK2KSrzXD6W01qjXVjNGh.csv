madison
hamilton

hamilton
i’m sorry burr i’ve gotta go

burr
but—

hamilton
decisions are happening over dinner

burr
two virginians and an immigrant walk into a room

burr and ensemble
diametric’ly opposed foes

burr
they emerge with a compromise having opened doors that were
burr and ensemble
previously closed

ensemble
bros

burr
the immigrant emerges with unprecedented financial power
a system he can shape however he wants
the virginians emerge with the nation’s capital
and here’s the pièce de résistance

burr  ensemble
no one else was in
the room where it happened
the room where it happened
the room where it happened
no one else was in
the room where it happened the room where it happened
the room where it happened
the room where it happened the room where it happened
no one really knows how the game is played game is played
the art of the trade
how the sausage gets made how the sausage gets made
we just assume that it happens assume that it happens
but no one else is in
the room where it happens the room where it happens

burr and company
thomas claims—

jefferson
alexander was on washington’s doorstep one day
in distress ‘n disarray
burr and company
thomas claims—

jefferson
alexander said—

hamilton
i’ve nowhere else to turn

jefferson
and basic’ly begged me to join the fray
burr and company
thomas claims—

jefferson
i approached madison and said—
“i know you hate ‘im but let’s hear what he has to say”

burr and company
thomas claims—

jefferson
well i arranged the meeting
i arranged the menu the venue the seating

burr
but
no one else was in—

burr and company
the room where it happened
the room where it happened
the room where it happened

burr
no one else was in—

burr and company
the room where it happened
the room where it happened
the room where it happened

burr  company
no one really knows how the
parties get to yesssss parties get to yesssss
the pieces that are sacrificed in ev’ry game of chesssss
ev’ry game of chesssss
we just assume that it happens assume that it happens
but no one else is in the room where it happens
the room where it happens

burr and company
meanwhile—

burr
madison is grappling with the fact that not ev’ry issue can be settled by committee

company
meanwhile—

burr
congress is fighting over where to put the capital—

company screams in chaos

burr
it isn’t pretty
then jefferson approaches with a dinner and invite
and madison responds with virginian insight

madison
maybe we can solve one problem with another and win a victory for the southerners in other words—

jefferson
ohho

madison
a quid pro quo

jefferson
i suppose

madison
wouldn’t you like to work a little closer to home

jefferson
actually i would

madison
well i propose the potomac

jefferson
and you’ll provide him his votes

madison
well we’ll see how it goes

jefferson
let’s go

burr
no

company
—one else was in
the room where it happened

burr and company
the room where it happened
the room where it happened
no one else was in
the room where it happened
the room where it happened
the room where it happened

burr
my god

burr and company
in god we trust
but we’ll never really know what got discussed
clickboom then it happened

burr
and no one else was in the room where it happened

company
alexander hamilton

burr
what did they say to you to get you to sell new york city down the river

company
alexander hamilton

burr
did washington know about the dinner
was there presidential pressure to deliver

company
alexander hamilton

burr
or did you know even then it doesn’t matter
where you put the us capital
hamilton
cuz we’ll have the banks
we’re in the same spot
burr
you got more than you gave

hamilton
and i wanted what i got
when you got skin in the game you stay in the game
but you don’t get a win unless you play in the game
oh you get love for it you get hate for it
you get nothing if you…

hamilton and company
wait for it wait for it wait

hamilton
god help and forgive me
i wanna build
something that’s gonna
outlive me

company
the art of the compromise—

burr
hold your nose and close your eyes

company
we want our leaders to save the day—

burr
but we don’t get a say in what they trade away

company
we dream of a brand new start—

burr
but we dream in the dark for the most part

burr and company
dark as a tomb where it happens

burr  company
i’ve got to be in
the room… the room where it happens
i’ve got to be
the room where it happens
i’ve got to be
the room where it happens
oh i’ve got to be in
the room where it happens… the room where it happens
i’ve got to be i’ve gotta be the room where it happens
i’ve gotta be…
in the room i wanna be in the room
where it happens
