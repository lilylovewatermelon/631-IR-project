you were talkin trash we were tossin bags
when i caught your name at a corn hole game
september saturday in rocky top
on top of g10 parking lot
said girl where you sittin i got an extra ticket
its right on the 50

chorus
you had a 16 home team jersey on
singin every word to the fight song
had your airplane bottles from your purse out
had a country mile smile every first down
last thing on my mind was the football
watchin you girl like its gonna be a good fall
you wouldve thought that postgame kiss wouldve made me wanna make you mine
but you had me by halftime

verse 2
they sent out the pride of the southland band
and all i could think about was holdin your hand
was just gonna catch it on a couch tv
and last second scored a couple tickets for free
but baby id have paid anything to see

chorus
you had a 16 home team jersey on
singin every word to the fight song
had your airplane bottles from your purse out
had a country mile smile every first down
last thing on my mind was the football
watchin you girl like its gonna be a good fall
you wouldve thought that postgame kiss wouldve made me wanna make you mine
but you had me by halftime
see morgan wallen liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likebridge
now every time the leaves start fallin down
i get to thinkin bout

chorus
that 16 home team jersey on
singin every word to the fight song
had your airplane bottles from your purse out
had a country mile smile every first down
last thing on my mind was the football
watchin you girl like its gonna be a good fall
you wouldve thought that postgame kiss wouldve made me wanna make you mine
but you had me by halftime
you had me by halftime
you had me by halftimeembed"
