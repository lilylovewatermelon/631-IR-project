hope you dont regret it
i pushed a lot back but i cant forget it
we never got the credit
nobody seemed to hear us but we said it
neither of us planned it
and for a long time i took it all for granted
i really thought we had it
but at the time it was more than i could manage so

prechorus 1
if we can leave it all behind us
and meet in between
it would get me so

chorus
high all the time high all the time
i wanna be high all the time
would you come with me

verse 2
wish i didnt doubt it
i wish i never ever told you all about it
but i just had to let you know
i never meant to hurt you though
i had all my motives
i didnt know they wouldnt mix with your emotions
i just had to reach my goals
never knew id meet you though so
you might also likeprechorus 2
if we can agree to disagree
and keep on reaching
it would get you so

extended chorus
high all the time high all the time
i wanna be high all the time
would you come with me
high all the time high all the time
i wanna be high all the time
would you come with me

bridge
we should stick together
youre my best friend ill love you forever would you come with me
it would get you so
we could be the greatest it doesnt matter if were never rich or famous would you come with me
it would get you so

chorus
high all the time high all the time
i wanna be high all the time
would you come with me
