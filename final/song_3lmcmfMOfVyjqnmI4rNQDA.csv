is this a dream
if it is please dont wake me from this high
id become comfortably numb
until you opened up my eyes
to what its like
when everythings right
i cant believe

chorus
you found me
when no one else was lookin
how did you know just where i would be
yeah you broke through all of my confusion
the ups and the downs and you still didnt leave
i guess that you saw what nobody could see
you found me
you found me

verse 2
so here we are
thats pretty far
when you think of where weve been
no going back im fading out
all that has faded me within
youre by my side
now everythings fine
i cant believe

til you came along
and showed me where i belong
you found me when no one else was lookin

chorus
you found me
when no one else was lookin
