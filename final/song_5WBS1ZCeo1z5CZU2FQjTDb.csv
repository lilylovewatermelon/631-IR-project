i dont wanna be the kind to hesitate
and be too shy wait too late
i dont care what they say other lovers do
i just wanna dance with you
i got a feeling that you have a heart like mine
so let it show let it shine
if we have a chance to make one heart of two
and i just wanna dance with you

chorus
i wanna dance with you
twirl you all around the floor
thats what they intended dancing for
i just wanna dance with you
i wanna dance with you
hold you in my arms once more
thats what they invented dancing for
and i just wanna dance with you

verse 2
i caught you looking at me when i looked at you
yes i did aint that true
you wont get embarrassed by the things i do
i just wanna dance with you
oh the boys are playing softly and the girls are too
so am i and so are you
if this was a movie wed be right on cue
and i just wanna dance with you
see george strait liveget tickets as low as 104you might also likechorus
i wanna dance with you
twirl you all around the floor
thats what they intended dancing for
and i just wanna dance with you
i wanna dance with you
hold you in my arms once more
thats what they invented dancing for
and i just wanna dance with you

chorus
i wanna dance with you
twirl you all around the floor
thats what they intended dancing for
i just wanna dance with you
i wanna dance with you
hold you in my arms once more
thats what they invented dancing for
and i just wanna dance with you

outro
i just wanna dance with you
i just wanna dance with you
i just wanna dance with youembed"
