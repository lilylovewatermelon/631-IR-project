heavy like a brinks truck
looking like im tiptop
shining like a wristwatch

lock it down til the thing pop
can you stick around for a minute til the ring stop

as time keeps slipping away slipping away
girl dont start feeling a way feeling a way

loving in pain loving in loving in pain
as time keeps slipping away slipping away
girl dont start feeling a way feeling a way
you and i we are one and the same
loving in pain loving in

ive been on the road and im sorry for the mixup
if you still love me can you see me during liftoff liftoff
