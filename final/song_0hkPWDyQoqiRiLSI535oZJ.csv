on the phone
hello hello
i cani can breathing down the side of the line
whywhy you so distressed
yes i killed people
gasp
i just did it right now
ive got blood all over my shoes and my clothes
my own fucking merchandise
do you know how it feels to have blood all over your fucking shirt with your face on it
crying
hello
well i need help
hangs up
no why the fuck did you hang up

verse 1  yomishious
am i sucker for punctures
in wounds and in car tires
when we exit the junction to the left with a full tank
i got destruction in my mind
when it lights up inside like a bull with some red horns
garage repairs cause it got badly teared
now there aint explaining this one but he aint changed his wheels for a good three years
and i aint complaining its just complicated
but tell the fucker that i used a spanner in two phrases to untighten the screws of the vehicle before we hit the road
then the speedbumps at the top of the street musta helped speed up the timeframe
the tables are turning
the world is unnerving
my minds collapsing
racks i need back crack skull smash blat
wackn splat on the floor ha

oh my god
are we doing this again
are we really doing this again
oh my god

verse 2  yomishious
did i mention he owes me a good few thousand dollars
cause we once played a single round or two of poker and i shelled out a few decks when he spent all his racks then was pressured under some debt  for not being able to pay up on his rent
a week before december
now its like he dont remember
so im losing my temper for not being payed back what i lended
and i attempted murder but it was in a fantasy world in my brain where i collected the payload
of a few millis in cheese by grating his spleen out like a paper machine
so im not much craving the breeze
and having no anxiety with no worry when i get my money
im just concerned with the mentality he has
so ill serve on some justice by picking up a knife and carving and serving a cold dish of revenge
it sounds so pleasant
binocular spotting
the tension is rotting
saw him leaving stacys then picking up a drive through at burger king
all these ideas i got jotted and these dots that are unfilled im filling
rear view mirror
hes going to the grocery store
now i knew he wasnt struggling
no more debt
i saw through his lies
no deceiving if you thought it would be me an easy target
do you take and perceive
to be a little minded bitch you could use
then you got played past the halfway line
i got a hundred pages of paper hanging pinned on my wall bout the way i wanna handle it as well as not being caught while handling it
its just business as per usual
spurt your lies one more time
and brainwash my mind like its fizzled and sizzled so try it and enjoy it
last time and last rhymes are a verse away so im taking you to nursery to learn your abcs your lmnops so you can craft out an apology
chorus  jacqueline irvine
oh my god
are we doing this again
are we really doing this again
oh my god

bridge  yomishious
gotta recapture my main element i had back during perfect disquise for us all to cement another killer verse
snatching the mic from you mumbling cocksuckers that dont know what the fuck you doing so im throwing you in a hearse

verse 3  yomishious
ignite a flame so that when in curiosity you follow that smoke rising above the buildings to see my name
itll leave ashes thatll be my past self
a version of simothy thats burning
he can never taint me again or snatch away my pen to lay down bars about killing a girlfriend in a bathtub to be discovered and chased down a hotel lobby by swat teams with automatic laser beams
hipll hop once i find my energy thats been my strong suit in this game since i came along and sprung my wings
droolndrop at the mic after i spit too many bars
this albums gonna be a hit and will shoot to the stars
be a step closer to the palm print on the hollywood walk of fame
going up bout to hit the planetary crust
im hydrogen nontoxic highly combustible
so after i set this in stone ill inflate with my ego then figure out what song concept i wanna have a tussle with at the pad next
cause im playing my cards close to the chest
got that little bit of my life in me in common with dexter
got simothy fighting battles out committing murders while having a sister with a law and order mind running us back like shes leading a hurd sure
you can think im a sheep on a grassy plain but when i take the grass smoke it up make me a wolf all the ideas no struggle thats why this verse started off as a freestyle
ill let you believe youre in control for a little while now
chorus  jacqueline irvine
oh my god
are we doing this again
are we really doing this again
oh my god
