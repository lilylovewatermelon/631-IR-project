yeah
yo

verse 1 mike shinoda
this is not the end this is not the beginnin
just a voice like a riot rockin every revision
but you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
and though the words sound steady somethin emptys within em
we say yeah with fists flyin up in the air
like were holdin onto somethin thats invisible there
cause were livin at the mercy of the pain and the fear
until we dead it forget it let it all disappear yeah

verse 2 chester bennington
waiting for the end to come
wishing i had strength to stand
this is not what i had planned
its out of my control
flying at the speed of light
thoughts were spinning in my head
so many things were left unsaid
its hard to let you go

chorus chester bennington
oh ohoh i know what it takes to move on
oh ohoh i know how it feels to lie
oh all i wanna do is trade this life for something new
oh holding on to what i havent got

chorus chester bennington
oh ohoh i know what it takes to move on

bridge mike shinoda
yo yo
what was left when that fire was gone
i thought it felt right but that right was wrong
all caught up in the eye of the storm
and tryin to figure out what its like movin on
and i dont even know what kind of things i said
my mouth kept movin and my mind went dead
so im pickin up the pieces now where to begin
the hardest part of endin is startin again ohoh

chorus chester bennington
all all aaaaall
all i wanna do is trade this life for something new
holding on to what i havent got
