i know you love a little late night
just me and you glowing with the brake light
silhouettes sipping with a halo
anything you want girl just say so
a little whisper off your lips yeah
said youre ready for the moonlight mix yeah
i keep you spinning til you get your fix
til the sky gets lit til the sunlight hits yeah

chorus
ive been given a piece of heaven
yeah youre my angel youre my angel tonight
did it hurt when you fell from the sky
pretty girl im gonna make you fly
see i was burning but you saved my life

i just gotta tell you now cause my heart cant wait girl
youre my angel youre my angel tonight
