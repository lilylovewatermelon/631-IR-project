born the middle son of a farmer
and a small town southern man
like his daddys daddy before him
brought up working on the land
fell in love with a small town woman
and they married up and settled down
natural way of life if youre lucky
for a small town southern man

verse 2
first there came four pretty daughters
for this small town southern man
then a few years later came another
a boy he wasnt planned
seven people living all together
in a house built with his own hands
little words with love and understanding
from a small town southern man

chorus
and he bowed his head to jesus
and he stood for uncle sam
and he only loved one woman
he was always proud of what he had
he said his greatest contribution
is the ones you leave behind
raised on the ways and gentle kindness
of a small town southern man

callous hands told the story
for this small town southern man
he gave it all to keep it all together
and keep his family on his land
like his daddy years wore out his body
made it hard just to walk and stand
you can break the back
but you cant break the spirit
of a small town southern man

chorus
and he bowed his head to jesus
and he stood for uncle sam
and he only loved one woman
he was always proud of what he had
he said his greatest contribution
is the ones you leave behind
raised on the ways and gentle kindness
of a small town southern man

verse 4
finally death came calling
for this small town southern man
he said its alright cause i see angels
and they got me by the hand
dont you cry and dont you worry
im blessed and i know i am
cause god has a place in heaven
for the small town southern man
chorus
and he bowed his head to jesus
and he stood for uncle sam
and he only loved one woman
he was always proud of what he had
he said his greatest contribution
is the ones you leave behind
raised on the ways and gentle kindness
of a small town southern man

outro
raised on the ways and gentle kindness
of a small town southern man4embed"
