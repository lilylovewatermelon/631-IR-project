hey sweet annie
dont take it so bad
you know the summers coming soon
though the interstate is choking under salt and dirty sand
and it seems the sun is hiding from the moon
your daddy told you
when you were a girl
the kind of things that come to those who wait
so give it a rest girl
take a deep breath girl
and meet me at the baystate tonight

chorus
and the snow is coming down
on our new england town
and its been falling all day long
what else is new
what could i do
i wrote a valley winter song
to play for you

verse 2
and late december
can drag a man down
you feel it deep in your gut
short days and afternoons spent pottering around
in a dark house with the windows painted shut
remember new york
staring outside
as reckless winter made its way
from staten island to the upper west side
whiting out our streets along the way
you might also likechorus
and the snow is coming down
on our new england town
and its been falling all day long
what else is new
what can i do
but sing this valley winter song
i wrote for youembed"
