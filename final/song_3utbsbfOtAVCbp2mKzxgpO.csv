dare me to reach a little higher
you can dare me to step over the edge
i dare you to dare me to go play with fire
im gonna do everything that you never did
ill leave my footprints on the water
bet on the dark horse until im a millionaire
and you can all sit back and say that im a loser
but i dont worry cause the truth is in the dare

verse 2
there was a time i was afraid of
the dark and monsters livin underneath my bed
and then i said enough is enough simply because
the only monsters were the voices in my head
