verse 1
what has this world come to
when a nigga like me could be perceived the american dream
life aint always what it seems my younguns
please believe strugglin always provokes the hustlin
to that we accustomed
you get acquainted with everybody throughout the hood
still dont trust em
trust is a serious thing
most niggas dont trust nobody they aint know since sixteen
does that mean the devil is in us of course
who you think is holdin us up to fall short
touch but dont taste taste but dont swallow
and these are the rules that we posed to follow

verse 2

cause a nigga with no cares is finally here
say what i want when i want fuck police
cause my gangsta niggas know we own the streets
with the wind beneath my wings ground under my feet
im the black rose nigga that grew from concrete
its the rule get it right or get it real hot
a whole lotta shots sent flying through your block gunshot
the one i need and oh before i leave
does anybody else feel they dont wanna breathe
been menacing this society since conceived
and nigga you know cold hearts dont bleed

chorus
still they pray for eternity never seein tomorrow
they just wishin the lord would take em away from the horror that
im currently bringin yall motherfuckers gonna hafta
murder me swingin the rule wont dieembed"
