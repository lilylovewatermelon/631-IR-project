leave me alone
leave me alone
im fine
ill be fine until the morning comes
then unmask me in the blistering sun

oh let me go
just let me go
just let me go
or ill burst in front of your eyes
then collect myself from the ground

and when i go
and when i go
just let me go
like a light
flickering out in the skies
lost as fast as was found

chorus
everything is easy when you never have to choose
but the balance has shifted and were forced to lose
like the sun and the moon i will circle you til you bloom
i will crush i will maul i will burn until i get to you
you might also likelay low
dont let me know when its real
will they quietly follow me here
will they take me as their own
now i will hold you i will keep you ill control my love
until it folds in my hands
but ill build it back to the top

chorus
everything is easy when you never have to choose
but the balance has shifted and were forced to lose
like the sun and the moon i will circle you til you bloom
i will crush i will maul i will burn until i get to you

outro x4
feel it rain
feel it rain
were alive
feel it rain
feel it rain
feel it rain
were alive
feel it rain
feel it rain
feel it rain
were alive
feel it rain
feel it rain
feel it rain
were alive
feel it rainembed"
