there comes a time
a time in everyones life
when nothing seems to go your way
where nothing seems to turn out right

there may come a time
you just cant seem to find your place
and for every door you open
seems like you get two slammed in your face

prechorus
thats when you need someone
someone that you you can call
when all your faith is gone
it feels like you cant go on

chorus
let it be me
let it be me
if its a friend you need
let it be me
let it be me

verse 2
when it feels like youre always comin up last
pockets full of nothin aint got no cash
no matter where you turn
you aint got no place to stand
you reach out for something and they slap your hand
you might also likei remember all too well
just how it feels to be all alone
to feel like youd give anything
for just a little place you can call your own

prechorus
thats when you need someone
someone that you can call
when all your faith is gone
and it feels like you cant go on

chorus
let it be me
let it be me
if its a friend you need
let it be me
let it be meembed"
