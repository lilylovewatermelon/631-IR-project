the stars are aligning
the future is bright
when i thought i’d never make it through girl
you got me right
everytime i see you walking by
i just want to chase you round the club just like it was the first time
i still get so excited baby
i just need a taste

hook
whenever i’m feeling low
whenever i can’t let go
whenever i want to party
you put your lovin on me
whenever i’m feelin crazy
whenever the world is hating
whenever i’m hurting baby
you put your lovin on me

that’s all i wanna do
put your lovin on
that’s all i need from you
put your lovin on me
that’s all i wanna do
put your lovin on
put your lovin on
put your lovin on me

dangerous body
dangerous face
dangerous ‘cause everybody wants some
i can’t give her no space

hook

bridge
take it off
put it on me
do what you want
be what you want to be

its on you
set it free
do what you want
tell me what you want to
