darling speak to me but dont you say a word
light a cigarette ill watch it as it burns
remember telling me that you thought you were cursed
im in love with every song youve ever heard

verse 2
if i could lose you i would
we buried your bones in plywood
if i could lose you i would
we buried your bones in plywood

prechorus
i said love is fast asleep
on a dirt road with your head on my shoulder

chorus
strawberry wine and all the time we used to have
those things i miss but know are never coming back
for you darling for you
no thing definеs a man like love that makes him soft
and sеntimental like a stranger in the park
for a few moments i see you

bridge
if i was empty space and you were a formless shape wed fit
but love leaves little runway and every time we run straight over it
if i was empty space and you were a formless shape wed fit
but love leaves little runway and every time i run straight over it
