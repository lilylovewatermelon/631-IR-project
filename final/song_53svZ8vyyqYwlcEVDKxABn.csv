everybodys doin some rappin and rockin
now its alright with me if its alright with you
you see i am mr t and what i got to tell
the truth about some nursery rhymes thats bound to ring your bell
let me tell you now little miss muffet sat on her tuffet eating bread and cheese
this big bad spider ran up her legs and she began to squeeze
said not one single crumb of bread youre gonna have my dear
the price i pay for this here food i cant afford to share
dont you bother checking out little tommy tucker
this poor kids got to sing like heck for a piece of bread and butter
and every time he gets a wife he takes it all away
so tommys in his clinker now 18 hours a day
little bo peep has lost her sheep they ran through a ravine
according to her neighbor tom they were never seen
tommy is the pipers son who stole a big fat pig
so he can have himself some dough to buy his wife a wig
when polly put her kettle on to make a cup of tea
she couldnt afford the meat or bread from the old storekeepers tree
so the butcher the baker the candlestick maker had to close their shop
if people cant afford to buy it these dudes are out of luck
old mother hubbard went to the cupboard to get herself a bone
when she got there the cupboard was bare the cockroaches had it gone
she turned to the pie man called simple simon said let me taste your ware
he said come to my place at 10 tonight i think fair is fair

who put him in little johnny green
wholl pull him out big tommy stout
what a naughty boy was he to do a thing like that
everybody say what a naughty boy was he to do a thing like that

mary had a little lamb she took him everywhere
she left him at a washroom door and went to check her gear
jack spratt he stole a lamb because the price of meat
has gone so high his big fat wife had nothing left to eat
so mary thought it was contrary she planted  seeds
she plucked up all the radishes that grew between her weeds
one day she ripped up her weeds and sold it at the corner
to wynken blynken and nod and jill and a kid they call jack horner
jack and jill went up a hill to fetch a pail of water
jill forgot to take her pill now jack he is a father
jill came home and told her dad he climbed up on the wall
the people on the ground yelled jump we like to see you fall
jack he got some candlesticks and piled them higher and higher
he tried to jump across the flame his pants had caught on fire
you should see him grin in pain you should see him grin and shout
when his two ding dongs fell out

everybody say ding dong bell dickys in the well
who put him in little johnny green
wholl pull him out big tommy stout
what a naughty boy was he to do a thing like that
everybody say what a naughty boy was he to do a thing like that
ding dong bell dickys in the well
who put him in little johnny green
wholl pull him out big tommy stout
what a naughty boy was he to do a thing like that
everybody say what a naughty boy was he to do a thing like that
what a naughty boy was he to do a thing like that
everybody say what a naughty boy was he to do a thing like that
what a naughty boy was he to do a thing like thatembed"
