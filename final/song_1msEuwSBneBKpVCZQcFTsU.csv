once upon a time
i believe it was a tuesday when i caught your eye
and we caught onto somethin
i hold onto the night
you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
were you just kiddin
cause it seems to me
this thing is breaking down we almost never speak
i dont feel welcome anymore
baby what happened please tell me
cause one second it was perfect
now youre halfway out the door

chorus
and i stare at the phone he still hasnt called
and then you feel so low you cant feel nothin at all
and you flashback to when he said forever and always oh
oh and it rains in your bedroom everythin is wrong
it rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
cause i was there when you said forever and always

verse 2
was i out of line
did i say somethin way too honest made you run and hide
like a scared little boy
i looked into your eyes
thought i knew you for a minute now im not so sure
so heres to everything coming down to nothin
heres to silence that cuts me to the core
where is this going
thought i knew for a minute but i dont anymore
