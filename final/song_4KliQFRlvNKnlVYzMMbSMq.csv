your eyes tell the stories of a day you wish you could
recall the moments that once have
retract the footsteps that brought us to this favor
i wouldnt ask this of you

prechorus
good eye sniper
here ill shoot you run

chorus
the words you scribbled on the walls
with the loss of friends you didnt have
ill call you when the time is right
are you in or are you out
for them all to know the end of us all

verse 2
run quick theyre behind us didnt think wed ever make it
this close to safety in one piece
now you wanna kill me in the act of what could maybe
save us from sleep and what we are

prechorus
good eye sniper
now i shoot you run

the words you scribbled on the walls
