wille man come on the 6 o’clock news
said somebody’s been shot somebody’s been abused
somebody blew up a building
somebody stole a car
somebody got away
somebody didn’t get too far yeah
they didn’t get too far

verse 2 willie nelson
grand pappy told my pappy back in my day son
a man had to answer for the wicked that he done
take all the rope in texas find a tall oak tree
round up all of them bad boys hang them high in the street
for all the people to see

chorus
that justice is the one thing you should always find
you gotta saddle up your boys
you gotta draw a hard line
when the gun smoke settles well sing a victory tune
and well all meet back at the local saloon
well raise up our glasses against evil forces
singin whiskey for my men beer for my horses

verse 3
we got too many gangsters doing dirty deeds
weve got too much corruption too much crime in the streets
it’s time the long arm of the law put a few more in the ground
send them all to their maker and hell settle them down
you can bet hell set them down cause
