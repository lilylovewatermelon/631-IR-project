in the eye of a hurricane
there is quiet
for just a moment
a yellow sky
when i was seventeen a hurricane
destroyed my town
i didn’t drown
i couldn’t seem to die

i wrote my way out
wrote everything down far as i could see
i wrote my way out
i looked up and the town had its eyes on me

they passed a plate around
total strangers
moved to kindness by my story
raised enough for me to book passage on a
ship that was new york bound…
i wrote my way out of hell
i wrote my way to revolution
i was louder than the crack in the bell
i wrote eliza love letters until she fell
i wrote about the constitution and defended it well
and in the face of ignorance and resistance
i wrote financial systems into existence
and when my prayers to god were met with indifference
i picked up a pen i wrote my own deliverance

there is quiet
for just a moment
a yellow sky
i was twelve when my mother died
she was holding me
we were sick and she was holding me
i couldn’t seem to die
