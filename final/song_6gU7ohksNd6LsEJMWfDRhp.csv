soma is what they would take when
hard times opened their eyes
saw pain in a new way
high stakes for a few names
racin against sunbeams
losin against fig trees
in your eyes

chorus
and i am
stop
and go
in your eyes
see i am
stop
and go
in your eyes

interlude
lets go

verse 2
when i saw her for the first time
lips moved as her eyes closed
heard something in his voice
and ill be there
he says then he walks out
somehow he was tryin
too hard to be like them
see the strokes liveget tickets as low as 122you might also likechorus
and i am
stop
and go
in your eyes
and i am
stop
oh darling let me go

outro
tried it once and they liked it
and tried to hide it

and these friends they keep askin for more
oh yeah oh but thats it14embed"
