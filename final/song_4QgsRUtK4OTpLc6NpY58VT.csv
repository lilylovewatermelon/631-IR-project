fly nigga couldnt tell me nothing different homes
and i be good til the fat woman sing a note
im tryna find lifes meaning up in this patron
im taking women to heaven and then i take em home
im waking up with something 20something fly shit
wanna stunt shit all that new designer shit
word she said she love me but she lying
shit im lying too told that bitch i love her for her mind
well thats quite true bustamove head game lovable
bust that pussy open turn that sofa to a fuckin pool
im playing cody smoking stogies make the rhythm better
im looking good in everything but she look good in leather
call me cocky i love it baby father a sucker
im longer than em i aint talking no rockin republic
i dont shop in the public aint finna wait in line
this not a free throw this easy as a layup line

pimpstroll on em the pen cold on em
couldnt fuck with it with a million nymphos on ya
bitches tend to love a nigga with the most money
i tell em honey i no cher im so sunny
and this is all probono
allstar weekend floor seats by the coaches
flying all frequent reclining on beaches
half a millie on the road yall relyin on features
i aint married but im tryna find a keeper
if she cook and keep her vagina like a secret
and we fuck i beast up and throw a little peace up
so peace out ima get up with you in like 3 months
word absence will make the heart grow
with that said i aint around like my old combs
and i be drinking all the brown straight no coke
im chasing money not the liquor yall aint even close
so lets have a toast everything fine
this aint a free throw this easy as a layup line

chorus neyo
if i got time you got time too
you with a boss baby so when i move you move
lets have some drinks malibu red how i do
and after that we do whatever we want to
girl im in charge that means im coolin
i have my own agenda that means im coolin
baby im large that means im coolin
dealin with a winner that mean im coolin2embed"
