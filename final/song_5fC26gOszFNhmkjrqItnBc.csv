im not satisfied
with that look up in your eyes
with that face you make when i come down around here lately
baby i just wanna ride
with the cool kids kickin it watching all the other six
fools on the interstate
sugarshakin making it lit like christmas trees

refrain
light it up let it glow let it pull let it blow
up and dry
youre up and dry
a hundred suns hundred notes easy come easy go
up and dry
youre up and dry

prechorus
dont you ever feel like you ever wanted anything more
than everybody anybody else
seventeen and bad was the best you never had
and you wont
sins you never said for yourself

chorus
seven six five four three two one
everybody got a name
everybody got a number
seven sins six frames
five for the two of us
three is too much if theres only one love and
you might also likerefrain
here he come let him know leave him hung let him go
up to dry
youre up to dry
light it up let it glow let it pull let it blow
up to dry
youre up to dry

verse 2
i dont believe that anybodys god ever felt this way
cause if they had they never wouldve made me
theyd say hell no wake me up at ten
tomorrow for my sake keep the volume down please
doesnt everybody try to do their best at what they do best
and do less of the bad to begin with
doesnt leaving me mean a little less if you left my life
but never loved to begin with
you never loved to begin with
you never loved me
you never loved to begin with
you never loved me

prechorus
dont you ever feel like you ever wanted anything more
than everybody anybody else
seventeen and bad was the best you never had
and you wont sins you never said to yourself

seven sins six frames
five for the two of us
three is too much if theres only one love and

refrain

up to dry
youre up to dry
light it up let it glow let it pull let it blow

and the seventh day youll leave
and every day youre here
