on the second day not long after dawn while lying in his berth his mate came below informing him that a strange sail was coming into the bay ships were then not so plenty in those waters as now he rose dressed and went on deck

the morning was one peculiar to that coast everything was mute and calm everything gray the sea though undulated into long roods of swells seemed fixed and was sleeked at the surface like waved lead that has cooled and set in the smelters mould the sky seemed a gray surtout flights of troubled gray fowl kith and kin with flights of troubled gray vapors among which they were mixed skimmed low and fitfully over the waters as swallows over meadows before storms shadows present foreshadowing deeper shadows to come

to captain delanos surprise the stranger viewed through the glass showed no colors though to do so upon entering a haven however uninhabited in its shores where but a single other ship might be lying was the custom among peaceful seamen of all nations considering the lawlessness and loneliness of the spot and the sort of stories at that day associated with those seas captain delanos surprise might have deepened into some uneasiness had he not been a person of a singularly undistrustful goodnature not liable except on extraordinary and repeated incentives and hardly then to indulge in personal alarms any way involving the imputation of malign evil in man whether in view of what humanity is capable such a trait implies along with a benevolent heart more than ordinary quickness and accuracy of intellectual perception may be left to the wise to determine

but whatever misgivings might have obtruded on first seeing the stranger would almost in any seamans mind have been dissipated by observing that the ship in navigating into the harbor was drawing too near the land a sunken reef making out off her bow this seemed to prove her a stranger indeed not only to the sealer but the island consequently she could be no wonted freebooter on that ocean with no small interest captain delano continued to watch her—a proceeding not much facilitated by the vapors partly mantling the hull through which the far matin light from her cabin streamed equivocally enough much like the sun—by this time hemisphered on the rim of the horizon and apparently in company with the strange ship entering the harbor—which wimpled by the same low creeping clouds showed not unlike a lima intriguantes one sinister eye peering across the plaza from the indian loophole of her dusk sayaymanta

it might have been but a deception of the vapors but the longer the stranger was watched the more singular appeared her manoeuvres ere long it seemed hard to decide whether she meant to come in or no—what she wanted or what she was about the wind which had breezed up a little during the night was now extremely light and baffling which the more increased the apparent uncertainty of her movements surmising at last that it might be a ship in distress captain delano ordered his whaleboat to be dropped and much to the wary opposition of his mate prepared to board her and at the least pilot her in on the night previous a fishingparty of the seamen had gone a long distance to some detached rocks out of sight from the sealer and an hour or two before daybreak had returned having met with no small success presuming that the stranger might have been long off soundings the good captain put several baskets of the fish for presents into his boat and so pulled away from her continuing too near the sunken reef deeming her in danger calling to his men he made all haste to apprise those on board of their situation but some time ere the boat came up the wind light though it was having shifted had headed the vessel off as well as partly broken the vapors from about her

upon gaining a less remote view the ship when made signally visible on the verge of the leadenhued swells with the shreds of fog here and there raggedly furring her appeared like a whitewashed monastery after a thunderstorm seen perched upon some dun cliff among the pyrenees but it was no purely fanciful resemblance which now for a moment almost led captain delano to think that nothing less than a shipload of monks was before him peering over the bulwarks were what really seemed in the hazy distance throngs of dark cowls while fitfully revealed through the open portholes other dark moving figures were dimly descried as of black friars pacing the cloisters

upon a still nigher approach this appearance was modified and the true character of the vessel was plain—a spanish merchantman of the first class carrying negro slaves amongst other valuable freight from one colonial port to another a very large and in its time a very fine vessel such as in those days were at intervals encountered along that main sometimes superseded acapulco treasureships or retired frigates of the spanish kings navy which like superannuated italian palaces still under a decline of masters preserved signs of former state

as the whaleboat drew more and more nigh the cause of the peculiar pipeclayed aspect of the stranger was seen in the slovenly neglect pervading her the spars ropes and great part of the bulwarks looked woolly from long unacquaintance with the scraper tar and the brush her keel seemed laid her ribs put together and she launched from ezekiels valley of dry bones

in the present business in which she was engaged the ships general model and rig appeared to have undergone no material change from their original warlike and froissart pattern however no guns were seen

the tops were large and were railed about with what had once been octagonal network all now in sad disrepair these tops hung overhead like three ruinous aviaries in one of which was seen perched on a ratlin a white noddy a strange fowl so called from its lethargic somnambulistic character being frequently caught by hand at sea battered and mouldy the castellated forecastle seemed some ancient turret long ago taken by assault and then left to decay toward the stern two highraised quarter galleries—the balustrades here and there covered with dry tindery seamoss—opening out from the unoccupied statecabin whose deadlights for all the mild weather were hermetically closed and calked—these tenantless balconies hung over the sea as if it were the grand venetian canal but the principal relic of faded grandeur was the ample oval of the shieldlike sternpiece intricately carved with the arms of castile and leon medallioned about by groups of mythological or symbolical devices uppermost and central of which was a dark satyr in a mask holding his foot on the prostrate neck of a writhing figure likewise masked

whether the ship had a figurehead or only a plain beak was not quite certain owing to canvas wrapped about that part either to protect it while undergoing a refurbishing or else decently to hide its decay rudely painted or chalked as in a sailor freak along the forward side of a sort of pedestal below the canvas was the sentence seguid vuestro jefe follow your leader while upon the tarnished headboards near by appeared in stately capitals once gilt the ships name san dominick each letter streakingly corroded with tricklings of copperspike rust while like mourning weeds dark festoons of seagrass slimily swept to and fro over the name with every hearselike roll of the hull

as at last the boat was hooked from the bow along toward the gangway amidship its keel while yet some inches separated from the hull harshly grated as on a sunken coral reef it proved a huge bunch of conglobated barnacles adhering below the water to the side like a wen—a token of baffling airs and long calms passed somewhere in those seas
climbing the side the visitor was at once surrounded by a clamorous throng of whites and blacks but the latter outnumbering the former more than could have been expected negro transportationship as the stranger in port was but in one language and as with one voice all poured out a common tale of suffering in which the negresses of whom there were not a few exceeded the others in their dolorous vehemence the scurvy together with the fever had swept off a great part of their number more especially the spaniards off cape horn they had narrowly escaped shipwreck then for days together they had lain tranced without wind their provisions were low their water next to none their lips that moment were baked

while captain delano was thus made the mark of all eager tongues his one eager glance took in all faces with every other object about him

always upon first boarding a large and populous ship at sea especially a foreign one with a nondescript crew such as lascars or manilla men the impression varies in a peculiar way from that produced by first entering a strange house with strange inmates in a strange land both house and ship—the one by its walls and blinds the other by its high bulwarks like ramparts—hoard from view their interiors till the last moment but in the case of the ship there is this addition that the living spectacle it contains upon its sudden and complete disclosure has in contrast with the blank ocean which zones it something of the effect of enchantment the ship seems unreal these strange costumes gestures and faces but a shadowy tableau just emerged from the deep which directly must receive back what it gave

perhaps it was some such influence as above is attempted to be described which in captain delanos mind heightened whatever upon a staid scrutiny might have seemed unusual especially the conspicuous figures of four elderly grizzled negroes their heads like black doddered willow tops who in venerable contrast to the tumult below them were couched sphynxlike one on the starboard cathead another on the larboard and the remaining pair face to face on the opposite bulwarks above the mainchains they each had bits of unstranded old junk in their hands and with a sort of stoical selfcontent were picking the junk into oakum a small heap of which lay by their sides they accompanied the task with a continuous low monotonous chant droning and drilling away like so many grayheaded bagpipers playing a funeral march

the quarterdeck rose into an ample elevated poop upon the forward verge of which lifted like the oakumpickers some eight feet above the general throng sat along in a row separated by regular spaces the crosslegged figures of six other blacks each with a rusty hatchet in his hand which with a bit of brick and a rag he was engaged like a scullion in scouring while between each two was a small stack of hatchets their rusted edges turned forward awaiting a like operation though occasionally the four oakumpickers would briefly address some person or persons in the crowd below yet the six hatchetpolishers neither spoke to others nor breathed a whisper among themselves but sat intent upon their task except at intervals when with the peculiar love in negroes of uniting industry with pastime two and two they sideways clashed their hatchets together like cymbals with a barbarous din all six unlike the generality had the raw aspect of unsophisticated africans

but that first comprehensive glance which took in those ten figures with scores less conspicuous rested but an instant upon them as impatient of the hubbub of voices the visitor turned in quest of whomsoever it might be that commanded the ship

but as if not unwilling to let nature make known her own case among his suffering charge or else in despair of restraining it for the time the spanish captain a gentlemanly reservedlooking and rather young man to a strangers eye dressed with singular richness but bearing plain traces of recent sleepless cares and disquietudes stood passively by leaning against the mainmast at one moment casting a dreary spiritless look upon his excited people at the next an unhappy glance toward his visitor by his side stood a black of small stature in whose rude face as occasionally like a shepherds dog he mutely turned it up into the spaniards sorrow and affection were equally blended

struggling through the throng the american advanced to the spaniard assuring him of his sympathies and offering to render whatever assistance might be in his power to which the spaniard returned for the present but grave and ceremonious acknowledgments his national formality dusked by the saturnine mood of illhealth

but losing no time in mere compliments captain delano returning to the gangway had his basket of fish brought up and as the wind still continued light so that some hours at least must elapse ere the ship could be brought to the anchorage he bade his men return to the sealer and fetch back as much water as the whaleboat could carry with whatever soft bread the steward might have all the remaining pumpkins on board with a box of sugar and a dozen of his private bottles of cider

not many minutes after the boats pushing off to the vexation of all the wind entirely died away and the tide turning began drifting back the ship helplessly seaward but trusting this would not long last captain delano sought with good hopes to cheer up the strangers feeling no small satisfaction that with persons in their condition he could—thanks to his frequent voyages along the spanish main—converse with some freedom in their native tongue

while left alone with them he was not long in observing some things tending to heighten his first impressions but surprise was lost in pity both for the spaniards and blacks alike evidently reduced from scarcity of water and provisions while longcontinued suffering seemed to have brought out the less goodnatured qualities of the negroes besides at the same time impairing the spaniards authority over them but under the circumstances precisely this condition of things was to have been anticipated in armies navies cities or families in nature herself nothing more relaxes good order than misery still captain delano was not without the idea that had benito cereno been a man of greater energy misrule would hardly have come to the present pass but the debility constitutional or induced by hardships bodily and mental of the spanish captain was too obvious to be overlooked a prey to settled dejection as if long mocked with hope he would not now indulge it even when it had ceased to be a mock the prospect of that day or evening at furthest lying at anchor with plenty of water for his people and a brother captain to counsel and befriend seemed in no perceptible degree to encourage him his mind appeared unstrung if not still more seriously affected shut up in these oaken walls chained to one dull round of command whose unconditionality cloyed him like some hypochondriac abbot he moved slowly about at times suddenly pausing starting or staring biting his lip biting his fingernail flushing paling twitching his beard with other symptoms of an absent or moody mind this distempered spirit was lodged as before hinted in as distempered a frame he was rather tall but seemed never to have been robust and now with nervous suffering was almost worn to a skeleton a tendency to some pulmonary complaint appeared to have been lately confirmed his voice was like that of one with lungs half gone—hoarsely suppressed a husky whisper no wonder that as in this state he tottered about his private servant apprehensively followed him sometimes the negro gave his master his arm or took his handkerchief out of his pocket for him performing these and similar offices with that affectionate zeal which transmutes into something filial or fraternal acts in themselves but menial and which has gained for the negro the repute of making the most pleasing bodyservant in the world one too whom a master need be on no stiffly superior terms with but may treat with familiar trust less a servant than a devoted companion

marking the noisy indocility of the blacks in general as well as what seemed the sullen inefficiency of the whites it was not without humane satisfaction that captain delano witnessed the steady good conduct of babo

but the good conduct of babo hardly more than the illbehavior of others seemed to withdraw the halflunatic don benito from his cloudy languor not that such precisely was the impression made by the spaniard on the mind of his visitor the spaniards individual unrest was for the present but noted as a conspicuous feature in the ships general affliction still captain delano was not a little concerned at what he could not help taking for the time to be don benitos unfriendly indifference towards himself the spaniards manner too conveyed a sort of sour and gloomy disdain which he seemed at no pains to disguise but this the american in charity ascribed to the harassing effects of sickness since in former instances he had noted that there are peculiar natures on whom prolonged physical suffering seems to cancel every social instinct of kindness as if forced to black bread themselves they deemed it but equity that each person coming nigh them should indirectly by some slight or affront be made to partake of their fare
but ere long captain delano bethought him that indulgent as he was at the first in judging the spaniard he might not after all have exercised charity enough at bottom it was don benitos reserve which displeased him but the same reserve was shown towards all but his faithful personal attendant even the formal reports which according to seausage were at stated times made to him by some petty underling either a white mulatto or black he hardly had patience enough to listen to without betraying contemptuous aversion his manner upon such occasions was in its degree not unlike that which might be supposed to have been his imperial countrymans charles v just previous to the anchoritish retirement of that monarch from the throne

this splenetic disrelish of his place was evinced in almost every function pertaining to it proud as he was moody he condescended to no personal mandate whatever special orders were necessary their delivery was delegated to his bodyservant who in turn transferred them to their ultimate destination through runners alert spanish boys or slave boys like pages or pilotfish within easy call continually hovering round don benito so that to have beheld this undemonstrative invalid gliding about apathetic and mute no landsman could have dreamed that in him was lodged a dictatorship beyond which while at sea there was no earthly appeal

thus the spaniard regarded in his reserve seemed the involuntary victim of mental disorder but in fact his reserve might in some degree have proceeded from design if so then here was evinced the unhealthy climax of that icy though conscientious policy more or less adopted by all commanders of large ships which except in signal emergencies obliterates alike the manifestation of sway with every trace of sociality transforming the man into a block or rather into a loaded cannon which until there is call for thunder has nothing to say

viewing him in this light it seemed but a natural token of the perverse habit induced by a long course of such hard selfrestraint that notwithstanding the present condition of his ship the spaniard should still persist in a demeanor which however harmless or it may be appropriate in a wellappointed vessel such as the san dominick might have been at the outset of the voyage was anything but judicious now but the spaniard perhaps thought that it was with captains as with gods reserve under all events must still be their cue but probably this appearance of slumbering dominion might have been but an attempted disguise to conscious imbecility—not deep policy but shallow device but be all this as it might whether don benitos manner was designed or not the more captain delano noted its pervading reserve the less he felt uneasiness at any particular manifestation of that reserve towards himself

neither were his thoughts taken up by the captain alone wonted to the quiet orderliness of the sealers comfortable family of a crew the noisy confusion of the san dominicks suffering host repeatedly challenged his eye some prominent breaches not only of discipline but of decency were observed these captain delano could not but ascribe in the main to the absence of those subordinate deckofficers to whom along with higher duties is intrusted what may be styled the police department of a populous ship true the old oakumpickers appeared at times to act the part of monitorial constables to their countrymen the blacks but though occasionally succeeding in allaying trifling outbreaks now and then between man and man they could do little or nothing toward establishing general quiet the san dominick was in the condition of a transatlantic emigrant ship among whose multitude of living freight are some individuals doubtless as little troublesome as crates and bales but the friendly remonstrances of such with their ruder companions are of not so much avail as the unfriendly arm of the mate what the san dominick wanted was what the emigrant ship has stern superior officers but on these decks not so much as a fourthmate was to be seen

the visitors curiosity was roused to learn the particulars of those mishaps which had brought about such absenteeism with its consequences because though deriving some inkling of the voyage from the wails which at the first moment had greeted him yet of the details no clear understanding had been had the best account would doubtless be given by the captain yet at first the visitor was loth to ask it unwilling to provoke some distant rebuff but plucking up courage he at last accosted don benito renewing the expression of his benevolent interest adding that did he captain delano but know the particulars of the ships misfortunes he would perhaps be better able in the end to relieve them would don benito favor him with the whole story

don benito faltered then like some somnambulist suddenly interfered with vacantly stared at his visitor and ended by looking down on the deck he maintained this posture so long that captain delano almost equally disconcerted and involuntarily almost as rude turned suddenly from him walking forward to accost one of the spanish seamen for the desired information but he had hardly gone five paces when with a sort of eagerness don benito invited him back regretting his momentary absence of mind and professing readiness to gratify him

while most part of the story was being given the two captains stood on the after part of the maindeck a privileged spot no one being near but the servant

it is now a hundred and ninety days began the spaniard in his husky whisper that this ship well officered and well manned with several cabin passengers—some fifty spaniards in all—sailed from buenos ayres bound to lima with a general cargo hardware paraguay tea and the like—and pointing forward that parcel of negroes now not more than a hundred and fifty as you see but then numbering over three hundred souls off cape horn we had heavy gales in one moment by night three of my best officers with fifteen sailors were lost with the mainyard the spar snapping under them in the slings as they sought with heavers to beat down the icy sail to lighten the hull the heavier sacks of mata were thrown into the sea with most of the waterpipes lashed on deck at the time and this last necessity it was combined with the prolonged detections afterwards experienced which eventually brought about our chief causes of suffering when—

here there was a sudden fainting attack of his cough brought on no doubt by his mental distress his servant sustained him and drawing a cordial from his pocket placed it to his lips he a little revived but unwilling to leave him unsupported while yet imperfectly restored the black with one arm still encircled his master at the same time keeping his eye fixed on his face as if to watch for the first sign of complete restoration or relapse as the event might prove

the spaniard proceeded but brokenly and obscurely as one in a dream

—oh my god rather than pass through what i have with joy i would have hailed the most terrible gales but—

his cough returned and with increased violence this subsiding with reddened lips and closed eyes he fell heavily against his supporter
his mind wanders he was thinking of the plague that followed the gales plaintively sighed the servant my poor poor master wringing one hand and with the other wiping the mouth but be patient señor again turning to captain delano these fits do not last long master will soon be himself

don benito reviving went on but as this portion of the story was very brokenly delivered the substance only will here be set down

it appeared that after the ship had been many days tossed in storms off the cape the scurvy broke out carrying off numbers of the whites and blacks when at last they had worked round into the pacific their spars and sails were so damaged and so inadequately handled by the surviving mariners most of whom were become invalids that unable to lay her northerly course by the wind which was powerful the unmanageable ship for successive days and nights was blown northwestward where the breeze suddenly deserted her in unknown waters to sultry calms the absence of the waterpipes now proved as fatal to life as before their presence had menaced it induced or at least aggravated by the more than scanty allowance of water a malignant fever followed the scurvy with the excessive heat of the lengthened calm making such short work of it as to sweep away as by billows whole families of the africans and a yet larger number proportionably of the spaniards including by a luckless fatality every remaining officer on board consequently in the smart west winds eventually following the calm the already rent sails having to be simply dropped not furled at need had been gradually reduced to the beggars rags they were now to procure substitutes for his lost sailors as well as supplies of water and sails the captain at the earliest opportunity had made for baldivia the southernmost civilized port of chili and south america but upon nearing the coast the thick weather had prevented him from so much as sighting that harbor since which period almost without a crew and almost without canvas and almost without water and at intervals giving its added dead to the sea the san dominick had been battledored about by contrary winds inveigled by currents or grown weedy in calms like a man lost in woods more than once she had doubled upon her own track

but throughout these calamities huskily continued don benito painfully turning in the half embrace of his servant i have to thank those negroes you see who though to your inexperienced eyes appearing unruly have indeed conducted themselves with less of restlessness than even their owner could have thought possible under such circumstances

here he again fell faintly back again his mind wandered but he rallied and less obscurely proceeded

yes their owner was quite right in assuring me that no fetters would be needed with his blacks so that while as is wont in this transportation those negroes have always remained upon deck—not thrust below as in the guineamen—they have also from the beginning been freely permitted to range within given bounds at their pleasure

once more the faintness returned—his mind roved—but recovering he resumed

but it is babo here to whom under god i owe not only my own preservation but likewise to him chiefly the merit is due of pacifying his more ignorant brethren when at intervals tempted to murmurings

ah master sighed the black bowing his face dont speak of me babo is nothing what babo has done was but duty

faithful fellow cried captain delano don benito i envy you such a friend slave i cannot call him

as master and man stood before him the black upholding the white captain delano could not but bethink him of the beauty of that relationship which could present such a spectacle of fidelity on the one hand and confidence on the other the scene was heightened by the contrast in dress denoting their relative positions the spaniard wore a loose chili jacket of dark velvet white smallclothes and stockings with silver buckles at the knee and instep a highcrowned sombrero of fine grass a slender sword silver mounted hung from a knot in his sash—the last being an almost invariable adjunct more for utility than ornament of a south american gentlemans dress to this hour excepting when his occasional nervous contortions brought about disarray there was a certain precision in his attire curiously at variance with the unsightly disorder around especially in the belittered ghetto forward of the mainmast wholly occupied by the blacks

the servant wore nothing but wide trowsers apparently from their coarseness and patches made out of some old topsail they were clean and confined at the waist by a bit of unstranded rope which with his composed deprecatory air at times made him look something like a begging friar of st francis

however unsuitable for the time and place at least in the bluntthinking americans eyes and however strangely surviving in the midst of all his afflictions the toilette of don benito might not in fashion at least have gone beyond the style of the day among south americans of his class though on the present voyage sailing from buenos ayres he had avowed himself a native and resident of chili whose inhabitants had not so generally adopted the plain coat and once plebeian pantaloons but with a becoming modification adhered to their provincial costume picturesque as any in the world still relatively to the pale history of the voyage and his own pale face there seemed something so incongruous in the spaniards apparel as almost to suggest the image of an invalid courtier tottering about london streets in the time of the plague

the portion of the narrative which perhaps most excited interest as well as some surprise considering the latitudes in question was the long calms spoken of and more particularly the ships so long drifting about without communicating the opinion of course the american could not but impute at least part of the detentions both to clumsy seamanship and faulty navigation eying don benitos small yellow hands he easily inferred that the young captain had not got into command at the hawsehole but the cabinwindow and if so why wonder at incompetence in youth sickness and gentility united

but drowning criticism in compassion after a fresh repetition of his sympathies captain delano having heard out his story not only engaged as in the first place to see don benito and his people supplied in their immediate bodily needs but also now farther promised to assist him in procuring a large permanent supply of water as well as some sails and rigging and though it would involve no small embarrassment to himself yet he would spare three of his best seamen for temporary deck officers so that without delay the ship might proceed to conception there fully to refit for lima her destined port

such generosity was not without its effect even upon the invalid his face lighted up eager and hectic he met the honest glance of his visitor with gratitude he seemed overcome

this excitement is bad for master whispered the servant taking his arm and with soothing words gently drawing him aside

when don benito returned the american was pained to observe that his hopefulness like the sudden kindling in his cheek was but febrile and transient

ere long with a joyless mien looking up towards the poop the host invited his guest to accompany him there for the benefit of what little breath of wind might be stirring

as during the telling of the story captain delano had once or twice started at the occasional cymballing of the hatchetpolishers wondering why such an interruption should be allowed especially in that part of the ship and in the ears of an invalid and moreover as the hatchets had anything but an attractive look and the handlers of them still less so it was therefore to tell the truth not without some lurking reluctance or even shrinking it may be that captain delano with apparent complaisance acquiesced in his hosts invitation the more so since with an untimely caprice of punctilio rendered distressing by his cadaverous aspect don benito with castilian bows solemnly insisted upon his guests preceding him up the ladder leading to the elevation where one on each side of the last step sat for armorial supporters and sentries two of the ominous file gingerly enough stepped good captain delano between them and in the instant of leaving them behind like one running the gauntlet he felt an apprehensive twitch in the calves of his legs

but when facing about he saw the whole file like so many organgrinders still stupidly intent on their work unmindful of everything beside he could not but smile at his late fidgety panic

presently while standing with his host looking forward upon the decks below he was struck by one of those instances of insubordination previously alluded to three black boys with two spanish boys were sitting together on the hatches scraping a rude wooden platter in which some scanty mess had recently been cooked suddenly one of the black boys enraged at a word dropped by one of his white companions seized a knife and though called to forbear by one of the oakumpickers struck the lad over the head inflicting a gash from which blood flowed

in amazement captain delano inquired what this meant to which the pale don benito dully muttered that it was merely the sport of the lad

pretty serious sport truly rejoined captain delano had such a thing happened on board the bachelors delight instant punishment would have followed

at these words the spaniard turned upon the american one of his sudden staring halflunatic looks then relapsing into his torpor answered doubtless doubtless señor

is it thought captain delano that this hapless man is one of those paper captains ive known who by policy wink at what by power they cannot put down i know no sadder sight than a commander who has little of command but the name

i should think don benito he now said glancing towards the oakumpicker who had sought to interfere with the boys that you would find it advantageous to keep all your blacks employed especially the younger ones no matter at what useless task and no matter what happens to the ship why even with my little band i find such a course indispensable i once kept a crew on my quarterdeck thrumming mats for my cabin when for three days i had given up my ship—mats men and all—for a speedy loss owing to the violence of a gale in which we could do nothing but helplessly drive before it

doubtless doubtless muttered don benito

but continued captain delano again glancing upon the oakumpickers and then at the hatchetpolishers near by i see you keep some at least of your host employed

yes was again the vacant response

those old men there shaking their pows from their pulpits continued captain delano pointing to the oakumpickers seem to act the part of old dominies to the rest little heeded as their admonitions are at times is this voluntary on their part don benito or have you appointed them shepherds to your flock of black sheep

what posts they fill i appointed them rejoined the spaniard in an acrid tone as if resenting some supposed satiric reflection

and these others these ashantee conjurors here continued captain delano rather uneasily eying the brandished steel of the hatchetpolishers where in spots it had been brought to a shine this seems a curious business they are at don benito

in the gales we met answered the spaniard what of our general cargo was not thrown overboard was much damaged by the brine since coming into calm weather i have had several cases of knives and hatchets daily brought up for overhauling and cleaning

a prudent idea don benito you are part owner of ship and cargo i presume but none of the slaves perhaps

i am owner of all you see impatiently returned don benito except the main company of blacks who belonged to my late friend alexandro aranda

as he mentioned this name his air was heartbroken his knees shook his servant supported him

thinking he divined the cause of such unusual emotion to confirm his surmise captain delano after a pause said and may i ask don benito whether—since awhile ago you spoke of some cabin passengers—the friend whose loss so afflicts you at the outset of the voyage accompanied his blacks

yes

but died of the fever

died of the fever oh could i but—

again quivering the spaniard paused

pardon me said captain delano lowly but i think that by a sympathetic experience i conjecture don benito what it is that gives the keener edge to your grief it was once my hard fortune to lose at sea a dear friend my own brother then supercargo assured of the welfare of his spirit its departure i could have borne like a man but that honest eye that honest hand—both of which had so often met mine—and that warm heart all all—like scraps to the dogs—to throw all to the sharks it was then i vowed never to have for fellowvoyager a man i loved unless unbeknown to him i had provided every requisite in case of a fatality for embalming his mortal part for interment on shore were your friends remains now on board this ship don benito not thus strangely would the mention of his name affect you

on board this ship echoed the spaniard then with horrified gestures as directed against some spectre he unconsciously fell into the ready arms of his attendant who with a silent appeal toward captain delano seemed beseeching him not again to broach a theme so unspeakably distressing to his master

this poor fellow now thought the pained american is the victim of that sad superstition which associates goblins with the deserted body of man as ghosts with an abandoned house how unlike are we made what to me in like case would have been a solemn satisfaction the bare suggestion even terrifies the spaniard into this trance poor alexandro aranda what would you say could you here see your friend—who on former voyages when you for months were left behind has i dare say often longed and longed for one peep at you—now transported with terror at the least thought of having you anyway nigh him

at this moment with a dreary graveyard toll betokening a flaw the ships forecastle bell smote by one of the grizzled oakumpickers proclaimed ten oclock through the leaden calm when captain delanos attention was caught by the moving figure of a gigantic black emerging from the general crowd below and slowly advancing towards the elevated poop an iron collar was about his neck from which depended a chain thrice wound round his body the terminating links padlocked together at a broad band of iron his girdle

how like a mute atufal moves murmured the servant

the black mounted the steps of the poop and like a brave prisoner brought up to receive sentence stood in unquailing muteness before don benito now recovered from his attack

at the first glimpse of his approach don benito had started a resentful shadow swept over his face and as with the sudden memory of bootless rage his white lips glued together

this is some mulish mutineer thought captain delano surveying not without a mixture of admiration the colossal form of the negro

see he waits your question master said the servant

thus reminded don benito nervously averting his glance as if shunning by anticipation some rebellious response in a disconcerted voice thus spoke—

atufal will you ask my pardon now

the black was silent

again master murmured the servant with bitter upbraiding eyeing his countryman again master he will bend to master yet

answer said don benito still averting his glance say but the one word pardon and your chains shall be off

upon this the black slowly raising both arms let them lifelessly fall his links clanking his head bowed as much as to say no i am content

go said don benito with inkept and unknown emotion

deliberately as he had come the black obeyed

excuse me don benito said captain delano but this scene surprises me what means it pray

it means that that negro alone of all the band has given me peculiar cause of offense i have put him in chains i—

here he paused his hand to his head as if there were a swimming there or a sudden bewilderment of memory had come over him but meeting his servants kindly glance seemed reassured and proceeded—

i could not scourge such a form but i told him he must ask my pardon as yet he has not at my command every two hours he stands before me

and how long has this been

some sixty days

and obedient in all else and respectful

yes

upon my conscience then exclaimed captain delano impulsively he has a royal spirit in him this fellow

he may have some right to it bitterly returned don benito he says he was king in his own land

yes said the servant entering a word those slits in atufals ears once held wedges of gold but poor babo here in his own land was only a poor slave a black mans slave was babo who now is the whites

somewhat annoyed by these conversational familiarities captain delano turned curiously upon the attendant then glanced inquiringly at his master but as if long wonted to these little informalities neither master nor man seemed to understand him

what pray was atufals offense don benito asked captain delano if it was not something very serious take a fools advice and in view of his general docility as well as in some natural respect for his spirit remit him his penalty

no no master never will do that here murmured the servant to himself proud atufal must first ask masters pardon the slave there carries the padlock but master here carries the key

his attention thus directed captain delano now noticed for the first that suspended by a slender silken cord from don benitos neck hung a key at once from the servants muttered syllables divining the keys purpose he smiled and said—so don benito—padlock and key—significant symbols truly

biting his lip don benito faltered

though the remark of captain delano a man of such native simplicity as to be incapable of satire or irony had been dropped in playful allusion to the spaniards singularly evidenced lordship over the black yet the hypochondriac seemed some way to have taken it as a malicious reflection upon his confessed inability thus far to break down at least on a verbal summons the entrenched will of the slave deploring this supposed misconception yet despairing of correcting it captain delano shifted the subject but finding his companion more than ever withdrawn as if still sourly digesting the lees of the presumed affront abovementioned byandby captain delano likewise became less talkative oppressed against his own will by what seemed the secret vindictiveness of the morbidly sensitive spaniard but the good sailor himself of a quite contrary disposition refrained on his part alike from the appearance as from the feeling of resentment and if silent was only so from contagion

presently the spaniard assisted by his servant somewhat discourteously crossed over from his guest a procedure which sensibly enough might have been allowed to pass for idle caprice of illhumor had not master and man lingering round the corner of the elevated skylight began whispering together in low voices this was unpleasing and more the moody air of the spaniard which at times had not been without a sort of valetudinarian stateliness now seemed anything but dignified while the menial familiarity of the servant lost its original charm of simplehearted attachment

in his embarrassment the visitor turned his face to the other side of the ship by so doing his glance accidentally fell on a young spanish sailor a coil of rope in his hand just stepped from the deck to the first round of the mizzenrigging perhaps the man would not have been particularly noticed were it not that during his ascent to one of the yards he with a sort of covert intentness kept his eye fixed on captain delano from whom presently it passed as if by a natural sequence to the two whisperers

his own attention thus redirected to that quarter captain delano gave a slight start from something in don benitos manner just then it seemed as if the visitor had at least partly been the subject of the withdrawn consultation going on—a conjecture as little agreeable to the guest as it was little flattering to the host

the singular alternations of courtesy and illbreeding in the spanish captain were unaccountable except on one of two suppositions—innocent lunacy or wicked imposture

but the first idea though it might naturally have occurred to an indifferent observer and in some respect had not hitherto been wholly a stranger to captain delanos mind yet now that in an incipient way he began to regard the strangers conduct something in the light of an intentional affront of course the idea of lunacy was virtually vacated but if not a lunatic what then under the circumstances would a gentleman nay any honest boor act the part now acted by his host the man was an impostor some lowborn adventurer masquerading as an oceanic grandee yet so ignorant of the first requisites of mere gentlemanhood as to be betrayed into the present remarkable indecorum that strange ceremoniousness too at other times evinced seemed not uncharacteristic of one playing a part above his real level benito cereno—don benito cereno—a sounding name one too at that period not unknown in the surname to supercargoes and sea captains trading along the spanish main as belonging to one of the most enterprising and extensive mercantile families in all those provinces several members of it having titles a sort of castilian rothschild with a noble brother or cousin in every great trading town of south america the alleged don benito was in early manhood about twentynine or thirty to assume a sort of roving cadetship in the maritime affairs of such a house what more likely scheme for a young knave of talent and spirit but the spaniard was a pale invalid never mind for even to the degree of simulating mortal disease the craft of some tricksters had been known to attain to think that under the aspect of infantile weakness the most savage energies might be couched—those velvets of the spaniard but the silky paw to his fangs

from no train of thought did these fancies come not from within but from without suddenly too and in one throng like hoar frost yet as soon to vanish as the mild sun of captain delanos goodnature regained its meridian

glancing over once more towards his host—whose sideface revealed above the skylight was now turned towards him—he was struck by the profile whose clearness of cut was refined by the thinness incident to illhealth as well as ennobled about the chin by the beard away with suspicion he was a true offshoot of a true hidalgo cereno

relieved by these and other better thoughts the visitor lightly humming a tune now began indifferently pacing the poop so as not to betray to don benito that he had at all mistrusted incivility much less duplicity for such mistrust would yet be proved illusory and by the event though for the present the circumstance which had provoked that distrust remained unexplained but when that little mystery should have been cleared up captain delano thought he might extremely regret it did he allow don benito to become aware that he had indulged in ungenerous surmises in short to the spaniards blackletter text it was best for awhile to leave open margin

presently his pale face twitching and overcast the spaniard still supported by his attendant moved over towards his guest when with even more than his usual embarrassment and a strange sort of intriguing intonation in his husky whisper the following conversation began—

señor may i ask how long you have lain at this isle

oh but a day or two don benito

and from what port are you last

canton

and there señor you exchanged your sealskins for teas and silks i think you said

yes silks mostly

and the balance you took in specie perhaps

captain delano fidgeting a little answered—

yes some silver not a very great deal though

ah—well may i ask how many men have you señor

captain delano slightly started but answered—

about fiveandtwenty all told

and at present señor all on board i suppose

all on board don benito replied the captain now with satisfaction

and will be tonight señor

at this last question following so many pertinacious ones for the soul of him captain delano could not but look very earnestly at the questioner who instead of meeting the glance with every token of craven discomposure dropped his eyes to the deck presenting an unworthy contrast to his servant who just then was kneeling at his feet adjusting a loose shoebuckle his disengaged face meantime with humble curiosity turned openly up into his masters downcast one

the spaniard still with a guilty shuffle repeated his question

and—and will be tonight señor

yes for aught i know returned captain delano—but nay rallying himself into fearless truth some of them talked of going off on another fishing party about midnight

your ships generally go—go more or less armed i believe señor

oh a sixpounder or two in case of emergency was the intrepidly indifferent reply with a small stock of muskets sealingspears and cutlasses you know

as he thus responded captain delano again glanced at don benito but the latters eyes were averted while abruptly and awkwardly shifting the subject he made some peevish allusion to the calm and then without apology once more with his attendant withdrew to the opposite bulwarks where the whispering was resumed

at this moment and ere captain delano could cast a cool thought upon what had just passed the young spanish sailor before mentioned was seen descending from the rigging in act of stooping over to spring inboard to the deck his voluminous unconfined frock or shirt of coarse woolen much spotted with tar opened out far down the chest revealing a soiled under garment of what seemed the finest linen edged about the neck with a narrow blue ribbon sadly faded and worn at this moment the young sailors eye was again fixed on the whisperers and captain delano thought he observed a lurking significance in it as if silent signs of some freemason sort had that instant been interchanged

this once more impelled his own glance in the direction of don benito and as before he could not but infer that himself formed the subject of the conference he paused the sound of the hatchetpolishing fell on his ears he cast another swift sidelook at the two they had the air of conspirators in connection with the late questionings and the incident of the young sailor these things now begat such return of involuntary suspicion that the singular guilelessness of the american could not endure it plucking up a gay and humorous expression he crossed over to the two rapidly saying—ha don benito your black here seems high in your trust a sort of privycounselor in fact

upon this the servant looked up with a goodnatured grin but the master started as from a venomous bite it was a moment or two before the spaniard sufficiently recovered himself to reply which he did at last with cold constraint—yes señor i have trust in babo

here babo changing his previous grin of mere animal humor into an intelligent smile not ungratefully eyed his master

finding that the spaniard now stood silent and reserved as if involuntarily or purposely giving hint that his guests proximity was inconvenient just then captain delano unwilling to appear uncivil even to incivility itself made some trivial remark and moved off again and again turning over in his mind the mysterious demeanor of don benito cereno

he had descended from the poop and wrapped in thought was passing near a dark hatchway leading down into the steerage when perceiving motion there he looked to see what moved the same instant there was a sparkle in the shadowy hatchway and he saw one of the spanish sailors prowling there hurriedly placing his hand in the bosom of his frock as if hiding something before the man could have been certain who it was that was passing he slunk below out of sight but enough was seen of him to make it sure that he was the same young sailor before noticed in the rigging

what was that which so sparkled thought captain delano it was no lamp—no match—no live coal could it have been a jewel but how come sailors with jewels—or with silktrimmed undershirts either has he been robbing the trunks of the dead cabinpassengers but if so he would hardly wear one of the stolen articles on board ship here ah ah—if now that was indeed a secret sign i saw passing between this suspicious fellow and his captain awhile since if i could only be certain that in my uneasiness my senses did not deceive me then—

here passing from one suspicious thing to another his mind revolved the strange questions put to him concerning his ship

by a curious coincidence as each point was recalled the black wizards of ashantee would strike up with their hatchets as in ominous comment on the white strangers thoughts pressed by such enigmas and portents it would have been almost against nature had not even into the least distrustful heart some ugly misgivings obtruded

observing the ship now helplessly fallen into a current with enchanted sails drifting with increased rapidity seaward and noting that from a lately intercepted projection of the land the sealer was hidden the stout mariner began to quake at thoughts which he barely durst confess to himself above all he began to feel a ghostly dread of don benito and yet when he roused himself dilated his chest felt himself strong on his legs and coolly considered it—what did all these phantoms amount to

had the spaniard any sinister scheme it must have reference not so much to him captain delano as to his ship the bachelors delight hence the present drifting away of the one ship from the other instead of favoring any such possible scheme was for the time at least opposed to it clearly any suspicion combining such contradictions must need be delusive beside was it not absurd to think of a vessel in distress—a vessel by sickness almost dismanned of her crew—a vessel whose inmates were parched for water—was it not a thousand times absurd that such a craft should at present be of a piratical character or her commander either for himself or those under him cherish any desire but for speedy relief and refreshment but then might not general distress and thirst in particular be affected and might not that same undiminished spanish crew alleged to have perished off to a remnant be at that very moment lurking in the hold on heartbroken pretense of entreating a cup of cold water fiends in human form had got into lonely dwellings nor retired until a dark deed had been done and among the malay pirates it was no unusual thing to lure ships after them into their treacherous harbors or entice boarders from a declared enemy at sea by the spectacle of thinly manned or vacant decks beneath which prowled a hundred spears with yellow arms ready to upthrust them through the mats not that captain delano had entirely credited such things he had heard of them—and now as stories they recurred the present destination of the ship was the anchorage there she would be near his own vessel upon gaining that vicinity might not the san dominick like a slumbering volcano suddenly let loose energies now hid

he recalled the spaniards manner while telling his story there was a gloomy hesitancy and subterfuge about it it was just the manner of one making up his tale for evil purposes as he goes but if that story was not true what was the truth that the ship had unlawfully come into the spaniards possession but in many of its details especially in reference to the more calamitous parts such as the fatalities among the seamen the consequent prolonged beating about the past sufferings from obstinate calms and still continued suffering from thirst in all these points as well as others don benitos story had corroborated not only the wailing ejaculations of the indiscriminate multitude white and black but likewise—what seemed impossible to be counterfeit—by the very expression and play of every human feature which captain delano saw if don benitos story was throughout an invention then every soul on board down to the youngest negress was his carefully drilled recruit in the plot an incredible inference and yet if there was ground for mistrusting his veracity that inference was a legitimate one

but those questions of the spaniard there indeed one might pause did they not seem put with much the same object with which the burglar or assassin by daytime reconnoitres the walls of a house but with ill purposes to solicit such information openly of the chief person endangered and so in effect setting him on his guard how unlikely a procedure was that absurd then to suppose that those questions had been prompted by evil designs thus the same conduct which in this instance had raised the alarm served to dispel it in short scarce any suspicion or uneasiness however apparently reasonable at the time which was not now with equal apparent reason dismissed

at last he began to laugh at his former forebodings and laugh at the strange ship for in its aspect someway siding with them as it were and laugh too at the oddlooking blacks particularly those old scissorsgrinders the ashantees and those bedridden old knitting women the oakumpickers and almost at the dark spaniard himself the central hobgoblin of all

for the rest whatever in a serious way seemed enigmatical was now goodnaturedly explained away by the thought that for the most part the poor invalid scarcely knew what he was about either sulking in black vapors or putting idle questions without sense or object evidently for the present the man was not fit to be intrusted with the ship on some benevolent plea withdrawing the command from him captain delano would yet have to send her to conception in charge of his second mate a worthy person and good navigator—a plan not more convenient for the san dominick than for don benito for relieved from all anxiety keeping wholly to his cabin the sick man under the good nursing of his servant would probably by the end of the passage be in a measure restored to health and with that he should also be restored to authority

such were the americans thoughts they were tranquilizing there was a difference between the idea of don benitos darkly preordaining captain delanos fate and captain delanos lightly arranging don benitos nevertheless it was not without something of relief that the good seaman presently perceived his whaleboat in the distance its absence had been prolonged by unexpected detention at the sealers side as well as its returning trip lengthened by the continual recession of the goal

the advancing speck was observed by the blacks their shouts attracted the attention of don benito who with a return of courtesy approaching captain delano expressed satisfaction at the coming of some supplies slight and temporary as they must necessarily prove

captain delano responded but while doing so his attention was drawn to something passing on the deck below among the crowd climbing the landward bulwarks anxiously watching the coming boat two blacks to all appearances accidentally incommoded by one of the sailors violently pushed him aside which the sailor someway resenting they dashed him to the deck despite the earnest cries of the oakumpickers

don benito said captain delano quickly do you see what is going on there look

but seized by his cough the spaniard staggered with both hands to his face on the point of falling captain delano would have supported him but the servant was more alert who with one hand sustaining his master with the other applied the cordial don benito restored the black withdrew his support slipping aside a little but dutifully remaining within call of a whisper such discretion was here evinced as quite wiped away in the visitors eyes any blemish of impropriety which might have attached to the attendant from the indecorous conferences before mentioned showing too that if the servant were to blame it might be more the masters fault than his own since when left to himself he could conduct thus well

his glance called away from the spectacle of disorder to the more pleasing one before him captain delano could not avoid again congratulating his host upon possessing such a servant who though perhaps a little too forward now and then must upon the whole be invaluable to one in the invalids situation

tell me don benito he added with a smile—i should like to have your man here myself—what will you take for him would fifty doubloons be any object

master wouldnt part with babo for a thousand doubloons murmured the black overhearing the offer and taking it in earnest and with the strange vanity of a faithful slave appreciated by his master scorning to hear so paltry a valuation put upon him by a stranger but don benito apparently hardly yet completely restored and again interrupted by his cough made but some broken reply

soon his physical distress became so great affecting his mind too apparently that as if to screen the sad spectacle the servant gently conducted his master below

left to himself the american to while away the time till his boat should arrive would have pleasantly accosted some one of the few spanish seamen he saw but recalling something that don benito had said touching their ill conduct he refrained as a shipmaster indisposed to countenance cowardice or unfaithfulness in seamen

while with these thoughts standing with eye directed forward towards that handful of sailors suddenly he thought that one or two of them returned the glance and with a sort of meaning he rubbed his eyes and looked again but again seemed to see the same thing under a new form but more obscure than any previous one the old suspicions recurred but in the absence of don benito with less of panic than before despite the bad account given of the sailors captain delano resolved forthwith to accost one of them descending the poop he made his way through the blacks his movement drawing a queer cry from the oakumpickers prompted by whom the negroes twitching each other aside divided before him but as if curious to see what was the object of this deliberate visit to their ghetto closing in behind in tolerable order followed the white stranger up his progress thus proclaimed as by mounted kingsatarms and escorted as by a caffre guard of honor captain delano assuming a goodhumored offhanded air continued to advance now and then saying a blithe word to the negroes and his eye curiously surveying the white faces here and there sparsely mixed in with the blacks like stray white pawns venturously involved in the ranks of the chessmen opposed

while thinking which of them to select for his purpose he chanced to observe a sailor seated on the deck engaged in tarring the strap of a large block a circle of blacks squatted round him inquisitively eying the process

the mean employment of the man was in contrast with something superior in his figure his hand black with continually thrusting it into the tarpot held for him by a negro seemed not naturally allied to his face a face which would have been a very fine one but for its haggardness whether this haggardness had aught to do with criminality could not be determined since as intense heat and cold though unlike produce like sensations so innocence and guilt when through casual association with mental pain stamping any visible impress use one seal—a hacked one

not again that this reflection occurred to captain delano at the time charitable man as he was rather another idea because observing so singular a haggardness combined with a dark eye averted as in trouble and shame and then again recalling don benitos confessed ill opinion of his crew insensibly he was operated upon by certain general notions which while disconnecting pain and abashment from virtue invariably link them with vice

if indeed there be any wickedness on board this ship thought captain delano be sure that man there has fouled his hand in it even as now he fouls it in the pitch i dont like to accost him i will speak to this other this old jack here on the windlass

he advanced to an old barcelona tar in ragged red breeches and dirty nightcap cheeks trenched and bronzed whiskers dense as thorn hedges seated between two sleepylooking africans this mariner like his younger shipmate was employed upon some rigging—splicing a cable—the sleepylooking blacks performing the inferior function of holding the outer parts of the ropes for him

upon captain delanos approach the man at once hung his head below its previous level the one necessary for business it appeared as if he desired to be thought absorbed with more than common fidelity in his task being addressed he glanced up but with what seemed a furtive diffident air which sat strangely enough on his weatherbeaten visage much as if a grizzly bear instead of growling and biting should simper and cast sheeps eyes he was asked several questions concerning the voyage—questions purposely referring to several particulars in don benitos narrative not previously corroborated by those impulsive cries greeting the visitor on first coming on board the questions were briefly answered confirming all that remained to be confirmed of the story the negroes about the windlass joined in with the old sailor but as they became talkative he by degrees became mute and at length quite glum seemed morosely unwilling to answer more questions and yet all the while this ursine air was somehow mixed with his sheepish one

despairing of getting into unembarrassed talk with such a centaur captain delano after glancing round for a more promising countenance but seeing none spoke pleasantly to the blacks to make way for him and so amid various grins and grimaces returned to the poop feeling a little strange at first he could hardly tell why but upon the whole with regained confidence in benito cereno

how plainly thought he did that old whiskerando yonder betray a consciousness of ill desert no doubt when he saw me coming he dreaded lest i apprised by his captain of the crews general misbehavior came with sharp words for him and so down with his head and yet—and yet now that i think of it that very old fellow if i err not was one of those who seemed so earnestly eying me here awhile since ah these currents spin ones head round almost as much as they do the ship ha there nows a pleasant sort of sunny sight quite sociable too

his attention had been drawn to a slumbering negress partly disclosed through the lacework of some rigging lying with youthful limbs carelessly disposed under the lee of the bulwarks like a doe in the shade of a woodland rock sprawling at her lapped breasts was her wideawake fawn stark naked its black little body half lifted from the deck crosswise with its dams its hands like two paws clambering upon her its mouth and nose ineffectually rooting to get at the mark and meantime giving a vexatious halfgrunt blending with the composed snore of the negress

the uncommon vigor of the child at length roused the mother she started up at a distance facing captain delano but as if not at all concerned at the attitude in which she had been caught delightedly she caught the child up with maternal transports covering it with kisses

theres naked nature now pure tenderness and love thought captain delano well pleased

this incident prompted him to remark the other negresses more particularly than before he was gratified with their manners like most uncivilized women they seemed at once tender of heart and tough of constitution equally ready to die for their infants or fight for them unsophisticated as leopardesses loving as doves ah thought captain delano these perhaps are some of the very women whom ledyard saw in africa and gave such a noble account of

these natural sights somehow insensibly deepened his confidence and ease at last he looked to see how his boat was getting on but it was still pretty remote he turned to see if don benito had returned but he had not

to change the scene as well as to please himself with a leisurely observation of the coming boat stepping over into the mizzenchains he clambered his way into the starboard quartergallery—one of those abandoned venetianlooking waterbalconies previously mentioned—retreats cut off from the deck as his foot pressed the halfdamp halfdry seamosses matting the place and a chance phantom catspaw—an islet of breeze unheralded unfollowed—as this ghostly catspaw came fanning his cheek as his glance fell upon the row of small round deadlights—all closed like coppered eyes of the coffined—and the statecabin door once connecting with the gallery even as the deadlights had once looked out upon it but now calked fast like a sarcophagus lid and to a purpleblack tarredover panel threshold and post and he bethought him of the time when that statecabin and this statebalcony had heard the voices of the spanish kings officers and the forms of the lima viceroys daughters had perhaps leaned where he stood—as these and other images flitted through his mind as the catspaw through the calm gradually he felt rising a dreamy inquietude like that of one who alone on the prairie feels unrest from the repose of the noon

he leaned against the carved balustrade again looking off toward his boat but found his eye falling upon the ribbon grass trailing along the ships waterline straight as a border of green box and parterres of seaweed broad ovals and crescents floating nigh and far with what seemed long formal alleys between crossing the terraces of swells and sweeping round as if leading to the grottoes below and overhanging all was the balustrade by his arm which partly stained with pitch and partly embossed with moss seemed the charred ruin of some summerhouse in a grand garden long running to waste

trying to break one charm he was but becharmed anew though upon the wide sea he seemed in some far inland country prisoner in some deserted château left to stare at empty grounds and peer out at vague roads where never wagon or wayfarer passed

but these enchantments were a little disenchanted as his eye fell on the corroded mainchains of an ancient style massy and rusty in link shackle and bolt they seemed even more fit for the ships present business than the one for which she had been built

presently he thought something moved nigh the chains he rubbed his eyes and looked hard groves of rigging were about the chains and there peering from behind a great stay like an indian from behind a hemlock a spanish sailor a marlingspike in his hand was seen who made what seemed an imperfect gesture towards the balcony but immediately as if alarmed by some advancing step along the deck within vanished into the recesses of the hempen forest like a poacher

what meant this something the man had sought to communicate unbeknown to any one even to his captain did the secret involve aught unfavorable to his captain were those previous misgivings of captain delanos about to be verified or in his haunted mood at the moment had some random unintentional motion of the man while busy with the stay as if repairing it been mistaken for a significant beckoning

not unbewildered again he gazed off for his boat but it was temporarily hidden by a rocky spur of the isle as with some eagerness he bent forward watching for the first shooting view of its beak the balustrade gave way before him like charcoal had he not clutched an outreaching rope he would have fallen into the sea the crash though feeble and the fall though hollow of the rotten fragments must have been overheard he glanced up with sober curiosity peering down upon him was one of the old oakumpickers slipped from his perch to an outside boom while below the old negro and invisible to him reconnoitering from a porthole like a fox from the mouth of its den crouched the spanish sailor again from something suddenly suggested by the mans air the mad idea now darted into captain delanos mind that don benitos plea of indisposition in withdrawing below was but a pretense that he was engaged there maturing his plot of which the sailor by some means gaining an inkling had a mind to warn the stranger against incited it may be by gratitude for a kind word on first boarding the ship was it from foreseeing some possible interference like this that don benito had beforehand given such a bad character of his sailors while praising the negroes though indeed the former seemed as docile as the latter the contrary the whites too by nature were the shrewder race a man with some evil design would he not be likely to speak well of that stupidity which was blind to his depravity and malign that intelligence from which it might not be hidden not unlikely perhaps but if the whites had dark secrets concerning don benito could then don benito be any way in complicity with the blacks but they were too stupid besides who ever heard of a white so far a renegade as to apostatize from his very species almost by leaguing in against it with negroes these difficulties recalled former ones lost in their mazes captain delano who had now regained the deck was uneasily advancing along it when he observed a new face an aged sailor seated crosslegged near the main hatchway his skin was shrunk up with wrinkles like a pelicans empty pouch his hair frosted his countenance grave and composed his hands were full of ropes which he was working into a large knot some blacks were about him obligingly dipping the strands for him here and there as the exigencies of the operation demanded

captain delano crossed over to him and stood in silence surveying the knot his mind by a not uncongenial transition passing from its own entanglements to those of the hemp for intricacy such a knot he had never seen in an american ship nor indeed any other the old man looked like an egyptian priest making gordian knots for the temple of ammon the knot seemed a combination of doublebowlineknot treblecrownknot backhandedwellknot knotinandoutknot and jammingknot

at last puzzled to comprehend the meaning of such a knot captain delano addressed the knotter—

what are you knotting there my man

the knot was the brief reply without looking up

so it seems but what is it for

for some one else to undo muttered back the old man plying his fingers harder than ever the knot being now nearly completed

while captain delano stood watching him suddenly the old man threw the knot towards him saying in broken english—the first heard in the ship—something to this effect undo it cut it quick it was said lowly but with such condensation of rapidity that the long slow words in spanish which had preceded and followed almost operated as covers to the brief english between

for a moment knot in hand and knot in head captain delano stood mute while without further heeding him the old man was now intent upon other ropes presently there was a slight stir behind captain delano turning he saw the chained negro atufal standing quietly there the next moment the old sailor rose muttering and followed by his subordinate negroes removed to the forward part of the ship where in the crowd he disappeared

an elderly negro in a clout like an infants and with a pepper and salt head and a kind of attorney air now approached captain delano in tolerable spanish and with a goodnatured knowing wink he informed him that the old knotter was simplewitted but harmless often playing his odd tricks the negro concluded by begging the knot for of course the stranger would not care to be troubled with it unconsciously it was handed to him with a sort of congé the negro received it and turning his back ferreted into it like a detective customhouse officer after smuggled laces soon with some african word equivalent to pshaw he tossed the knot overboard

all this is very queer now thought captain delano with a qualmish sort of emotion but as one feeling incipient seasickness he strove by ignoring the symptoms to get rid of the malady once more he looked off for his boat to his delight it was now again in view leaving the rocky spur astern

the sensation here experienced after at first relieving his uneasiness with unforeseen efficacy soon began to remove it the less distant sight of that wellknown boat—showing it not as before half blended with the haze but with outline defined so that its individuality like a mans was manifest that boat rover by name which though now in strange seas had often pressed the beach of captain delanos home and brought to its threshold for repairs had familiarly lain there as a newfoundland dog the sight of that household boat evoked a thousand trustful associations which contrasted with previous suspicions filled him not only with lightsome confidence but somehow with half humorous selfreproaches at his former lack of it

what i amasa delano—jack of the beach as they called me when a lad—i amasa the same that ducksatchel in hand used to paddle along the waterside to the schoolhouse made from the old hulk—i little jack of the beach that used to go berrying with cousin nat and the rest i to be murdered here at the ends of the earth on board a haunted pirateship by a horrible spaniard too nonsensical to think of who would murder amasa delano his conscience is clean there is some one above fie fie jack of the beach you are a child indeed a child of the second childhood old boy you are beginning to dote and drule im afraid

light of heart and foot he stepped aft and there was met by don benitos servant who with a pleasing expression responsive to his own present feelings informed him that his master had recovered from the effects of his coughing fit and had just ordered him to go present his compliments to his good guest don amasa and say that he don benito would soon have the happiness to rejoin him

there now do you mark that again thought captain delano walking the poop what a donkey i was this kind gentleman who here sends me his kind compliments he but ten minutes ago darklantern in had was dodging round some old grindstone in the hold sharpening a hatchet for me i thought well well these long calms have a morbid effect on the mind ive often heard though i never believed it before ha glancing towards the boat theres rover good dog a white bone in her mouth a pretty big bone though seems to me—what yes she has fallen afoul of the bubbling tiderip there it sets her the other way too for the time patience

it was now about noon though from the grayness of everything it seemed to be getting towards dusk

the calm was confirmed in the far distance away from the influence of land the leaden ocean seemed laid out and leaded up its course finished soul gone defunct but the current from landward where the ship was increased silently sweeping her further and further towards the tranced waters beyond

still from his knowledge of those latitudes cherishing hopes of a breeze and a fair and fresh one at any moment captain delano despite present prospects buoyantly counted upon bringing the san dominick safely to anchor ere night the distance swept over was nothing since with a good wind ten minutes sailing would retrace more than sixty minutes drifting meantime one moment turning to mark rover fighting the tiderip and the next to see don benito approaching he continued walking the poop

gradually he felt a vexation arising from the delay of his boat this soon merged into uneasiness and at last—his eye falling continually as from a stagebox into the pit upon the strange crowd before and below him and byandby recognizing there the face—now composed to indifference—of the spanish sailor who had seemed to beckon from the mainchains—something of his old trepidations returned

ah thought he—gravely enough—this is like the ague because it went off it follows not that it wont come back

though ashamed of the relapse he could not altogether subdue it and so exerting his goodnature to the utmost insensibly he came to a compromise

yes this is a strange craft a strange history too and strange folks on board but—nothing more

by way of keeping his mind out of mischief till the boat should arrive he tried to occupy it with turning over and over in a purely speculative sort of way some lesser peculiarities of the captain and crew among others four curious points recurred

first the affair of the spanish lad assailed with a knife by the slave boy an act winked at by don benito second the tyranny in don benitos treatment of atufal the black as if a child should lead a bull of the nile by the ring in his nose third the trampling of the sailor by the two negroes a piece of insolence passed over without so much as a reprimand fourth the cringing submission to their master of all the ships underlings mostly blacks as if by the least inadvertence they feared to draw down his despotic displeasure

coupling these points they seemed somewhat contradictory but what then thought captain delano glancing towards his now nearing boat—what then why don benito is a very capricious commander but he is not the first of the sort i have seen though its true he rather exceeds any other but as a nation—continued he in his reveries—these spaniards are all an odd set the very word spaniard has a curious conspirator guyfawkish twang to it and yet i dare say spaniards in the main are as good folks as any in duxbury massachusetts ah good last rover has come

as with its welcome freight the boat touched the side the oakumpickers with venerable gestures sought to restrain the blacks who at the sight of three gurried watercasks in its bottom and a pile of wilted pumpkins in its bow hung over the bulwarks in disorderly raptured

don benito with his servant now appeared his coming perhaps hastened by hearing the noise of him captain delano sought permission to serve out the water so that all might share alike and none injure themselves by unfair excess but sensible and on don benitos account kind as this offer was it was received with what seemed impatience as if aware that he lacked energy as a commander don benito with the true jealousy of weakness resented as an affront any interference so at least captain delano inferred

in another moment the casks were being hoisted in when some of the eager negroes accidentally jostled captain delano where he stood by the gangway so that unmindful of don benito yielding to the impulse of the moment with goodnatured authority he bade the blacks stand back to enforce his words making use of a halfmirthful halfmenacing gesture instantly the blacks paused just where they were each negro and negress suspended in his or her posture exactly as the word had found them—for a few seconds continuing so—while as between the responsive posts of a telegraph an unknown syllable ran from man to man among the perched oakumpickers while the visitors attention was fixed by this scene suddenly the hatchetpolishers half rose and a rapid cry came from don benito

thinking that at the signal of the spaniard he was about to be massacred captain delano would have sprung for his boat but paused as the oakumpickers dropping down into the crowd with earnest exclamations forced every white and every negro back at the same moment with gestures friendly and familiar almost jocose bidding him in substance not be a fool simultaneously the hatchetpolishers resumed their seats quietly as so many tailors and at once as if nothing had happened the work of hoisting in the casks was resumed whites and blacks singing at the tackle

captain delano glanced towards don benito as he saw his meagre form in the act of recovering itself from reclining in the servants arms into which the agitated invalid had fallen he could not but marvel at the panic by which himself had been surprised on the darting supposition that such a commander who upon a legitimate occasion so trivial too as it now appeared could lose all selfcommand was with energetic iniquity going to bring about his murder

the casks being on deck captain delano was handed a number of jars and cups by one of the stewards aids who in the name of his captain entreated him to do as he had proposed—dole out the water he complied with republican impartiality as to this republican element which always seeks one level serving the oldest white no better than the youngest black excepting indeed poor don benito whose condition if not rank demanded an extra allowance to him in the first place captain delano presented a fair pitcher of the fluid but thirsting as he was for it the spaniard quaffed not a drop until after several grave bows and salutes a reciprocation of courtesies which the sightloving africans hailed with clapping of hands

two of the less wilted pumpkins being reserved for the cabin table the residue were minced up on the spot for the general regalement but the soft bread sugar and bottled cider captain delano would have given the whites alone and in chief don benito but the latter objected which disinterestedness not a little pleased the american and so mouthfuls all around were given alike to whites and blacks excepting one bottle of cider which babo insisted upon setting aside for his master

here it may be observed that as on the first visit of the boat the american had not permitted his men to board the ship neither did he now being unwilling to add to the confusion of the decks

not uninfluenced by the peculiar goodhumor at present prevailing and for the time oblivious of any but benevolent thoughts captain delano who from recent indications counted upon a breeze within an hour or two at furthest dispatched the boat back to the sealer with orders for all the hands that could be spared immediately to set about rafting casks to the wateringplace and filling them likewise he bade word be carried to his chief officer that if against present expectation the ship was not brought to anchor by sunset he need be under no concern for as there was to be a full moon that night he captain delano would remain on board ready to play the pilot come the wind soon or late

as the two captains stood together observing the departing boat—the servant as it happened having just spied a spot on his masters velvet sleeve and silently engaged rubbing it out—the american expressed his regrets that the san dominick had no boats none at least but the unseaworthy old hulk of the longboat which warped as a camels skeleton in the desert and almost as bleached lay potwise inverted amidships one side a little tipped furnishing a subterraneous sort of den for family groups of the blacks mostly women and small children who squatting on old mats below or perched above in the dark dome on the elevated seats were descried some distance within like a social circle of bats sheltering in some friendly cave at intervals ebon flights of naked boys and girls three or four years old darting in and out of the dens mouth

had you three or four boats now don benito said captain delano i think that by tugging at the oars your negroes here might help along matters some did you sail from port without boats don benito

they were stove in the gales señor

that was bad many men too you lost then boats and men those must have been hard gales don benito

past all speech cringed the spaniard

tell me don benito continued his companion with increased interest tell me were these gales immediately off the pitch of cape horn

cape horn—who spoke of cape horn

yourself did when giving me an account of your voyage answered captain delano with almost equal astonishment at this eating of his own words even as he ever seemed eating his own heart on the part of the spaniard you yourself don benito spoke of cape horn he emphatically repeated

the spaniard turned in a sort of stooping posture pausing an instant as one about to make a plunging exchange of elements as from air to water

at this moment a messengerboy a white hurried by in the regular performance of his function carrying the last expired half hour forward to the forecastle from the cabin timepiece to have it struck at the ships large bell

master said the servant discontinuing his work on the coat sleeve and addressing the rapt spaniard with a sort of timid apprehensiveness as one charged with a duty the discharge of which it was foreseen would prove irksome to the very person who had imposed it and for whose benefit it was intended master told me never mind where he was or how engaged always to remind him to a minute when shavingtime comes miguel has gone to strike the halfhour afternoon it is now master will master go into the cuddy

ah—yes answered the spaniard starting as from dreams into realities then turning upon captain delano he said that ere long he would resume the conversation

then if master means to talk more to don amasa said the servant why not let don amasa sit by master in the cuddy and master can talk and don amasa can listen while babo here lathers and strops

yes said captain delano not unpleased with this sociable plan yes don benito unless you had rather not i will go with you

be it so señor

as the three passed aft the american could not but think it another strange instance of his hosts capriciousness this being shaved with such uncommon punctuality in the middle of the day but he deemed it more than likely that the servants anxious fidelity had something to do with the matter inasmuch as the timely interruption served to rally his master from the mood which had evidently been coming upon him

the place called the cuddy was a light deckcabin formed by the poop a sort of attic to the large cabin below part of it had formerly been the quarters of the officers but since their death all the partitioning had been thrown down and the whole interior converted into one spacious and airy marine hall for absence of fine furniture and picturesque disarray of odd appurtenances somewhat answering to the wide cluttered hall of some eccentric bachelorsquire in the country who hangs his shootingjacket and tobaccopouch on deer antlers and keeps his fishingrod tongs and walkingstick in the same corner

the similitude was heightened if not originally suggested by glimpses of the surrounding sea since in one aspect the country and the ocean seem cousinsgerman

the floor of the cuddy was matted overhead four or five old muskets were stuck into horizontal holes along the beams on one side was a clawfooted old table lashed to the deck a thumbed missal on it and over it a small meagre crucifix attached to the bulkhead under the table lay a dented cutlass or two with a hacked harpoon among some melancholy old rigging like a heap of poor friars girdles there were also two long sharpribbed settees of malacca cane black with age and uncomfortable to look at as inquisitors racks with a large misshapen armchair which furnished with a rude barbers crotch at the back working with a screw seemed some grotesque engine of torment a flag locker was in one corner open exposing various colored bunting some rolled up others half unrolled still others tumbled opposite was a cumbrous washstand of black mahogany all of one block with a pedestal like a font and over it a railed shelf containing combs brushes and other implements of the toilet a torn hammock of stained grass swung near the sheets tossed and the pillow wrinkled up like a brow as if who ever slept here slept but illy with alternate visitations of sad thoughts and bad dreams

the further extremity of the cuddy overhanging the ships stern was pierced with three openings windows or portholes according as men or cannon might peer socially or unsocially out of them at present neither men nor cannon were seen though huge ringbolts and other rusty iron fixtures of the woodwork hinted of twentyfourpounders

glancing towards the hammock as he entered captain delano said you sleep here don benito

yes señor since we got into mild weather

this seems a sort of dormitory sittingroom sailloft chapel armory and private closet all together don benito added captain delano looking round

yes señor events have not been favorable to much order in my arrangements

here the servant napkin on arm made a motion as if waiting his masters good pleasure don benito signified his readiness when seating him in the malacca armchair and for the guests convenience drawing opposite one of the settees the servant commenced operations by throwing back his masters collar and loosening his cravat

there is something in the negro which in a peculiar way fits him for avocations about ones person most negroes are natural valets and hairdressers taking to the comb and brush congenially as to the castinets and flourishing them apparently with almost equal satisfaction there is too a smooth tact about them in this employment with a marvelous noiseless gliding briskness not ungraceful in its way singularly pleasing to behold and still more so to be the manipulated subject of and above all is the great gift of goodhumor not the mere grin or laugh is here meant those were unsuitable but a certain easy cheerfulness harmonious in every glance and gesture as though god had set the whole negro to some pleasant tune

when to this is added the docility arising from the unaspiring contentment of a limited mind and that susceptibility of blind attachment sometimes inhering in indisputable inferiors one readily perceives why those hypochondriacs johnson and byron—it may be something like the hypochondriac benito cereno—took to their hearts almost to the exclusion of the entire white race their serving men the negroes barber and fletcher but if there be that in the negro which exempts him from the inflicted sourness of the morbid or cynical mind how in his most prepossessing aspects must he appear to a benevolent one when at ease with respect to exterior things captain delanos nature was not only benign but familiarly and humorously so at home he had often taken rare satisfaction in sitting in his door watching some free man of color at his work or play if on a voyage he chanced to have a black sailor invariably he was on chatty and halfgamesome terms with him in fact like most men of a good blithe heart captain delano took to negroes not philanthropically but genially just as other men to newfoundland dogs

hitherto the circumstances in which he found the san dominick had repressed the tendency but in the cuddy relieved from his former uneasiness and for various reasons more sociably inclined than at any previous period of the day and seeing the colored servant napkin on arm so debonair about his master in a business so familiar as that of shaving too all his old weakness for negroes returned

among other things he was amused with an odd instance of the african love of bright colors and fine shows in the blacks informally taking from the flaglocker a great piece of bunting of all hues and lavishly tucking it under his masters chin for an apron

the mode of shaving among the spaniards is a little different from what it is with other nations they have a basin specifically called a barbers basin which on one side is scooped out so as accurately to receive the chin against which it is closely held in lathering which is done not with a brush but with soap dipped in the water of the basin and rubbed on the face

in the present instance saltwater was used for lack of better and the parts lathered were only the upper lip and low down under the throat all the rest being cultivated beard

the preliminaries being somewhat novel to captain delano he sat curiously eying them so that no conversation took place nor for the present did don benito appear disposed to renew any

setting down his basin the negro searched among the razors as for the sharpest and having found it gave it an additional edge by expertly strapping it on the firm smooth oily skin of his open palm he then made a gesture as if to begin but midway stood suspended for an instant one hand elevating the razor the other professionally dabbling among the bubbling suds on the spaniards lank neck not unaffected by the close sight of the gleaming steel don benito nervously shuddered his usual ghastliness was heightened by the lather which lather again was intensified in its hue by the contrasting sootiness of the negros body altogether the scene was somewhat peculiar at least to captain delano nor as he saw the two thus postured could he resist the vagary that in the black he saw a headsman and in the white a man at the block but this was one of those antic conceits appearing and vanishing in a breath from which perhaps the best regulated mind is not always free

meantime the agitation of the spaniard had a little loosened the bunting from around him so that one broad fold swept curtainlike over the chairarm to the floor revealing amid a profusion of armorial bars and groundcolors—black blue and yellow—a closed castle in a blood red field diagonal with a lion rampant in a white

the castle and the lion exclaimed captain delano—why don benito this is the flag of spain you use here its well its only i and not the king that sees this he added with a smile but—turning towards the black—its all one i suppose so the colors be gay which playful remark did not fail somewhat to tickle the negro

now master he said readjusting the flag and pressing the head gently further back into the crotch of the chair now master and the steel glanced nigh the throat

again don benito faintly shuddered

you must not shake so master see don amasa master always shakes when i shave him and yet master knows i never yet have drawn blood though its true if master will shake so i may some of these times now master he continued and now don amasa please go on with your talk about the gale and all that master can hear and between times master can answer

ah yes these gales said captain delano but the more i think of your voyage don benito the more i wonder not at the gales terrible as they must have been but at the disastrous interval following them for here by your account have you been these two months and more getting from cape horn to st maria a distance which i myself with a good wind have sailed in a few days true you had calms and long ones but to be becalmed for two months that is at least unusual why don benito had almost any other gentleman told me such a story i should have been half disposed to a little incredulity

here an involuntary expression came over the spaniard similar to that just before on the deck and whether it was the start he gave or a sudden gawky roll of the hull in the calm or a momentary unsteadiness of the servants hand however it was just then the razor drew blood spots of which stained the creamy lather under the throat immediately the black barber drew back his steel and remaining in his professional attitude back to captain delano and face to don benito held up the trickling razor saying with a sort of half humorous sorrow see master—you shook so—heres babos first blood

no sword drawn before james the first of england no assassination in that timid kings presence could have produced a more terrified aspect than was now presented by don benito

poor fellow thought captain delano so nervous he cant even bear the sight of barbers blood and this unstrung sick man is it credible that i should have imagined he meant to spill all my blood who cant endure the sight of one little drop of his own surely amasa delano you have been beside yourself this day tell it not when you get home sappy amasa well well he looks like a murderer doesnt he more like as if himself were to be done for well well this days experience shall be a good lesson

meantime while these things were running through the honest seamans mind the servant had taken the napkin from his arm and to don benito had said—but answer don amasa please master while i wipe this ugly stuff off the razor and strop it again

as he said the words his face was turned half round so as to be alike visible to the spaniard and the american and seemed by its expression to hint that he was desirous by getting his master to go on with the conversation considerately to withdraw his attention from the recent annoying accident as if glad to snatch the offered relief don benito resumed rehearsing to captain delano that not only were the calms of unusual duration but the ship had fallen in with obstinate currents and other things he added some of which were but repetitions of former statements to explain how it came to pass that the passage from cape horn to st maria had been so exceedingly long now and then mingling with his words incidental praises less qualified than before to the blacks for their general good conduct these particulars were not given consecutively the servant at convenient times using his razor and so between the intervals of shaving the story and panegyric went on with more than usual huskiness

to captain delanos imagination now again not wholly at rest there was something so hollow in the spaniards manner with apparently some reciprocal hollowness in the servants dusky comment of silence that the idea flashed across him that possibly master and man for some unknown purpose were acting out both in word and deed nay to the very tremor of don benitos limbs some juggling play before him neither did the suspicion of collusion lack apparent support from the fact of those whispered conferences before mentioned but then what could be the object of enacting this play of the barber before him at last regarding the notion as a whimsy insensibly suggested perhaps by the theatrical aspect of don benito in his harlequin ensign captain delano speedily banished it

the shaving over the servant bestirred himself with a small bottle of scented waters pouring a few drops on the head and then diligently rubbing the vehemence of the exercise causing the muscles of his face to twitch rather strangely

his next operation was with comb scissors and brush going round and round smoothing a curl here clipping an unruly whiskerhair there giving a graceful sweep to the templelock with other impromptu touches evincing the hand of a master while like any resigned gentleman in barbers hands don benito bore all much less uneasily at least than he had done the razoring indeed he sat so pale and rigid now that the negro seemed a nubian sculptor finishing off a white statuehead

all being over at last the standard of spain removed tumbled up and tossed back into the flaglocker the negros warm breath blowing away any stray hair which might have lodged down his masters neck collar and cravat readjusted a speck of lint whisked off the velvet lapel all this being done backing off a little space and pausing with an expression of subdued selfcomplacency the servant for a moment surveyed his master as in toilet at least the creature of his own tasteful hands

captain delano playfully complimented him upon his achievement at the same time congratulating don benito

but neither sweet waters nor shampooing nor fidelity nor sociality delighted the spaniard seeing him relapsing into forbidding gloom and still remaining seated captain delano thinking that his presence was undesired just then withdrew on pretense of seeing whether as he had prophesied any signs of a breeze were visible

walking forward to the mainmast he stood awhile thinking over the scene and not without some undefined misgivings when he heard a noise near the cuddy and turning saw the negro his hand to his cheek advancing captain delano perceived that the cheek was bleeding he was about to ask the cause when the negros wailing soliloquy enlightened him

ah when will master get better from his sickness only the sour heart that sour sickness breeds made him serve babo so cutting babo with the razor because only by accident babo had given master one little scratch and for the first time in so many a day too ah ah ah holding his hand to his face

is it possible thought captain delano was it to wreak in private his spanish spite against this poor friend of his that don benito by his sullen manner impelled me to withdraw ah this slavery breeds ugly passions in man—poor fellow

he was about to speak in sympathy to the negro but with a timid reluctance he now reentered the cuddy

presently master and man came forth don benito leaning on his servant as if nothing had happened

but a sort of lovequarrel after all thought captain delano

he accosted don benito and they slowly walked together they had gone but a few paces when the steward—a tall rajahlooking mulatto orientally set off with a pagoda turban formed by three or four madras handkerchiefs wound about his head tier on tier—approaching with a saalam announced lunch in the cabin

on their way thither the two captains were preceded by the mulatto who turning round as he advanced with continual smiles and bows ushered them on a display of elegance which quite completed the insignificance of the small bareheaded babo who as if not unconscious of inferiority eyed askance the graceful steward but in part captain delano imputed his jealous watchfulness to that peculiar feeling which the fullblooded african entertains for the adulterated one as for the steward his manner if not bespeaking much dignity of selfrespect yet evidenced his extreme desire to please which is doubly meritorious as at once christian and chesterfieldian

captain delano observed with interest that while the complexion of the mulatto was hybrid his physiognomy was european—classically so

don benito whispered he i am glad to see this usherofthegoldenrod of yours the sight refutes an ugly remark once made to me by a barbadoes planter that when a mulatto has a regular european face look out for him he is a devil but see your steward here has features more regular than king georges of england and yet there he nods and bows and smiles a king indeed—the king of kind hearts and polite fellows what a pleasant voice he has too

he has señor

but tell me has he not so far as you have known him always proved a good worthy fellow said captain delano pausing while with a final genuflexion the steward disappeared into the cabin come for the reason just mentioned i am curious to know

francesco is a good man a sort of sluggishly responded don benito like a phlegmatic appreciator who would neither find fault nor flatter

ah i thought so for it were strange indeed and not very creditable to us whiteskins if a little of our blood mixed with the africans should far from improving the latters quality have the sad effect of pouring vitriolic acid into black broth improving the hue perhaps but not the wholesomeness

doubtless doubtless señor but—glancing at babo—not to speak of negroes your planters remark i have heard applied to the spanish and indian intermixtures in our provinces but i know nothing about the matter he listlessly added

and here they entered the cabin

the lunch was a frugal one some of captain delanos fresh fish and pumpkins biscuit and salt beef the reserved bottle of cider and the san dominicks last bottle of canary

as they entered francesco with two or three colored aids was hovering over the table giving the last adjustments upon perceiving their master they withdrew francesco making a smiling congé and the spaniard without condescending to notice it fastidiously remarking to his companion that he relished not superfluous attendance

without companions host and guest sat down like a childless married couple at opposite ends of the table don benito waving captain delano to his place and weak as he was insisting upon that gentleman being seated before himself

the negro placed a rug under don benitos feet and a cushion behind his back and then stood behind not his masters chair but captain delanos at first this a little surprised the latter but it was soon evident that in taking his position the black was still true to his master since by facing him he could the more readily anticipate his slightest want

this is an uncommonly intelligent fellow of yours don benito whispered captain delano across the table

you say true señor

during the repast the guest again reverted to parts of don benitos story begging further particulars here and there he inquired how it was that the scurvy and fever should have committed such wholesale havoc upon the whites while destroying less than half of the blacks as if this question reproduced the whole scene of plague before the spaniards eyes miserably reminding him of his solitude in a cabin where before he had had so many friends and officers round him his hand shook his face became hueless broken words escaped but directly the sane memory of the past seemed replaced by insane terrors of the present with starting eyes he stared before him at vacancy for nothing was to be seen but the hand of his servant pushing the canary over towards him at length a few sips served partially to restore him he made random reference to the different constitution of races enabling one to offer more resistance to certain maladies than another the thought was new to his companion

presently captain delano intending to say something to his host concerning the pecuniary part of the business he had undertaken for him especially—since he was strictly accountable to his owners—with reference to the new suit of sails and other things of that sort and naturally preferring to conduct such affairs in private was desirous that the servant should withdraw imagining that don benito for a few minutes could dispense with his attendance he however waited awhile thinking that as the conversation proceeded don benito without being prompted would perceive the propriety of the step

but it was otherwise at last catching his hosts eye captain delano with a slight backward gesture of his thumb whispered don benito pardon me but there is an interference with the full expression of what i have to say to you

upon this the spaniard changed countenance which was imputed to his resenting the hint as in some way a reflection upon his servant after a moments pause he assured his guest that the blacks remaining with them could be of no disservice because since losing his officers he had made babo whose original office it now appeared had been captain of the slaves not only his constant attendant and companion but in all things his confidant

after this nothing more could be said though indeed captain delano could hardly avoid some little tinge of irritation upon being left ungratified in so inconsiderable a wish by one too for whom he intended such solid services but it is only his querulousness thought he and so filling his glass he proceeded to business

the price of the sails and other matters was fixed upon but while this was being done the american observed that though his original offer of assistance had been hailed with hectic animation yet now when it was reduced to a business transaction indifference and apathy were betrayed don benito in fact appeared to submit to hearing the details more out of regard to common propriety than from any impression that weighty benefit to himself and his voyage was involved

soon his manner became still more reserved the effort was vain to seek to draw him into social talk gnawed by his splenetic mood he sat twitching his beard while to little purpose the hand of his servant mute as that on the wall slowly pushed over the canary

lunch being over they sat down on the cushioned transom the servant placing a pillow behind his master the long continuance of the calm had now affected the atmosphere don benito sighed heavily as if for breath

why not adjourn to the cuddy said captain delano there is more air there but the host sat silent and motionless

meantime his servant knelt before him with a large fan of feathers and francesco coming in on tiptoes handed the negro a little cup of aromatic waters with which at intervals he chafed his masters brow smoothing the hair along the temples as a nurse does a childs he spoke no word he only rested his eye on his masters as if amid all don benitos distress a little to refresh his spirit by the silent sight of fidelity

presently the ships bell sounded two oclock and through the cabin windows a slight rippling of the sea was discerned and from the desired direction

there exclaimed captain delano i told you so don benito look

he had risen to his feet speaking in a very animated tone with a view the more to rouse his companion but though the crimson curtain of the sternwindow near him that moment fluttered against his pale cheek don benito seemed to have even less welcome for the breeze than the calm

poor fellow thought captain delano bitter experience has taught him that one ripple does not make a wind any more than one swallow a summer but he is mistaken for once i will get his ship in for him and prove it

briefly alluding to his weak condition he urged his host to remain quietly where he was since he captain delano would with pleasure take upon himself the responsibility of making the best use of the wind

upon gaining the deck captain delano started at the unexpected figure of atufal monumentally fixed at the threshold like one of those sculptured porters of black marble guarding the porches of egyptian tombs

but this time the start was perhaps purely physical atufals presence singularly attesting docility even in sullenness was contrasted with that of the hatchetpolishers who in patience evinced their industry while both spectacles showed that lax as don benitos general authority might be still whenever he chose to exert it no man so savage or colossal but must more or less bow

snatching a trumpet which hung from the bulwarks with a free step captain delano advanced to the forward edge of the poop issuing his orders in his best spanish the few sailors and many negroes all equally pleased obediently set about heading the ship towards the harbor

while giving some directions about setting a lower stunsail suddenly captain delano heard a voice faithfully repeating his orders turning he saw babo now for the time acting under the pilot his original part of captain of the slaves this assistance proved valuable tattered sails and warped yards were soon brought into some trim and no brace or halyard was pulled but to the blithe songs of the inspirited negroes

good fellows thought captain delano a little training would make fine sailors of them why see the very women pull and sing too these must be some of those ashantee negresses that make such capital soldiers ive heard but whos at the helm i must have a good hand there

he went to see

the san dominick steered with a cumbrous tiller with large horizontal pullies attached at each pullyend stood a subordinate black and between them at the tillerhead the responsible post a spanish seaman whose countenance evinced his due share in the general hopefulness and confidence at the coming of the breeze

he proved the same man who had behaved with so shamefaced an air on the windlass

ah—it is you my man exclaimed captain delano—well no more sheepseyes now—look straight forward and keep the ship so good hand i trust and want to get into the harbor dont you

the man assented with an inward chuckle grasping the tillerhead firmly upon this unperceived by the american the two blacks eyed the sailor intently

finding all right at the helm the pilot went forward to the forecastle to see how matters stood there

the ship now had way enough to breast the current with the approach of evening the breeze would be sure to freshen

having done all that was needed for the present captain delano giving his last orders to the sailors turned aft to report affairs to don benito in the cabin perhaps additionally incited to rejoin him by the hope of snatching a moments private chat while the servant was engaged upon deck

from opposite sides there were beneath the poop two approaches to the cabin one further forward than the other and consequently communicating with a longer passage marking the servant still above captain delano taking the nighest entrance—the one last named and at whose porch atufal still stood—hurried on his way till arrived at the cabin threshold he paused an instant a little to recover from his eagerness then with the words of his intended business upon his lips he entered as he advanced toward the seated spaniard he heard another footstep keeping time with his from the opposite door a salver in hand the servant was likewise advancing

confound the faithful fellow thought captain delano what a vexatious coincidence

possibly the vexation might have been something different were it not for the brisk confidence inspired by the breeze but even as it was he felt a slight twinge from a sudden indefinite association in his mind of babo with atufal

don benito said he i give you joy the breeze will hold and will increase by the way your tall man and timepiece atufal stands without by your order of course

don benito recoiled as if at some bland satirical touch delivered with such adroit garnish of apparent good breeding as to present no handle for retort

he is like one flayed alive thought captain delano where may one touch him without causing a shrink

the servant moved before his master adjusting a cushion recalled to civility the spaniard stiffly replied you are right the slave appears where you saw him according to my command which is that if at the given hour i am below he must take his stand and abide my coming

ah now pardon me but that is treating the poor fellow like an exking indeed ah don benito smiling for all the license you permit in some things i fear lest at bottom you are a bitter hard master

again don benito shrank and this time as the good sailor thought from a genuine twinge of his conscience

again conversation became constrained in vain captain delano called attention to the now perceptible motion of the keel gently cleaving the sea with lacklustre eye don benito returned words few and reserved

byandby the wind having steadily risen and still blowing right into the harbor bore the san dominick swiftly on sounding a point of land the sealer at distance came into open view

meantime captain delano had again repaired to the deck remaining there some time having at last altered the ships course so as to give the reef a wide berth he returned for a few moments below

i will cheer up my poor friend this time thought he

better and better don benito he cried as he blithely reentered there will soon be an end to your cares at least for awhile for when after a long sad voyage you know the anchor drops into the haven all its vast weight seems lifted from the captains heart we are getting on famously don benito my ship is in sight look through this sidelight here there she is all ataunto the bachelors delight my good friend ah how this wind braces one up come you must take a cup of coffee with me this evening my old steward will give you as fine a cup as ever any sultan tasted what say you don benito will you

at first the spaniard glanced feverishly up casting a longing look towards the sealer while with mute concern his servant gazed into his face suddenly the old ague of coldness returned and dropping back to his cushions he was silent

you do not answer come all day you have been my host would you have hospitality all on one side

i cannot go was the response

what it will not fatigue you the ships will lie together as near as they can without swinging foul it will be little more than stepping from deck to deck which is but as from room to room come come you must not refuse me

i cannot go decisively and repulsively repeated don benito

renouncing all but the last appearance of courtesy with a sort of cadaverous sullenness and biting his thin nails to the quick he glanced almost glared at his guest as if impatient that a strangers presence should interfere with the full indulgence of his morbid hour meantime the sound of the parted waters came more and more gurglingly and merrily in at the windows as reproaching him for his dark spleen as telling him that sulk as he might and go mad with it nature cared not a jot since whose fault was it pray

but the foul mood was now at its depth as the fair wind at its height

there was something in the man so far beyond any mere unsociality or sourness previously evinced that even the forbearing goodnature of his guest could no longer endure it wholly at a loss to account for such demeanor and deeming sickness with eccentricity however extreme no adequate excuse well satisfied too that nothing in his own conduct could justify it captain delanos pride began to be roused himself became reserved but all seemed one to the spaniard quitting him therefore captain delano once more went to the deck

the ship was now within less than two miles of the sealer the whaleboat was seen darting over the interval

to be brief the two vessels thanks to the pilots skill ere long neighborly style lay anchored together

before returning to his own vessel captain delano had intended communicating to don benito the smaller details of the proposed services to be rendered but as it was unwilling anew to subject himself to rebuffs he resolved now that he had seen the san dominick safely moored immediately to quit her without further allusion to hospitality or business indefinitely postponing his ulterior plans he would regulate his future actions according to future circumstances his boat was ready to receive him but his host still tarried below well thought captain delano if he has little breeding the more need to show mine he descended to the cabin to bid a ceremonious and it may be tacitly rebukeful adieu but to his great satisfaction don benito as if he began to feel the weight of that treatment with which his slighted guest had not indecorously retaliated upon him now supported by his servant rose to his feet and grasping captain delanos hand stood tremulous too much agitated to speak but the good augury hence drawn was suddenly dashed by his resuming all his previous reserve with augmented gloom as with halfaverted eyes he silently reseated himself on his cushions with a corresponding return of his own chilled feelings captain delano bowed and withdrew

he was hardly midway in the narrow corridor dim as a tunnel leading from the cabin to the stairs when a sound as of the tolling for execution in some jailyard fell on his ears it was the echo of the ships flawed bell striking the hour drearily reverberated in this subterranean vault instantly by a fatality not to be withstood his mind responsive to the portent swarmed with superstitious suspicions he paused in images far swifter than these sentences the minutest details of all his former distrusts swept through him

hitherto credulous goodnature had been too ready to furnish excuses for reasonable fears why was the spaniard so superfluously punctilious at times now heedless of common propriety in not accompanying to the side his departing guest did indisposition forbid indisposition had not forbidden more irksome exertion that day his last equivocal demeanor recurred he had risen to his feet grasped his guests hand motioned toward his hat then in an instant all was eclipsed in sinister muteness and gloom did this imply one brief repentant relenting at the final moment from some iniquitous plot followed by remorseless return to it his last glance seemed to express a calamitous yet acquiescent farewell to captain delano forever why decline the invitation to visit the sealer that evening or was the spaniard less hardened than the jew who refrained not from supping at the board of him whom the same night he meant to betray what imported all those daylong enigmas and contradictions except they were intended to mystify preliminary to some stealthy blow atufal the pretended rebel but punctual shadow that moment lurked by the threshold without he seemed a sentry and more who by his own confession had stationed him there was the negro now lying in wait

the spaniard behind—his creature before to rush from darkness to light was the involuntary choice

the next moment with clenched jaw and hand he passed atufal and stood unharmed in the light as he saw his trim ship lying peacefully at anchor and almost within ordinary call as he saw his household boat with familiar faces in it patiently rising and falling on the short waves by the san dominicks side and then glancing about the decks where he stood saw the oakumpickers still gravely plying their fingers and heard the low buzzing whistle and industrious hum of the hatchetpolishers still bestirring themselves over their endless occupation and more than all as he saw the benign aspect of nature taking her innocent repose in the evening the screened sun in the quiet camp of the west shining out like the mild light from abrahams tent as charmed eye and ear took in all these with the chained figure of the black clenched jaw and hand relaxed once again he smiled at the phantoms which had mocked him and felt something like a tinge of remorse that by harboring them even for a moment he should by implication have betrayed an atheist doubt of the everwatchful providence above

there was a few minutes delay while in obedience to his orders the boat was being hooked along to the gangway during this interval a sort of saddened satisfaction stole over captain delano at thinking of the kindly offices he had that day discharged for a stranger ah thought he after good actions ones conscience is never ungrateful however much so the benefited party may be

presently his foot in the first act of descent into the boat pressed the first round of the sideladder his face presented inward upon the deck in the same moment he heard his name courteously sounded and to his pleased surprise saw don benito advancing—an unwonted energy in his air as if at the last moment intent upon making amends for his recent discourtesy with instinctive good feeling captain delano withdrawing his foot turned and reciprocally advanced as he did so the spaniards nervous eagerness increased but his vital energy failed so that the better to support him the servant placing his masters hand on his naked shoulder and gently holding it there formed himself into a sort of crutch

when the two captains met the spaniard again fervently took the hand of the american at the same time casting an earnest glance into his eyes but as before too much overcome to speak

i have done him wrong selfreproachfully thought captain delano his apparent coldness has deceived me in no instance has he meant to offend

meantime as if fearful that the continuance of the scene might too much unstring his master the servant seemed anxious to terminate it and so still presenting himself as a crutch and walking between the two captains he advanced with them towards the gangway while still as if full of kindly contrition don benito would not let go the hand of captain delano but retained it in his across the blacks body

soon they were standing by the side looking over into the boat whose crew turned up their curious eyes waiting a moment for the spaniard to relinquish his hold the now embarrassed captain delano lifted his foot to overstep the threshold of the open gangway but still don benito would not let go his hand and yet with an agitated tone he said i can go no further here i must bid you adieu adieu my dear dear don amasa go—go suddenly tearing his hand loose go and god guard you better than me my best friend

not unaffected captain delano would now have lingered but catching the meekly admonitory eye of the servant with a hasty farewell he descended into his boat followed by the continual adieus of don benito standing rooted in the gangway

seating himself in the stern captain delano making a last salute ordered the boat shoved off the crew had their oars on end the bowsmen pushed the boat a sufficient distance for the oars to be lengthwise dropped the instant that was done don benito sprang over the bulwarks falling at the feet of captain delano at the same time calling towards his ship but in tones so frenzied that none in the boat could understand him but as if not equally obtuse three sailors from three different and distant parts of the ship splashed into the sea swimming after their captain as if intent upon his rescue

the dismayed officer of the boat eagerly asked what this meant to which captain delano turning a disdainful smile upon the unaccountable spaniard answered that for his part he neither knew nor cared but it seemed as if don benito had taken it into his head to produce the impression among his people that the boat wanted to kidnap him or else—give way for your lives he wildly added starting at a clattering hubbub in the ship above which rang the tocsin of the hatchetpolishers and seizing don benito by the throat he added this plotting pirate means murder here in apparent verification of the words the servant a dagger in his hand was seen on the rail overhead poised in the act of leaping as if with desperate fidelity to befriend his master to the last while seemingly to aid the black the three white sailors were trying to clamber into the hampered bow meantime the whole host of negroes as if inflamed at the sight of their jeopardized captain impended in one sooty avalanche over the bulwarks

all this with what preceded and what followed occurred with such involutions of rapidity that past present and future seemed one

seeing the negro coming captain delano had flung the spaniard aside almost in the very act of clutching him and by the unconscious recoil shifting his place with arms thrown up so promptly grappled the servant in his descent that with dagger presented at captain delanos heart the black seemed of purpose to have leaped there as to his mark but the weapon was wrenched away and the assailant dashed down into the bottom of the boat which now with disentangled oars began to speed through the sea

at this juncture the left hand of captain delano on one side again clutched the halfreclined don benito heedless that he was in a speechless faint while his rightfoot on the other side ground the prostrate negro and his right arm pressed for added speed on the after oar his eye bent forward encouraging his men to their utmost

but here the officer of the boat who had at last succeeded in beating off the towing sailors and was now with face turned aft assisting the bowsman at his oar suddenly called to captain delano to see what the black was about while a portuguese oarsman shouted to him to give heed to what the spaniard was saying

glancing down at his feet captain delano saw the freed hand of the servant aiming with a second dagger—a small one before concealed in his wool—with this he was snakishly writhing up from the boats bottom at the heart of his master his countenance lividly vindictive expressing the centred purpose of his soul while the spaniard halfchoked was vainly shrinking away with husky words incoherent to all but the portuguese

that moment across the longbenighted mind of captain delano a flash of revelation swept illuminating in unanticipated clearness his hosts whole mysterious demeanor with every enigmatic event of the day as well as the entire past voyage of the san dominick he smote babos hand down but his own heart smote him harder with infinite pity he withdrew his hold from don benito not captain delano but don benito the black in leaping into the boat had intended to stab

both the blacks hands were held as glancing up towards the san dominick captain delano now with scales dropped from his eyes saw the negroes not in misrule not in tumult not as if frantically concerned for don benito but with mask torn away flourishing hatchets and knives in ferocious piratical revolt like delirious black dervishes the six ashantees danced on the poop prevented by their foes from springing into the water the spanish boys were hurrying up to the topmost spars while such of the few spanish sailors not already in the sea less alert were descried helplessly mixed in on deck with the blacks

meantime captain delano hailed his own vessel ordering the ports up and the guns run out but by this time the cable of the san dominick had been cut and the fagend in lashing out whipped away the canvas shroud about the beak suddenly revealing as the bleached hull swung round towards the open ocean death for the figurehead in a human skeleton chalky comment on the chalked words below follow your leader

at the sight don benito covering his face wailed out tis he aranda my murdered unburied friend

upon reaching the sealer calling for ropes captain delano bound the negro who made no resistance and had him hoisted to the deck he would then have assisted the now almost helpless don benito up the side but don benito wan as he was refused to move or be moved until the negro should have been first put below out of view when presently assured that it was done he no more shrank from the ascent

the boat was immediately dispatched back to pick up the three swimming sailors meantime the guns were in readiness though owing to the san dominick having glided somewhat astern of the sealer only the aftermost one could be brought to bear with this they fired six times thinking to cripple the fugitive ship by bringing down her spars but only a few inconsiderable ropes were shot away soon the ship was beyond the guns range steering broad out of the bay the blacks thickly clustering round the bowsprit one moment with taunting cries towards the whites the next with upthrown gestures hailing the now dusky moors of ocean—cawing crows escaped from the hand of the fowler

the first impulse was to slip the cables and give chase but upon second thoughts to pursue with whaleboat and yawl seemed more promising

upon inquiring of don benito what firearms they had on board the san dominick captain delano was answered that they had none that could be used because in the earlier stages of the mutiny a cabinpassenger since dead had secretly put out of order the locks of what few muskets there were but with all his remaining strength don benito entreated the american not to give chase either with ship or boat for the negroes had already proved themselves such desperadoes that in case of a present assault nothing but a total massacre of the whites could be looked for but regarding this warning as coming from one whose spirit had been crushed by misery the american did not give up his design

the boats were got ready and armed captain delano ordered his men into them he was going himself when don benito grasped his arm

what have you saved my life señor and are you now going to throw away your own

the officers also for reasons connected with their interests and those of the voyage and a duty owing to the owners strongly objected against their commanders going weighing their remonstrances a moment captain delano felt bound to remain appointing his chief mate—an athletic and resolute man who had been a privateersman—to head the party the more to encourage the sailors they were told that the spanish captain considered his ship good as lost that she and her cargo including some gold and silver were worth more than a thousand doubloons take her and no small part should be theirs the sailors replied with a shout

the fugitives had now almost gained an offing it was nearly night but the moon was rising after hard prolonged pulling the boats came up on the ships quarters at a suitable distance laying upon their oars to discharge their muskets having no bullets to return the negroes sent their yells but upon the second volley indianlike they hurtled their hatchets one took off a sailors fingers another struck the whaleboats bow cutting off the rope there and remaining stuck in the gunwale like a woodmans axe snatching it quivering from its lodgment the mate hurled it back the returned gauntlet now stuck in the ships broken quartergallery and so remained

the negroes giving too hot a reception the whites kept a more respectful distance hovering now just out of reach of the hurtling hatchets they with a view to the close encounter which must soon come sought to decoy the blacks into entirely disarming themselves of their most murderous weapons in a handtohand fight by foolishly flinging them as missiles short of the mark into the sea but ere long perceiving the stratagem the negroes desisted though not before many of them had to replace their lost hatchets with handspikes an exchange which as counted upon proved in the end favorable to the assailants

meantime with a strong wind the ship still clove the water the boats alternately falling behind and pulling up to discharge fresh volleys

the fire was mostly directed towards the stern since there chiefly the negroes at present were clustering but to kill or maim the negroes was not the object to take them with the ship was the object to do it the ship must be boarded which could not be done by boats while she was sailing so fast

a thought now struck the mate observing the spanish boys still aloft high as they could get he called to them to descend to the yards and cut adrift the sails it was done about this time owing to causes hereafter to be shown two spaniards in the dress of sailors and conspicuously showing themselves were killed not by volleys but by deliberate marksmans shots while as it afterwards appeared by one of the general discharges atufal the black and the spaniard at the helm likewise were killed what now with the loss of the sails and loss of leaders the ship became unmanageable to the negroes

with creaking masts she came heavily round to the wind the prow slowly swinging into view of the boats its skeleton gleaming in the horizontal moonlight and casting a gigantic ribbed shadow upon the water one extended arm of the ghost seemed beckoning the whites to avenge it

follow your leader cried the mate and one on each bow the boats boarded sealingspears and cutlasses crossed hatchets and handspikes huddled upon the longboat amidships the negresses raised a wailing chant whose chorus was the clash of the steel

for a time the attack wavered the negroes wedging themselves to beat it back the halfrepelled sailors as yet unable to gain a footing fighting as troopers in the saddle one leg sideways flung over the bulwarks and one without plying their cutlasses like carters whips but in vain they were almost overborne when rallying themselves into a squad as one man with a huzza they sprang inboard where entangled they involuntarily separated again for a few breaths space there was a vague muffled inner sound as of submerged swordfish rushing hither and thither through shoals of blackfish soon in a reunited band and joined by the spanish seamen the whites came to the surface irresistibly driving the negroes toward the stern but a barricade of casks and sacks from side to side had been thrown up by the mainmast here the negroes faced about and though scorning peace or truce yet fain would have had respite but without pause overleaping the barrier the unflagging sailors again closed exhausted the blacks now fought in despair their red tongues lolled wolflike from their black mouths but the pale sailors teeth were set not a word was spoken and in five minutes more the ship was won

nearly a score of the negroes were killed exclusive of those by the balls many were mangled their wounds—mostly inflicted by the longedged sealingspears resembling those shaven ones of the english at preston pans made by the poled scythes of the highlanders on the other side none were killed though several were wounded some severely including the mate the surviving negroes were temporarily secured and the ship towed back into the harbor at midnight once more lay anchored

omitting the incidents and arrangements ensuing suffice it that after two days spent in refitting the ships sailed in company for conception in chili and thence for lima in peru where before the viceregal courts the whole affair from the beginning underwent investigation

though midway on the passage the illfated spaniard relaxed from constraint showed some signs of regaining health with freewill yet agreeably to his own foreboding shortly before arriving at lima he relapsed finally becoming so reduced as to be carried ashore in arms hearing of his story and plight one of the many religious institutions of the city of kings opened an hospitable refuge to him where both physician and priest were his nurses and a member of the order volunteered to be his one special guardian and consoler by night and by day

the following extracts translated from one of the official spanish documents will it is hoped shed light on the preceding narrative as well as in the first place reveal the true port of departure and true history of the san dominicks voyage down to the time of her touching at the island of st maria

but ere the extracts come it may be well to preface them with a remark

the document selected from among many others for partial translation contains the deposition of benito cereno the first taken in the case some disclosures therein were at the time held dubious for both learned and natural reasons the tribunal inclined to the opinion that the deponent not undisturbed in his mind by recent events raved of some things which could never have happened but subsequent depositions of the surviving sailors bearing out the revelations of their captain in several of the strangest particulars gave credence to the rest so that the tribunal in its final decision rested its capital sentences upon statements which had they lacked confirmation it would have deemed it but duty to reject

    

i don jose de abos and padilla his majestys notary for the royal revenue and register of this province and notary public of the holy crusade of this bishopric etc

do certify and declare as much as is requisite in law that in the criminal cause commenced the twentyfourth of the month of september in the year seventeen hundred and ninetynine against the negroes of the ship san dominick the following declaration before me was made

declaration of the first witness don benito cereno

the same day and month and year his honor doctor juan martinez de rozas councilor of the royal audience of this kingdom and learned in the law of this intendency ordered the captain of the ship san dominick don benito cereno to appear which he did in his litter attended by the monk infelez of whom he received the oath which he took by god our lord and a sign of the cross under which he promised to tell the truth of whatever he should know and should be asked—and being interrogated agreeably to the tenor of the act commencing the process he said that on the twentieth of may last he set sail with his ship from the port of valparaiso bound to that of callao loaded with the produce of the country beside thirty cases of hardware and one hundred and sixty blacks of both sexes mostly belonging to don alexandro aranda gentleman of the city of mendoza that the crew of the ship consisted of thirtysix men beside the persons who went as passengers that the negroes were in part as follows

here in the original follows a list of some fifty names descriptions and ages compiled from certain recovered documents of arandas and also from recollections of the deponent from which portions only are extracted

—one from about eighteen to nineteen years named josé and this was the man that waited upon his master don alexandro and who speaks well the spanish having served him four or five years    a mulatto named francesco the cabin steward of a good person and voice having sung in the valparaiso churches native of the province of buenos ayres aged about thirtyfive years    a smart negro named dago who had been for many years a gravedigger among the spaniards aged fortysix years    four old negroes born in africa from sixty to seventy but sound calkers by trade whose names are as follows—the first was named muri and he was killed as was also his son named diamelo the second nacta the third yola likewise killed the fourth ghofan and six fullgrown negroes aged from thirty to fortyfive all raw and born among the ashantees—matiluqui yan leche mapenda yambaio akim four of whom were killed    a powerful negro named atufal who being supposed to have been a chief in africa his owner set great store by him    and a small negro of senegal but some years among the spaniards aged about thirty which negros name was babo    that he does not remember the names of the others but that still expecting the residue of don alexandras papers will be found will then take due account of them all and remit to the court    and thirtynine women and children of all ages

the catalogue over the deposition goes on

   that all the negroes slept upon deck as is customary in this navigation and none wore fetters because the owner his friend aranda told him that they were all tractable    that on the seventh day after leaving port at three oclock in the morning all the spaniards being asleep except the two officers on the watch who were the boatswain juan robles and the carpenter juan bautista gayete and the helmsman and his boy the negroes revolted suddenly wounded dangerously the boatswain and the carpenter and successively killed eighteen men of those who were sleeping upon deck some with handspikes and hatchets and others by throwing them alive overboard after tying them that of the spaniards upon deck they left about seven as he thinks alive and tied to manoeuvre the ship and three or four more who hid themselves remained also alive although in the act of revolt the negroes made themselves masters of the hatchway six or seven wounded went through it to the cockpit without any hindrance on their part that during the act of revolt the mate and another person whose name he does not recollect attempted to come up through the hatchway but being quickly wounded were obliged to return to the cabin that the deponent resolved at break of day to come up the companionway where the negro babo was being the ringleader and atufal who assisted him and having spoken to them exhorted them to cease committing such atrocities asking them at the same time what they wanted and intended to do offering himself to obey their commands that notwithstanding this they threw in his presence three men alive and tied overboard that they told the deponent to come up and that they would not kill him which having done the negro babo asked him whether there were in those seas any negro countries where they might be carried and he answered them no that the negro babo afterwards told him to carry them to senegal or to the neighboring islands of st nicholas and he answered that this was impossible on account of the great distance the necessity involved of rounding cape horn the bad condition of the vessel the want of provisions sails and water but that the negro babo replied to him he must carry them in any way that they would do and conform themselves to everything the deponent should require as to eating and drinking that after a long conference being absolutely compelled to please them for they threatened to kill all the whites if they were not at all events carried to senegal he told them that what was most wanting for the voyage was water that they would go near the coast to take it and thence they would proceed on their course that the negro babo agreed to it and the deponent steered towards the intermediate ports hoping to meet some spanish or foreign vessel that would save them that within ten or eleven days they saw the land and continued their course by it in the vicinity of nasca that the deponent observed that the negroes were now restless and mutinous because he did not effect the taking in of water the negro babo having required with threats that it should be done without fail the following day he told him he saw plainly that the coast was steep and the rivers designated in the maps were not to be found with other reasons suitable to the circumstances that the best way would be to go to the island of santa maria where they might water easily it being a solitary island as the foreigners did that the deponent did not go to pisco that was near nor make any other port of the coast because the negro babo had intimated to him several times that he would kill all the whites the very moment he should perceive any city town or settlement of any kind on the shores to which they should be carried that having determined to go to the island of santa maria as the deponent had planned for the purpose of trying whether on the passage or near the island itself they could find any vessel that should favor them or whether he could escape from it in a boat to the neighboring coast of arruco to adopt the necessary means he immediately changed his course steering for the island that the negroes babo and atufal held daily conferences in which they discussed what was necessary for their design of returning to senegal whether they were to kill all the spaniards and particularly the deponent that eight days after parting from the coast of nasca the deponent being on the watch a little after daybreak and soon after the negroes had their meeting the negro babo came to the place where the deponent was and told him that he had determined to kill his master don alexandro aranda both because he and his companions could not otherwise be sure of their liberty and that to keep the seamen in subjection he wanted to prepare a warning of what road they should be made to take did they or any of them oppose him and that by means of the death of don alexandro that warning would best be given but that what this last meant the deponent did not at the time comprehend nor could not further than that the death of don alexandro was intended and moreover the negro babo proposed to the deponent to call the mate raneds who was sleeping in the cabin before the thing was done for fear as the deponent understood it that the mate who was a good navigator should be killed with don alexandro and the rest that the deponent who was the friend from youth of don alexandro prayed and conjured but all was useless for the negro babo answered him that the thing could not be prevented and that all the spaniards risked their death if they should attempt to frustrate his will in this matter or any other that in this conflict the deponent called the mate raneds who was forced to go apart and immediately the negro babo commanded the ashantee martinqui and the ashantee lecbe to go and commit the murder that those two went down with hatchets to the berth of don alexandro that yet half alive and mangled they dragged him on deck that they were going to throw him overboard in that state but the negro babo stopped them bidding the murder be completed on the deck before him which was done when by his orders the body was carried below forward that nothing more was seen of it by the deponent for three days    that don alonzo sidonia an old man long resident at valparaiso and lately appointed to a civil office in peru whither he had taken passage was at the time sleeping in the berth opposite don alexandros that awakening at his cries surprised by them and at the sight of the negroes with their bloody hatchets in their hands he threw himself into the sea through a window which was near him and was drowned without it being in the power of the deponent to assist or take him up    that a short time after killing aranda they brought upon deck his germancousin of middleage don francisco masa of mendoza and the young don joaquin marques de aramboalaza then lately from spain with his spanish servant ponce and the three young clerks of aranda josé mozairi lorenzo bargas and hermenegildo gandix all of cadiz that don joaquin and hermenegildo gandix the negro babo for purposes hereafter to appear preserved alive but don francisco masa josé mozairi and lorenzo bargas with ponce the servant beside the boatswain juan robles the boatswains mates manuel viscaya and roderigo hurta and four of the sailors the negro babo ordered to be thrown alive into the sea although they made no resistance nor begged for anything else but mercy that the boatswain juan robles who knew how to swim kept the longest above water making acts of contrition and in the last words he uttered charged this deponent to cause mass to be said for his soul to our lady of succor    that during the three days which followed the deponent uncertain what fate had befallen the remains of don alexandro frequently asked the negro babo where they were and if still on board whether they were to be preserved for interment ashore entreating him so to order it that the negro babo answered nothing till the fourth day when at sunrise the deponent coming on deck the negro babo showed him a skeleton which had been substituted for the ships proper figurehead—the image of christopher colon the discoverer of the new world that the negro babo asked him whose skeleton that was and whether from its whiteness he should not think it a whites that upon discovering his face the negro babo coming close said words to this effect keep faith with the blacks from here to senegal or you shall in spirit as now in body follow your leader pointing to the prow    that the same morning the negro babo took by succession each spaniard forward and asked him whose skeleton that was and whether from its whiteness he should not think it a whites that each spaniard covered his face that then to each the negro babo repeated the words in the first place said to the deponent    that they the spaniards being then assembled aft the negro babo harangued them saying that he had now done all that the deponent as navigator for the negroes might pursue his course warning him and all of them that they should soul and body go the way of don alexandro if he saw them the spaniards speak or plot anything against them the negroes—a threat which was repeated every day that before the events last mentioned they had tied the cook to throw him overboard for it is not known what thing they heard him speak but finally the negro babo spared his life at the request of the deponent that a few days after the deponent endeavoring not to omit any means to preserve the lives of the remaining whites spoke to the negroes peace and tranquillity and agreed to draw up a paper signed by the deponent and the sailors who could write as also by the negro babo for himself and all the blacks in which the deponent obliged himself to carry them to senegal and they not to kill any more and he formally to make over to them the ship with the cargo with which they were for that time satisfied and quieted   but the next day the more surely to guard against the sailors escape the negro babo commanded all the boats to be destroyed but the longboat which was unseaworthy and another a cutter in good condition which knowing it would yet be wanted for towing the water casks he had it lowered down into the hold

    

various particulars of the prolonged and perplexed navigation ensuing here follow with incidents of a calamitous calm from which portion one passage is extracted to wit

—that on the fifth day of the calm all on board suffering much from the heat and want of water and five having died in fits and mad the negroes became irritable and for a chance gesture which they deemed suspicious—though it was harmless—made by the mate raneds to the deponent in the act of handing a quadrant they killed him but that for this they afterwards were sorry the mate being the only remaining navigator on board except the deponent

    

—that omitting other events which daily happened and which can only serve uselessly to recall past misfortunes and conflicts after seventythree days navigation reckoned from the time they sailed from nasca during which they navigated under a scanty allowance of water and were afflicted with the calms before mentioned they at last arrived at the island of santa maria on the seventeenth of the month of august at about six oclock in the afternoon at which hour they cast anchor very near the american ship bachelors delight which lay in the same bay commanded by the generous captain amasa delano but at six oclock in the morning they had already descried the port and the negroes became uneasy as soon as at distance they saw the ship not having expected to see one there that the negro babo pacified them assuring them that no fear need be had that straightway he ordered the figure on the bow to be covered with canvas as for repairs and had the decks a little set in order that for a time the negro babo and the negro atufal conferred that the negro atufal was for sailing away but the negro babo would not and by himself cast about what to do that at last he came to the deponent proposing to him to say and do all that the deponent declares to have said and done to the american captain        that the negro babo warned him that if he varied in the least or uttered any word or gave any look that should give the least intimation of the past events or present state he would instantly kill him with all his companions showing a dagger which he carried hid saying something which as he understood it meant that that dagger would be alert as his eye that the negro babo then announced the plan to all his companions which pleased them that he then the better to disguise the truth devised many expedients in some of them uniting deceit and defense that of this sort was the device of the six ashantees before named who were his bravoes that them he stationed on the break of the poop as if to clean certain hatchets in cases which were part of the cargo but in reality to use them and distribute them at need and at a given word he told them that among other devices was the device of presenting atufal his right hand man as chained though in a moment the chains could be dropped that in every particular he informed the deponent what part he was expected to enact in every device and what story he was to tell on every occasion always threatening him with instant death if he varied in the least that conscious that many of the negroes would be turbulent the negro babo appointed the four aged negroes who were calkers to keep what domestic order they could on the decks that again and again he harangued the spaniards and his companions informing them of his intent and of his devices and of the invented story that this deponent was to tell charging them lest any of them varied from that story that these arrangements were made and matured during the interval of two or three hours between their first sighting the ship and the arrival on board of captain amasa delano that this happened about halfpast seven oclock in the morning captain amasa delano coming in his boat and all gladly receiving him that the deponent as well as he could force himself acting then the part of principal owner and a free captain of the ship told captain amasa delano when called upon that he came from buenos ayres bound to lima with three hundred negroes that off cape horn and in a subsequent fever many negroes had died that also by similar casualties all the sea officers and the greatest part of the crew had died

    

and so the deposition goes on circumstantially recounting the fictitious story dictated to the deponent by babo and through the deponent imposed upon captain delano and also recounting the friendly offers of captain delano with other things but all of which is here omitted after the fictitious story etc the deposition proceeds

    

—that the generous captain amasa delano remained on board all the day till he left the ship anchored at six oclock in the evening deponent speaking to him always of his pretended misfortunes under the forementioned principles without having had it in his power to tell a single word or give him the least hint that he might know the truth and state of things because the negro babo performing the office of an officious servant with all the appearance of submission of the humble slave did not leave the deponent one moment that this was in order to observe the deponents actions and words for the negro babo understands well the spanish and besides there were thereabout some others who were constantly on the watch and likewise understood the spanish    that upon one occasion while deponent was standing on the deck conversing with amasa delano by a secret sign the negro babo drew him the deponent aside the act appearing as if originating with the deponent that then he being drawn aside the negro babo proposed to him to gain from amasa delano full particulars about his ship and crew and arms that the deponent asked for what that the negro babo answered he might conceive that grieved at the prospect of what might overtake the generous captain amasa delano the deponent at first refused to ask the desired questions and used every argument to induce the negro babo to give up this new design that the negro babo showed the point of his dagger that after the information had been obtained the negro babo again drew him aside telling him that that very night he the deponent would be captain of two ships instead of one for that great part of the americans ships crew being to be absent fishing the six ashantees without any one else would easily take it that at this time he said other things to the same purpose that no entreaties availed that before amasa delanos coming on board no hint had been given touching the capture of the american ship that to prevent this project the deponent was powerless   —that in some things his memory is confused he cannot distinctly recall every event   —that as soon as they had cast anchor at six of the clock in the evening as has before been stated the american captain took leave to return to his vessel that upon a sudden impulse which the deponent believes to have come from god and his angels he after the farewell had been said followed the generous captain amasa delano as far as the gunwale where he stayed under pretense of taking leave until amasa delano should have been seated in his boat that on shoving off the deponent sprang from the gunwale into the boat and fell into it he knows not how god guarding him that—

    

here in the original follows the account of what further happened at the escape and how the san dominick was retaken and of the passage to the coast including in the recital many expressions of eternal gratitude to the generous captain amasa delano the deposition then proceeds with recapitulatory remarks and a partial renumeration of the negroes making record of their individual part in the past events with a view to furnishing according to command of the court the data whereon to found the criminal sentences to be pronounced from this portion is the following

—that he believes that all the negroes though not in the first place knowing to the design of revolt when it was accomplished approved it    that the negro josé eighteen years old and in the personal service of don alexandro was the one who communicated the information to the negro babo about the state of things in the cabin before the revolt that this is known because in the preceding midnight he use to come from his berth which was under his masters in the cabin to the deck where the ringleader and his associates were and had secret conversations with the negro babo in which he was several times seen by the mate that one night the mate drove him away twice   that this same negro josé was the one who without being commanded to do so by the negro babo as lecbe and martinqui were stabbed his master don alexandro after be had been dragged halflifeless to the deck   that the mulatto steward francesco was of the first band of revolters that he was in all things the creature and tool of the negro babo that to make his court he just before a repast in the cabin proposed to the negro babo poisoning a dish for the generous captain amasa delano this is known and believed because the negroes have said it but that the negro babo having another design forbade francesco   that the ashantee lecbe was one of the worst of them for that on the day the ship was retaken he assisted in the defense of her with a hatchet in each hand with one of which he wounded in the breast the chief mate of amasa delano in the first act of boarding this all knew that in sight of the deponent lecbe struck with a hatchet don francisco masa when by the negro babos orders he was carrying him to throw him overboard alive beside participating in the murder before mentioned of don alexandro aranda and others of the cabinpassengers that owing to the fury with which the ashantees fought in the engagement with the boats but this lecbe and yan survived that yan was bad as lecbe that yan was the man who by babos command willingly prepared the skeleton of don alexandro in a way the negroes afterwards told the deponent but which he so long as reason is left him can never divulge that yan and lecbe were the two who in a calm by night riveted the skeleton to the bow this also the negroes told him that the negro babo was he who traced the inscription below it that the negro babo was the plotter from first to last he ordered every murder and was the helm and keel of the revolt that atufal was his lieutenant in all but atufal with his own hand committed no murder nor did the negro babo   that atufal was shot being killed in the fight with the boats ere boarding   that the negresses of age were knowing to the revolt and testified themselves satisfied at the death of their master don alexandro that had the negroes not restrained them they would have tortured to death instead of simply killing the spaniards slain by command of the negro babo that the negresses used their utmost influence to have the deponent made away with that in the various acts of murder they sang songs and danced—not gaily but solemnly and before the engagement with the boats as well as during the action they sang melancholy songs to the negroes and that this melancholy tone was more inflaming than a different one would have been and was so intended that all this is believed because the negroes have said it—that of the thirtysix men of the crew exclusive of the passengers all of whom are now dead which the deponent had knowledge of six only remained alive with four cabinboys and shipboys not included with the crew  —that the negroes broke an arm of one of the cabinboys and gave him strokes with hatchets

then follow various random disclosures referring to various periods of time the following are extracted

—that during the presence of captain amasa delano on board some attempts were made by the sailors and one by hermenegildo gandix to convey hints to him of the true state of affairs but that these attempts were ineffectual owing to fear of incurring death and futhermore owing to the devices which offered contradictions to the true state of affairs as well as owing to the generosity and piety of amasa delano incapable of sounding such wickedness    that luys galgo a sailor about sixty years of age and formerly of the kings navy was one of those who sought to convey tokens to captain amasa delano but his intent though undiscovered being suspected he was on a pretense made to retire out of sight and at last into the hold and there was made away with this the negroes have since said    that one of the shipboys feeling from captain amasa delanos presence some hopes of release and not having enough prudence dropped some chanceword respecting his expectations which being overheard and understood by a slaveboy with whom he was eating at the time the latter struck him on the head with a knife inflicting a bad wound but of which the boy is now healing that likewise not long before the ship was brought to anchor one of the seamen steering at the time endangered himself by letting the blacks remark some expression in his countenance arising from a cause similar to the above but this sailor by his heedful after conduct escaped    that these statements are made to show the court that from the beginning to the end of the revolt it was impossible for the deponent and his men to act otherwise than they did   —that the third clerk hermenegildo gandix who before had been forced to live among the seamen wearing a seamans habit and in all respects appearing to be one for the time he gandix was killed by a musket ball fired through mistake from the boats before boarding having in his fright run up the mizzenrigging calling to the boats—dont board lest upon their boarding the negroes should kill him that this inducing the americans to believe he some way favored the cause of the negroes they fired two balls at him so that he fell wounded from the rigging and was drowned in the sea   —that the young don joaquin marques de aramboalaza like hermenegildo gandix the third clerk was degraded to the office and appearance of a common seaman that upon one occasion when don joaquin shrank the negro babo commanded the ashantee lecbe to take tar and heat it and pour it upon don joaquins hands   —that don joaquin was killed owing to another mistake of the americans but one impossible to be avoided as upon the approach of the boats don joaquin with a hatchet tied edge out and upright to his hand was made by the negroes to appear on the bulwarks whereupon seen with arms in his hands and is a questionable altitude he was shot  for a renegade seaman   —that on the person of don joaquin was found secreted a jewel which by papers that were discovered proved to have been meant for the shrine of our lady of mercy in lima a votive offering beforehand prepared and guarded to attest his gratitude when he should have landed in peru his last destination for the safe conclusion of his entire voyage from spain   —that the jewel with the other effects of the late don joaquin is in the custody of the brethren of the hospital de sacerdotes awaiting the disposition of the honorable court   —that owing to the condition of the deponent as well as the haste in which the boats departed for the attack the americans were not forewarned that there were among the apparent crew a passenger and one of the clerks disguised by the negro babo   —that beside the negroes killed in the action some were killed after the capture and reanchoring at night when shackled to the ringbolts on deck that these deaths were committed by the sailors ere they could be prevented that so soon as informed of it captain amasa delano used all his authority and in particular with his own hand struck down martinez gola who having found a razor in the pocket of an old jacket of his which one of the shackled negroes had on was aiming it at the negros throat that the noble captain amasa delano also wrenched from the hand of bartholomew barlo a dagger secreted at the time of the massacre of the whites with which he was in the act of stabbing a shackled negro who the same day with another negro had thrown him down and jumped upon him   —that for all the events befalling through so long a time during which the ship was in the hands of the negro babo he cannot here give account but that what he has said is the most substantial of what occurs to him at present and is the truth under the oath which he has taken which declaration he affirmed and ratified after hearing it read to him

he said that he is twentynine years of age and broken in body and mind that when finally dismissed by the court he shall not return home to chili but betake himself to the monastery on mount agonia without and signed with his honor and crossed himself and for the time departed as he came in his litter with the monk infelez to the hospital de sacerdotes

benito cereno

doctor rozas

if the deposition have served as the key to fit into the lock of the complications which precede it then as a vault whose door has been flung back the san dominicks hull lies open today

hitherto the nature of this narrative besides rendering the intricacies in the beginning unavoidable has more or less required that many things instead of being set down in the order of occurrence should be retrospectively or irregularly given this last is the case with the following passages which will conclude the account

during the long mild voyage to lima there was as before hinted a period during which the sufferer a little recovered his health or at least in some degree his tranquillity ere the decided relapse which came the two captains had many cordial conversations—their fraternal unreserve in singular contrast with former withdrawments

again and again it was repeated how hard it had been to enact the part forced on the spaniard by babo

ah my dear friend don benito once said at those very times when you thought me so morose and ungrateful nay when as you now admit you half thought me plotting your murder at those very times my heart was frozen i could not look at you thinking of what both on board this ship and your own hung from other hands over my kind benefactor and as god lives don amasa i know not whether desire for my own safety alone could have nerved me to that leap into your boat had it not been for the thought that did you unenlightened return to your ship you my best friend with all who might be with you stolen upon that night in your hammocks would never in this world have wakened again do but think how you walked this deck how you sat in this cabin every inch of ground mined into honeycombs under you had i dropped the least hint made the least advance towards an understanding between us death explosive death—yours as mine—would have ended the scene

true true cried captain delano starting you have saved my life don benito more than i yours saved it too against my knowledge and will

nay my friend rejoined the spaniard courteous even to the point of religion god charmed your life but you saved mine to think of some things you did—those smilings and chattings rash pointings and gesturings for less than these they slew my mate raneds but you had the prince of heavens safeconduct through all ambuscades

yes all is owing to providence i know but the temper of my mind that morning was more than commonly pleasant while the sight of so much suffering more apparent than real added to my goodnature compassion and charity happily interweaving the three had it been otherwise doubtless as you hint some of my interferences might have ended unhappily enough besides those feelings i spoke of enabled me to get the better of momentary distrust at times when acuteness might have cost me my life without saving anothers only at the end did my suspicions get the better of me and you know how wide of the mark they then proved

wide indeed said don benito sadly you were with me all day stood with me sat with me talked with me looked at me ate with me drank with me and yet your last act was to clutch for a monster not only an innocent man but the most pitiable of all men to such degree may malign machinations and deceptions impose so far may even the best man err in judging the conduct of one with the recesses of whose condition he is not acquainted but you were forced to it and you were in time undeceived would that in both respects it was so ever and with all men

you generalize don benito and mournfully enough but the past is passed why moralize upon it forget it see yon bright sun has forgotten it all and the blue sea and the blue sky these have turned over new leaves

because they have no memory he dejectedly replied because they are not human

but these mild trades that now fan your cheek do they not come with a humanlike healing to you warm friends steadfast friends are the trades

with their steadfastness they but waft me to my tomb señor was the foreboding response

you are saved cried captain delano more and more astonished and pained you are saved what has cast such a shadow upon you

the negro

there was silence while the moody man sat slowly and unconsciously gathering his mantle about him as if it were a pall

there was no more conversation that day

but if the spaniards melancholy sometimes ended in muteness upon topics like the above there were others upon which he never spoke at all on which indeed all his old reserves were piled pass over the worst and only to elucidate let an item or two of these be cited the dress so precise and costly worn by him on the day whose events have been narrated had not willingly been put on and that silvermounted sword apparent symbol of despotic command was not indeed a sword but the ghost of one the scabbard artificially stiffened was empty

as for the black—whose brain not body had schemed and led the revolt with the plot—his slight frame inadequate to that which it held had at once yielded to the superior muscular strength of his captor in the boat seeing all was over he uttered no sound and could not be forced to his aspect seemed to say since i cannot do deeds i will not speak words put in irons in the hold with the rest he was carried to lima during the passage don benito did not visit him nor then nor at any time after would he look at him before the tribunal he refused when pressed by the judges he fainted on the testimony of the sailors alone rested the legal identity of babo

some months after dragged to the gibbet at the tail of a mule the black met his voiceless end the body was burned to ashes but for many days the head that hive of subtlety fixed on a pole in the plaza met unabashed the gaze of the whites and across the plaza looked towards st bartholomews church in whose vaults slept then as now the recovered bones of aranda and across the rimac bridge looked towards the monastery on mount agonia without where three months after being dismissed by the court benito cereno borne on the bier did indeed follow his leader3embed"
