she said nice to meet you
but she didn’t tell me her name
with red lip stick and pale pink boots
this bitch just blew me away
cocktails later
she said to me
don’t be late
and here’s my key

chorus 1
wanna know what happened next
just take a wild guess
i stumbled up the stairs
to room 21
here we go again

verse 2
i walked in and saw her on the bed
there was nothing to be said
when we were done
she said she loved the taste of my oh oh oh
when i came to next morning
there were cigarettes put out on the floor
her panties hangin’ from the doorknob
yes she left me cravin’ more
i swear to god you’d feel the same
if you got used by
what’s her name

wanna know what happened next
take a wild guess
i stumbled out the door
of room 21
here we go again

verse 3
i walked out with her in my head
can’t remember a damn thing she said
when we were done
she said she loved the taste of my oh oh oh
