yeah yeah yeah yeah

verse 1
since the day they got married
hed been praying for a little baby boy
someone he could take fishing
throw the football and be his pride and joy
he could already see him holding that trophy
taking his team to state
but when the nurse came in with a little pink blanket
all those big dreams changed

chorus
and now hes wrapped around her finger
shes the center of his whole world
and his heart belongs to that sweet little
beautiful wonderful perfect allamerican girl

verse 2
sixteen short years later
she was falling for the senior football star
before you knew it he was dropping passes
skipping practice just to spend more time with her
the coach said hey son whats your problem
tell me have you lost your mind
and daddy said youll lose your free ride to college
boy you better tell her goodbye
see carrie underwood liveget tickets as low as 94you might also likechorus
but now hes wrapped around her finger
shes the center of his whole world
and his heart belongs to that sweet little
beautiful wonderful perfect allamerican

bridge
and when they got married and decided to have one of their own
she said be honest tell me what you want
and he said honey you oughta know
sweet little beautiful one just like you
oh a beautiful wonderful perfect allamerican

chorus
now hes wrapped around her finger
shes the center of his whole world
and his heart belongs to that sweet little
beautiful wonderful perfect allamerican girl
