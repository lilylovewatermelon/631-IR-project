i slept last night in a good hotel
i went shoppin today for jewels
the wind rushed around in the dirty town
and the children let out from their school
i was standin on a noisy corner
waitin for the walkin green
across the street he stood
and he played real good
on his clarinet for free

verse 2 lana del rey
now me i play for fortunes
and those velvet curtain calls
ive got a black limousine and two gentlemen
who escort me through these halls
and ill play if youve got the money
or if youre a friend to me
but the oneman band by thе quick lunch stand
hes been playin real good for free

verse 3 weyes blood
nobody stopped to hеar him
though he played so sweet and high
they knew he had never been on the tv
so they passed his music by
i meant to go over and ask for a song
maybe put on a harmony
i heard his refrain as the signal changed
he was playin real good for freesee lana del rey liveget tickets as low as 42you might also like18embed"
