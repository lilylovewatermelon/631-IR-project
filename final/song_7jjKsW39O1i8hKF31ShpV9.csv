at fortyfour minutes to four
an angel walked up to my door
opened the windows to my soul
told me he thinks that i should know
theres no slowing down
as the globe spins round and round

refrain
you gotta keep going gotta keep going
gotta keep going you gotta keep going
gotta keep going you gotta keep going
you gotta keep going you gotta keep going
you gotta keep going

bridge
if theres one thing that i learned
while in those county lines
its that everything takes time
you have gotta lose your pride
you have gotta lose your mind
just to find your peace of mind
you have got to trust the signs
everything will turn out fine

hook
so why arent you smiling why arent you smiling
life can get wild when youre caught in the whirlwind
lost in the world when youre chasing the win
you gotta understand
theres really no end theres really no beginning
theres really no real theres really no pretending
theres really no fail theres really no winning
cause nothing really is and everything really isnt

at fortyfour minutes to four
an angel walked up to my door
opened the windows to my soul
told me he thinks that i should know
that life only gets harder but you gotta get stronger
this is for my brother i do this for my daughter

refrain
thats why i keep going thats why i keep going
thats why i keep going
thats why i keep going i gotta keep going
i gotta keep going i gotta keep going
i gotta keep going gotta keep going
gotta keep going
i gotta show them that i can keep going
i gotta keep going i gotta keep going
i gotta keep going

hook
why arent you smiling why arent you smiling
life can get wild when youre caught in the whirlwind
lost in the world when youre chasing the win
you gotta understand
theres really no end theres really no beginning
theres really no real theres really no pretending
theres really no fail theres really no winning
cause nothing really is and everything really isnt
outro
thats why i keep going82embed"
