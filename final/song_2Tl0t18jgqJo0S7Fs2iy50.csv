ohohohohohoh

verse 1
i wanna know if you want to
i wanna go if you want to go
im sick and tired of talking
told you everything you need to know
cause the rest is in the body language
do you hear me can you feel me now
yeah the rest is in the body language
ohohohohohoh

verse 2
didnt wanna have to do it
didnt wanna be the one to say
never wanted to go through it
i think about it most every day
now im packing all my bags and i am leaving it behind
theres no tracking where im going
theres no me for them to find

outro
just come closer closer closer closer closer
i wanna know who you are
just come closer closer closer closer closeryou might also like12embed"
