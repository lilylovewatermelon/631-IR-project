well grow as grass under their feet
no one here will ever know your name
and you still lie here next to me

if it takes another life
ill wait for you on the other side
everything that comes to me
as good belongs to you
ill count our blessings as i wait for you
on the other side
good luck and i will see you through

get used to this youre going to be alright
the world goes on with or without me
if i dont ever leave a thing behind
ill still leave you without me

if it takes another life
ill wait for you on the other side
everything that comes to me
as good belongs to you
ill count our blessings as i wait for you
on the other side
good luck and i will see you through
you might also likespoken
and i have a right to be in love
and i have a right to be loved
dont be over the rainbow for meembed"
