standing there with your red coat on
french perfume lookin vulnerable
black widow girl you sit and wait
til i climb into the web you made

prechorus
im an animal you got me losing control
you got me losing control you got me losing control
its not right

chorus
i cant take it no more girl
i cant take this abuse
every time that you walk in the room girl
im hypnotized by the way that you move
its the way that you move

verse 2
you call me out at your beck and call
set me up just to watch me fall
twist and turn bend and sway
i move in then you push away

prechorus
im an animal you got me losing control
you got me losing control you got me losing control
its not right
