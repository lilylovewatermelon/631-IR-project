you got ya mind rocked rollin down loners blvd
youve got dreams keep on dreaming

verse 1
high school team never got accepted
guess it didnt get to go how i expected
now a nigga pissed
steady lookin at the bottom of the list like
where the fuck are my projections
niggas like next year tory
its all good youll be next years story
then i said man you dont even understand
man im droppin out now win it next year for me
so i left bus route to the bench down 53
took the last dollar that i had for this dream
and i spent it on some 99 cents micky ds
shit wasnt doin too fine
then i made a call to this nigga named rimes
said he had a little studio and it wasnt topnotch
but could damn near do the whole nine
so i said cool made a few songs in this shit
stayed too long in this shit
but by the month man i was there so much niggas had to lay futons in this shit
owe it to my aunt suzanne
drove to my first shows in your new jetta
always said one day i would be the man
i would just laugh like who are you tellin me
ima go far
i could still dream in this world full of stars
i could still scheme in this world full of narcs
if they could still scheme in them unmarked cars so
ima dream ima dream dream
ima dream dream like you said to me
best words that was said to me
best words that was said to me

verse 2
ten long miles from a long way home
im headed downtown cause im workin on this lil mixtape
no fillers no throwaway songs
hopin that this shit just go
sadly for me this shit didnt
so i make another mixtape and another mixtape and another mixtape
til them niggas start sayin shits hittin
then i meet a guy named sascha
tells me hes thinkin bout takin up management
say he got a million dollar empire on his mind he just need the artist to plan it with
he also say he throw shows out in texas and maybe i should open up for one
and i say cool man he books me the next flight out like im showin up for somethin
i land down in houston around nine warehouse live
was my worst show ever
niggas damn near got booed off stage
i performed like my first show ever
women in the crowd wouldnt scream for a nigga
niggas in the crowd they was kotched up down
bad enough niggas let bun b watch
but i felt like i let sascha down this shit was live on stage dog
that night felt like a nigga had the whole world on my shoulders
twenty years old tryna find a warm spot in this world gettin colder
then he came to me like dog i could put money on this bet a hundred on this
gives me a few tips for the next night setlist
says dog you gon run it on this and it all works out
chorus instrumental

outro
its a big world
the bigger your dream the bigger youre livin it
its all in your mind
dont let nobody fuck up your high
its a big world
the bigger your dream the bigger youre livin it
its all in your mind
dont let nobody fuck up your high
