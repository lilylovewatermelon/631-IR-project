the wavelength gently grows
coercive notions reevolve
a universe is trapped inside a tear
it resonates the core creates unnatural laws
replaces love and happiness with fear ooh

chorus
how much deception can you take
how many lies will you create
how much longer till you break
your minds about to fall

bridge
and theyre breaking through
and theyre breaking through
theyre breaking through
we are losing control
theyre breaking through
theyre breaking through
theyre breaking through
now were falling
we are losing control

verse 2
invisible to all
the mind becomes a wall
all of history deleted with one stroke ooh

how much deception can you take
how many lies will you create
how much longer till you break
your minds about to fall

outro
and theyre breaking through
theyre breaking through
theyre breaking through
now were falling
we are losing control9embed"
