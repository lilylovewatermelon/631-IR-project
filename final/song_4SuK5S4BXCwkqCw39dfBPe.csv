looking at the ceiling thinking why i treat you bad
aint no worser feeling than knowing i did it for the laughs
arguing all i was doing accusing you  my bad
said lets take some time never mind rewind
looking at the ceiling thinking why i treat you bad
aint no worser feeling than knowing i did it for the laughs
arguing all i was doing accusing you  my bad
said lets take some time never mind just playing with your mind
i always thought play dumb and let the other one love
why get caught up in a web of trust
only love for fun im too young i thought
all i wanted was a thanks them louboutins i bought
but it aint your fault
heaven knows you deserve it all
you sent letters to my heart but i burnt them all
the bible says before you run gotta learn to crawl
but i dont wanna waste time if we aint involved

hook
aw aww
we been through it all
i know i broke your heart once before
but im done
aw aww awww
tell me whats wrong
i know i never listen but just listen to this song
aww man
i promise we gon do it til the sun come down
i swear its going down
i promise we gon do it til the sun come out
fuck if they dont do it we gon do it all

now the ceiling fan spinning  getting dizzy man
wondering who she with maybe should i call
dont be desperate man
this aint no tagyoureit hideandseek shit
reality just kicked in i lost one and now shes winning
found another nigga she did
says he treat her like a queen but she probably control him
fuck that i gotta get her back to where we started
start over again this time her hearts in
honestly leave us leave us lets just talk about it
i know before i wasnt much of a man about it
but this time i realize i cant live without you
believe when i say its true
i love you

hook
aw aww
we been through it all
i know i broke your heart once before
but im done
aw aww awww
tell me whats wrong
i know i never listen but just listen to this song
aww man
i promise we gon do it til the sun come down
i swear its going down
i promise we gon do it til the sun come out
fuck if they dont do it we gon do it all
verse 3
love make you do it all
going up and down like a seesaw
cant be a player forever dog
it feels so good but i know its wrong
motherfucker drink what im sipping on
motherfucker drink what im sipping on
motherfucker drink what im sipping on
a bottle of love tell me if its too strong

hook
aw aww
we been through it all
i know i broke your heart once before
but im done

i know i never listen but just listen to this song
aww man
i promise we gon do it til the sun come down
