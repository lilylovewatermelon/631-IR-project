at times life is wicked
and i just cant see the light
a silver lining sometimes isnt enough
to make some wrongs seem right

refrain
whatever life brings
ive been through everything
and now im on my knees again

prechorus
but i know i must go on
although i hurt i must be strong
because inside i know
that many feel this way

chorus
children dont stop dancing
believe you can fly away away

verse 2
at times lifes unfair
and you know its plain to see
hey god i know im just a dot in this world
have you forgot about me
see creed liveget tickets as low as 25you might also likerefrain
whatever life brings
ive been through everything
and now im on my knees again

prechorus
but i know i must go on
although i hurt i must be strong
because inside i know
that many feel this way

chorus
children dont stop dancing
believe you can fly away away

bridge
am i hiding in the shadows
forget the pain and forget the sorrows
am i hiding in the shadows
forget the pain and forget the sorrows

prechorus
but i know i must go on
although i hurt i must be strong
because inside i know
that many feel this way
chorus
children dont stop dancing
believe you can fly away away

children dont stop dancing
believe you can fly away away

children dont stop dancing
believe you can fly away away

outro
am i hiding in the shadows
are we hiding in the shadowsembed"
