just what i had in mind thinking about the weekend
standing by the yeti with the party lights plugged in
got a jug of feel good going around

i need a sweet little somethin like you got
standing there red hot tied up little tank top
looking like you must be straight out of the country

verse 2
i see you dancing over there with your girlfriends
got your fine self showing off that sun tan
you keep smiling that smile at me
like youre reading my mind and you know

looking like you must be straight out of the country
