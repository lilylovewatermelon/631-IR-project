to your back then youre shivering tongue delivering uh
chills up that spine that ass is mine woo
skip the wine and the candlelight no cristal tonight
if its alright with you we fucking thats cool
déjà vu the blunts sparked finger fucking in the park
pissy off bacardi dark
remember when i used to play between your legs uh
you begged for me to stop
because you know where it would head uh
straight to your mothers bed
at the marriott we be lucky if we find a spot
next to your sister damn i really missed the
way she used to rub my back when i hit that
way she used to giggle when your ass would wiggle haha
now i know you used to suites at the parker meridian
trips to the caribbean but tonight no ends
