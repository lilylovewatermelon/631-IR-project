my face is horrid and im constantly slouching
my place is lower so im constantly crouching
and i dont believe it i saw the man again
and he wont hear another word i say

i have delusions so im constantly shouting
i have compulsions so im constantly counting
and i dont believe it there goes my world again
and i dont understand a word i say

chorus
just because im paranoid
it doesnt mean im not annoyed and
just because im not prepared
it doesnt mean im not aware

verse
the smoke is infinite im constantly panting
the truth is imminent im constantly ranting
and i dont believe it i took a chance again and
people i dont know wont let it go
people i dont know wont let it go

ive got some problems so im constantly bitching
ive got some rashes so im constantly itching
and i dont believe it forgot the pills again
i just woke up a million miles from home
