were one in the same
thinking the worlds too easy
how has it changed
did it end up above me
its not my place
pull me out of the ether
youve got a new face pretty girl
i dont mind

chorus
go ahead tell me now what you like
maybe this time ill listen
go ahead tell me now what you like
maybe this time

verse 2
and all the pieces fall
when you smile back at me
am i the cause
or am i a poster child for pity
the empty space
discolored walls painted over
youve got a new place in the world
that i cant find
you might also likechorus
go ahead tell me now what you like
maybe this time ill listen
go ahead tell me now what you like
maybe this time

bridge
pull me to the floor
and im down for the night
please kill me before
you tell me what you like
dont waste a performance
dont give it away
i just need an answer
what did you say

chorus
go ahead tell me now what you like
maybe this time ill listen
go ahead tell me now what you like
maybe this time ill listen
go ahead tell me now what you like
go ahead tell me now what you like
go ahead tell me now what you like
maybe this time ill listen10embed"
