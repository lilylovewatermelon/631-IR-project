to live where i do to be what i can
and to know that youre mine when im holding you close
and to never forget
what matters the most
im gonna run with the wind behind me
have fun when the sun is shining
stop when the world reminds me
got to take the time to pray

fight for the right to be free
smile at what my children might be
live with you beside me
oh till my dyin day

as long as we are here you know ill always be there
if were down to nothing weve still sill got so much to share
i know ive been givin way more than i deserve
im gonna live every day like it was my last
baby ill always put you first

fight for the right to be free
smile at what my children might be
live with you beside me
oh till my dyin day
see brooks  dunn liveget tickets as low as 30you might also likeim gonna walk on the road less traveled
yeah sit tall in the saddle
know when i pick my battles
not to be afraid

fight for the right to be free
smile at what my children might be
and live with you beside me
till my dyin day

fight for the right to be free
smile at what my children might be
live with you beside me
oh till my dyin dayembed"
