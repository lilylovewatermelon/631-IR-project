verse 1
written in graffiti on a bridge in a park
do you ever get the feeling that youre missing the mark
its so cold its so cold
its so cold its so cold
written up in marker on a factory sign
i struggle with the feeling that my life isnt mine
its so cold its so cold
its so cold its so cold
see the arrow they shot trying to tear us apart
took the fire from my belly and the beat from my heart
still i wont let go
still i wont let go

prechorus
of you
cause you do

chorus
oh you use your heart as a weapon
and it hurts like heaven
verse 2
on every street every car every surface a name
tonight the streets are ours and were writing and saying
dont let em take control
no we wont let em take control
yes i feel a little bit nervous
yes i feel nervous and i cannot relax
how come theyre out to get us
how come theyre out when they dont know the facts
so on a concrete canvas under cover of dark
on a concrete canvas ill go making my mark
armed with a spray can soul
ill be armed with a spray can soul
