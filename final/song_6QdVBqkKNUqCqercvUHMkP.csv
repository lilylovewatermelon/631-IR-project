verse 2 lloyd banks
im sensing a lot of tension now that im rapping
but the kids used to look up to you what happened
me on the contrary hand covered with platinum uh
different color coupes but im in love with the black one
on point cause you get rips when slacking
so the stash box big enough to squeeze the mac in yeah
im fairly new but i demand some respect
cause i already wear your advance on my neck
im fresh off the jet then i breeze to the beaches
blue yankee fitted gunit sneakers
i already figured out what to do with all my features
decorate the basement full of street sweepers
when it comes to stunting theres nothing you could teach us
were in a different time zone your records dont reach us nah
