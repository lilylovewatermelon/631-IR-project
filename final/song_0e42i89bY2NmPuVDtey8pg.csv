sirens limousines and the club owner ya bitch you
if you late aint no getting in this bitch cause its filling up
inside packed from the floor to the ceiling up
the building aint big enough
im backstage bouncing adrenaline building up
the pussy cutter did i stutter
the heart flutter make your woman drawers melt like butter
go down like nelly im hype like belly
the rhyme seller kick ass like jim kelly
stand up wild out boot up and frown
