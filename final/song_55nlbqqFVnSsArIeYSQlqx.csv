i yeah

verse 1
you fix your makeup just so
guess you dont know that youre beautiful
try on every dress that you own
you were fine in my eyes a half hour ago

prechrous
and if your mirror wont make it any clearer
ill be the one to let you know

chrous
out of all the girls
youre my one and only girl
aint nobody in the world tonight
all of the stars
you make them shine like they were ours
aint nobody in the world but you and i
you and i
aint nobody in the world but you

verse 2
you stop the room when we walk in
the spotlights on everybodys staring
tell all of these boys theyre wasting their time
stop standing in line cause youre all mine
see john legend liveget tickets as low as 71you might also likeprechrous
and this evening i wont let the feeling die
i never wanna leave your side

chrous
out of all the girls
you’re my one and only girl
aint nobody in the world tonight
all of the stars
you make them shine like they were ours
aint nobody in the world but you and i
you and i
aint nobody in the world

bridge
you keep wondering if youre what im wanting
you dont even have to try
oh you dont have to try

chrous
oh out of all of the girls
you’re my one and only girl
aint nobody in the world tonight
all of the stars
