ive had a largemouth bass bust my line
a couple beautiful girls tell me goodbye
trucks break down dogs run off
politicians lie been fired by the boss

prechorus
it takes one hand
to count the things i can count on
no there aint much man
that aint never let me down

chorus
longneck icecold beer never broke my heart
like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
like a neon dream it just dawned on me that bars and this guitar
and longneck icecold beer never broke my heart

verse 2
she was a carolina blue jean baby
fire in her eyes that drove me crazy
it was red taillights when she left town
if i didnt know then i sure know now

chorus
but longneck icecold beer never broke my heart
like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
like a neon dream it just dawned on me that bars and this guitar
and longneck icecold beer never broke my heart yeah
