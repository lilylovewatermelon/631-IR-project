im so tired of the rain in my life
and im so tired of the strain and now youre gonna lie
cause sometimes i cant sleep at night and
this here it just dont seem right and
sometimes i just wonder why i
almost let my life go by
sometimes i cant sleep at night and
this here it just dont seem right and
sometimes i just wonder why i
almost let my life go by
