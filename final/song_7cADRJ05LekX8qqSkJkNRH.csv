sew this up with threads of reason and regret
so i will not forget i will not forget
how this felt one year six months ago
i know i cannot forget i cannot forget

chorus
im falling into memories of you and things we used to do
follow me there
a beautiful somewhere
a place that i can share with you

verse 2
i can tell that you dont know me anymore
its easy to forget sometimes we just forget
and being on this road is anything but sure
maybe well forget i hope we dont forget

chorus

verse 3
so many nights legs tangled tight
wrap me up in a dream with you
close up these eyes try not to cry
all that ive got to pull me through is memories of you
memories of you
memories of you
memories of you
