take you like a drug
i taste you on my tongue

prechorus
you ask me what im thinking about
i tell you that im thinking about
whatever youre thinking about ah
tell me somethin then ill forget
and you might have to tell me again
its crazy what you do for a friend

chorus
go ahead and cry little girl
nobody does it like you do
i know how much it matters to you
i know that you got daddy issues
and if you were my little girl
id do whatever i could do
id run away and hide with you
i know that you got daddy issues and i do too
