what she do she jumped out of her sleep and left the pad at a quarter to two
thats on you you shoulda put your foot in her ass like a pimps supposed to do
but instead of goin upside da head
you bought her a 5 karat wit your bread
and then she went and gave her homeboy ted some head
i aint tellin on her im just sayin what you do
when your bitch out of bounds and you dont know what to do
what we do we check em from the gate to keep a bitch straight
its on you see you can take her out and buy her all types of things
yous a fool cause when she leave you for what he do
