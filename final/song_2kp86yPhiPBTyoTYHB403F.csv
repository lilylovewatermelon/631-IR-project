we played grownup drowned in bathtubs
but you never opened up and i never said enough

kept bending every rule til all of me was yours
and pushing things aside but nothing ever worked worked

we pretended to hold it went quiet
and we blamed it on the time on the time on the time
and we broke it went silent
