we were lovers in a past life
i can see it in your green eyes
maybe you were one of my wives
in a longlost tribe
theres just somethin bout you i know
started centuries ago though
you see your kiss is like a lost ghost
only i would know

prechorus
but i i keep on falling
for you

chorus
time after time
time after time
ill make you mine

time after time

verse 2
see millenniums ago love
we were nothing more than stardust
just the galaxy beneath us
we found weight
then we made it through the ice age
but i lost you in the crusades
i built the pyramids for you babe
just to see your face
you might also likeprechorus
but i i keep on falling
for you

ill make you mine
