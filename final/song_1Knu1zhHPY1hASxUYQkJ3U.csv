make everybody fall in love with you
call me your lover call me another
all i hear are lies from you
theyre throwing stones and you’re feeling bad
blue baby friends are all you ever had
lie to you i won’t
lie to me you may
but now is not the time and death is not the place but

chorus
would you come with me
i want you to come with me
cuz i can’t do this alone
oh and society is putting scars on my body
it’s got me acting so naughty
setting fire to my home

i’m just another skeleton in her closet
a freak like no one knows
buried bones up in her backyard with dirt between my toes
yeah i used to really love her
but now i just dont know
the time between us faded all the love i felt below
and i wish i may i wish i might have some love today
you know i could
you know i would find a way to stay
but now is not the time and here is not the place
i’m on my way to somewhere these scars i cant erase
