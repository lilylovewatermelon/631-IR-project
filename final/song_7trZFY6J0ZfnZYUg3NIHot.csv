maybe i could swim into your thoughts like your drugs do
paralyze your body sick and tired of waking up to
burning eyes and cigarettes
im falling through the couch like a suicide mission tonight
my god here comes the downside
wild eyes of terror pray for sex on the beach
while oceans of kerosene will soak into me
im not meant for this world i just dont see the point
dont think about it dont over think about it
and life is a joke but everythings riding on me tonight
been counting the stars and scars
how im becoming a work of art

chorus
desperate times and desperate measures
i come so close my hopes are severed by the downside
a million waves in the ocean crash at once to make you smile

verse 2
the whispered words youd better hide the bullets
you stayed on the phone and talked to me day and night
trigger my nightmare once again
its fucking loaded in hand
and well let the fire rage
the smoke and the drowning flames
my bedroom computer light is the only menace to my new faux wooden blinds
see pierce the veil liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likechorus
desperate times and desperate measures
i come so close my hopes are severed by the downside
a million waves in the ocean crash at once to make you smile

bridge
now i only pray when it all goes down
ill be surrounded by all of the ones ive loved and cared about
and then burn it down

verse 3
and life is a joke
at least i can love you naked and tattooed
counting the stars and scars
and if the pain is a sound lets slow it down

chorus
desperate times and desperate measures
i come so close my hopes are severed by the downside
a million waves in the ocean crash at once to make you smile

bridge
now i only pray when it all goes down
ill be surrounded by all of the ones ive loved and cared about
and then burn it down
outro
your serotonins gone
the kerosene is gone
the sunset is gone
so hold on
your serotonins gone
the kerosene is gone
the sunset is gone
its all gone all gone all gone all gone75embed"
