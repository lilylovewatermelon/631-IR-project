youre talking shit for the hell of it
addicted to betrayal but youre relevant
youre terrified to look down
cause if you dare youll see the glare
of everyone you burned just to get there
its coming back around

prechorus
and i keep my side of the street clean
you wouldnt know what i mean

chorus
cause karma is my boyfriend
karma is a god
karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
karmas a relaxing thought
arent you envious that for you its not
sweet like honey karma is a cat
purring in my lap cause it loves me
flexing like a goddamn acrobat
me and karma vibe like that

verse 2
spiderboy king of thieves
weave your little webs of opacity
my pennies made your crown
trick me once trick me twice
dont you know that cash aint the only price
its coming back around

karma takes all my friends to the summit
karma is the guy on the screen
coming straight home to me
