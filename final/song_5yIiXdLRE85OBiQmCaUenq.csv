verse 1 blake shelton
i was gonna keep it real like chill like only have a drink or two
but it turned into a party when i started talking to you
now youre standing in the neon looking like a high i wanna be on
baby its your call no pressure at all

chorus blake shelton
you don’t have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter and lean a little closer
you don’t have to keep on smiling that smile that’s driving me wild and when the night is almost over
meet me in the middle of a moonlit chevy bench seat and do a little bit of country song hanging on
you don’t have to keep me fallin’ like this
but it’d sure be cool if you did

verse 2 blake shelton
you can’t shoot me down cause you already knocked me dead
got me falling apart with my heart talking out of my head
let your mind take a little back road
just as far as you wanna go
baby i’ll do whatever you wanna do

chorus blake shelton
you dont have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter
and lean a little closer
you dont have to keep on smiling that smile thats driving me wild
and when the night is almost over
meet me in the middle of a moonlit chevy bench seat
and do a little bit of country song hanging on
you dont have to keep me falling like this
but itd sure be cool if you did
