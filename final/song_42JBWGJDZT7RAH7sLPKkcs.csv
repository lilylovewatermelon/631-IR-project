i walked through a county courthouse square
on a park bench an old man was sitting there
i said your old court house is kind of run down he said
naw itll do for our little town
i said your old flag pole is leaned a little bit
and thats a ragged old flag you got hanging on it
he said have a seat and i sat down
is this the first time youve been to our little town
i said i think it is he said
i dont like to brag
but were kind of proud of that ragged old flag
you see we got a little hole in that flag there
when washington took it across the delaware
and it got powder burned the night that francis scott key
sat watching it writin say can you see
and it got a bad rip in new orleans
with packingham and jackson tugging at its seams
and it almost fell at the alamo
beside the texas flag but
she waved on though
she got cut with a sword at chancellorsville
and she got cut again at shiloh hill
there was robert e lee beauregard and bragg
and the south wind blew hard on that ragged old flag
on flanders field in world war i
she got a big hole from a bertha gun
she turned blood red in world war ii
she hung limp and low a time or two
she was in korea vietnam
she went where she was sent
by her uncle sam
she waved from our ships upon the briny foam
and now theyve about quit waving back here at home
in her own good land here shes been abused
shes been burned dishonored denied and refused
and the government for which she stands
is scandalized throughout out the land
and shes gettin thread bare and shes wearing thin
but shes in good shape for the shape shes in
cause shes been through the fire before
and i believe she can take a whole lot more
so we raise her up every morning
we take her down every night
we dont let her touch the ground and we fold her up right
on second thought i do like to brag
cause im mighty proud of that ragged old flagyou might also like4embed"
