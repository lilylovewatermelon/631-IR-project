come to me
in all your glamour and cruelty
just do that thing that you do
and ill undress you
keep it tight
sometimes the simplest move is right
the melody that you choose
can rescue you

prechorus 1
a hybrid can withstand these things
my heart can beat with bricks and strings
my artpop could mean anything

chorus
we could we could belong together artpop
we could we could belong together artpop
we could we could belong together artpop artpop artpop

verse 2
come to me
with all your subtext and fantasy
just do that thing that you do
in a perverse hue
lovers kites
are flown on beaches for public sight
the color palette you choose
could profit you
you might also likeprechorus 2
a hybrid can withstand these things
my heart can beat with bricks and strings
my artpop could mean anything
could try to sell you out or i
could show you all the reasons why
my artpop could mean anything

chorus
we could we could belong together artpop
we could we could belong together artpop
we could we could belong together artpop artpop artpop

bridge
brushes of darkness wont help you create your destiny of self
but artpop could mean anything
anything
i try to sell myself but i am really laughing
because i just love the music not the bling
music not the bling

chorus
we could we could belong together artpop
we could we could belong together artpop
we could we could belong together artpop artpop artpop
we could we could belong together artpop
we could we could belong together artpop
we could we could belong together artpop artpop artpop
outro
free my mind
artpop
you make my
heart stop51embed"
