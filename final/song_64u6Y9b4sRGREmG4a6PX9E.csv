your room was square
i once noticed from there
in your bed as you slept
and i held my breath
everything had its own place
and i wondered what space would i take
in the order you kept

verse 2
i tried to eat like your girlfriend
just tea in the night id end up
too hungry to sleep
so lying awake i would follow the aching inside
i would find
its for you wont be mine

chorus 1
i tried my hardest for id never learned
gods very simple and love shouldnt burn
and i wouldve offered you all that you yearned for
but i was still waiting for something to earn

verse 3
what is that quiet of snow in the night
the dark rings with white noise
as you stand and drown
maybe its all of these snowflakes screaming
a choir of mute
as they brace for the ground
see mitski liveget tickets as low as 39you might also likeverse 4
well thats my ride
hope you had a good night
you know you made me happy
here shake my hand
you make such a good man
never once did you know me

chorus 2
i tried my hardest for how do you learn
gods very simple and love doesnt burn
and maybe youd offered me all that i yearned for
but i was still waiting for something to earn

silly me waiting15embed"
