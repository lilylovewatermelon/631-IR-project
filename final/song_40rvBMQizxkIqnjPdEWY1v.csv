verse 1
drowning deep in my sea of loathing
broken your servant i kneel
will you give in to me
it seems whats left of my human side
is slowly changing in me
will you give in to me

prechorus
looking at my own reflection
when suddenly it changes
violently it changes oh
no there is no turning back now
youve woken up the demon
in me

chorus
get up come on get down with the sickness
get up come on get down with the sickness
get up come on get down with the sickness
open up your hate and let it flow into me
get up come on get down with the sickness
you mother get up come on get down with the sickness
you fucker get up come on get down with the sickness
madness is the gift that has been given to me

i can see inside you the sickness is rising
dont try to deny what you feel
will you give in to me
it seems that all that was good has died
and is decaying in me
will you give in to me

it seems youre having some trouble
in dealing with these changes
living with these changes oh

now that youve woken up the demon
in me
