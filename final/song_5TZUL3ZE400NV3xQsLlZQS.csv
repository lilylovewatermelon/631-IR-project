theres a difference in the way she feels when i touch her now
i can tell that somethings wrong
but i cant put my finger on when the why or how
and theres a coldness in the way she swears
im not the reason shes not in the mood
and it tears me up inside to lie here next to her
while she lies to me about you

chorus
she thinks i dont know but im about to lose control
shes the kinda love that builds you up enough
but she cant stand to be alone
hells what im gonna raise cause im hellbent on a change
buddy finish your drink its on me
then get up and walk away

verse 2
you see ive known her long enough to know
how she was before she was mine
and im not oblivious
its just ive been the only one for all this time
so now you know the reason i came in here tonight
to put an end to this romance
theres nothing you can say or do to prove to me
that shes not worth a second chance

she thinks i dont know but im about to lose control
shes the kinda love that builds you up enough
but she cant stand to be alone
hells what im gonna raise cause im hellbent on a change
buddy finish your drink its on me
then get up and walk away
buddy finish your drink
and then i think its time you walk awayembed"
