winter gettin colder summer gettin warmer
tidal wave come across the mexican border
why buy a gallon its cheaper by the barrel
just dont get busted singin christmas carols

chorus
thats us thats right
gotta love this american ride
both ends of the ozone burnin
funny how the world keeps turnin
look ma no hands
i love this american ride
gotta love this american ride

verse 2
momma gets her rocks off watchin desperate housewives
daddy works his ass off payin for the good life
kids on the youtube learning how to be cool
livin in a cruel world pays to be a mean girl

chorus
thats us thats right
gotta love this american ride
both ends of the ozone burnin
funny how the world keeps turnin
look ma no hands
i love this american ride
gotta love this american ride

poor little infamous americas town
she gained five pounds and lost her crown
quick fix plastic surgical antidote
got herself a record deal cant even sing a note

verse 4
plasma gettin bigger jesus getting smaller
spill a cup of coffee make a million dollars
customs caught a thug with an aerosol can
if the shoe dont fit the fits gonna hit the shan

outro
thats us thats right
gotta love this american ride
both ends of the ozone burning
funny how the world keeps turning
hot dog hot damn
i love this american ride
gotta love this american ride
