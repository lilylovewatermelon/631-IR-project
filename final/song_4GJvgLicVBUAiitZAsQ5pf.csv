welcome back winter once again
and put on your warm fuzzy sweater cause youll feel much better when
the snowflakes fall gently to the ground
the temperature drops and your shivers freeze all the rivers around
but i keep you warm

refrain

dadada dadada
dadada dadadadadadada

verse 2
if speeds a pro inertia must be a con
cause the cold wind blows at precise rates when ive got my ice skates on
if all the roads were paved with ice that wouldnt thaw or crack
i could skate from maine to nebraska then on to alaska and back
cause you keep me warm

refrain
dadada dadadadadada
dadada dadada

see owl city liveget tickets as low as 46you might also likechorus
peer over the edge can you see me
rivulets flow from your eyes
paint runs from your mouth like a waterfall
and your lungs crystalize
ill travel the subzero tundra
ill brave glaciers and frozen lakes
and thats just the tip of the iceberg
ill do whatever it takes to change

farewell powdery paradise
wed rather skate on the thinnest ice
fingers failed us before they froze
frostbite bit down on all our toes

chorus
snow drifts build up and enfold us
as we wait out this winter storm
so we snuggle close in the darkness
and keep each other so warm3embed"
