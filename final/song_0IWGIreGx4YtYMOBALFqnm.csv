its a tractor firin up
kids playin in a field
four wheels gettin stuck
a line singin out a fishin reel
its a cooler slidin in the bed of a truck
a tin roof drippin rain
your baby sayin come pick me up
take me down to the riverbank

chorus
these are sounds going down in a nowhere town
underneath the wide open sky
its the dust in the air and the freedom everywhere
cant you hear it coming alive
makes you wanna drop it down a gear
and kill a couple of beers
been waiting all year now its finally here
back around these are the sounds of summer

verse 2
its the flick of a lighter lighting up a little smoke
boots climbing barbwire a little spot nobody goes
lawn chairs breaking out in the yard to the firework boom
hearing a heart beating in the dark saying that she wants to
see dierks bentley liveget tickets as low as 25you might also likechorus
these are sounds going down in a nowhere town
underneath the wide open sky
its the dust in the air and the freedom everywhere
cant you hear it coming alive
makes you wanna drop it down a gear
and kill a couple of beers
been waiting all year now its finally here
back around these are the sounds of summer
yeah the sounds of summer

bridge
round here thats what its all about
so listen up and look around
its who we are its what we love
so tonight lets crank em up

chorus
these sounds going down in a nowhere town
underneath the wide open sky
its the dust in the air and the freedom everywhere
cant you hear it coming alive
it goes way too fast it all disappears
and when its gone well still be here
hanging round missing the sounds of summer
missing the sounds of summer
missing the sounds of summer
the sounds of summer
yeah the sounds of summerembed"
