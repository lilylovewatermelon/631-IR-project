chainsmoking beedies til his brains broken completely
get back on his feet work out and eat some wheaties
greedy for the cheese please most couldnt fathom
had him in the cobra clutch when he spat the mad hymn
gems collection of brrrats timbs and hats
had no time for the pittypat ill give him that
the rhythm hit him back with a right hook
shook it off caught a shiner thought it was an aight look
depends on the shades
the end of days fades pretenders lay
in dazes on stages doomalaise
eat it up microphone microwave mayonnaise
his own way was strange but it matters not
tuned into a frequency tone that shattered rock
hold it down like shatner do spock
rapper jocks need to put a sock in they chatterbox
the block got light of vioxx stock
folks gather round its no joke like knock knock
its them they came home to roost yall
and watch em transform the game to the rules of foosball
shes too small any questions
him could squeeze blood from a penny in the recession
keep guessing it gets deeper than depression
the power of suggestion wake a sleeper peep the lesson
dig that beat
ripped it with metal fingers and stomped it with big fat feet
and you know what they say cut the hay
resistance is futile you will be assimilated but today
its all grey metallic with a ruby stone
rude like the type of dude you could write a movie on
hardcore porn did his own stunts
writ his own rhymes and split his own blunts
once in a while every other minute
eyes pop out popeye heavy on the spinach
steady on his business and ready with a ill pitch
keeps a bad bilznitch like denny kucinilznich
no hitch just a shitload of spit and sneeze
strictly g stacking up off a rack of hidden fees
rap is like the gay club strip tease
with hippies on the yip saying hey bub grip these
they screaming for attention
beaming at the mention of a scary demon convention
you could cut the tension with a switchblade
and serve it on the same plate of hors doeuvres a witch made
filleted persuaded the chambermaid
to bet her paycheck on a getnaked game of spades
straight up no chaser no layaways
caution faint taste of microwave mayonnaise
