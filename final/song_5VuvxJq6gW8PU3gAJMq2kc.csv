i might not know what to say

but thatll neva be my pride and joy

make my ass stop and read a book
on her stove known how to cook
now i know how an angel look
my beauty queen

i dont let nobody fuck up my dreams
so i pack bubble gum machines
everybody wanna wanna wanna be da king

ill soak yo ass in gasoline
now listen to my fat girl sing

verse 3 south park mexican
screwston texas were i roam
bought me home off a telephone
took my wife on a trip to rome
and bought girlfriend silicone
that vanilla bone in the killa zone
fivefootnine with high heellas on
i sipp patron flip my phone
left that pearl white bitch alone
most of my friends aint around
dead locked up or just cant be found
i keep my lil girl safe and sound
daddy gonna buy a cinderella gown
and if that gown should disappear
heaven is real but it isnt here
you cant take no souvenirs
like those diamonds in your ears
raised my daughter differently
cause the life i lived wont set me free
write my list of enemies a
and kill them hoes alphabetically
uuhh
