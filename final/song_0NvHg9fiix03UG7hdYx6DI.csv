oh

chorus
uh say she is the truth say she is so real
and i love the way that you make me feel
when its time to show affection again
look her in her eyes like youre mine thats no lie

verse 1
come on ill take you where you need to go
tell you whatever you need to know
cause we for sure ill keep you close wont sleep alone
passionate give you deepest stroke
soaring through these skies trips to dubai
ill do anything to keep you satisfied
tеars of a warrior i have some battle criеs
know you wonderin how i survived oh
and i hate it when we break up different hoes and liquor
all night i stayed up starin at your picture
them hard times made us my heart for you got bigger
dont think ill ever find something realer

chorus
uh say she is the truth say she is so real
and i love the way that you make me feel
when its time to show affection again
look her in her eyes like youre mine thats no lie

may 18th 9 oclock la time
i remember thats the first day we facetimed
now even when its gloomy still know how to make my day shine
on the road to forever we cant fall by the wayside
real street nigga love you like my first gun
forever grateful for you blessed me with my first son
bonnie and clyde baby lets go on the run
play you for your heart girl lets have a oneonone
treat this love like a religion cause i believe in you
something like a guardian angel there when i needed you
never had to question a thing i know that she the truth
always showed me nothing but loyalty when i needed proof

chorus
uh say she is the truth say she is so real
and i love the way that you make me feel
when its time to show affection again
look her in her eyes like youre mine thats no lie9embed"
