looking out a dirty old window
down below the cars in the city go rushing by
i sit here alone and i wonder why
friday night and everyones moving
i can feel the heat but its soothing heading down
i search for the beat in this dirty town

chorus
downtown the young ones are going
downtown the young ones are growing
were the kids in america whoa
were the kids in america whoa
everybody live for the musicgoround

verse 2
bright lights the music gets faster
look boy dont check on your watch not another glance
im not leaving now honey not a chance
hot shot give me no problems
much later baby youll be saying never mind
you know life is cruel
life is never kind

chorus
kind hearts dont make a new story
kind hearts dont grab any glory
were the kids in america whoa
were the kids in america whoa
everybody live for the musicgoround

bridge
come closer honey thats better
gotta get a brand new experience feeling right
oh dont try to stop baby hold me tight
outside a new day is dawning
outside suburbias sprawling everywhere
i dont want to go baby
new york to east california
theres a new wave coming i warn ya

outro
were the kids in america whoa
