here i stand
empty hands
wishing my wrists were bleeding
to stop the pain from the beatings and
there you stood
holding me
waiting for me to notice you

chorus
but who are you
you are the truth you are the truth
outscreaming these lies
you are the truth you are the truth
saving my life

verse 2
the warmth of your embrace
melts my frostbitten spirit
you speak the truth and i hear it
the words are i love you
and i have to believe in you

chorus
but who are you
you are the truth you are the truth
outscreaming these lies
you are the truth you are the truth
saving my life
you might also likebridge
my hands are open
and you are filling them
hands in the air
in the air in the air in the air
and i worship
and i worship
and i worship
and i worship

chorus
you are the truth you are the truth
outscreaming these lies
you are the truth you are the truth
saving my life3embed"
