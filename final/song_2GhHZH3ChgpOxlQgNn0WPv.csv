well the road was hot and flat as a ruler
good hundred miles between me and missoula
that vinyl top wasnt getting no cooler
i stopped at a quickie sack
well i figured id need about a sixth of miller
and one of those things so i wouldnt spill her
i asked the girl if the beer was in the back
she said

chorus
its a dry town
no beer no liquor for miles around
id give a nickel for a sip or two
to wash me down
outta this dry town

verse 2
so i turn right around no hesitation
cursed the law for running the nation
waved goodbye to the boy at the station
but she wouldnt go in gear
he said it sounds like your transmission
you need bob but hes gone fishin
his day off he gets a long way from here
see miranda lambert liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likechorus
cause its a dry town
no beer no liquor for miles around
id give a nickel for a sip or two
to wash me down
outta this dry town

verse 3
well back home friends you can get a dose of
something strong from your local grocer
so i walked down till i got a little closer
to a place called happy johns

bridge
he said i keep something here for colds and fevers
down underneath where i usually leave her
just last night i felt a cold coming on

chorus
now its a dry town
no beer no liquor for miles around
id give a nickel for a sip or two
to wash me down
outta this dry town
i need a sip or two
to wash me down
outta this dry townembed"
