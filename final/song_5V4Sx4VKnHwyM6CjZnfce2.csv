maybe its your bad girl underneath that sweet smile
like a peek of black lace that nobody but me sees
just a trace of all the possibilities
maybe its the quarter moon maybe its the quart of wine
that we havent even touched yet baby dont need it
everything youre doing girl is my weakness

chorus
im not good at not kissin again
when youre leanin it on in a little closer
im not good at not getting sidetracked
when your tank top straps slippin off of your shoulder
ohoh girl i try to be but i aint that tough
im not good at not fallin in love fallin in love fallin in love

verse 2
you know what youre doin girl
you know what it does to me
when you turn on that song and turn the lights down
baby im gone before the part about you
dancin in slow motion with my hands on your hips
now you got me going right where i cant resist

chorus
im not good at not kissin again
when youre leanin it on in a little closer
im not good at not getting sidetracked
when your tank top straps slipping off of your shoulder
ohoh girl i try to be but i aint that tough
im not good at not fallin in love fallin in love fallin in love

cant tell you no
cant say goodbye
cant hold a little bit back even if i tried
cause when i look in your eyes

chorus
im not good at not kissin again
when youre leanin it on in a little closer
im not good at not getting sidetracked
when your tank top straps slipping off of your shoulder
girl i try to be but i aint that tough
im not good at not fallin in love fallin in love fallin in loveembed"
