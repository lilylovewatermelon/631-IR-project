its not a game
im not a robot ai challenging you
im not a phantom
im in your face and
im here to see it through

prechorus
right before your eyes
watch us multiply
come to claim our rights its time
as our power grows
tryin to stop us shows
you might as well go tryn stop time

chorus
so you know that were out there
swatting lies in the making
cant move fast without breaking
cant hold on or life wont change
and our voices ring out yeah
took the mask off to feel free
fought it out in the debris
now we know that life will change

a taste of your own meds
fire in every breath
fight inside your head your heart
and as your crippled brain
tries to fight in vain
your empire will fall apart

chorus
and youll know we were out there
swatted lies in the making
your empire for the taking
cant hold on or life wont change
and our voices rang out yeah
took the mask off to feel free
fought it out in the debris
now we know that life will change3embed"
