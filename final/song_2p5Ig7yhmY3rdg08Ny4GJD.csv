if youre tired of your life and the way that you feel
like a fish on a hook like a bug on a dirty windshield its ok
it’s time to take your chips and cash em all in
cause it matters where youre going
not where you been say hey
goodbye yesterday
well if life dont go your way
maybe its time to take a break
yeah yeah

chorus
raise your hands in the air tonight
put a little love back in your life
get your feet up uh and just kick it hey
we got a one way ticket
suns shining bright and its meant for us
life is like a ride on a party bus
turn the radio up and sing along with it hey
we got a one way ticket

verse 2
so pack up your smile and your new flip flops
were headed to a heaven where the beat dont stop
well dance the day and the night away
grab yourself a gal grab yourself a fella
grab yourself a drink with a pink umbrella
goodbye yesterday
whenever life dont go your way
well maybe its time to take a nice long break

raise your hands in the air tonight
put a little love back in your life
get your feet up woo and just kick it hey
we got a one way ticket
suns shining bright and its meant for us
life is like a ride on a party bus
turn the radio up and sing along with it hey
we got a one way ticket
ooh la la la la la la la la

verse 3
so raise your hands in the air tonight
raise your hands in the air tonight whoa
punch that clock and call it a day
say adios to the minimum wage
tell your boss man where he can stick it hey
we got a one way ticket
life is so good its sticky sweet
it’s a carnival cotton candy treat
unwrap it like a lollipop lick it hey
we got a one way ticket

outro
