i think i need something new something you got for me

verse 1
no games no way josé
foreplay dont fake both ways
like olay and i wont chase to it oj
soul based and im on face like im colgate
hallways when i go all day get it uhhuh

reading all my feelings need a oneway ticket
looking so fly cause i mind my business
selfproposed but you know im vicious
