i wont beg you to stay
and if you gotta go darling
maybe its better that way
im gonna be strong
im gonna do fine
dont worry about this heart of mine
just walk out that door

go on and go now but

dont turn around
cause youre gonna see my heart breaking
dont turn around
i dont want you seeing me cry
just walk away
its tearing me apart that youre leaving
im letting you go
but i wont let you know

i wont miss your arms around me
holding me tight
if you ever think about me
just know that ill be alright
