but then i knew you was fake from the start
sayin that you love me playin with my heart
actin like you cared just to be around a star
but oh no

me shoulda knew when you take me to the mall
smilin at my face but youre buying up a storm
now i regret it should i listen to my mom
to my mom whoa

everything good must come to a stop
you played with my head
now youre bout to get dropped
gimme my ring gimme my watch and go

so girl its over o v e r
over you tried to come up on a star
over and i dont wanna see your face again again

so girl its over o v e r
over you tried to come up on a star
over and i dont wanna see your face again again
so girl its over

talkin on the phone like everyday
sendin me messages hey baby
tellin me you want me to meet your family
when you really you just tryin to go to the grammys
well oh no
you might also likei shoulda knew you wasnt for me
you didnt like me you liked by bentley
all them stories were shady
but baby dont worry cause

everything good must come to a stop
you played with my head
now youre bout to get dropped
gimme my ring gimme my watch and go

so girl its over o v e r
over you tried to come up on a star
over and i dont wanna see your face again again

so girl its over o v e r
over you tried to come up on a star
over and i dont wanna see your face again again

ever since she walked through that door
