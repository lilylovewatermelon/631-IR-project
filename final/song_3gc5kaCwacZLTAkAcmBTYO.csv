it’s a lesson
you’d blessed him
you heard it all the time
feel the heat from the pressure
it’s starting to unwind
sometimes it feels like a movie
but i can’t rewind
if i could tell what i’m doing
i’d leave it all behind yeah

chorus
i can see through the sky
the fish below me
they can’t tell
when they lie awake
at night
wondering how when or why
i take my things and
move into the ocean today
