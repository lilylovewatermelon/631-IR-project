this time this place
misused mistakes
too long too late
who was i to make you wait
just one chance just one breath
just in case theres just one left

prechorus
cause you know
you know you know

chorus
i love you
i loved you all along
and i miss you
been far away for far too long
i keep dreaming youll be with me
and youll never go
stop breathing
if i dont see you anymore

verse 2
on my knees ill ask
last chance for one last dance
cause with you id withstand
all of hell to hold your hand
id give it all id give for us
give anything but i wont give up
