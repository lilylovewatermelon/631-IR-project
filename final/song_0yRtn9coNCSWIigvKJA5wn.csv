say hello to the rugs topography
it holds quite a lot of interest with your face down on it
say hello to the shrinking in your head
you cant see it but you know its there so dont neglect it

chorus
im taking her home with me all dressed in white
shes got everything i need pharmacy keys
shes falling hard for me i can see it in her eyes
she acts just like a nurse with all the other guys

verse 2
say hello to all the apples on the ground
they were once in your eyes but you sneezed them out while sleeping
say hello to everything youve left behind
its even more a part of your life now that you cant touch it

chorus
im taking her home with me all dressed in white
shes got everything i need some pills in a little cup
shes falling hard for me i can see it in her eyes
she acts just like a nurse with all the other guys

chorus
shes got everything i need pharmacy keys
she acts just like a nurse with all the other guys
