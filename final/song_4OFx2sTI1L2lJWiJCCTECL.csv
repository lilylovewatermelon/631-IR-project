you think youre ready
but youve got too much on your mind
too much left to prove
no easy answers
youve got to work it out yourself
you wont hear anyone but you

chorus
the moment you stop looking
wherever you go youll be in the right place
youll never know the difference it makes
when you let go and give up the chase
ill come find you one of these days

verse 2
weve got potential
but its the future you and me
when the coast is cleared
you see the sunrise
i see your soul shine through to your eyes
when youre here

chorus
the moment you stop looking
wherever you go youll be in the right place
youll never know the difference it makes
when you let go and give up the chase
ill come find you one of these days

chorus
the moment you stop looking
yeah the moment you stop looking
wherever you go youll be in the right place
youll never know the difference it makes
when you let go and give up the chase
ill come find you one of these days
ill come find you one of these days
ill come find you one of these days1embed"
