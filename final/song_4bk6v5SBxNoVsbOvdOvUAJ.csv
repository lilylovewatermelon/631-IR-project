hello we havent talked in quite some time
i know i havent been the best of sons
hello ive been travelin in the deserts of my mind
and i havent found a drop of life
i havent found a drop of you
i havent found a drop
i havent found a drop of water

refrain
water
oh
oh

verse
i try desperately to run through the sand
as i hold the water in the palm of my hand
cause its all that i have and its all that i need
and the waves of the water mean nothing to me
but i try my best and all that i can to
hold tightly onto whats left in my hand
but no matter how how tightly i will strain
the sand will slow me down and the water will drain
im just bein dramatic in fact im only at it again
as an addict with a pen whos addicted to the wind
as it blows me back and forth bindless spineless and pretend
of course ill be here again see you tomorrow but its the end of today
end of my ways as a walking denial
my trial was filed as a crazy suicidal headcase
but you specialize in dyin you hear me screamin father
and im lyin here just cryin so wash me with your water
you might also likerefrain
water
oh

chorus
hello i havent talked in quite some time
i know i havent been the best of sons
hello ive been travelin in the deserts of my mind
and i i havent found a drop of life
i havent found a drop of you
i havent found a drop
i havent found a drop of water102embed"
