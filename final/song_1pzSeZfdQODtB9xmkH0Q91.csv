verse 1 miley cyrus
if i cant trust
then why am i giving my heart in exchange for him to love me
cause there aint much
difference than a one night stand and one that aint for me
is it too much
cause you hate that you love everything that he do and you cant deny you wanna
so what
my heartll light a fire in this bitch and blow it
