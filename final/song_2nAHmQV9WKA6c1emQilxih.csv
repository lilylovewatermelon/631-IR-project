undercover blame it on the season
it aint no kind of reason baby
why i come and go
i had a lover
she felt as good as treason
you cant ask her if its pleasin
you cant ask the wind to blow

chorus
and i would buy for you a diamond or myself some gasoline
if i cant afford you darlin then i cant afford to dream
and is it time i should be moving is it time i settle down
will i sit still or will i feel the wheels aspinnin round

verse 2
well i aint the brightest
bird that ever flew
im just someone you knew
a road you travelled on
all the colors
they shine and fade away
well theyre just like new years day
theyre here and then theyre gone

chorus
and i would buy for you a diamond or myself some gasoline
if i cant afford you darlin then i cant afford to dream
and is it time i should be moving is it time i settle down
will i sit still or will i feel the wheels aspinnin round

lord i love you
i wish you only knew
well i wish you had a clue
i wish you had a clue you know
but im stuck here in tulsa
with my oklahoma blues
with a pair of concrete shoes
that got me sinking pretty low

chorus
and i would buy for you a diamond or myself some gasoline
if i cant afford you darlin then i cant afford to dream
and is it time i should be moving is it time i settle down
will i sit still or will i feel the wheels aspinnin round
the wheels aspinnin round
the wheels
are spinninembed"
