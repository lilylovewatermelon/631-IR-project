verse 1
first time she was in my math class uhhuh
long hair brown skin with the fat ass
sat beside me used to laugh had mad jokes
the teacher always got mad so we passed notes
it started off so innocent
she had a vibe and a nigga started diggin it uh
i was a youngin straight crushin tryna play the shit cool
but a nigga couldnt wait to get to school ‘cause when i seen
them thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her
got me daydreamin man what
im thinkin how she rides on it if she sits on it if she licks on it
make it hard for me to stand up as time goes by
attractions gettin deep and
wet dreamin thinkin that im smashin but im sleepin i want it bad
and i aint never been obsessed before
she wrote a note that said you ever had sex before damn…
