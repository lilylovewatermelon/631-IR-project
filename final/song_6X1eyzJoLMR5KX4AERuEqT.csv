im out on my own again
face down in the porcelain
feeling so high but looking so low
party favors on the floor
group of girls banging on the door
so many new fairweather friends
oh oh oh

chorus
have you ever been so lost
known the way and still so lost

verse 2
caught in the eye of a hurricane
slowly waving goodbye like a pageant parade
so sick of this town pulling me down oh
my mother says i should come back home but
cant find the way cause the way is gone
so if i pray am i just sending words into outer space

chorus
have you ever been so lost
known the way and still so lost
another night waiting for someone to take me home
have you ever been so lost
you might also likebridge
is there a light is there a light
at the end of the road
im pushing everyone away
cause i cant feel this anymore
feel this anymore

chorus
have you ever been so lost
know the way and still so lost
another night waiting for someone to take me home
have you ever been so lost been so lost
have you ever been so lost
