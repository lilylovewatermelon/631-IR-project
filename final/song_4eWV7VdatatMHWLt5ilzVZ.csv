if he knows how it feels to be beginnin and the end
i reckon he knows the feelin’ tween the now and then
im stuck between a rock and a hard place friend
lord won’t you help me carry my load
i borrowed me a hammer i swung it for a dime
i got to where i finally could afford me mine
but in between the swingin and the idle time
i got to thinkin heavy on the road

chorus
now im hid out in the upper room
with walls so thin i could bust right through
give all my buddies a ramblin to
about the shit that really blows my mind

verse 2
back when i was younger didnt have a clue
come to think of it i still doubt i do
but every now and then i get to thinkin
you know ive got it all worked out
i used to take my time and burn it in a bong
iced down with lights turned off
somethin’ in my speakers i can ponder on
somethin’ i can mull around
see tyler childers liveget tickets as low as 39you might also likechorus
now im lit up like a christmas tree
check onetwo can y’all hear me
the sights are somethin but they aint for free
lookin at ’em wired for sale

verse 3
the road goes on forever the part it will tend
to run forever if you never let it end
i got a part of me thats wonderin when
ill finally kick the urge to roam
a part of me just wants to live forever on the road
split me down the middle ship my southpaw home
and if she gets to askin tell her you dont rightly know
what happened to the rest of me

chorus
aw weep no more girl dont cry
thats why you married you a gemini
this is the half of him you always liked
looky here his heart still beatsembed"
