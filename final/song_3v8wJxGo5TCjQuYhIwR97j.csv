i felt you cut free
turning cold shoulders to me
growing blame lines
communicating lies
nothing more to trust
fallacies of love
killing all that holds you

chorus
bring me back to this
what you said useless
leave me
ill shed my skin
these scars will mend

verse 2
dont worry about me
the hearts supposed to bleed
purity is drained
help each other die
i see it i see it in your eyes
killing all that holds you

chorus
bring me back to this
what you said useless
leave me
ill shed my skin
these scars will mend
you might also likebridge
eyes twitch and lies itch of nervous
eyes twitch and lies itch of nervous ending
innocence is ugly
in the one who is guilty

chorus
bring me back to this
what you said useless
leave me
ill shed my skin
these scars will mendembed"
