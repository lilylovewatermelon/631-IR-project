i dont wanna make this
harder than i have to
this is how it has to be
theres so many things i want to say
but you just dont listen to me

prechorus
i dont wanna hurt you
you dont wanna hurt me
i cant stand you
and you cant stand me
we cant rearrange
you could never change me
say goodbye
nothing i say could change your mind because

chorus
i cant stay
tomorrow ill be on my way
so dont expect to find me sleeping in my bed
cause when you wake up
i wont be there
i wont be there

verse 2
everything i say
you find a way to make it
sound like i was born just yesterday
and everything you taught me
doesnt mean a thing
so im going my way
