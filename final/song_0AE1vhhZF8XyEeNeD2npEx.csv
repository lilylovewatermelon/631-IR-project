yellow sun is shining in the afternoon
id really like to tell you but i feel its too soon
my actions are dictated by the phase of the moon
the phase of the moon

the sun it isnt hiding when it sets on you
its not a coward like me and i know but its true
waiting for the darkness now is all i can do
its all i can do

verse 2
and if the sun should follow us into your room
then the courage will be robbed from me to tell you the truth
the setting suns the only thing thats shining on you
thats shining on you

chorus
youre making me hungry
but whats really funny is its not sunny anymore

verse 4
and when i finally told you when the sun has gone
youre laughing cause i thought i was the only one
and the only thing thats left for me is the rising sun
the rising sun

youre making me hungry
youre making me hungry
but whats really funny is its not sunny anymore

outro
its not sunny anymore its not sunny anymore
its not sunny anymore its not sunny anymore
its not sunny anymore its not sunny anymore
its not sunny anymore its not sunny anymore
its not sunny anymore its not sunny anymore1embed"
