verse 1
i dont know anything at all
and im somebody else
it could take years to find you
it could take years to find myself
and i dont need to hear your answer
i just need you to see
that i think its time to break down
these walls that we throw up

chorus
am i still breathing
have i lost that feeling
am i made of glass cause
you see right through me
i dont know who i am
and youre the only one who sees that
i cant ask these questions
that cannot be answered today

refrain

and even if everything goes wrong
and we start to fall apart
i will understand where you are
i will understand this by myself
and i dont need to hear your answer
i just need you to feel
like there are no boundaries at all

chorus
am i still breathing
have i lost that feeling
am i made of glass cause
you see right through me
i dont know who i am
and youre the only one who sees that
i cant ask these questions
that cannot be answered today

bridge
i dont mind today
whoa today i dont matter today oh

verse 3
and how far have we come
too far to throw away the past
will you be there waiting for me
if i have to ask what we are
if i ask today it just wont last
so ill be here waiting for you
outro
will we ever feel this good again
will we ever feel this real again again
will you ever be mine again
will we ever feel this real again
not today today
i dont mind today
whoa today
i dont matter todayembed"
