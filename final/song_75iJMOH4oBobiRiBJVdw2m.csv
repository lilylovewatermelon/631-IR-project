no matter where you go youll never have control
no one makes it out alive no one makes it out alive in paradise

verse 1 jesse rutherford
picture you in summertime drinkin white wine in antigua
told me that youll see me and i see ya
and i really wanna believe ya i do
singin blues no shoes on
strummin in the sun and youve got your feet up
i remember when you used to tell me that youd find your freedom
it was hard to believe ya

prechorus 1 jesse rutherford
cause you never feel enough it never fills you up
and if lyin on an island is the closest that youll come
then run go ahead have fun run

no matter where you go doesnt matter where you go
youll never have control no no no no

no one makes it out alive yeah

verse 2 jesse rutherford
picture me in the major leagues
livin in a dream that i created mhm
i wrote my own books so i never had to read your pages
ive got no patience for that anyway
sensations dont mean anything
if i can just have everything
some days i think ill run away
what would i even do if i made it
i just keep on fading cause
