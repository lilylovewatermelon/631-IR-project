verse
uh i had to hit my knees and thank god for the blessings i been having
i aint mean to sound ungrateful when i complain about the madness
you know it always been my dream to make it with this rapping
but i been having a hard time adapting
but i know god give his toughest battles to his toughest soldiers
dont cry for me when the war is over
just know i finally found that peace that i was looking for
im all in houston me and cuzzo found that drink that we was looking for
cuh what you doing lets get high or something
fade what is you doing go in the store and get me a sprite or something
get me a bigass cup of ice or something
cuh fuck a deuce pour me a four at least a five or something
cause i dont wanna feel nothing
i fuck with her because her head different
she fuck with me because my bread different
i snatched the black out the hellcat and i threw red in it
i left the city cause the feds in it
i threw the phone they say the feds listening
who the fuck is wendy williams keep my name from out your mentions
already made six million its too late to hurt my feelings
sometimes i feel i fucked my life up becoming famous
gotta watch where i be hanging gotta watch where i be staying
ayy rest in peace to whats her name this rap shit super dangerous
already cocked it back just bang it already cocked it back just aim it
look i smoke the weed and sip the lean to take the pain out
if i wasnt high id probably try and blow my brains out
