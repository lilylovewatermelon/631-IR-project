on my arm but what do i go and do
i go and get another one now i got two
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

m simple math aside that has to be some of eminems laziest writing but appropriately enough this song has a lot to do with puking it makes you feel shit and just as you think youre finished surprise but unfortunately unlike puke you cant just pour pink sawdust on this song to make it go away

now im sittin here with your name on my skin
i cant believe i went and did this stupid shit again
my next girlfriend now her names gotta be kim
shiiiiiiit

rc this song wasnt designed for people to listen to it was designed for him to listen to and wallow in his own sorrows and didnt care to actually make us feel anything

m oh no it made me feel something all right mainly disappointment eminem made a name for himself by rapping about hatred but this song just feels like a cheap call back minus all the attitude and intensity9 evil deedstherefore i did not know that i would grow to be
my mothers evil seeding do these evil deeds

m its the first song off encore and much like an overture evil deeds spells it all out giving you a little taste of everything wrong with this dreadful album all in one stagesetting piece

rc this songs main problem is that it sounds like a man trying to do what he did before with bouncy elaborately flowing intricate lyrical delivery but like… somethings cracked something broken and he just cant do it anymore

momma had a baby and its head popped off
head popped off head popped off head popped off head popped off head popped off marc anger
my momma dont want me the next thing i know im gettin dropped off
gettin dropped off gettin dropped off gettin dropped off gettin dropped off
ring ring ring on the doorbell of the next door neighbors on their front porch
rc i think you see our problem with this first verse

predominantly predominantly everythings always predominantly
predominantly white predominantly black
well what about me where does that leave me

m with predominantly white fans in a predominantly black genre

well i guess that im between predominantly both of em
i think if i hear that fuckin word again ima scream

m youre the one saying it who the hell is annoyed at the word predominantly it isnt that common it isnt nearly as annoying as moistor phlegmor slurry

man id hate to have it as bad as that mr mathers claims he had it

rc and here he is addressing the fact that youve heard it all before and that he is recycling it but like ive always said acknowledging that you suck is not an excuse to keep sucking in fact now its worse because now we know that you know you suck and you actively arent doing anything about it and this is how you start your album by rattling off the same crap and you know on his other albums where he would joke about his conventions there was a certain energy quickwittedness and intelligence about his selfawareness this just sounds like hes bored but completely unwilling to break new ground8 my bandrc you know i actually liked this song when it came out but now that i look at it this is the first song that signified his new corny style and sure eminem only has one verse but that one verse plus the stupid corny beat and the chorus are enough to pull it down make no mistake the first minute and a half are filled with eminem and only eminem this is eminems song and its horrible

these chicks dont even know the name of my band
but theyre all on me like they wanna hold hand

so i get off stage right and drop the mic
walk up to these hot chicks and im all like
whats up ladies my names slim shady
im the lead singer in d12 baby

rc and while the rest of these guys here are pretty much mediocre which does nothing to hurt the song proof is the only one with an actually funny verse
im gonna let the world know that proof is hot
i should cut his mic off when the music starts
hey yo its ready to snap on a dumb ass fan
every time i hear hey dude i love your band
we aint a band bitch we dont play instruments

m but then bizarre comes in… and brings it right back home

i told you i made the beats and wrote all the raps
till kon artist slipped me some crack
lose yourself video i was in the back
superman video i was in the back

rc no you werent thats just untrue like its not even the funny kind of untrue like theres some joke to it its just lying for the sake of lying

fuck d12 im outta this band
im gonna start a group with the real roxanne

rc why why would you start a rap group with the chick from the roxanne wars of 1984 what is the joke here why was i supposed to find that funny

m i dont even think they knew what they were going for here but the song wraps up in a neat little package which im sure they thought was comedic gold

im the lead singer of my band my salsa
makes all the pretty girls want to dance
my salsa well look out for my next single its called my salsa
m why is this on the album i think thats a fair enough question i mean i guess i can see how it would fit in the music video you know for a cheap laugh theyre all in costumes you got a cute little dog there but i dont see anyone blasting this in their car or better yet singing along

rc and many people have said this is supposed to be some kind of parody of my milkshake by kelis… thats fine but unfortunately that doesnt make it sound any less stupid7 my first singlehere comes the bucking bronco stomping and stampeding up the damn street
like them buffalo soldiers i told ya im bout to blow
so look out below geronimo motherfuckers is dominos
im on a roll around and around i go
when will i stop i dont know

m did you catch any of that he didnt say anything besides string together a bunch of haphazard irrelevent words with zero meaning behind any of them

eric swallowed some generic sleeping pills
and woke up in bed next to his best friend derick bare naked

janean just turned sixteen and used a fake id
to sneak in vip to see r kelly
hehehehehe

rc so what the hell are you talking about how do these stories relate in any way

am i a jerk or just jerk chicken
or chicka chicka chicka chicka jer jer jerkin the chain
twentytwo jerks and a jerk circle
or is it a circle jerk or wait a minute what am i saying

m good fucking question em and again the joke is supposed to be oh look how aware i am of the fact that im not making sense to which i say okay… i dont care you have given me no reason to care its just random scattershot lyrics with no intent of telling you the listener anything these are lyrics from a man who has nothing to say and and couldnt give two shits how sloppily he presents it did he cut any songs off the album did he seriously think this were worth releasing why didnt anyone stop him

just recently somebody just discovered
britney and justin videotapes of them fucking
when they were just musketeers in the mickey mouse club
and dusted them and went straight to the source with them
cause they couldve sworn someone said nuh
and then tried to erase and record over it
but if you listen close enough to it you can hear the
gauh and then the come to find out it was justin
saying im gonna cum

m why did he just dedicate half of his verse to talking about someone discovering child porn of justin timberlake and britney spears in such detail no less why the hell would you waste this much time to tell us something that has absolutely no significance whats the logic here let me try to guess is this fake story of child pornography that someone randomly sent to source magazine that includes justin timberlake as a kid saying the n word supposed to be a joke on how the source arent a reliable magazine saying that theyll report anything and is this story supposed to parallel the old tape they found of you saying the n word thats the only reasoning i can make out of it and how contrived would that be if it were the truth besides that old tape of you saying the nword turned out to be pretty real so if this convoluted verse was supposed to be you trying to discredit them as a magazine well on execution alone you failed im pretty sure it wont be the last time

so fuck a chicken lick a chicken suck a chicken
beat a chicken eat a chicken like its a big cock
or suck a dick and lick a dick and eat a dick
and stick a dick in your mouth
im done you can fuck off
fuckafuckafuck off6 big weenierc this song is supposed to be a diss track to ray benzino and you know how if youre making a diss track to someone you usually try to sound like the better smarter more clever person well not when youre going through the infantile stage slim shady was going through

youre just really jealous of me
cause im what you want to be
so you just look like an idiot
when you say these mean things
cause its too easy to see
youre really just a big weenie big weenie

m does anyone else think this sounds like an eminem song written through the eyes of spongebob squarepants big weenie more like big pussy what the fuck happened to you

rc so yeah with that in mind check out some of the witty quips that truly put benzino in his place

youre droolin you have tooth decay
your mouth is open youre disgusting
what the fuck you eat for lunch
a bunch of sweets or something what
you munch a bunch of crunch n munch

you look like i sound like singing about weenies

rc uh… shots fired

m yeah sure but who did this song hurt more first of all this song is wack as hell and secondly its eminem dissing somebody we really shouldnt care about in the first place its like when he wasted time dissing icp on his second album get the fuck over it5 mockingbird rc now i know a lot of people like this song and it sounds all sentimental and stuff and some lyrics are truly bittersweet

its funny
i remember back one year when daddy had no money
mommy wrapped the christmas presents up
and stuck em under the tree and said some of em were from me

rc but im sorry i still expect some modicum of lyrical dexterity or at least a flow that sounds like it took time to craft and here he sounds like he just wrote a midnight confessional and any rhyming that happened was purely coincidental

and it seemed like everything was just startin to fall apart
mom and dad was arguin a lot so momma moved back
on the chalmers in the flat

rc and seriously listen to this vocal delivery and tell me it wasnt recorded at four in the morning

i dont see us ever being together ever again
like we used to be when we were teenagers
but then of course everything always happens for a reason
i guess it was never meant to be
but its just something we have no control over and thats what destiny is

rc the pure lackluster delivery murders the sentimentality of the music also

now hush little baby dont you cry
everythings gonna be all right

rc couldnt you get anyone to do these choruses for you like it was endearing on hailies song but now its getting painful

m i didnt like any of the hailie songs myself i hate to sound unsympathetic to ems plite but i just never cared and you know she couldnt possibly like them either especially when she gets older these songs are the rap equivalent of showing embarrassing baby photos to dinner guests4 rain man m i think we found the inspiration for that south park episode where parents go and listen to their kids music and it sounds like shit noises

rc an appropriate sound for this song though because this is the one song off of encore with absolutely no redeemable value theres no main theme or point its just him farting around for four minutes unfiltered and with no structure or purpose his flow is as stilted as ever and his rhymes are arent even laughably bad because that would imply that you could possibly squeeze a quantifiable amount of enjoyment out of this waste of studio money

in football the quarterback yells out hutthutt
while he reaches in another grown mans ass

grabs on his nuts but just what if
it was never meant it was just an accident
but he tripped fell slipped and his penis went in
his teeny tiny little round hiney
but he didnt mean it
but his little weenie flinched

m no more sarcasm guys i just gotta say it straight out quieted anger this is not fucking funny it isnt offensive it isnt controversial its just unacceptable

and i dont gotta make no god damn sense
i just did a whole song and i didnt say shit

m oh oh okay i see thats cool i noticed how pointless it was so that just wipes the sleigh clean no harm no foul its completely cool no its not

rc yeah by the end of the encore album you will wish death on the bastard who invented the concept of selfreferential humor3 just lose itrc now i already reviewed this song so honestly i refuse to listen to it again for the purpose of reiterating my disgust for it if you wanna hear what i had to say about it go and check out that review  im serious you talk about it im not listenin to that dumb ass laugh again

mues oh really this is happening okayumsee you in a minute uh lets see here uh what do i remember about just lose it i remember it not being musically all that bad it was okay but from what i remember it just seemed like eminem trying way too hard for a pop single like a lot of selfreferential humor a lot of callbacks making fun of himself guess he figured that would sell and it did but what i think was really weird is that it wasnt like the rest of the album at all the rest of the album was alienating as fuck its eminem doing a stupid voice making fun of irrelevant celebritiesuh music video he was wearing a lot of costumesum michael jacksons hair caught on fire cause that was funny to somebodynose got kicked around a bit at the end of the videoreally all i remember just lose it kind of speaks for itself

rc ah okay im back youre done right

mues yep you dont have to listen to any part of that song now

rc oh thank god

ha ha ha ha ha

rc i dont like you2 ass like thati aint ever seen an ass like that

rc okay now this song was yet another diss track this time to triumph the insult comic dog thats right the rapper who could be contending for best rapper alive made a diss track to a puppet this was an embarrassing time to be an eminem fan

m but wait triumph in the video and thats robert smigels voice so did they like make up or something

rc look i dont care if this feud was real or fake the point is some publicity battle resulted in this annoying excuse for a song

m yeah hey remember those random parts about pedophelia in just lose it well i guess eminem thought it was so hilarious that he wrote an entire song dedicated to statutory rape…

hillary duff is not quite old enough so
i aint ever seen a butt like that
maybe next year ill say ass and shell make my pee pee go
dodoing doing doing

rc my peepee 

m and if that isnt enough hes gonna piss on girls too you know because thats what the song was truly missing all along

i just like to pee pee pee
yes i make rb i sing song it go
ringachong achingchongchongchongching

m because… r kelly did stuff allegedly i dont know where that random bit of racism came from it has nothing to do with triumph the insult comic dog but it was 2004 and i guess you had to be there

please please forgive
for i am triumph the puppet dog i am a mere puppet
i can get away with anything i say and you will love it

rc so your rip on the guy behind triumph the insult comic dog is that people let him get away with saying offensive things just because hes hiding behind the puppet well couldnt you make the argument that your fans are letting you get away with saying offensive things just because you hide behind the alter ego of an angry rapper i mean im still a fan but dude dont be a hypocrite

i am triumph britney spears has shoulders like a man
and i can say that and youll laugh cause theres a puppet on my hand

m how do you eminem not see the irony in judging someone because they take cheap shots at celebrities have you not heard… every lead single of every one of your albums

get to the chopper everybody get out
i am not triumph i am arnold get down

m an arnold schwarzenegger reference because… 2003 california election…you know what fuck it i cant make excuses for this shit anymore

rc so yeah this song is crap its reprehensible and completely inexcusable as the guy who once brought us the way i am and stan but my friends… nothing can prepare you for this number one song on this list nothing1 fackm i would like you to imagine if you will someone who in late 2005 is trying to get into eminems music but doesnt know where to start weve all been there so hes goes to the record shop and he sees eminems name but he doesnt know which album to buy so he takes a safe bet and goes with his greatest hits album curtain call so he gladly lays his money down and runs home so excited to pop that cd in now imagine you are that person and the first track you hear before lose yourself before stan before sing for the moment even before the real slim shady the very first impression that you get of eminem is a previously unreleased track called

fack fack faaaack
i am going to cum

m dude i dont know what the fuck to say about this but after hearing this people stopped saying eminem please come back i for me at least my response was eminem go away get lost dont call dont write leave and never come back

rc what the hell was the point of this song the whole thing is based around a sexual activity that nobody did he might as well have made a song about rainbow parties i mean who the hell was this song supposed to be for it only serves to highlight a gross sexual activity that people of course accused homosexuals of doing because hey theyre the demographic you could still pick on in the early 2000s without worrying about losing any money

shove a gerbil in your ass through a tube
shove a gerbil in your ass through a tube

rc are we supposed to be singing along with this because… no

m this is absolute trash with no redeeming quality whatsoever there should have never come a day where i would take listening to an insane clown posse song over an eminem song but this is that fucking day

rc now some fans like to use the excuse that he was on drugs

m on drugs my ass puke was made while on drugs rain man was made while on drugs the only possible excuse for a song like this to come from any being of sentient thought is that that person has in mind the specific intention of eliciting pure unadulterated disgust and hatred for listening audience in other words attempted career suicide and unfortunately for us you managed to fuck that up too9embed"
