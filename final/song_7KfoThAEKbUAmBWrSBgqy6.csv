dont you want to dance with me little baby
dont you want to dance with me
i want to take you out tonight
i want to see your face tonight
dont you want to dance with me little baby
dont you want to dance with me
i want to take you out tonight
i want to see your face tonight

verse 1 paul cherry
i ask you to take my hand
lead me to the dance floor
i want to baskin that
i dont think that theres anything better than you
step with me imperfect time
shake everything from your mind
and the lights so blue
its just me and you
in an empty room

verse 2 eyedress
take a turn
let me go
let me go
you now said i love you and everybody knows
im not afraid to be in love
cause i know that youre the one for me
