oh no no no no no no
i cant take no more of this
im knock knock knockin on your door
asking if youll still let me in
wont you stay wont you stay

verse 1 frisco
hear what im saying yeah ask her one more time
if shes stayin then stay if she goin go
fighting arguing hyping no
thats all long like going go
forget the knock knock knocking
making a scene all neighbors are clockin
you need to take control make her know
if she dont open up the door youre bopping
honestly if she aint on it then long it
make her know who the is boss like norwich
come like she dont know mans credentials
she must want man to run off like sonic
the likkle man hyping and fighting is long
make her know from now that you just aint on it
tell her dont get it wrong just try get along
if not bounce to your show in norwich

yo you need to start acting colder
for no reason shes giving you the cold shoulder
but when you dont answer the door
she starts investigating like scully and molder
if she said its over then its over
tell her shes lucky like a four leaf clover
but you keep on ringing her nokia
worst thing bout it shes on voda
dont call her dont ring back
get your car and your diamond ring back
look how many songs youve sang for the girl
and she cant book studio time and sing back leave her
get your old ting back
i dont know why you even started to link that
you need to listen to me jammer chips and frisk
forget the beef allow the big mac

oh no no no no no no

verse 3 chipmunk
if shes saying she dont wanna stay no more
creep downstairs lock the door
you cant have it but dont panic
two days alone she wont manage
yo what gwarn for girls these days
like say we cant get girls these days
one likkle passa two likkle problems
third time round you have to beg them to stay no
you need to low it
remind her who wears the trousers
these women forgetting their roles
tell her i said no you roll them pole
she sees the reaction when you do shows
females flexing like their brainless
fame its not like your nameless
ps do not forget youre famous
hook jay sean
oh no no no no no no
i cant take no more of this
im knock knock knockin on your door
asking if youll still let me in

verse 4 jammer
yo why do girls always wanna talk about leaving
she says shes gone again
and this time shes gone much further than ealing
dont watch that shell be gone by the evening
dont hold your breath cause you might stop breathing
and if shes part of the plan then what you achieving
girls only leave cause they cant take deceiving
after shes got what she wants and she packs up her bags
and opens the door and talks about breezing
thats why im colder at the door girls wanna war like freezing
get that cash money get them gs in
get you cars dry know what youre dealing
dont try to propose when youre kneeling
cause your heart will need a lot more than healing

hook jay sean
oh no no no no no no
i cant take no more of this
im knock knock knockin on your door
asking if youll still let me in
wont you stay wont you stay
oh no no no no no no
i cant take no more of this
im knock knock knockin on your door
asking if youll still let me in
wont you stay wont you stayembed"
