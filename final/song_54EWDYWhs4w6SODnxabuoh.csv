when i feel my phone buzzing aint even gotta look down
i know its you thats calling a couple drinks in by now
so i say hello you say hey babe
say youre bout to catch a cab over to my place
see you in five but baby this time

chorus
stay downtown
keep moving your heels on the floor
let the bartender pour you up another round
tip the cover band find another hand
to dance and call him your rebound
another late night love another last call crush
with the neon shining down
girl this time around stay downtown

verse 2
aint gonna lie if you knock on my door
im gonna let you walk in
let you leave drunk lipstick marks like tattoos on my skin
but you know in the morning
were gonna regret everything we did
so why even start what aint good for our hearts

chorus
stay downtown
keep moving your heels on the floor
let the bartender pour you up another round
tip the cover band find another hand
to dance and call him your rebound
another late night love another last call crush
with the neon shining down
girl this time around stay downtown
see cole swindell liveget tickets as low as 30you might also likebridge
keep sipping your drink keep spinning the room
keep chasing the night like you always do
keep letting the good times play
dont let me get in your way

chorus
stay downtown
keep moving your heels on the floor
let the bartender pour you up another round
tip the cover band find another hand
to dance and call him your rebound
another late night love another last call crush
with the neon shining down
girl this time around stay downtown
stay downtown
yeah this time around baby stay downtownembed"
