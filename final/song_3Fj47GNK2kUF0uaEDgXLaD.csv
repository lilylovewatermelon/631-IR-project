baby i dont feel so good six words you never understood
ill never let you go five words youll never say aww
i laugh along like nothings wrong four days has never felt so long
if threes a crowd and two was us one slipped away hahahahahahahaha

chorus
i just wanna make you feel okay
but all you do is look the other way
i cant tell you how much i wish i didnt wanna stay
i just kinda wish you were gay

verse 2
is there a reason were not through
is there a 12 step just for you
our conversations all in blue
11 heys hey hey hey hey
ten fingers tearin out my hair
nine times you never made it there
i ate alone at 7 you were six minutes away
yay

chorus
how am i supposed to make you feel okay
when all you do is walk the other way
i cant tell you how much i wish i didnt wanna stay
i just kinda wish you were gay
you might also likebridge
to spare my pride
to give your lack of interest an explanation
dont say im not your type
just say that im not your preferred sexual orientation
im so selfish
but you make me feel helpless yeah
and i cant stand another day
stand another day

chorus
i just wanna make you feel okay
but all you do is look the other way hmm
i cant tell you how much i wish i didnt wanna stay
i just kinda wish you were gay
i just kinda wish you were gay
