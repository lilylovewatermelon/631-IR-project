sometimes i can be my own worst enemy
i am my own worst enemy
and other times when im alone at night i definitely find myself in a position to be very unhappy with myself
i am my own worst enemy
i am my own worst enemy
this is one of those times  those bad places that i go to
i am my own worst enemy
i am my own worst enemy
 cause i dont really wanna do that
i am my own worst enemy
i am my own worst enemy

i am my own worst enemy
i am my own worst enemy
