im a goddamn sore loser
i aint too proud to say
that im still thinking bout you
and im so lonesome without you
and i cant get you out of my mind

oh mama dont leave me alone
with my soul shut down so tight
just like a stone cold tomb
aint it clear when im near you
im just dying to hear you
calling my name one more time

oh so dont pay no mind
to my watering eyes
must be something in the air
that im breathing
yes and try to ignore
all this blood on the floor
its just this heart on my sleeve thats bleeding

oh mama dont walk away
you leave me here bereaving
from the words so hard and plain
saying the love that we had
was just selfish and sad
yes but to see you now with him
is just making me mad
oh so kiss him again
just to prove to me that you can
i will stand here
and burn in my skin
yes i will stand here
and burn in my skinyou might also likeembed"
