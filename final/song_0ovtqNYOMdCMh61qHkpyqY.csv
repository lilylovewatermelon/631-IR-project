with her winestained lips yeah she’s nothing but trouble
cold to the touch but she’s warm as a devil
gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
she tasted the break and i can’t get more

chorus
you got me in chains
you got me in chains for your love
but i wouldn’t change
no i wouldn’t change this love
you got me in chains
you got me in chains for your love
but i wouldn’t change
no i wouldn’t change this love
try to break the chains but the chains only break me

verse 2
alone in the night ‘til she knocks on my door oh no
wasted again but i can’t say no whoa

refrain
baby tell me why why you do do me wrong
baby tell me why why you do do me wrong
gave you my heart but you took my soul

you got me in chains
you got me in chains for your love
but i wouldn’t change
no i wouldn’t change this love
you got me in chains
you got me in chains for your love
but i wouldn’t change

try to break the chains but the chains only break meembed"
