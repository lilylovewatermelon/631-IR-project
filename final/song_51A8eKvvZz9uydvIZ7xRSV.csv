this is wrong but i cant help but feel like
there aint nothin more right babe
misty mornin comes again and i cant
help but wish i could see your face
i knew from the first note played
id be breakin all my rules to see you

prechorus
you smile that beautiful smile
and all the girls in the front row
scream your name

chorus
so dim that spotlight tell me things like
i cant keep my eyes off of you
im no one special just another wideeyed girl
whos desperately in love with you
give me a photograph to hang on my wall
superstar

verse 2
mornin lonelinеss comes around when im not
dreamin about you
whеn my world wakes up today
youll be in another town
and i knew when i saw your face
id be counting down the ways to see you

im invisible and everyone knows who you are
and youll never see you sing me to sleep
every night from the radio

whos desperately in love with you
give me a photograph to hang on my wall
