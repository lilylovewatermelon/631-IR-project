you can take money
you can take the ride
you can take it all but never get inside
you cant take my honor
you cant take my soul
you cant take the fact youll never have control

prechorus
you wont break me
no matter how hard you try
you cant shake me down
im fucking bulletproof

chorus
all ive learned its like poison
all ive known inside my veins
all ive seen its like venom
all i know its all that remains

verse 2
you can keep the fortune
you can have the fame
you can have the shit you never will obtain
you cant take my virtue
you cant take my pride
you cant take the anger building up inside
