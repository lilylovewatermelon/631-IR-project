uh thats right
reality check
you know what i mean
street lifes eh
scorpion yeah uh

verse 1
when i was young
i use to dream of being rich
have a lot of houses and cars
couldnt know which one was which
and finding me a chick and getting hitched
living the fairy tale life perfect without a ditch
you think that this would bring me happiness
if at the end of every rainbow
there was a treasure chest
sometimes having more is really less
so take a look inside yourself
youll realize youre really blessed
no matter how youre sad and blue
theres always someone who has it worse than you
sometimes you gotta pay your dues
so dont worry just push on through

chorus
keepn it real
gotta gig up all my peoples who be working on the future
though they know they gotta struggle
keepn it real
to all my homies working on the 9 to 5
and doing right to keep themselves up out of trouble
keepn it real
although sometimes i know it seems impossible
there aint no need in drowning in your sorrows
keepn it real
if things are as bad as they can be
you can be sure therell be a brighter tomorrow

i never got to have myself the house the mansion and the benz
im not the type of brother who be making mad ends
i got myself a girl but we be kickin it as friends
is not enough for me now that depends
again not everything you want is everything you really need
the standard of society is motivated by greed
are you prepared to follow
tell me are you prepared to lead
so persevere and youll succeed

chorus
keepn it real
gotta gig up all my peoples who be working on the future
though they know they gotta struggle
keepn it real
to all my homies working on the 9 to 5
and doing right to keep themselves up out of trouble
keepn it real
although sometimes i know it seems impossible
there aint no need in drowning in your sorrows
keepn it real
if things are as bad as they can be
you can be sure therell be a brighter tomorrow

bridge
all the harsh realities
appears to come in twos and threes
dont worry cause
therell be a better day
one thing i can promise you
just keep on keeping on
i swear to you
theres gonna be a brighter day
verse 3
back in the days
i used to dream of being rich
have a lot of houses and cars
couldnt know which one was which
and finding me a chick and getting hitched
living the fairy tale life perfect without a ditch
you think that this would bring me happiness
if at the end of every rainbow there was a treasure chest
sometimes having more is really less
so take a look inside yourself
youll realize youre really blessed
no matter how youre sad and blue
theres always someone who has it worse than you
sometimes you gotta pay your dues
so dont worry just push on through

chorus
keepn it real
gotta gig up all my peoples who be working on the future
though they know they gotta struggle
keepn it real
to all my peoples working on the 9 to 5
and doing right to keep themselves up out of trouble
keepn it real
although sometimes i know it seems impossible
there aint no need in drowning in your sorrows
keepn it real
if things are as bad as they can be
you can be sure therell be a brighter tomorrow
