i can’t help but wonder
if you fit this world i see
‘cause if not i wonder
if we’re fine
i can’t help but wonder
if you’d rather be set free
you feel oh so distant
when you say you’re mine

chorus
yes you say you say you say
you are you are you are
my girl my girl my girl for now
for now
oooohhh for now

verse 2
i can’t help but wonder
if somewhere things changed for you
because when you’re with me
you’re not here
i keep trying to tell myself
that all of these doubts i fear
are all simply stories
dressed in fеar

then you say you say you say
you are you are you arе
my girl my girl my girl for now
for now
oooohhh for now

bridge
mmmmm

outro
you say you say oh you say that you love me
you say you say oh you say that you care
you say you say how careless can you be
you say you say to leave me out here in the cold cold air
heartbroken
heartbroken for now
for now
for now
for nowembed"
