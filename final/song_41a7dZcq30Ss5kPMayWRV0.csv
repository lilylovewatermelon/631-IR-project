yeah woo

verse 1 drake
im just in the cut sittin sideways
way that you lookin all the time
time gets to tickin and it takes a toll
told you i couldnt really draw the line
line ringin sayin that you told him things
things that you couldve kept inside
sidetrackin me when i was good to you
you were somebody i would stand behind

chorus drake
i know you like to drink til the sun up
grind til you come up
work all winter shine all summer
ride for your brother
you die for your mother
keep that shit a hunna
i know you wanna
vacay to a place where you could
take pictures post on insta
your friends say they miss ya
but they dont really miss ya

rule number one to be a bossass bitch uhhuh
never let a clown nigga try to play you okay
if he play you then rule number two okay
is fuck his best friends and make em yes men okay
and– wow thats how you feel
verse 2 drake
im just in the cut sittin sideways
way that you lookin all the time
time it done left you with a broken heart
hardly excuses how you play with mine
mindin my business and you show up
up to no good i shouldve seen the signs
signin me up to do your dirty work
workin to try and get you off my mind

chorus drake
i know you like to drink til the sun up
grind til you come up
work all winter shine all summer
ride for your brother
you die for your mother
keep that shit a hunna
i know you wanna
vacay to a place where you could
take pictures post on insta
your friends say they miss ya
but they dont really miss ya
