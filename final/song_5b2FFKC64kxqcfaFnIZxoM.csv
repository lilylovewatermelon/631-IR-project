my flow is in the pocket like wallets i got the bounce like hydraulics

i give a fuck if you fail me im gonna follow
my heart and if you follow the charts
or the plaques or the stacks you aint gotta guess whos back you see
im so chi that you thought i was bashful

and i will cut your girl like pastor tro

and i wont give you that money that you askin for

thats why we hear your music and fast forward
cause we dont wanna hear that weak shit no mo

verse 4 common
get em high like noon or the moon
or a room filled with smoke a hype filled with dope
yall assumed i was doomed out of tune
but i still filled the notes with real nigga quotes
real rappers is hard to find like a remote
control rap is out of
used to but still got love
thats why i abuse you who are not thugs
rock clubs like tiger woods in the hood
should have my own reality show called soul survivor
i stole on liveer niggas than you
yous a bitch i got ones that are thicker than you
how could i ever let your words affect me
they say hiphop is dead im here to resurrect me
marshas too sexy to even make songs like these
thats why the raw dont know your name like alicia keys
too many featured mcs and producers is popular
twelve thousand spins nobody got to coppin a
album how come you the hot garbage of
the year its clear your image is looped up
label got you souped up tellin you you sick
when you a dick with a loose nut
video hard to watch like medusa
even your club record need a booster chimped up
with a pimp cup illiterate nigga read the infra
red across your head im bred king like simba
bolder than denver i aint a mad rapper
just a mc with a temper
you dancin for money like honey i did this my way
so when the industry crash i survive like kanye
spittin through wires and fires mcs retirin
got your hands up get them motherfuckers higher then
