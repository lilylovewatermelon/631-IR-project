high quality film right
yo yo yo ayy its like would you
yo yo yo ayy it’s like would you
uh ayy no not the same way
whoa ayy yo yo whoa whoa ayy

verse
its like would you love me no not the same way
if it get ugly you know the gang way
like “show me off in public” this a strange way
like 2012 summer how im movin’ in a straight 8
i hit you when i landed lil dummy you a day late
i be here often your city my vacay
i rocked with them last year its funny we changed place
im only on cash shit them niggas in eighth grade
why they mad at lucki im a bodeine lover
my fans worry ‘bout my health so i aint sippin in public
momma told me ‘bout myself so i cant listen to nothing
i need grandma picture with me i won’t sip if she near me
i can’t give a bitch the glory this bitch think she a britney
i got bitches on my story mad at me but who isnt
so she hit me with “what” you saw sawbuck with who
i got perky on my mental i won’t give you a clue

outro
like would you ayy no the same way
if it get ayy ayy you know the gang way
like would you ayy ayy no not the uh yo
like would you uh yo yo yo yo
ayy like would you love me no not the same way
if it get ugly you know the gang way
no nothing from me no not the same way
like would you ayy ayy no not the same way
