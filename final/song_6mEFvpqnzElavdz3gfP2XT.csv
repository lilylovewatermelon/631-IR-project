verse 1
you built me from a broken heart
with bricks you made from broken parts
youve fixed the paint so we could start
so now whats mine is ours
i still have proof in form of scars
the first time always falls so far
those healing wounds heal twice as hard
but now whats mine is ours
but now whats mine is ours

chorus
we are survivors
we are survivors of the wild
we are survivors
we are survivors of the wild

verse 2
my sweet devoted counterpart
we catch each others shooting stars
however close however far
whatevers mine is ours
whatevers mine is ours
