true friends lie underneath these witty words i dont believe
i cant believe a damn thing they say anymore
lie liar youll pay for your sins
now liar i know all the places youve been lie
forgiveness this taste all but poisons my mouth
i scream but nothing nothing will come out
youve gone too far

chorus
so tell me how does it feel
how does it feel to be like you
i think your mouth should be quiet
cause it never tells the truth
so tell me so tell me why
why does it have to be this way
why cant things ever change

verse 2
falling over and over again
oh why does it have to be this way
from the place i was to the place i am to the place i want to be
for the mountains ive been climbing over and under and over
from the place that i was to the man i’ve become
ill be there to see the tower you’ll fall from
no this kingdom isnt quite what it may seem
you’re an illusion you’ll never be king
you might also likechorus
so tell me how does it feel
how does it feel to be like you
i think your mouth should be quiet
cause it never tells the truth
so tell me so tell me why
why does it have to be this way
why cant things ever change

bridge
sometimes things are better left unsaid
but this time youll get what you give
true friends lie underneath these witty words i dont believe
i cant believe a damn thing they say anymore
come down come down come down from your tower
falling over and over again
come down come down come down from your tower

outro
i know that for all my life for all my strength
there is one above who can judge me
all i am is yours all i am is yours i am yours18embed"
