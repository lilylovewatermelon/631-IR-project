if im a bad person you dont like me
well i guess ill make my own way
its a circle a mean cycle
i cant excite you anymore
wheres your gavel your jury
whats my offense this time
youre not a judge but if youre gonna judge me
oh sentence me to another life

prechorus
dont wanna hear your sad songs i dont wanna feel your pain
when you swear its all my fault cause you know were not the same no
were not the same oh
oh were not the same
yeah the friends who stuck together we wrote our names in blood
but i guess you cant accept that the change is good hey
its good hey
its good

chorus
well you treat me just like another stranger
well its nice to meet you sir i guess ill go
i best be on my way out
you treat me just like another stranger
well its nice to meet you sir i guess ill go
i best be on my way out

verse 2
this is the best thing that couldve happened
any longer and i wouldnt have made it

well now i can fend for myself

when you swear its all my fault cause you know were not the same no

but i guess you cant accept that the change is good hey
its good hey
