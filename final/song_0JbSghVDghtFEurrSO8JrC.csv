hey girl go on now
you know youve got everybody lookin

verse 1
got a little boom in my big truck
gonna open up the doors and turn it up
gonna stomp my boots in the georgia mud
gonna watch you make me fall in love
get up on the hood of my daddys tractor
up on the toolbox it dont matter
down on the tailgate girl i cant wait
to watch you do your thing

prechorus
shake it for the young bucks sittin in the honkytonks
for the rednecks rockin til the break of dawn
for the dj spinnin that country song
come on come on come on
shake it for the birds shake it for the bees
shake it for the catfish swimmin down deep in the creek
for the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
shake it to the moon shake it for me girl aww

chorus
country girl shake it for me girl
shake it for me girl shake it for me
country girl shake it for me girl
shake it for me girl shake it for me

with a gattle in her bud to get a little wild

spin me around this big ole barn
tangle me up like grandmas yarn
