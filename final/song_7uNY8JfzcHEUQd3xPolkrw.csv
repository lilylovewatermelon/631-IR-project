got a got a bunch of baggage

verse 1 ruby da cherry
got a bunch of baggage
got a bunch of bags up in the attic hidin all my bad habits
lick he got some bad habits plus hes asthmatic
all the smoke that i be draggin bitch
i need some caskets for my fuckin lungs they fucking damaged
like the black flag classic sabbath never heard of that shit
bitch i work it aint for assets
roll a solo blunt no matchin
its because of all the gadgets why i keep a social status
fuckin phones and tablets bitch i do this shit just for jefe
yeah he told me make it happen then he died in that tragic car crash
and every time i think of that im flickin ashes
yeah it sucks
when you realize life is fast and im a fuckin cashless organism
tryna thrive inside a habitat thats plastic

verse 2 lick loth
its that motherfucker that ya momma said dont hang with
meet me in the gallows bitch i promise that its painless
stupid motherfuckers thinking that we on the same shit
cock it back and then i yell okay here comes the pain bitch
up in gangsters paradise could give a fuck about your life
every time i roll the dice sixes popping up twice
bitches tryna sacrifice their pussy but i am not enticed
good try ho
i do this shit for dirt so i aint got the time ho
dont like nobody and i think thats all you need to know
walkin on water while im surrounded by some crows
and when i hit the other side im blowing on some dope hosee uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also like23embed"
