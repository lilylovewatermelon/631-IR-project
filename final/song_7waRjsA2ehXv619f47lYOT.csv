there must be something we can eat
maybe find another lover
should i fly to los angeles
find my asshole brother
mickey mouse has grown up a cow
daves on sale again
we kissy kiss in the rear view
were so bored youre to blame

a million dollars at stake
as you search for your demigod
and you fake with a saint
