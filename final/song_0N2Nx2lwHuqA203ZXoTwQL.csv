gather around everybody
have you heard the latest craze
put your hands in your pockets
and look the other way
remember those times when you were laughing
and naked on my couch
pretend it never happened
politely smile as we turn around

chorus
and do the act like you never met me
do the act like you never met me
do the act like you never met me
and slowly walk away

verse 2
the hidden kisses
the clumsy conspiratory glance
but i dont really mind it though
i always like the way you danced
its so easy to do
so much simpler than the one we did before
just point out your toe
at someone you know
and pretend that theyre not
you might also likechorus
and do the act like you never met me
do the act like you never met me
and do the act like you never met me
and slowly walk away

bridge

verse 3
slide to the left
now slide to the right
now tell me once again
how i was a really great guy
and dip to right
now shimmy to the left
its 3 oclock in the morning
dont answer my texts
take a step back and
take a couple more
now one more sorry look
before you walk out that door
arch your back
when you spend the night with him
bounce around a while
never talk to me again
chorus
thats how you do the
act like you never met me
so do the act like you never met me
do the act like you never met me
and slowly walk away2embed"
