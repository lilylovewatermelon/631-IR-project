hes got so much love for her
but he doesnt know what to do
sitting in the car
waiting outside her school

prechorus
hes in for a heartbreak
if its all been blind faith
from my point of view

chorus
baby hes got to be crazy
living like hes john wayne
always facing the world
or chasing the girl
baby hes got to be crazy

verse 2
hes got so much in his heart
but he doesnt know what to do
all he wants is her
lying inside his room

prechorus
hes always feeling cheated
telling all his secrets
that i couldnt keep
