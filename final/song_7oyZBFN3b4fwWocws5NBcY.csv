outro
to my women with the utmost respect intellect
we often forget and neglect
intuition can see through illusive intent listen to it
just listen just listen oh
i found myself searching for a way to prevent the detriment
and giving the impression that if you express to him what a woman needs his comprehension is definite
but theres a difference between understanding and honoring your word
and im articulate hes a good listener
but im hesitant cause hes gonna fuck up anyways
baby just listen listen listen oh
in the corners of a mans mind
theres a place where vulnerability hides
and intimacy is not the act of physical intertwine
but its the isolation of two minds
thats why he keeps his heart and his head separate
theres only one he can connect with
the multiple names on the checklist
only calls when hes desperate
i guess its too much pressure to be respectful and honest
its too stressful to be keepin promises and im impatient
im too high maintenance
way too many expectations when were just dating
but im special right
deny deny deny
all you do is lie word is bond right
but not with me because i dont know what its like
ill never understand the needs of a man or how to nurture
and what she doesnt know cant hurt her
but nah its deep and you know it
i told you exactly what i wanted
and that love is exhausting but im not tired of you yet
oh no woah no
to my women with the utmost respect intellect
we often forget and neglect
intuition can see through illusive intent listen to it7embed"
