uh and it dont stop

verse 1 mae
see i’m all big benzes coupes and hummer trucks
hoes don’t really like me i’m just somethin to fuck
what it gone take to make cats slow up
do i got to go back to pickin 44 up
leavin’ the seen for teams that gone make them throw up
im the reason the witness don’t never show up
wanna be safe from mase give the safe to mase
neither judge or the jury wanna take this case
one in your mouth you don’t know the rage i’m in
matter fact you don’t know how mad you made my men
i got niggas at your moms house 8am
and after they through with you they go and blaze your men
you was ass way back then should of laid you then
grab a nigga out the building tre 8 to his chin
pull a bullet to his chest that a change his wind
and don’t care bout the pain hes in

chorus diddy  mae
i’m no killa but you could make me one
i’m no thug but you could make me one
i’m no hustla but you could make me one
i’m no gangsta so don’t make me one
you might also likeverse 2 mae
who would ever ever ever make a nigga try me
what you think sumthin tangy bout mase i see
what it take for blood to clog niggas ivs
for cats to sit back and think why me
now why you better yet how you
be a light skinned nigga that get fount sky blue
either all summer long you been ducking piru
or half y’all cats just scared to buy blue
wit mase your rival mase is liable
put blink beside you then tape and tie you
rape and hide you in the lake they find you
with no prints cops cant trace what i do
now your mother think her baby didn’t deserve this shit
well her baby shouldn’t fuck with a third of my brick
i got people that’s payin think they ain’t concern with this
is you thinkin how could one bullet burn like this
put the word out i want that black suburban hit
one think side of the story from a vibe journalist
when you dropped in a box with worms on your wrist
other niggas learn from this

chorus diddy  mae
i’m no killa but you could make me one
i’m no thug but you could make me one
i’m no hustla but you could make me one
i’m no gangsta so don’t make me one
verse 3 mae
half these cats spit it don’t even live it
and according to they digits they all midgets
see me i rocks wit it 6 months shock bid it
i go up state see all my cats and count digits
you got guns but never get knocked wit it
cuz if i’m stopped wit it the cops get it
im one of the few that talk about gators and got lizards
you got ice but never go on the block wit it
jerk your work and you go n still rock wit it
ill rapped till i’m clapped like big and pac did it
mase get his message from a lifer
he said shorty i was young i was just like ya
now i’m illy wit the best snipers
did wheelies wit the best bikers
gettin’ head from confessed dikers
saddle thugs and that’s just righteous
niggas don’t want a war niggas just hyper
movin off a motions im no dude for commotion
leave niggas bruised in the ocean
neck broken head open chest soakin
fund him piece by piece wit the rest floatin

chorus diddy  mae
i’m no killa but you could make me one yeah dont make me one
i’m no thug but you could make me one motherfucker dont make me one
i’m no hustla but you could make me one fuck what you heard nigga
i’m no gangsta so don’t make me one im gonna tell you wassup
i’m no killa but you could make me one you cant stop me
i’m no thug but you could make me one 99
i’m no hustla but you could make me one
i’m no gangsta so don’t make me one so wassup motherfuckerembed"
