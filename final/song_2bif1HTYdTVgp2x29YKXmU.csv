when i grab you by the hand you hesitate
with a subtle inclination to tell a man straight
your sister was a savior and your mother is a saint
sometimes a woman is the sum of all the things her father aint
and men are just the sum of all the things their mothers did
theyll spend their lives searchin for the love they had as kids
my vices aint in place to replace a loving home
you cant expect to harvest where the fields halfgrown

chorus
you cant choose your blood
but you can choose to change the chains that chained you down
when you was just a child
and forgiveness aint an easy road to go
but i know that its a road worth headin down

verse 2
when i see myself i see your eyes
reflections nowadays are a calm surprise
with the older i get the more i become
all the things i swore id always run from
but ill raise myself a family and right the wrong
of some imperfect people who were only halfgrown

chorus
cause you cant choose your blood
but you can choose to change the chains that chained you down
when you was just a child
and forgiveness aint an easy road to go
but i know that its a road worth going down

when i grab you by the hand you hesitate
with a subtle inclination to tell a man straight
your sister was a savior and your mother is a saint
sometimes a woman is the sum of all the things her father aintembed"
