itll be fine by dusk light im tellin you baby
these things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy
but when you place your head between my collar and jaw
i dont know much but theres no weight at all

verse 2
and im damned if i do and im damned if i dont
cause if i say i miss you i know that you wont
but i miss you in the mornings when i see the sun
somethin in the orange tells me were not done

chorus
to you im just a man to me youre all i am
where the hell am i supposed to go
i poisoned myself again somethin in the orange
tells mе youre never comin homе
if you leave today ill just stare at the way
the orange touches all things around
the grass trees and dew how i just hate you
please turn those headlights around

verse 3
i need to hear you say youve been waitin all night
theres orange dancin in your eyes from bulb light
your voice only trembles when you try to speak
take me back to us dancin this wood used to creak

to you im just a man to me youre all i am
where the hell am i supposed to go
i poisoned myself again somethin in the orange
tells me youre never comin home
if you leave today ill just stare at the way
the orange touches all things around
the grass trees and dew how i just hate you
please turn those headlights around

chorus
to you im just a man to me youre all i am
where the hell am i supposed to go
i poisoned myself again somethin in the orange
tells me youre never comin home
if you leave today ill just stare at the way
the orange touches all things around
the grass trees and dew how i just hate you
please turn those headlights around
please turn those headlights around1embed"
