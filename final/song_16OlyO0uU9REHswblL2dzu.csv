ive got these letters tattooed on my arm
that remind me each second
of where i come from
and the long hard road
to guide me back home

verse 1
back to my mama who raised me up right
and back to my lady i held every night
its a long hard road trying to get home
ive been gone now for too long

chorus
im not trying to stop a hurricane
im not trying to shake the ground below
im just trying to find a way to make it back home
im not trying to part the ocean waves
im not trying to overthrow the throne
im just trying to find a way to make it back home
im just trying to get home

ive got this image engraved in my mind
of a light that i had in a whole different time
it still breathes and lives at the end of the road
ive seen mountains and valleys through my missing days
but i never once parted with how you begged me to stay
i will run down that long hard and treacherous road to get home

chorus
im not trying to stop a hurricane
im not trying to shake the ground below
im just trying to find a way to make it back home
im not trying to part the ocean waves
im not trying to overthrow the throne
im just trying to find a way to make it back home
im just trying to get home
ooh ooh
ooh ooh

ive been gone for so long
but my heart it carries on
as it pounds like a drum
on my journey back home
ive been gone for so long
but my heart it carries on
i wont give up
chorus
im not trying to stop a hurricane
im not trying to shake the ground below
