he is observing the chaos taking in the lack of raw humanity
its as if the entire worlds fallen in love with their insanity
hear the innocent voices scream
as their tormentors laugh through all of it
no forgiveness from all ive seen
the degradation i cannot forget

prechorus
so sleep soundly in your beds tonight
for judgement falls upon you at first light

chorus
im the hand of god im the dark messiah
im the vengeful one
look inside and see what youre becoming
in the blackest moment of a dying world
what have you become
look inside and see what youre becoming

verse 2
as the violence surges
and the teeming masses have been terrorized
the human predators all gone mad
are reaping profits born from their demise
the rabid media plays their roles
stoking the flames of war to no surprise
only too eager to sell their souls
for the apocalypse must be televised
see disturbed liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likeprechorus
so sleep soundly in your beds tonight
for judgement falls upon you at first light

chorus
im the hand of god im the dark messiah
im the vengeful one
look inside and see what youre becoming
in the blackest moment of a dying world
what have you become
look inside and see what youre becoming

when you die youll know why
for you cannot be saved
with all the world enslaved
when you die youll know why
youll die youll know why
for you cannot be saved
this world is too depraved
when you die youll know why

im the hand of god im the dark messiah
im the vengeful one

in the blackest moment of a dying world
what have you become
look inside and see what youre becoming
im the hand of god im the dark messiah
im the vengeful one
look inside and see what youre becoming
in the blackest moment of a dying world
