suddenly
my choice is clear
i knew that only you and i were standing here
and beautiful

its only you i know its true

verse 1 victoria justice
that money isnt worth a thing if you didnt earn it
you dont deserve it
true love doesnt cost a thing
and if you try to buy it
you cant return it
no no no whoa
your friends doing all the same things
and my friends
look at what youre wasting
it doesnt matter if you change their minds

chorus victoria justice
suddenly i can see what i didnt before
and i dont care what they say anymore
cause im finally falling falling
im finally falling falling

it doesnt matter if we change their minds

chorus victoria justice
suddenly i can see what i didnt before

bridge victoria justice
if you cant find love when youre in it
dont forget it
it would change your mind once you get it

chorus victoria justice
