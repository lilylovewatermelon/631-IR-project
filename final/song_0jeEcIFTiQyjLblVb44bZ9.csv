verse
somehow i keep on losing all my friends
i came to the conclusion its not them
where do i go to get some peace tossing turning when i sleep
change my number every week i got some pain thats running deep yeah
i dont shed tears anymore cause love dont live here anymore
im sorry baby girl i got to go whether if you like it or you dont
cause ive been here too many times before yeah
i wonder when they look at me yeah
i wonder what they see
wondering if they can see the pain underneath
wondering if they can see the change i increased
brother really swang it for me
we tear down their whole gang when its beef
leave a nigga brains in the street
50kll have em swangin for weeks
you better have that thang when they creep yeah
and i cant get no sleep i got to stay up
im in love with the streets i cant lay up
its like i feel myself falling then i wake up up
ima die a paper chaser
my whole life i been running baby
like someones coming baby
i have a hard time trusting baby
cant trust for nothing babe
