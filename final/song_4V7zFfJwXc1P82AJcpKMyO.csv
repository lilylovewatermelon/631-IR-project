can you sleep the days on and in the kitchen
can you see im not your dog
if you give me all your soul your affection
ill lay on my back and purr

refrain
ive got all nine lives and
that aint enough

verse 2
can you wrestle each and all of the parasites
that keep gnashing at my fur
can you truly be the power of illusion
pretend the back turn doesnt hurt

refrain
ive got all nine lives and
that aint enough

verse 3
i sure hope this feline metaphor
tells you nothings ever enough
cause i got the things i claimed i was living for
and i still just wanna jump
see matt maltese liveget tickets as low as 41you might also likeoutro
ive got all nine lives and
ive got all nine lives and
that aint enoughembed"
