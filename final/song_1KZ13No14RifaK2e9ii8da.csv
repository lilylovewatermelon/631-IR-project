been going round and round all day
bailing some hay and stackin it all up
cant wait for the sun to go down
roll into town shine the old truck up
swing by the quick stop
grab a couple rocky tops
then ease on out your way
to your place around eight oclock

chorus
well im just ready to ride this chevy
ride this chevy down a little back road
slide your pretty little self on over
get a little closer turn up the radio
put your pretty pink toes on the dash
lean the seat back
man i swear there aint nothin looks better than that
sweet tan little thing with nothin to do
i wanna take a little ride with you

verse 2
i hope youre wearing those frayed out cutoffs
makes me want to get lost out in the moonlight
drop the tailgate down on a turn road
watch the corn grow baby thats a good night
anyone from the heartland is gonna understand
what i am talking about right now
aint no doubt we got a game plan

chorus
well im just ready to ride this chevy
ride this chevy down a little back road
slide your pretty little self on over
get a little closer you can play my radio
put your pretty pink toes on the dash
lean the seat back
man i swear there aint nothin looks better than that
sweet tan little thing with nothin to do
i wanna take a little ride with you

take a little ride with you
i wanna take a little ride with you4embed"
