city lights take me away
now its time we never ever head down
dont be scared i am for real
hide away and we will never be found

prechorus
its alright we never look back
birds will sing if we fall
its alright with memories inside
midnight dust on the floor
watch it turn into gold

chorus
and i dont even know whats real
and i dont know what to feel
im your truth in disguise im in love with your lies
cause i cant breathe cant settle down
and i dont know what to feel
no i dont know what to feel

verse 2
see these lights were getting away
heads wont find us were not making a sound
were not scared we are for real
love cant hurt us now were sheltered by lies

cause i cant breathe cant settle down
and i dont know what to feel
no i dont know what to feel1embed"
