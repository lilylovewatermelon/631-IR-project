youre just too good to be true
cant take my eyes off of you
youd be like heaven to touch
i wanna hold you so much
at long last love has arrived
and i thank god im alive
youre just too good to be true
cant take my eyes off you

verse 2
pardon the way that i stare
theres nothing else to compare
the sight of you leaves me weak
there are no words left to speak
but if you feel like i feel
please let me know that it real
youre just too good to be true
cant take my eyes off you

chorus
i love you baby and if its quite alright
i need you baby to warm the lonely night
i love you baby trust in me when i say
oh pretty baby dont bring me down i pray
oh pretty baby now that i found you stay
and let me love you baby let me love you
