ah i stank i can i stank i can

the underground smell road
everybodys lookin for an excuse to let loose
whats your locomotive the chattanigga choo choo

hook andré 3000  erykah badu
humble as a mumble in the jungles
of shouts and screams
thats the way the cracker crumbles
so i guess ive got to reroute my dreams
humble as a mumble in the jungles
of shouts and screams
thats the way the cracker crumbles
so i guess ive got to reroute my dreams

verse 1 big boi
back on the microphone your number one controller
i rock the microphone like a blizzard im so cold im tryin to told ya
life is like a great big roller coaster
everything in life dont always happen like its supposed to
trials and tribulations make you stronger live longer
you wanna reach the nation nigga start from ya corner
everything dont always happen like you plan it
demand it over stand it then you handle it
fuck wishing you missing the ambition on your mission
now you switchin
why you quittin cause its heated in the kitchen
sloppy slipping in your pimpin nigga nigga
you either pistol whoop the nigga or you choke the trigger
youve gots to follow through struggle to complete your dreams
no weapon formed against you prospers 5417
from isaiah lay a nigga down and spray em
if the dealer dealt a fucked up hand of cards youve gotta play em

verse 2 andre 3000
yeah too democratic republic fuck it
we chicken nugget we dip in the sauce like mop and bucket
bluecollar scholars wholl take your dolla and wipe my ass with it
you living for the lotto never hit it
i met a critic i made her shit her draws
she said she thought hip hop was only guns and alcohol
i said oh hell naw but yet its that too
you cant discrimahate cause you done read a book or two
what if i looked at you in a microscope saw all the dirty organisms
living in your closet would i stop and would i pause it whoo
to put that bitch in slower motion got the potion and the antidote
and a quote for collision the decision
is do you want to live or wanna exist
the game changes every day so obsolete is the fist and marches
speeches only reaches those who already know about it
this is how we go about it
hook andré 3000  erykah badu

verse 3 erykah badu
im wild just like a rock a stone a tree
and im free just like the wind the breeze that blows
and i flow just like a brook a stream the rain
and i fly just like a bird up in the sky
and ill surely die just like a flower plucked
and dragged away and thrown away
and then one day it turns to clay
it blows away it finds a ray it finds its way
and there it lays until the rain and sun
then i breathe just like the wind the breeze that blows
and i grow just like a baby breastfeeding
and its beautiful thats life and thats life ahhhh
and thats life and thats life

hook andré 3000  erykah badu
humble as a mumble in the jungles

humble as a mumble in the jungles
of shouts and screams
thats the way the cracker crumbles
