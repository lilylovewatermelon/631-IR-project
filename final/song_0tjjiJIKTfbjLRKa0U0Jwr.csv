lay me down hard
light my cigarette and make my bed
somewhere beneath the stars

i was born a blue child
of the wild western sky
but i left my prairie home
found a boxcar for to ride
now im way down in okemah
earning blisters on my feet
with my guitar and my buck knife
thumbing down woody guthrie street

so lay me down easy
lay me down hard
light my cigarette and make my bed
somewhere beneath the stars
dont look for me in glory
dont look for me below
cause ill be riding on that freight
where the souls of ramblers go

and theres a sadness that follows
most everywhere i roam
you can see it on my smile
you can smell it on my clothes
sometimes ill outrun it
it never lasts too long
so keep me good and loaded
and ill keep singing songs
see colter wall liveget tickets as low as 68you might also likelay me down easy
lay me down hard
light my cigarette and make my bed
somewhere beneath the stars
dont look for me in glory
dont look for me below
cause ill be riding on that freight
where the souls of ramblers go

if i dont leave here tomorrow
i believe ill blow out my brains
but either way therell be sorrow
and you wont be seeing me again

lay me down easy
lay me down hard
light my cigarette and make my bed
somewhere beneath the stars
dont look for me in glory
dont look for me below
cause ill be riding on that freight
where the souls of ramblers goembed"
