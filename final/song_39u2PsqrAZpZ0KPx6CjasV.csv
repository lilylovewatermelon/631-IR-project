verse lil wayne
like adam in the garden of eve
my bitch got an apple bottom and she swallow my seeds
follow my lead fire i breathe water my seed
and sit back and watch money grow on trees
droppin seeds like classics these hoes drop they asses
i drop a seed in her panties if it smell like pansies
im a banshee in her panties nigga ask your mammy
never played golf but got a driver and a caddy
whole squad slammin like onyx you know sticky fingaz
some drop science im droppin english
even if tyler named the song flower
no seeds in the bud still dont trust bugs
im down

chorus tyler the creator  lil wayne
droppin seeds on these niggas they cant fuck with the boy mula
