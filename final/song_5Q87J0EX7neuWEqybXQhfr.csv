im holding on your rope
got me ten feet off the ground
im hearing what you say
but i just cant make a sound
you tell me that you need me
then you go and cut me down but wait
you tell me that youre sorry
didnt think id turn around and say

chorus
that its too late to apologize
its too late
i said its too late to apologize
its too late

verse 2
i take another chance
take a shot take a fall for you
i need you like a heart needs a beat
but its nothing new
i loved you with the fire red
now its turning blue and you said
sorry like the angel
heaven let me think was you
but im afraid
see luke bryan liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likechorus
that its too late to apologize
its too late
i said its too late to apologize
its too late

chorus
i said its too late to apologize
its too late
its too late to apologize
its too late
its too late to apologize
its too late
i said its too late to apologize
its too late

outro
im holding on your rope
got me ten feet off the groundembed"
