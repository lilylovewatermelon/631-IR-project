a bird with the word came to me
the sweetness of a honeycomb tree
and now i look whats taking over me
couldnt fake it if i wanted to
i had to wake up just to make it through
i got my patience and im making do
i learned my lessons from the ancient roots
i choose to follow what the greatest do
a bird with the word came to me
the sweetness of a honeycomb tree
and now i look whats taking over me
couldnt fake it if i wanted to
i had to wake up just to make it through
i got my patience and im making do
i learned my lessons from the ancient roots
i choose to follow what the greatest do

verse
im repping for the longest cycle mmm
my uncles had to pay the cost mmm
my sister used to sing to whitney mmm
my mama caught the gambling bug mmm
we came up in a lonely castle mmm
my papa was behind them bars mmm
we never had to want for nothing mmm
said all we ever need is love mmm
we see the same things
we sing the same songs
we feel the same grief
bleed the same blood
you grew up in the home beside me
i always had a friend to call
how could i make it here without you mmm
i pray i leave before youre gone

i choose to follow what the greatest do
a bird with the word came to me
the sweetness of a honeycomb tree
and now my luck was taking over me
couldnt fake it if i wanted to
i had to wake up just to make it through

papa was a goner mmm14embed"
