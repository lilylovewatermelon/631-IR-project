take it and take it and take it and take it and take it all
take it and take it and take it until you take us all
smash it and crash it and thrash it and trash it  theyre only toys

try it youll like it dont hide it dont fight it just let it out
steal it and shoot it and kill it or take another route
take it and take it and take it you know theyre only toys

chorus
devour devour
suffocate your own empire
devour devour
its your final hour
devour devour
stolen like a foreign soul
devour devour
what a way to go

verse 2
you want it you want it you want it you want it well here it is
everything everything everything isnt so primitive
take it and take it and take it and take it and take it all

nobody nobody wants to feel like this
nobody nobody wants to live like this
nobody nobody wants a war like this
