cant believe that its over baby
but every bruise on my heart you gave me
see we tried but we fight then we cried
now its over babe its over babe
cant believe that its over baby
but every bruise on my heart you gave me
see we tried but we fight then we cried
so its over babe its over babe

verse 1
when i met you i knew you would be the one for me
cause looking at you had me feeling kind of crazy
now what you asked i almost did it automatically
but it was nothing compared to the joy you gave me
although i know that what we had it wasnt perfect babe
you fooled around but see back then it didnt phase me
i thought by staying trying to change you would be worth it babe
but now i see that trying to change you only changed me

prechorus
all these tears
and all of your lies
all these years
and now were saying goodbye
its over babe

so its over babe its over babe

verse 2
now im thinking that i never shoulda dealt with you
all this screaming and this yelling that we go through
raining late at night im sitting waiting up for you
just to tell you how i hate who you turned into
see aint no way im gonna sit and take this shit from you
ill never play another day of being your fool
ive wasted all my time on something that just wasnt true
i should have known i could never ever change you

prechorus
all these tears
and all of your lies
all these years
and now were saying goodbye
its over babe
