honestly why are my clothes out on the street
honestly i think youve lost your mind
i cant believe i came home to find my car keyed
honestly im way too tired to fight
round and round drama every time

chorus
imma go cause i got no
problem with saying goodbye
is it wrong that im gonna be
having the time of my life
cause deep down i know
i should cry i should scream
and get down on my knees
i should say that i need you here
but im gonna party tonight
cause honestly i just dont care
naaa naaa
honestly i just dont care
naaa naaa naaaa

verse 2
honestly everybodys stoked im finally free
honestly my phones blowing up tonight

make out with all your dumb friends
tag your face
just to rub it in

so dont roll up when theyre playing my song
dont act right when you know youre dead wrong

im under cover so you can drop that bomb

cause im already gone

honestly you did it to yourself
so dont blame me
