baby pour over
tell me are we concrete
what would you do without my perfect company to your undressed spine
and i can hear you drag behind my car by your broken legs
swallowing stitches in her sleep
as she stole my only view may i never blink

chorus
while you stood over the pavement
i was biting the curb
sick entertainment
but ill bet it feels good coming down
cant bear to wash out the wasted time
between your lips and mine

verse 2
zero friends
followed your voices into a sea of crosses
she blends in with the foxes gold and feels like home
under the surface my love
but beware beware beware
and take it slow tonight
were on the other side of the road
i think were bleeding out
see pierce the veil liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likechorus
while you stood over the pavement
i was biting the curb
sick entertainment
but ill bet it feels good coming down
cant bear to wash out the wasted time
between our lips
so cmon and swing it back and forth just like
my heart is on a pendulum tonight
if your lungs are mine i only wanna watch your clouds linger in the darkness

bridge
oh cant you feel it
youre feeding on my restless soul
oh cant you see that
its never enough its never enough
oh cant you feel it
you feed on my restless soul
oh can you see that
its never enough its never enough
today i saw the whole world
and i think heaven has a plot to take my life
listen im the one who made you
ill be the one who brings you down
but this will be the last time
chorus
bite on the curb
aw your sick entertainment
oh ill bet it feels good when youre coming down
cant bear to wash out the wasted time
between our lips
so cmon swing it back and forth just like
my heart is on a pendulum tonight
if your lungs are mine
i only wanna watch your clouds linger in the darkness

sing it one more time8embed"
