hey i feel like i might say the wrong thing
i hung up when i started calling
you probably wouldve laughed then
if you had seen it happen
hey who took my place in bed when i left
who laughs at everything that youve said
im sure that i would like her
if i were slightly nicer

chorus
bet you wish you
never even met me
i dont blame you
broke your every heartbeat

verse 2
hey i parked across the street from your house
the lights were on the music got loud
i doubt you wouldve seen me
i hid from everybody
hey i feel like if we gave it one night
youd hate me less and make it alright
just wish that we could fight now
id hold you on the comedown

i cant blame you

i see you every night in my sleep
anticipating every bad dream
like falling with a knife you cut deep

i see you every night in my sleep
anticipating every bad dream
like falling with a knife you cut deep
you cut deep
