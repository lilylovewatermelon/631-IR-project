remove the gag and step away hes suffocating
you pull the strings day after day
thats why he needs a break from you
bid your ass adieu
a break from you
bitch your ass is through

prechorus
oh i hope he hears these words
maybe this time he will learn

chorus
you should escape
skip town
no more excuses
abandon ship or drown
no more excuses
do you even have a plan of attack
a way to react
oh no you should escape skip town
youre better on your own

verse 2
okay we get it
youre both a happy couple
why else go through the trouble
of posting it ten times a day
break from you
bid your ass adieu
we need a break from you
bitch your ass is through

oh i hope he hears these words
maybe this time he will learn

chorus
you should escape
skip town
no more excuses
abandon ship or drown
no more excuses
do you even have a plan of attack
a way to react
oh no you should escape skip town
youre better on your own

bridge
if youre both in black and white
and they ask who dares defy
ill be raising my hand high

spoken
if anyone should object to this marriage
speak now or forever hold your peace
yeah i got something to say

chorus
you should escape
skip town
no more excuses
abandon ship or drown
no more excuses
do you even have a plan of attack
a way to react
oh no you should escape skip town
youre better on your own
youre better on your own
youre better on your own
youre better on your own
youre better on your own8embed"
