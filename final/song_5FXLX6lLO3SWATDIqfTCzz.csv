sometimes i wish i lived in air stream homemade curtains
lived just like a gypsy
break a heart roll out of town
cause gypsies never get tied down

verse 1
sometimes i wish i lived on a mountain
drank from a stream instead of a fountain
id stay there top of the world
but i was born a red dirt girl

verse 2
unbridled or tethered and tied
the safety of the fence
or the danger of the ride
ill always be unsatisfied

chorus 2
sometimes i wish i lived by a pier
in a lighthouse with a chandelier
id watch everybodys ships come in
and then id sail away with them

bridge
unanchored in a storm
or safety on the shore
if this is all i need
why do i want more

lived just like a gypsy3embed"
