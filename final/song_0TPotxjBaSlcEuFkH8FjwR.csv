i lie here alone and wonder why
that i come alive just before i have to hide
cause i believe im losing my nerve
but could i ever do better than this

chorus
cause all ive ever wanted was a place to call my home
to shelter me when i am there and to miss me when im gone
all ive ever wanted was a place to call my own
where stars will dance and sun still shines and the storms feel free to roam

verse 2
i listen if only for a while
but i cant decide if im aware that im on trial
cause i believe im losing my nerve
but could i ever do better than this

chorus
cause all ive ever wanted was a place to call my home
to shelter me when i am there and to miss me when im gone
all ive ever wanted was a place to call my own
where stars will dance and sun still shines and the storms feel free to roam

bridge
if theres a way to a remedy then lead me straight to it
if theres a path or a door i missed then show me now well show me this
