dont cry open up your eyes and know
theres someone else out there that feels this way
im singing to you cause i know what youve been through and
now its not so long ago i felt the same

chorus
like soldiers march on if we can make it through tonight
well see the sun march on march on

verse 2
and i remember summer nights alone the fireflies the only thing
we own yeah all we had were dreams of california
and i remember winters were so cold hunger was the only thing
we know and rock n roll dreaming was what saved us

chorus
like soldiers march on if we can make it through tonight
well see the sun march on march on

verse 3
till we see the sun march on till we see the sun
through the good times through the bad times
through the long days through the hard nights
keep on till we see the sun
