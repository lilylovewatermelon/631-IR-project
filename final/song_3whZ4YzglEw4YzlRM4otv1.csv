the bottom feels so much better than the top
so much better

chorus
nan youre a window shopper
taking a look but you never buy
nan youre a window shopper
you wont pick it up if its over a fiver
nan youre a window shopper
get on the bus cause you still cant drive
nan youre a window shopper
mad as fuck only just alive

verse 1
get up in the morning and you like your tea milky
you fumble for your glasses cause without them you cant see
its funny how i come round your house and im twenty
and i still have to wear all the presents you sent me
i walk into your kitchen everythings got a label
you done your christmas shopping and were only in april
and you wont leave the house unless youre wearing your thermals
youre covered all in cat hair and youre stinking like strepsils
youre heading down the bowls club
have another orange squash
balls are rollin rollin rollin
you cant walk right cause things arent what they were
your ankles are swollen swollen swollen

nan youre a window shopper
taking a look but you never buy
nan youre a window shopper
you wont pick it up if its over a fiver
nan youre a window shopper
get on the bus cause you still cant drive
nan youre a window shopper
mad as fuck only just alive

verse 2
youre walking down the post office to pick up your pension
and then youre off to bingo its become an obsession
so weary of the kids when theyre wearing their hoods up
and even if they smile at you you think its a stickup
you only buy the paper just to cut out the coupons
youre saving 50p but what do you want with tampons
youre always at the doctor picking up your prescription
and they throw in some ky just to ease up the friction
you got a leak in your colostomy bag
yeah its got a hole in hole in hole in
at the weekend youre shopping with your trolley
its sad how youre rollin rollin rollin

chorus
nan youre a window shopper
taking a look but you never buy
nan youre a window shopper
you wont pick it up if its over a fiver
nan youre a window shopper
get on the bus cause you still cant drive
nan youre a window shopper
mad as fuck only just aliveembed"
