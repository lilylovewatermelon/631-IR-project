verse 4 kanye west
first it go viral then they get digital
then they get critical no im not doin no interview
mask on my face you cant see what im finna do
had to move away from people thats miserable
dont wanna link you i aint finna sit with you
aint finna talk to you aint finna get with you
dont get me mad cause i dont wanna injure you
she put my paintings inside of her living room
look at the problems and issues im livin through
they tryna drown me i rise to my pinnacle
walked through the block like the neighborhood general
drop me the lo and then thats where i send it to
i was forgettin you now i remember now i remember
did what i want and i say what i want
and i thought you was with me like how you get sensitive
i got this god power thats my leverages
i got this holy water thats my beverages
i gotta help myself out of selfishness
i just bought a floor out of selfridges
i gotta make sure they know who they messin with
i gotta tell em sorry they too delicate
i gotta stay with god where the blessings is
i aint deliverin heavenly messages just for the hell of it
dont try to test me i keep it clean but it can get messy
i talk to god every day thats my bestie
they playin soccer in my backyard i think i see messi
and this money could never neglect me
i pray that my family they never resent me
and she fell in love with me soon as she met me
we both got a bag but my bag is more heavy
we had to stop countin its gettin too petty
you not a real stepper you cant overstep me
just sit back and listen and watch how he bless me
he wait til i fall and then pull up and catch me
your check is too small you cant run up and check me
nah nah i get em fast see
you feel a way then go pull up and get me
might do somethin wild if i feel like you press me
nah i get em fast see
you feel a way then go pull up and get me
might do somethin wild if i feel like you press me
