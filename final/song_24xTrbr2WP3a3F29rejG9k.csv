settle down now and sit with me
let me tell you how this all came to be
a yellow flower with your petals to the air
and flying on paper wings that brought you here
summer rolls on in the lazy hours
an neither dream way of hummingbirds and clouds
midnight swims in the cool black waves
and you in my arms as it rolls away

prechorus
little dandelion
let your heart keep time
now the clouds are gone
all your tomorrows shine

chorus
oh oh
all your tomorrows shine
oh oh
all your tomorrows shine

verse 2
born of restless night the moon as a pearl
playing games down inside your soft warm world
hear my voice i know that you can
youre the fire in my eyes the sun as a man
seasons come along and seasons go
and what theyll leave behind i dont pretend to know
im afraid that all i have missed
will loom very large when the darkness lifts

little dandelion
let your heart keep time
now the clouds are gone
all your tomorrows shine

chorus
oh oh
all your tomorrows shine
oh oh
all your tomorrows

bridge
i will ride by your side
wherever you go
i wont run i wont hide
just letting you know
just letting you know

prechorus
little dandelion
let your heart keep time
now the clouds are gone
all your tomorrows shine

chorus
oh oh
all your tomorrows shine
oh oh
all your tomorrows shine
oh oh
all your tomorrows shine1embed"
