mamma shes still got that picture
of me and katie on homecoming night
she looked pretty in that fancy dress
but that girl was a barefoot blue jean princess
a hand full of rocks and daddys pine ladder
sure did come in handy
for a teenage boy thinking all that mattered
was a kiss that taste like candy

chorus
back in the day we were wild and free
she was my dashboard drummer
butterflies in the backseat
little footprints on my window
parking my chevy by the riverside
and four letters in a heart carved in a pine
a little sun dress laying up there on the bank
while the water washed our innocence away
back in the day

verse 2
friday nights id look up there in the bleachers
and i can see her
with my letter mans jacket on
and i still got this scar here on my right hand
from when bobby told her she deserved a better man
aw she hung right with me down in panama city
raising hell on our senior trip
and man aint it funny
it gets the best of me
and i just cant forget
i just cant forget

back in the day we were wild and free
she was my dashboard drummer
butterflies in the backseat
little footprints on my window
parking my chevy by the riverside
and four letters in a heart carved in a pine
a little sun dress laying up there on the bank
while the water washed our innocence away
back in the day

bridge
summer was over
college was calling man i had to watch her leave
but i still wonder if she ever thinks of me

chorus
back in the day we were wild and free
she was my dashboard drummer
butterflies in the backseat
little footprints on my window
parking my chevy by the riverside
and four letters in a heart carved in a pine
a little sun dress laying up there on the bank
while the water washed our innocence away
back in the dayembed"
