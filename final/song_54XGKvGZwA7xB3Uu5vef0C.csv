and well i think ive gone mad
isnt that so sad
and what a shame youve lost a brain that you never had
oh mum check the car it can’t have gone far
i must have left it on a train or lost in a bar
it’s likely in a sainsbury’s
flirting with the girls and waiting for me
i jumped on a bus declared my name
and asked if anybodys seen my brain
your brain was last seen going for a run
and would you sign an autograph for my daughter laura
cause she adores you
but i think you’re shit
ive gotta look for my brain for a bit”
i stepped outside it hurt my eyes
“well what do you expect when you’ve got no mind”
i searched all day it drove me insane
“where would i be if i was my brain”

instrumental

outro
the nice nurse told me she felt my pain
but she couldnt find a single trace of my brain
oops i did it again started playing
