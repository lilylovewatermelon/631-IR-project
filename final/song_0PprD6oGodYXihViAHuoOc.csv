i woke up this morning
with this feeling inside me that i cant explain
like a weight that ive carried been carried away away
but i know something is coming
i dont know what it is but i know its amazing
you save me
my time is coming
and ill find my way out of this longest drought

chorus
it feels like today i know
i know it feels like today im sure
its the one thing thats missing
the one thing im wishing
the last sacred blessing and hey
it feels like today
feels like today

verse 2
you treat life like a picture
but its not a moment thats frozen in time
its not gonna wait til you make up your mind at all
so while this storm is breaking
while theres light at the end of the tunnel
keep running towards it
releasing the pressure thats my heartache
soon this dam will break
