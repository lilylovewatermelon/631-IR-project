yeah yeah neeko you made that mothafuckin beat
ah nah you aint make that motherfucker
oh lord jetson made another one

refrain
im that lil nigga not spendin them ms
im holdin that shit like its good mmm
i aint hidin my hand they know what it is
leave the hood as soon as blood spill boom
bring them sticks out hood go crazy
show no love straight homicide
45 glock aint got no safety
in the north we at war with the other side

verse 1
fuck all you niggas im strapped with my burner
im tryna see what it is
swerve in that bentley hop out on a corner
make my way to la on a lear
i see that your vision aint looking too clear
them bodies get left in the fiеld
and them diamonds get set on a bеzel
and my mind stay set on a mil
all night standin on that corner
we on go we see em
ima fly her in when i wanna
cause lil shorty chill
and thats all that matter chit no chatter
and these hoes get cut like pills
bitch dont run your mouth bout nothin
you know that aint real
you might also likechorus
i can barely get peace hardly
lie like they all in
i see all these people just wanna scheme i just wanna be
when its war aint no stallin
all night we be stalkin
lets see where they hidin or where they be
we slangin that heat die in the street
hundred two hundred three hundred
four hundred five hundred six add four more
im really rich ima spend that shit
ima shoot the shit got plenty of sticks
one million two million three million
wanna be with a nigga ho add some more
why you worried bout me you aint here with me
til you prove with me you aint innocent

verse 2
wrong side we gon ride that bitch
tell shorty i say bring him right in the dead end
fuck if he alone know how we get down
not sayin nothin wrong with some dead friends
its 187 we burnin shit down
murder right in the town they movin in
she aint right for my heart so im movin out
ima clear this bitch out if they mug again
now im back in this bitch gotta thug again
full of xans i be toppin it with a ten
dirty straps in that car when im with lil ben
catch another i aint thinkin another sin
get it to em no talkin no motorola
he gon bang for that gang aint no switchin over
travel out for them things just him and soldiers
for that money be less better pray its over
chorus
i can barely get peace hardly
lie like they all in
i see all these people just wanna scheme i just wanna be
when its war aint no stallin
all night we be stalkin
lets see where they hidin or where they be
we slangin that heat die in the street
hundred two hundred three hundred
four hundred five hundred six add four more
im really rich ima spend that shit
ima shoot the shit got plenty of sticks
one million two million three million
wanna be with a nigga ho add some more
why you worried bout me you aint here with me
til you prove with me you aint innocent

refrain
im that lil nigga not spendin them ms
