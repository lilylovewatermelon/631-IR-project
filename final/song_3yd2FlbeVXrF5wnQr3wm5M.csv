walk down the street seen too many faces
stop tryna fit in youll only fake it
dont overthink youre too complicated
dont wait for me girl youll lose your patience

postchorus kxllswxtch
i be starin at the sky sometimes
when i close my eyes money cross my mind not you
hope it kills your vibe just to think bout i
when youre lying confined inside your room
conversations flame when you say my name
i be stained on your brain just like tattoo
baby im okay stuck inside this place
where the tears dont rain cause the pain taboo

verse kxllswxtch
gettin high where the sun dont shine at all
seen the future in your eyes no crystal ball
heard the rumors in your lies each time you talked
shouldve listened but it be like that
and girl you came into my life and put a gun to my heart
you got me thinking to myself when im alone in the park
all through the night where  you aint nothing but a thought in the dark
and girl youre nothing like a saint but you can sure play the part
and when its dark skies in the windowpane
baby youre the only one i blame
take your time girl dont be afraid
pull the trigger make this gun go bang
send me to a place far away
think i lost my mind here
we can make this work no way
think you lost your mind dear
