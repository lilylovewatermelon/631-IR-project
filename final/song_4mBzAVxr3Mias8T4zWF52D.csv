woke up too early
almost put salt in my coffee
oh i thank god that you stopped me before that
tripped over something
spilled it all over your front seat
didnt even say im sorry about that

prechorus
on and on its just more of the same
and even when you ask if im okay

chorus
i try to say im fine im fine
you dont you dont
believe believe me
when i say im alright alright
you know you know
i need you when i try to say im fine im fine
you know you know
its just because i
cant admit when im sad im sad
but thank god you know
i need you when i try to say im fine

verse 2
i can hide from everyone еlse
and they wont bat an eyе
no they never can tell
when im fallin apart on the inside
it gets so hard
keepin it up
keep your eyes down
keep your chin up
we all need someone there for us sometimes
