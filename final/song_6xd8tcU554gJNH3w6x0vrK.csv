my eyes are so rootless
they wander i follow
i keep staring i cant stop it
i know i shouldnt but i cant stop it

verse 2
such a cute girl im so jealous
i wish i looked exactly like her
whats it like to have that body
im gawking while i wonder

chorus
staring
i cant stop staring
staring
i cant stop staring

bridge
staring
problem

verse 3
with my envy i steal glances
resentful fault finder
this peekaboos become a problem
predisposed cat fighter

staring
i cant stop staring
staring
i cant stop staringembed"
