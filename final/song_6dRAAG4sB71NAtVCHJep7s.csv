i liked having hurt
so send the pain below where i need it
you used to beg me to take care of things
and smile at the thought of me failing
but long before having hurt
id send the pain below
id send the pain below

chorus
much like suffocating
much like suffocating
much like suffocating
id send the pain below
much like suffocating
id send the pain below

verse 2
you used to run me away
all while laughing
then cry about that fact
til i returned
but long before having hurt
id send the pain below
id send the pain below
