theres still black marks on that county road
where we drag raced our pickups and mustangs
and weathered all the sun and rain
and to this day up on that overpass
even underneath the new paint you can still see
allie will you marry me

interlude
take a ride look around
there aint no doubt

chorus
it sure left its mark on us we sure left our mark on it
we let the world know we were here with everything we did
we laid a lot of memories down like tattoos on this town

verse 2
theres still a rope burn on that old branch that hangs over the river
i still got the scar
from swinging out a little too far
there aint a corner of this hallow ground
that we dont laughed or cried on
its where we loved lived and learned real life stuff
its everything were made of

it sure left its mark on us we sure left our mark on it
we let the world know we were here with everything we did
we laid a lot of memories down like tattoos on this town
like tattoos on this town

bridge
everywhere there we are
it hits me right in my heart

verse 3
it sure left its mark on us we sure left our mark on it
we let the world know we were here with everything we did
we laid a lot of memories down
and well always be hanging around
like tattoos on this town
like tattoos on this town2embed"
