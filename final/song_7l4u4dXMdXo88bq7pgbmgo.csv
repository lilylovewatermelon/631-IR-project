i can feel when my mind starts to creep into doubt
on the days when the strength in my hearts giving out
theres a light but it hides from me deep in the cloud
theres a voice that i need but i dont hear a sound

prechorus
ever running to what i cant see
fighting out of all my unbelief
father even then my song will be
i know you will always carry me

chorus
its inevitable

verse 2
set your promise to play on repeat in my head
when you meet my anxiety put it to death

prechorus
ever running to what i cant see
fighting out of all my unbelief
father even then my song will be
i know you will always carry me

chorus
its inevitable
its inevitable
its inevitable
its inevitablesee lauren daigle liveget tickets as low as 37you might also likeembed"
