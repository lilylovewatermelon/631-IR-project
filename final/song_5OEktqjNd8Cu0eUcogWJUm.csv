im movin in shes movin out
to los angeles
shes got a truck shes got my stuff
packed into it
but seven months was just enough
of puttin up with me
imagine that
a baseball bat upside her tv

prechorus
she says she needs some therapy

chorus
you know it seemed so simple before
she could have asked
i would have given her anything
and its one two three
blame it all on me
and i had to find it out the hard way

verse 2
she calls me up shes breakin down
in los angeles
she misses home shes all alone
she cant handle it
but seven months was just enough
of putting up with her
your brand new nose and bigger boobs
they dont change a thing yeah yeah
see bowling for soup liveget tickets as low as 52you might also likeprechorus
you need some therapy
i think you need some help

chorus
you know it seemed so simple before
she could have asked
i would have given her anything
and then its one two three
blame it all on me
and i had to find it out the hard way
and then its one two three
blame it all on me
and i had to find it out the hard way

bridge
shes got a lot to figure out
shes got a lot to think about
shes got a lot to forget about
shes got a lot to live without
so many things to miss about me

chorus
you know it seemed so simple before
she could have asked
i would have given her anything
and then its one two three
blame it all on me
and i had to find it out the hard way
and then its one two three
blame it all on me
and i had to find it out the hard wayembed"
