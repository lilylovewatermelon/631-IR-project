in an endless night
life is trapped between
two black entities

cause when you trust someone
illusion has begun
no way to prepare
impending despair

despair

did one say so cruel
tis better to love and lose
ignorance is bliss
wish not knew your kiss

so many times been burned
this lesson goes unlearned
remember desire
only fuels the fire

liar
liar

betwixt birth and death
every breath regret
i pity the living
envy for the dead
you might also likeemotionally stunned
in defense im numb
id rather not care
than to be aware
be scared

i dont need love
i dont need love

i dont need love
i dont need love

are a thousand tears worth a single smile
when you give an inch will they take a mile
longing for the past but dreading the future
if not being used well then youre a user and a loser ah

world renowned failure at both death and life
given nothingness purgatory blight
to run and hide a cowardly procedure
options exhausted except for anesthesia anesthesia ah

i dont feel anything anything
i dont need anything anything
i dont feel anything anything
i dont feel anything anything
anything anything no
i dont feel anything anything
anything anything2embed"
