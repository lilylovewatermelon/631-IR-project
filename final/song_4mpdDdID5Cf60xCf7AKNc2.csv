some days her shape in the doorway will speak to me
a birds wing on the window
sometimes ill hear when shes sleeping
her fever dream a language on her face

refrain
i want your flowers like babies want gods love
or maybe as sure as tomorrow will come

verse 2
some days like rain on the doorstep shell cover me
with grace in all she offers
sometimes id like just to ask her what honest words
she cant afford to say like

refrain
i want your flowers like babies want gods love
or maybe as sure as tomorrow will comesee iron  wine liveget tickets as low as 60you might also like2embed"
