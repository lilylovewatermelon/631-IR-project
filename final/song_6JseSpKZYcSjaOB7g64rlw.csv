under the water we cant breathe we cant breathe
under the water we die
under the water there is no one watching
under the water we are alone
then why do we jump in
why do we jump in
under the water we die

prechorus
so many souls that lost control
where did they fall
into the deep what do they seek
where did they fall
where did they fall

chorus
hearts will dream again
lungs will breathe in
wash away the sins
its where it begins
feet wont fail you now
arms wont let you down
wash away the sins

verse 2
under the water we cant be together
under the water we die
then why do we jump in
why do we jump in
under the water we die
