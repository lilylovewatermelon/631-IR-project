close my eyes and move to the back of my mind
where worries are washed out to sea
see the changes peoples faces blurred out
like the sun spots or raindrops

chorus
now all those feelings
those yesterday’s feelings will all be lost in time
but today i’ve wasted away
for today is on my mind

verse 2
left the only worries i had in my hands
away from the light in my eyes
holding tight and try not to hide how i feel
cause feelings mean nothing now

chorus
now all those feelings
those yesterday’s feelings will all be lost in time
but today i’ve wasted away
for today is on my mind
yeah today is on my mind

postchorus
i cant care to worry
i’m feeling so lonely
breaking apart all this love in my heart
