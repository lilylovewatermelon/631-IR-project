mmm mmm mmm mmm
mmm mmm mmm mmm

verse 1
boys workin on empty
is that the kinda way to face the burnin heat
i just think about my baby
im so full of love i could barely eat
theres nothin sweeter than my baby
id never want once from the cherry tree
cause my babys sweet as can be
shed give me toothaches just from kissin me

chorus
when my time comes around
lay me gently in the cold dark earth
no grave can hold my body down
ill crawl home to her

verse 2
boys when my baby found me
i was three days on a drunken sin
i woke with her walls around me
nothin in her room but an empty crib
and i was burnin up a fever
i didnt care much how long i lived
but i swear i thought i dreamed her
she never asked me once about the wrong i did

when my time comes around
lay me gently in the cold dark earth
no grave can hold my body down
ill crawl home to her
when my time comes around
lay me gently in the cold dark earth
no grave can hold my body down
ill crawl home to her

verse 3
my babe would never fret none
about what my hands and my body done
if the lord dont forgive me
id still have my baby and my babe would have me
when i was kissin on my baby
and she put her love down soft and sweet
in the low lamplight i was free
heaven and hell were words to me
chorus
when my time comes around
lay me gently in the cold dark earth
no grave can hold my body down
ill crawl home to her
when my time comes around
lay me gently in the cold dark earth
no grave can hold my body down
ill crawl home to her114embed"
