i left my head at home
buried in the backyard with the dog
ive thought of leaving more times than once
im leaving you all alone
i tried so hard to be the rock
but all i felt like was a wet sponge

prechorus
i want to run
i just cant
the things it takes to be a man

chorus
im on a road
im not proud of the things i have done
dont let my living bring you down
youll never know
how much it hurts to nod when im the son
ill never stand and watch you drown

verse 2
im under a spell
this isnt what i want for us
weve held it all together this long
my spines deep as well
my heart is bigger than you know
this family is just a sad song

i want to run
i just cant
the things it takes to be a man

chorus
im on a road
im not proud of the things i have done
dont let my living bring you down
youll never know
how much it hurts to nod when im the son
ill never stand and watch you drownembed"
