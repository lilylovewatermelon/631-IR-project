look alive sunshine
109 in the sky but the pigs wont quit
youre here with me dr death defying
ill be your surgeon your proctor your helicopterpumping out the slaughtermatic sounds to keep you alive
a system failure for the masses antimatter for the master plan
louder than gods revolver and twice as shiny
this ones for all you rock n rollers
all you crash queens and motor babies listen up
intro na na na na na na na na na na na na
the future is bulletproof
the aftermath is secondary
its time to do it now and do it loud
