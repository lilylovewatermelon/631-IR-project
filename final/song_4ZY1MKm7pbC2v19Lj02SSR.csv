i think youre livin in denial
oh cant you see shes pretty wild
and every night i pray that you dont knock her up
cause i still want to be the mother of your child
they say lamour est né à paris
so shes planned a little trip to france
while shes in anxious anticipation
i really hope you have a horrible vacation

verse 2
and so you think of me when you arrive
hope the french fleas eat you both alive
and your room smells
and the toilet doesnt flush
and the locals treat you mean
and the service takes too long

prechorus
cause im fragile
and you broke my heart in two
but you just smile
like its all the same to you to you

chorus
when you learn your lesson
come back like a prodigal son
and read the big sign at the airport
bienvenue from hell mon amour
when you learn your lesson
come back like a prodigal son
and read the big sign at the airport
bienvenue from hell mon amour

where did you get the ability
to make fake promises to me
you are exactly like a politician
need everyones approval just to see if youre doing right

verse 4
and i hope you freeze under the eiffel tower
so you end up throwing in the towel
hope youll miss me
and someday youre gonna see
that i put my trust in you
but you turned your back to me

prechorus
cause im fragile
and you broke my heart in two
but you just smile
like its all the same to you to you

chorus
when you learn your lesson
come back like a prodigal son
and read the big sign at the airport
“bienvenue from hell mon amour”
when you learn your lesson
come back like a prodigal son
and read the big sign at the airport
bienvenue from hell mon amour
breakdown
whats your destination
whats your destination

chorus
when you learn your lesson
come back like a prodigal son
and read the big sign at the airport
bienvenue from hell mon amour
when you learn your lesson
come back like a prodigal son
and read the big sign at the airport
bienvenue from hell mon amour
mon amour mon amour
