africa is my descent
and here i am far from home
i dwell within a land thats meant
meant for many men not my tone
verse 2
the blood of god is my defence
let it drip down to my seed
showers to your innocence
to protect you for all eternity
and with this wood i beat this drum
and we wont see defeat
from kings and queens becomes a prince
knowledge and wisdom is understanding what we need

bridge
and this game of love
ever since the day you came
my whole world began to change
i knew then to dedicate my life
for your own
and this game of love
everyday i see you grow
and remember what you already know
i receive i receive the love
that radiates from your glow

from which you came was love
and thats how it all should be
you and my soul are one
through all the time and history
outro
and i thank you thank you5embed"
