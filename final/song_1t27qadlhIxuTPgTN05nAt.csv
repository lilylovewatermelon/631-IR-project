oh this must be the way the nigga pac felt when he made
me against the world all eyez on me
yall niggas got me feelin like all eyes on me me against the world
mmm yall got me on my shit
thought niggas would appreciate what i did to this game

raw rough and rugged when addressing the mass public
my attitude is fuck it cause motherfuckers love it
got a chip on my shoulder the size of the golden nugget in vegas
and fuck being famous i came to get the butters
i came from the gutter my success in this game
is sort of like projectic justice
a payment for brushes with police officers
a peace offering from the gods for the streets i was tossed in
til im deceased in a coffin
ima be a beast on these beats releasing early and often
please your disdain for the brothers aint gon change the numbers
its the strengthening of chain among us
please we aint afraid of none of yas who want it with us
aint nuttin changed since the ninetysix summer cmon

chorus jayz  sample
some people hate yeah
some people hate uh uh uh
some people hate yeah you know what i think
i think theyve lost their minds they say success breeds envy

verse 2 jayz
i guess its just the penalty of leadership
i guess im what niggas wanna be and shit
or niggas just bored wanna be in shit
fore they get to rappin start believing it think they ali and shit
i roll with the punches so i survive
i bob and weave move my feet from side to side
im back stronger than ever surprise surprise
they try to take me out the game but is alive
its like a old negro spiritual but i mastered tobey
with a splash of monster kody shoot faster than kobe nigga
you bastards know me the one and only
big homie from the roc i think you pastors lonely
you need jesus in your life
its either that or yall gon make me
put the double desert eagles in your life nigga
chorus jayz  sample
some people hate
i know niggas aint hating man let me find out
some people hate jealousy is a weak emotion man
some people kill their brothers
cmon man be stronger than that you know what i think
i think theyve lost their minds youll be alright though

verse 3 jayz
au contraire nigga i am here cause i earned this shit
by riding out when niggas had learners permit
we bring then knives out or we let them burners spit
i bring them pies out if niggas wanna burn the strip
bring your rides out bring your buggy eyes out
turn your six i laid back in the maybach
nigga this the payback i know you bitch niggas from way back
niggas wanna clown but the pound it dont play that
get yourself found drowned where the lake at
run up on em notoriously take that take that
and then we coming where your wake at
eight maniac cats strapped with gats you can hate that
face facts fake rap cats
cant take back what i took back to the brook look

outro sample
some people hate
some people hate
some people kill their brothers
i think theyve lost their minds
and im hung up ohh1embed"
