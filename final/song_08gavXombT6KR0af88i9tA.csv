i like the way you sound in the morning
were on the phone and without a warning
i realize your laugh is the best sound
i have ever heard
i like the way i cant keep my focus
i watch you talk you didnt notice
i hear the words but all i can think is
we should be together

prechorus
every time you smile i smile
and every time you shine ill shine for you

chorus
woahoh im feelin you baby
dont be afraid to jump then fall
jump then fall into me
baby im never gonna leave you
say that you wanna be with me too
cause ima stay through it all
so jump then fall

verse 2
well i like the way your hair falls in your face
you got the keys to me i love each freckle on your face oh
ive never been so wrapped up honey
i like the way youre everything i ever wanted
i had time to think it ohover
and all i can say is come closer
take a deep breath and jump then fall into me
