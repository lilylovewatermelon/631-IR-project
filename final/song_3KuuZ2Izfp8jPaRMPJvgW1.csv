im still looking out your window your shady tones of home
where dusty memories echo down like rain
and the years grow ever longer the days go flying by
but i cant wait til you and i are finally home again

chorus
well there aint no easy answers when the circus is in town
troubled juries hang each other dead
and the tvs filled with poets who only write in rhyme
and my brother works for the cia when hes not doin time

verse 2
when comfort comforts no one surrounded by your name
there is no one that i can talk to now
and this town is a painting and i am but a dream
so come live me outside the lonely fields of midnight may

chorus
well there aint no easy answers when the circus is in town
troubled juries hang each other dead
and the tvs filled with poets who only write in rhyme
and my brother works for the cia when hes not doin time

verse 3
and when the nighttime tricks me to believin im the same
as every barstool in this goddamn place
you come put your arms around me slowly say my name
so come live with me outside the lonely fields of midnight may
see trampled by turtles liveget tickets as low as 54you might also likechorus

chorus
well there aint no easy answers when the circus is in town
