everything black i dont want black they want us to bow
i want everything black i aint need black down to our knees

i want everything black we dont believe
everything black want all things black
i dont need black want everything black
dont need black our eyes aint black

bridge kendrick lamar
six in the morn
fire in the street
burn baby burn you you you you you
thats all i wanna see you you you you you
and sometimes i get off watchin you die in vain
its such a shame they may call me crazy
they may say i suffer from schizophrenia or somethin
but homie you made me you you you you you
black dont crack my nigga
verse 1 kendrick lamar
im the biggest hypocrite of 2015
once i finish this witnesses will convey just what i mean
been feelin this way since i was sixteen came to my senses
you never liked us anyway fuck your friendship i meant it
im africanamerican im african im black as the moon
heritage of a small village pardon my residence
came from the bottom of mankind
my hair is nappy my dick is big my nose is round and wide
you hate me dont you
you hate my people your plan is to terminate my culture
youre fuckin evil
i want you to recognize that im a proud monkey
you vandalize my perception but cant take style from me
and this is more than confession
i mean i might press the button just so you know my discretion
im guardin my feelings i know that you feel it
you sabotage my community makin a killin
you made me a killer emancipation of a real nigga

the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
the blacker the berry the bigger i shoot
chorus assassin
i said they treat me like a slave cah me black
woi we feel a whole heap of pain cah we black
and man a say they put me inna chains cah we black
imagine now big gold chains full of rocks
how you no see the whip left scars pon me back
but now we have a big whip parked pon the block
all them say we doomed from the start cah we black
remember this every race start from the block jus member dat

verse 2 kendrick lamar
im the biggest hypocrite of 2015
once i finish this witnesses will convey just what i mean
i mean its evident that im irrelevant to society
thats what youre tellin me penitentiary would only hire me
curse me til im dead church me with your fake prophesizing
that ima be just another slave in my head
institutionalized manipulation and lies
reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
you hate me dont you
i know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
jealous of my wisdom and cards i dealt
watchin me as i pull up fill up my tank then peel out
muscle cars like pullups show you what these big wheels bout ah
black and successful this black man meant to be special
katzkins on my radar bitch how can i help you
how can i tell you im making a killin
you made me a killer emancipation of a real nigga
prechorus kendrick lamar
the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
the blacker the berry the bigger i shoot
chorus assassin
i said they treat me like a slave cah me black
woi we feel a whole heap of pain cah we black
and man a say they put me inna chains cah we black
imagine now big gold chains full of rocks
how you no see the whip left scars pon me back
but now we have a big whip parked pon the block
all them say we doomed from the start cah we black
remember this every race start from the block jus member dat

verse 3 kendrick lamar
im the biggest hypocrite of 2015
when i finish this if you listen then sure you will agree
this plot is bigger than me its generational hatred
its genocism its grimy little justification
im africanamerican im african
im black as the heart of a fuckin aryan
im black as the name of tyrone and darius excuse my french
but fuck you — no fuck yall thats as blunt as it gets
i know you hate me dont you
you hate my people i can tell cause its threats when i see you
i can tell cause your ways deceitful
know i can tell because you in love with that desert eagle
thinkin maliciously he get a chain then you gon bleed him
its funny how zulu and xhosa might go to war
two tribal armies that wanna build and destroy
remind me of these compton crip gangs that live next door
beefin with pirus only death settle the score
so dont matter how much i say i like to preach with the panthers
or tell georgia state marcus garvey got all the answers
or try to celebrate february like its my bday
or eat watermelon chicken and koolaid on weekdays
or jump high enough to get michael jordan endorsements
or watch bet cause urban support is important
so why did i weep when trayvon martin was in the street
when gangbanging make me kill a nigga blacker than me
hypocrite
