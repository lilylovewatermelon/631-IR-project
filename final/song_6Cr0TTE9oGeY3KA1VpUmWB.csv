its been a while since ive seen your face face face face
gotta say that im happy to see you come around my place
now i think we talked about it
and i think i know whats coming up next
lets put our minds away and let our hormones do the rest
does it seem obscene does it seem like a bad thing
well if it is im sorry miss but you know im just nineteen
so dont be afraid when my pants start to leak
you know damn well im in my sexual peak

why dont you have some dirty hot sex with me
it aint like im asking you to give it up for free
oh we can start it right now baby get on your knees
dont make me beg again girl i just said please please

verse 2
yeah now when you look down
