theyre calling it a crime
you give yourself to it
taking your love for lies
subdued to fit their will

off you go to your childhood home
off you go but behind closed doors

chorus
this could be
a memory
of mine
of mine
of mine
of mine

verse 2
i never felt that fine
im never giving up
im always on your side
but now thats not enough

slowly dying in this awkward room
slowly dying little did they know

this could be
a memory
of mine
of mine
of mine
of mine

verse 3
where did i go wrong
i dont want to know
when did i go wrong
i dont want to know
where did i go wrong
i dont want to know
when did i go wrong
i dont want to know
where did i go wrong
i dont want to know
when did i go wrong
i dont want to know
where did i go wrong
