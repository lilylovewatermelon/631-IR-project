oh the river oh the river its running free
and oh the joy oh the joy it brings to me
but i know itll have to drown me
before it can breathe easy
and ive seen it in the flights of birds ive seen it in you
in the entrails of the animals the blood running through
but in order to get to the heart of things
sometimes you have to cut through

prechorus
but you can
you can
we can
we can

chorus
just keep following the heart lines on your hand
just keep following the heart lines on your hand
keep it up i know you can
just keep following the heart lines on your hand
cause i am

verse 2
odyssey on odyssey and land over land
creeping and crawling like the sea over sand
still i follow heart lines on your hand
and this fantasy this fallacy this tumbling stone
echoes of a city thats long overgrown
your heart is the only place that i call home
can i be returned

you can
you can
we can

chorus
just keep following the heart lines on your hand
just keep following the heart lines on your hand
keep it up i know you can
just keep following the heart lines on your hand

bridge
what a thing to do
oh what a thing to choose
but know in some way im there with you
up against the wall on a wednesday afternoon

chorus
just keep following the heart lines on your hand
just keep following the heart lines on your hand
keep it up i know you can
just keep following the heart lines on your hand
cause i am6embed"
