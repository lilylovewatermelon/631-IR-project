believe it or not everyone has things that they hide
believe it or not everyone keeps most things inside
believe it or not everyone believe in something above
believe it or not everyone needs to feel loved

chorus
feel loved
but we dont and we wont until we figure out
could someone deliver us and send us some kind of sign
so close to giving up
cause faith is so hard to find
but you dont and you wont until we figure out

verse 1
ive seen it a lot
every time to the world turns upside down
believe it or not
most of us feel like were losing ground
believe it or not everyone hate admitting fear
believe it or not most of us wanna know why were here

verse 2
why were here but we dont and we wont until we figure out
could someone deliver us and send us some kind of sign
so close to giving up
cause faith is so hard to find
someone deliver us just send us some kind of sign
so close to giving up
cause faith is so hard to find
but you dont and you wont until we figure out

most of us have things we could live without
everyone need advice on how to get along
get along we dont until we figure out
believe it or not everyone everyone everyone
