watery eyes
that howling wind shes waving hi
her other hands in mine

oh oh silhouette
shes growing tall and fine
shes got my back
shell follow me down every street
no matter what my crime

all inside our amsterdam she flies
hoarding the kites
that howling wind shell take everything
but shes easy on the eyes

oh churches and trains
they all look the same to me now
they shoot you some place
while we ache to come home somehowsee gregory alan isakov liveget tickets as low as 40you might also like2embed"
