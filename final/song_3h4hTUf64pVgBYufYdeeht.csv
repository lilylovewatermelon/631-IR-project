can i just say something crazy

verse 1 anna and hans
all my life has been a series of doors in my face
and then suddenly i bump into you
i was thinking the same thing
because like ive been searching my whole life to find my own place
and maybe its the party talking or the chocolate fondue

prechorus 1 anna and hans both
but with you but with you
i found my place i see your face
and its nothing like ive ever known before

chorus 1 anna and hans both
love is an open door
love is an open door door
love is an open door
with you with you
with you with you
love is an open door

verse 2 anna and hans both
i mean its crazy what
we finish each others—
sandwichеs
thats what i was gonna say
ive never mеt someone who thinks so much like me
jinx jinx again
our mental synchronization can have but one explanation
you and i were just meant to be
you might also likeprechorus 2 anna and hans both
say goodbye say goodbye to the pain of the past
we dont have to feel it anymore

chorus 2 anna and hans both
love is an open door
love is an open door door
life can be so much more
with you with you
with you with you
love is an open door door

outro spoken anna and hans
can i say something crazy
will you marry me
can i say something even crazier
yesembed"
