queen size mattress on an old wood oak floor
and i dont see the need in closin a screen door
i wanna hear the birds when the day finally comes
i fear all my days of bein young are done or only just begun

verse 2
how close can a man come to god before dyin
about as close as you were when you were tryin
to shade the sun from your eyes on the creeks edge darlin
theres a bar round the bend a man is bendin blues guitar in

chorus
when the day is done
and those neon lights call you home
youll be beggin for a savior to let you savor
the savage times of twentyso
when the night is through
and those american girls are headed home
youll be beggin of your savior to let you save her
from the sweet nights of twentyso

verse 3
and i know how hard it is to love a boy like me
with my dry sense of humor and my reckless tendencies
but not all labors done with hardened hands
youve been chompin at the bit just to love an honest man

so when the day is done
and those neon lights call you home
youll be beggin of a savior to let you savor
the savage times of twentyso
when the night is through
and those american girls are headed home
youll be beggin of your savior to let you save her
from the sweet nights of twentyso

chorus
so when the day is done
and those neon lights call you home
youll be beggin for your savior to let you savor
the savage times of twentyso
when the night is through
and those american girls are headed home
youll be beggin of your savior to let you save her
from the sweet nights of twentysoembed"
