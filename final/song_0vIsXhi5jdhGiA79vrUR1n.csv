0vIsXhi5jdhGiA79vrUR1n,Good Morning,Old Town School of Folk Music,4bTD53mtiKyg7wiiHaGxqa,"1 contributordead souls chap 12 lyricsfor more than two weeks the visitor lived amid a round of evening parties and dinners wherefore he spent as the saying goes a very pleasant time finally he decided to extend his visits beyond the urban boundaries by going and calling upon landowners manilov and sobakevitch seeing that he had promised on his honour to do so yet what really incited him to this may have been a more essential cause a matter of greater gravity a purpose which stood nearer to his heart than the motive which i have just given and of that purpose the reader will learn if only he will have the patience to read this prefatory narrative which lengthy though it be may yet develop and expand in proportion as we approach the denouement with which the present work is destined to be crowned

one evening therefore selifan the coachman received orders to have the horses harnessed in good time next morning while petrushka received orders to remain behind for the purpose of looking after the portmanteau and the room in passing the reader may care to become more fully acquainted with the two servingmen of whom i have spoken naturally they were not persons of much note but merely what folk call characters of secondary or even of tertiary importance yet despite the fact that the springs and the thread of this romance will not depend upon them but only touch upon them and occasionally include them the author has a passion for circumstantiality and like the average russian such a desire for accuracy as even a german could not rival to what the reader already knows concerning the personages in hand it is therefore necessary to add that petrushka usually wore a castoff brown jacket of a size too large for him as also that he had according to the custom of individuals of his calling a pair of thick lips and a very prominent nose in temperament he was taciturn rather than loquacious and he cherished a yearning for selfeducation that is to say he loved to read books even though their contents came alike to him whether they were books of heroic adventure or mere grammars or liturgical compendia as i say he perused every book with an equal amount of attention and had he been offered a work on chemistry would have accepted that also not the words which he read but the mere solace derived from the act of reading was what especially pleased his mind even though at any moment there might launch itself from the page some devilsent word whereof he could make neither head nor tail for the most part his task of reading was performed in a recumbent position in the anteroom which circumstance ended by causing his mattress to become as ragged and as thin as a wafer in addition to his love of poring over books he could boast of two habits which constituted two other essential features of his character—namely a habit of retiring to rest in his clothes that is to say in the brown jacket abovementioned and a habit of everywhere bearing with him his own peculiar atmosphere his own peculiar smell—a smell which filled any lodging with such subtlety that he needed but to make up his bed anywhere even in a room hitherto untenanted and to drag thither his greatcoat and other impedimenta for that room at once to assume an air of having been lived in during the past ten years nevertheless though a fastidious and even an irritable man chichikov would merely frown when his nose caught this smell amid the freshness of the morning and exclaim with a toss of his head the devil only knows what is up with you surely you sweat a good deal do you not the best thing you can do is to go and take a bath to this petrushka would make no reply but approaching brush in hand the spot where his masters coat would be pendent or starting to arrange one and another article in order would strive to seem wholly immersed in his work yet of what was he thinking as he remained thus silent perhaps he was saying to himself my master is a good fellow but for him to keep on saying the same thing forty times over is a little wearisome only god knows and sees all things wherefore for a mere human being to know what is in the mind of a servant while his master is scolding him is wholly impossible however no more need be said about petrushka on the other hand coachman selifan—

but here let me remark that i do not like engaging the readers attention in connection with persons of a lower class than himself for experience has taught me that we do not willingly familiarise ourselves with the lower orders—that it is the custom of the average russian to yearn exclusively for information concerning persons on the higher rungs of the social ladder in fact even a bowing acquaintance with a prince or a lord counts in his eyes for more than do the most intimate of relations with ordinary folk for the same reason the author feels apprehensive on his heros account seeing that he has made that hero a mere collegiate councillor—a mere person with whom aulic councillors might consort but upon whom persons of the grade of full general 8 would probably bestow one of those glances proper to a man who is cringing at their august feet worse still such persons of the grade of general are likely to treat chichikov with studied negligence—and to an author studied negligence spells death

however in spite of the distressfulness of the foregoing possibilities it is time that i returned to my hero after issuing overnight the necessary orders he awoke early washed himself rubbed himself from head to foot with a wet sponge a performance executed only on sundays—and the day in question happened to be a sunday shaved his face with such care that his cheeks issued of absolutely satinlike smoothness and polish donned first his bilberrycoloured spotted frockcoat and then his bearskin overcoat descended the staircase attended throughout by the waiter and entered his britchka with a loud rattle the vehicle left the innyard and issued into the street a passing priest doffed his cap and a few urchins in grimy shirts shouted gentleman please give a poor orphan a trifle presently the driver noticed that a sturdy young rascal was on the point of climbing onto the splashboard wherefore he cracked his whip and the britchka leapt forward with increased speed over the cobblestones at last with a feeling of relief the travellers caught sight of macadam ahead which promised an end both to the cobblestones and to sundry other annoyances and sure enough after his head had been bumped a few more times against the boot of the conveyance chichikov found himself bowling over softer ground on the town receding into the distance the sides of the road began to be varied with the usual hillocks fir trees clumps of young pine trees with old scarred trunks bushes of wild juniper and so forth presently there came into view also strings of country villas which with their carved supports and grey roofs the latter looking like pendent embroidered tablecloths resembled rather bundles of old faggots likewise the customary peasants dressed in sheepskin jackets could be seen yawning on benches before their huts while their womenfolk fat of feature and swathed of bosom gazed out of upper windows and the windows below displayed here a peering calf and there the unsightly jaws of a pig in short the view was one of the familiar type after passing the fifteenth verststone chichikov suddenly recollected that according to manilov fifteen versts was the exact distance between his country house and the town but the sixteenth verst stone flew by and the said country house was still nowhere to be seen in fact but for the circumstance that the travellers happened to encounter a couple of peasants they would have come on their errand in vain to a query as to whether the country house known as zamanilovka was anywhere in the neighbourhood the peasants replied by doffing their caps after which one of them who seemed to boast of a little more intelligence than his companion and who wore a wedgeshaped beard made answer

perhaps you mean manilovka—not zamanilovka

yes yes—manilovka

manilovka eh well you must continue for another verst and then you will see it straight before you on the right

on the right reechoed the coachman

yes on the right affirmed the peasant you are on the proper road for manilovka but zamanilovka—well there is no such place the house you mean is called manilovka because manilovka is its name but no house at all is called zamanilovka the house you mean stands there on that hill and is a stone house in which a gentleman lives and its name is manilovka but zamanilovka does not stand hereabouts nor ever has stood

so the travellers proceeded in search of manilovka and after driving an additional two versts arrived at a spot whence there branched off a byroad yet two three or four versts of the byroad had been covered before they saw the least sign of a twostoried stone mansion then it was that chichikov suddenly recollected that when a friend has invited one to visit his country house and has said that the distance thereto is fifteen versts the distance is sure to turn out to be at least thirty

not many people would have admired the situation of manilovs abode for it stood on an isolated rise and was open to every wind that blew on the slope of the rise lay closelymown turf while disposed here and there after the english fashion were flowerbeds containing clumps of lilac and yellow acacia also there were a few insignificant groups of slenderleaved pointedtipped birch trees with under two of the latter an arbour having a shabby green cupola some bluepainted wooden supports and the inscription this is the temple of solitary thought lower down the slope lay a greencoated pond—greencoated ponds constitute a frequent spectacle in the gardens of russian landowners and lastly from the foot of the declivity there stretched a line of mouldy logbuilt huts which for some obscure reason or another our hero set himself to count up to two hundred or more did he count but nowhere could he perceive a single leaf of vegetation or a single stick of timber the only thing to greet the eye was the logs of which the huts were constructed nevertheless the scene was to a certain extent enlivened by the spectacle of two peasant women who with clothes picturesquely tucked up were wading kneedeep in the pond and dragging behind them with wooden handles a ragged fishingnet in the meshes of which two crawfish and a roach with glistening scales were entangled the women appeared to have cause of dispute between themselves—to be rating one another about something in the background and to one side of the house showed a faint dusky blur of pinewood and even the weather was in keeping with the surroundings since the day was neither clear nor dull but of the grey tint which may be noted in uniforms of garrison soldiers which have seen long service to complete the picture a cock the recognised harbinger of atmospheric mutations was present and in spite of the fact that a certain connection with affairs of gallantry had led to his having had his head pecked bare by other cocks he flapped a pair of wings—appendages as bare as two pieces of bast—and crowed loudly

as chichikov approached the courtyard of the mansion he caught sight of his host clad in a green frock coat standing on the verandah and pressing one hand to his eyes to shield them from the sun and so get a better view of the approaching carriage in proportion as the britchka drew nearer and nearer to the verandah the hosts eyes assumed a more and more delighted expression and his smile a broader and broader sweep

paul ivanovitch he exclaimed when at length chichikov leapt from the vehicle never should i have believed that you would have remembered us
the two friends exchanged hearty embraces and manilov then conducted his guest to the drawingroom during the brief time that they are traversing the hall the anteroom and the diningroom let me try to say something concerning the master of the house but such an undertaking bristles with difficulties—it promises to be a far less easy task than the depicting of some outstanding personality which calls but for a wholesale dashing of colours upon the canvas—the colours of a pair of dark burning eyes a pair of dark beetling brows a forehead seamed with wrinkles a black or a fieryred cloak thrown backwards over the shoulder and so forth and so forth yet so numerous are russian serf owners that though careful scrutiny reveals to ones sight a quantity of outre peculiarities they are as a class exceedingly difficult to portray and one needs to strain ones faculties to the utmost before it becomes possible to pick out their variously subtle their almost invisible features in short one needs before doing this to carry out a prolonged probing with the aid of an insight sharpened in the acute school of research

only god can say what manilovs real character was a class of men exists whom the proverb has described as men unto themselves neither this nor that—neither bogdan of the city nor selifan of the village and to that class we had better assign also manilov outwardly he was presentable enough for his features were not wanting in amiability but that amiability was a quality into which there entered too much of the sugary element so that his every gesture his every attitude seemed to connote an excess of eagerness to curry favour and cultivate a closer acquaintance on first speaking to the man his ingratiating smile his flaxen hair and his blue eyes would lead one to say what a pleasant goodtempered fellow he seems yet during the next moment or two one would feel inclined to say nothing at all and during the third moment only to say the devil alone knows what he is and should thereafter one not hasten to depart one would inevitably become overpowered with the deadly sense of ennui which comes of the intuition that nothing in the least interesting is to be looked for but only a series of wearisome utterances of the kind which are apt to fall from the lips of a man whose hobby has once been touched upon for every man has his hobby one mans may be sporting dogs another mans may be that of believing himself to be a lover of music and able to sound the art to its inmost depths anothers may be that of posing as a connoisseur of recherche cookery anothers may be that of aspiring to play roles of a kind higher than nature has assigned him anothers though this is a more limited ambition may be that of getting drunk and of dreaming that he is edifying both his friends his acquaintances and people with whom he has no connection at all by walking arminarm with an imperial aidedecamp anothers may be that of possessing a hand able to chip corners off aces and deuces of diamonds anothers may be that of yearning to set things straight—in other words to approximate his personality to that of a stationmaster or a director of posts in short almost every man has his hobby or his leaning yet manilov had none such for at home he spoke little and spent the greater part of his time in meditation—though god only knows what that meditation comprised nor can it be said that he took much interest in the management of his estate for he never rode into the country and the estate practically managed itself whenever the bailiff said to him it might be well to have suchandsuch a thing done he would reply yes that is not a bad idea and then go on smoking his pipe—a habit which he had acquired during his service in the army where he had been looked upon as an officer of modesty delicacy and refinement yes it is not a bad idea he would repeat again whenever a peasant approached him and rubbing the back of his neck said barin may i have leave to go and work for myself in order that i may earn my obrok 9 he would snap out with pipe in mouth as usual yes go and never trouble his head as to whether the peasants real object might not be to go and get drunk true at intervals he would say while gazing from the verandah to the courtyard and from the courtyard to the pond that it would be indeed splendid if a carriage drive could suddenly materialise and the pond as suddenly become spanned with a stone bridge and little shops as suddenly arise whence pedlars could dispense the petty merchandise of the kind which peasantry most need and at such moments his eyes would grow winning and his features assume an expression of intense satisfaction yet never did these projects pass beyond the stage of debate likewise there lay in his study a book with the fourteenth page permanently turned down it was a book which he had been reading for the past two years in general something seemed to be wanting in the establishment for instance although the drawingroom was filled with beautiful furniture and upholstered in some fine silken material which clearly had cost no inconsiderable sum two of the chairs lacked any covering but bast and for some years past the master had been accustomed to warn his guests with the words do not sit upon these chairs they are not yet ready for use another room contained no furniture at all although a few days after the marriage it had been said my dear tomorrow let us set about procuring at least some temporary furniture for this room also every evening would see placed upon the drawingroom table a fine bronze candelabrum a statuette representative of the three graces a tray inlaid with motherofpearl and a rickety lopsided copper invalide yet of the fact that all four articles were thickly coated with grease neither the master of the house nor the mistress nor the servants seemed to entertain the least suspicion at the same time manilov and his wife were quite satisfied with each other more than eight years had elapsed since their marriage yet one of them was for ever offering his or her partner a piece of apple or a bonbon or a nut while murmuring some tender something which voiced a wholehearted affection open your mouth dearest—thus ran the formula—and let me pop into it this titbit you may be sure that on such occasions the dearest mouth parted its lips most graciously for their mutual birthdays the pair always contrived some surprise present in the shape of a glass receptacle for toothpowder or what not and as they sat together on the sofa he would suddenly and for some unknown reason lay aside his pipe and she her work if at the moment she happened to be holding it in her hands and husband and wife would imprint upon one anothers cheeks such a prolonged and languishing kiss that during its continuance you could have smoked a small cigar in short they were what is known as a very happy couple yet it may be remarked that a household requires other pursuits to be engaged in than lengthy embracings and the preparing of cunning surprises yes many a function calls for fulfilment for instance why should it be thought foolish or low to superintend the kitchen why should care not be taken that the storeroom never lacks supplies why should a housekeeper be allowed to thieve why should slovenly and drunken servants exist why should a domestic staff be suffered in indulge in bouts of unconscionable debauchery during its leisure time yet none of these things were thought worthy of consideration by manilovs wife for she had been gently brought up and gentle nurture as we all know is to be acquired only in boarding schools and boarding schools as we know hold the three principal subjects which constitute the basis of human virtue to be the french language a thing indispensable to the happiness of married life pianoplaying a thing wherewith to beguile a husbands leisure moments and that particular department of housewifery which is comprised in the knitting of purses and other surprises nevertheless changes and improvements have begun to take place since things now are governed more by the personal inclinations and idiosyncracies of the keepers of such establishments for instance in some seminaries the regimen places pianoplaying first and the french language second and then the above department of housewifery while in other seminaries the knitting of surprises heads the list and then the french language and then the playing of pianos—so diverse are the systems in force none the less i may remark that madame manilov—

but let me confess that i always shrink from saying too much about ladies moreover it is time that we returned to our heroes who during the past few minutes have been standing in front of the drawingroom door and engaged in urging one another to enter first

pray be so good as not to inconvenience yourself on my account said chichikov i will follow you

no paul ivanovitch—no you are my guest and manilov pointed towards the doorway

make no difficulty about it i pray urged chichikov i beg of you to make no difficulty about it but to pass into the room

pardon me i will not never could i allow so distinguished and so welcome a guest as yourself to take second place

why call me distinguished my dear sir i beg of you to proceed

nay be you pleased to do so

and why

for the reason which i have stated and manilov smiled his very pleasantest smile

finally the pair entered simultaneously and sideways with the result that they jostled one another not a little in the process
allow me to present to you my wife continued manilov my dear—paul ivanovitch

upon that chichikov caught sight of a lady whom hitherto he had overlooked but who with manilov was now bowing to him in the doorway not wholly of unpleasing exterior she was dressed in a wellfitting highnecked morning dress of palecoloured silk and as the visitor entered the room her small white hands threw something upon the table and clutched her embroidered skirt before rising from the sofa where she had been seated not without a sense of pleasure did chichikov take her hand as lisping a little she declared that she and her husband were equally gratified by his coming and that of late not a day had passed without her husband recalling him to mind
yes affirmed manilov and every day she has said to me why does not your friend put in an appearance wait a little dearest i have always replied twill not be long now before he comes and you have come you have honoured us with a visit you have bestowed upon us a treat—a treat destined to convert this day into a gala day a true birthday of the heart

the intimation that matters had reached the point of the occasion being destined to constitute a true birthday of the heart caused chichikov to become a little confused wherefore he made modest reply that as a matter of fact he was neither of distinguished origin nor distinguished rank

ah you are so interrupted manilov with his fixed and engaging smile you are all that and more

how like you our town queried madame have you spent an agreeable time in it

very replied chichikov the town is an exceedingly nice one and i have greatly enjoyed its hospitable society

and what do you think of our governor

yes is he not a most engaging and dignified personage added manilov

he is all that assented chichikov indeed he is a man worthy of the greatest respect and how thoroughly he performs his duty according to his lights would that we had more like him

and the tactfulness with which he greets every one added manilov smiling and halfclosing his eyes like a cat which is being tickled behind the ears

quite so assented chichikov he is a man of the most eminent civility and approachableness and what an artist never should i have thought he could have worked the marvellous household samplers which he has done some specimens of his needlework which he showed me could not well have been surpassed by any lady in the land

and the vicegovernor too—he is a nice man is he not inquired manilov with renewed blinkings of the eyes

who the vicegovernor yes a most worthy fellow replied chichikov

and what of the chief of police is it not a fact that he too is in the highest degree agreeable
very agreeable indeed and what a clever wellread individual with him and the public prosecutor and the president of the local council i played whist until the cocks uttered their last morning crow he is a most excellent fellow

and what of his wife queried madame manilov is she not a most gracious personality

one of the best among my limited acquaintance agreed chichikov

nor were the president of the local council and the postmaster overlooked until the company had run through the whole list of urban officials and in every case those officials appeared to be persons of the highest possible merit

do you devote your time entirely to your estate asked chichikov in his turn

well most of it replied manilov though also we pay occasional visits to the town in order that we may mingle with a little wellbred society one grows a trifle rusty if one lives for ever in retirement

quite so agreed chichikov

yes quite so capped manilov at the same time it would be a different matter if the neighbourhood were a good one—if for example one had a friend with whom one could discuss manners and polite deportment or engage in some branch of science and so stimulate ones wits for that sort of thing gives ones intellect an airing it it— at a loss for further words he ended by remarking that his feelings were apt to carry him away after which he continued with a gesture what i mean is that were that sort of thing possible i for one could find the country and an isolated life possessed of great attractions but as matters stand such a thing is not possible all that i can manage to do is occasionally to read a little of a son of the fatherland
with these sentiments chichikov expressed entire agreement adding that nothing could be more delightful than to lead a solitary life in which there should be comprised only the sweet contemplation of nature and the intermittent perusal of a book

nay but even that were worth nothing had not one a friend with whom to share ones life remarked manilov

true true agreed chichikov without a friend what are all the treasures in the world possess not money a wise man has said but rather good friends to whom to turn in case of need

yes paul ivanovitch said manilov with a glance not merely sweet but positively luscious—a glance akin to the mixture which even clever physicians have to render palatable before they can induce a hesitant patient to take it consequently you may imagine what happiness—what perfect happiness so to speak—the present occasion has brought me seeing that i am permitted to converse with you and to enjoy your conversation

but what of my conversation replied chichikov i am an insignificant individual and beyond that nothing

oh paul ivanovitch cried the other permit me to be frank and to say that i would give half my property to possess even a portion of the talents which you possess

on the contrary i should consider it the highest honour in the world if—

the lengths to which this mutual outpouring of soul would have proceeded had not a servant entered to announce luncheon must remain a mystery

i humbly invite you to join us at table said manilov also you will pardon us for the fact that we cannot provide a banquet such as is to be obtained in our metropolitan cities we partake of simple fare according to russian custom—we confine ourselves to shtchi 10 but we do so with a single heart come i humbly beg of you

after another contest for the honour of yielding precedence chichikov succeeded in making his way in zigzag fashion to the diningroom where they found awaiting them a couple of youngsters these were manilovs sons and boys of the age which admits of their presence at table but necessitates the continued use of high chairs beside them was their tutor who bowed politely and smiled after which the hostess took her seat before her soup plate and the guest of honour found himself esconsed between her and the master of the house while the servant tied up the boys necks in bibs

what charming children said chichikov as he gazed at the pair and how old are they

the eldest is eight replied manilov and the younger one attained the age of six yesterday

themistocleus went on the father turning to his firstborn who was engaged in striving to free his chin from the bib with which the footman had encircled it on hearing this distinctly greek name to which for some unknown reason manilov always appended the termination eus chichikov raised his eyebrows a little but hastened the next moment to restore his face to a more befitting expression

themistocleus repeated the father tell me which is the finest city in france

upon this the tutor concentrated his attention upon themistocleus and appeared to be trying hard to catch his eye only when themistocleus had muttered paris did the preceptor grow calmer and nod his head

and which is the finest city in russia continued manilov

again the tutors attitude became wholly one of concentration

st petersburg replied themistocleus

and what other city

moscow responded the boy

clever little dear burst out chichikov turning with an air of surprise to the father indeed i feel bound to say that the child evinces the greatest possible potentialities

you do not know him fully replied the delighted manilov the amount of sharpness which he possesses is extraordinary our younger one alkid is not so quick whereas his brother—well no matter what he may happen upon whether upon a cowbug or upon a waterbeetle or upon anything else his little eyes begin jumping out of his head and he runs to catch the thing and to inspect it for him i am reserving a diplomatic post themistocleus added the father again turning to his son do you wish to become an ambassador

yes i do replied themistocleus chewing a piece of bread and wagging his head from side to side

at this moment the lacquey who had been standing behind the future ambassador wiped the latters nose and well it was that he did so since otherwise an inelegant and superfluous drop would have been added to the soup after that the conversation turned upon the joys of a quiet life—though occasionally it was interrupted by remarks from the hostess on the subject of acting and actors meanwhile the tutor kept his eyes fixed upon the speakers faces and whenever he noticed that they were on the point of laughing he at once opened his mouth and laughed with enthusiasm probably he was a man of grateful heart who wished to repay his employers for the good treatment which he had received once however his features assumed a look of grimness as fixing his eyes upon his visavis the boys he tapped sternly upon the table this happened at a juncture when themistocleus had bitten alkid on the ear and the said alkid with frowning eyes and open mouth was preparing himself to sob in piteous fashion until recognising that for such a proceeding he might possibly be deprived of his plate he hastened to restore his mouth to its original expression and fell tearfully to gnawing a mutton bone—the grease from which had soon covered his cheeks
every now and again the hostess would turn to chichikov with the words you are eating nothing—you have indeed taken little but invariably her guest replied thank you i have had more than enough a pleasant conversation is worth all the dishes in the world

at length the company rose from table manilov was in high spirits and laying his hand upon his guests shoulder was on the point of conducting him to the drawingroom when suddenly chichikov intimated to him with a meaning look that he wished to speak to him on a very important matter

that being so said manilov allow me to invite you into my study and he led the way to a small room which faced the blue of the forest this is my sanctum he added

what a pleasant apartment remarked chichikov as he eyed it carefully and indeed the room did not lack a certain attractiveness the walls were painted a sort of blueishgrey colour and the furniture consisted of four chairs a settee and a table—the latter of which bore a few sheets of writingpaper and the book of which i have before had occasion to speak but the most prominent feature of the room was tobacco which appeared in many different guises—in packets in a tobacco jar and in a loose heap strewn about the table likewise both window sills were studded with little heaps of ash arranged not without artifice in rows of more or less tidiness clearly smoking afforded the master of the house a frequent means of passing the time

permit me to offer you a seat on this settee said manilov here you will be quieter than you would be in the drawingroom
but i should prefer to sit upon this chair

i cannot allow that objected the smiling manilov the settee is specially reserved for my guests whether you choose or no upon it you must sit

accordingly chichikov obeyed

and also let me hand you a pipe

no i never smoke answered chichikov civilly and with an assumed air of regret

and why inquired manilov—equally civilly but with a regret that was wholly genuine

because i fear that i have never quite formed the habit owing to my having heard that a pipe exercises a desiccating effect upon the system

then allow me to tell you that that is mere prejudice nay i would even go so far as to say that to smoke a pipe is a healthier practice than to take snuff among its members our regiment numbered a lieutenant—a most excellent welleducated fellow—who was simply incapable of removing his pipe from his mouth whether at table or pardon me in other places he is now forty yet no man could enjoy better health than he has always done

chichikov replied that such cases were common since nature comprised many things which even the finest intellect could not compass

but allow me to put to you a question he went on in a tone in which there was a strange—or at all events rather a strange—note for some unknown reason also he glanced over his shoulder for some equally unknown reason manilov glanced over his
how long is it inquired the guest since you last rendered a census return

oh a long long time in fact i cannot remember when it was

and since then have many of your serfs died

i do not know to ascertain that i should need to ask my bailiff footman go and call the bailiff i think he will be at home today

before long the bailiff made his appearance he was a man of under forty cleanshaven clad in a smock and evidently used to a quiet life seeing that his face was of that puffy fullness and the skin encircling his slitlike eyes was of that sallow tint which shows that the owner of those features is well acquainted with a feather bed in a trice it could be seen that he had played his part in life as all such bailiffs do—that originally a young serf of elementary education he had married some agashka of a housekeeper or a mistresss favourite and then himself become housekeeper and subsequently bailiff after which he had proceeded according to the rules of his tribe—that is to say he had consorted with and stood in with the more welltodo serfs on the estate and added the poorer ones to the list of forced payers of obrok while himself leaving his bed at nine oclock in the morning and when the samovar had been brought drinking his tea at leisure

look here my good man said manilov how many of our serfs have died since the last census revision

how many of them have died why a great many the bailiff hiccoughed and slapped his mouth lightly after doing so

yes i imagined that to be the case corroborated manilov in fact a very great many serfs have died he turned to chichikov and repeated the words

how many for instance asked chichikov

yes how many reechoed manilov

how many reechoed the bailiff well no one knows the exact number for no one has kept any account

quite so remarked manilov i supposed the deathrate to have been high but was ignorant of its precise extent

then would you be so good as to have it computed for me said chichikov and also to have a detailed list of the deaths made out

yes i will—a detailed list agreed manilov

very well

the bailiff departed

for what purpose do you want it inquired manilov when the bailiff had gone

the question seemed to embarrass the guest for in chichikovs face there dawned a sort of tense expression and it reddened as though its owner were striving to express something not easy to put into words true enough manilov was now destined to hear such strange and unexpected things as never before had greeted human ears

you ask me said chichikov for what purpose i want the list well my purpose in wanting it is this—that i desire to purchase a few peasants and he broke off in a gulp

but may i ask how you desire to purchase those peasants asked manilov with land or merely as souls for transferment—that is to say by themselves and without any land

i want the peasants themselves only replied chichikov and i want dead ones at that

what—excuse me but i am a trifle deaf really your words sound most strange

all that i am proposing to do replied chichikov is to purchase the dead peasants who at the last census were returned by you as alive

manilov dropped his pipe on the floor and sat gaping yes the two friends who had just been discussing the joys of camaraderie sat staring at one another like the portraits which of old used to hang on opposite sides of a mirror at length manilov picked up his pipe and while doing so glanced covertly at chichikov to see whether there was any trace of a smile to be detected on his lips—whether in short he was joking but nothing of the sort could be discerned on the contrary chichikovs face looked graver than usual next manilov wondered whether for some unknown reason his guest had lost his wits wherefore he spent some time in gazing at him with anxious intentness but the guests eyes seemed clear—they contained no spark of the wild restless fire which is apt to wander in the eyes of madmen all was as it should be consequently in spite of manilovs cogitations he could think of nothing better to do than to sit letting a stream of tobacco smoke escape from his mouth
so continued chichikov what i desire to know is whether you are willing to hand over to me—to resign—these actually nonliving but legally living peasants or whether you have any better proposal to make

manilov felt too confused and confounded to do aught but continue staring at his interlocutor

i think that you are disturbing yourself unnecessarily was chichikovs next remark

i oh no not at all stammered manilov only—pardon me—i do not quite comprehend you you see never has it fallen to my lot to acquire the brilliant polish which is so to speak manifest in your every movement nor have i ever been able to attain the art of expressing myself well consequently although there is a possibility that in the—er—utterances which have just fallen from your lips there may lie something else concealed it may equally be that—er—you have been pleased so to express yourself for the sake of the beauty of the terms wherein that expression found shape

oh no asserted chichikov i mean what i say and no more my reference to such of your pleasant souls as are dead was intended to be taken literally

manilov still felt at a loss—though he was conscious that he must do something he must propound some question but what question the devil alone knew in the end he merely expelled some more tobacco smoke—this time from his nostrils as well as from his mouth

so went on chichikov if no obstacle stands in the way we might as well proceed to the completion of the purchase
what of the purchase of the dead souls

of the dead souls oh dear no let us write them down as living ones seeing that that is how they figure in the census returns never do i permit myself to step outside the civil law great though has been the harm which that rule has wrought me in my career in my eyes an obligation is a sacred thing in the presence of the law i am dumb

these last words reassured manilov not a little yet still the meaning of the affair remained to him a mystery by way of answer he fell to sucking at his pipe with such vehemence that at length the pipe began to gurgle like a bassoon it was as though he had been seeking of it inspiration in the present unheardof juncture but the pipe only gurgled et praeterea nihil
perhaps you feel doubtful about the proposal said chichikov

not at all replied manilov but you will i know excuse me if i say and i say it out of no spirit of prejudice nor yet as criticising yourself in any way—you will i know excuse me if i say that possibly this—er—this er scheme of yours this—er—transaction of yours may fail altogether to accord with the civil statutes and provisions of the realm

and manilov with a slight gesture of the head looked meaningly into chichikovs face while displaying in his every feature including his closelycompressed lips such an expression of profundity as never before was seen on any human countenance—unless on that of some particularly sapient minister of state who is debating some particularly abstruse problem

nevertheless chichikov rejoined that the kind of scheme or transaction which he had adumbrated in no way clashed with the civil statutes and provisions of russia to which he added that the treasury would even benefit by the enterprise seeing it would draw therefrom the usual legal percentage

what then do you propose asked manilov

i propose only what is aboveboard and nothing else

then that being so it is another matter and i have nothing to urge against it said manilov apparently reassured to the full

very well remarked chichikov then we need only to agree as to the price

as to the price began manilov and then stopped presently he went on surely you cannot suppose me capable of taking money for souls which in one sense at least have completed their existence seeing that this fantastic whim of yours if i may so call it has seized upon you to the extent that it has i on my side shall be ready to surrender to you those souls unconditionally and to charge myself with the whole expenses of the sale

i should be greatly to blame if i were to omit that as soon as manilov had pronounced these words the face of his guest became replete with satisfaction indeed grave and prudent a man though chichikov was he had much ado to refrain from executing a leap that would have done credit to a goat an animal which as we all know finds itself moved to such exertions only during moments of the most ecstatic joy nevertheless the guest did at least execute such a convulsive shuffle that the material with which the cushions of the chair were covered came apart and manilov gazed at him with some misgiving finally chichikovs gratitude led him to plunge into a stream of acknowledgement of a vehemence which caused his host to grow confused to blush to shake his head in deprecation and to end by declaring that the concession was nothing and that his one desire being to manifest the dictates of his heart and the psychic magnetism which his friend exercised he in short looked upon the dead souls as so much worthless rubbish

not at all replied chichikov pressing his hand after which he heaved a profound sigh indeed he seemed in the right mood for outpourings of the heart for he continued—not without a ring of emotion in his tone if you but knew the service which you have rendered to an apparently insignificant individual who is devoid both of family and kindred for what have i not suffered in my time—i a drifting barque amid the tempestuous billows of life what harryings what persecutions have i not known of what grief have i not tasted and why simply because i have ever kept the truth in view because ever i have preserved inviolate an unsullied conscience because ever i have stretched out a helping hand to the defenceless widow and the hapless orphan after which outpouring chichikov pulled out his handkerchief and wiped away a brimming tear

manilovs heart was moved to the core again and again did the two friends press one anothers hands in silence as they gazed into one anothers tearfilled eyes indeed manilov could not let go our heros hand but clasped it with such warmth that the hero in question began to feel himself at a loss how best to wrench it free until quietly withdrawing it he observed that to have the purchase completed as speedily as possible would not be a bad thing wherefore he himself would at once return to the town to arrange matters taking up his hat therefore he rose to make his adieus

what are you departing already said manilov suddenly recovering himself and experiencing a sense of misgiving at that moment his wife sailed into the room

is paul ivanovitch leaving us so soon dearest lizanka she said with an air of regret

yes surely it must be that we have wearied him her spouse replied

by no means asserted chichikov pressing his hand to his heart in this breast madam will abide for ever the pleasant memory of the time which i have spent with you believe me i could conceive of no greater blessing than to reside if not under the same roof as yourselves at all events in your immediate neighbourhood

indeed exclaimed manilov greatly pleased with the idea how splendid it would be if you did come to reside under our roof so that we could recline under an elm tree together and talk philosophy and delve to the very root of things

yes it would be a paradisaical existence agreed chichikov with a sigh nevertheless he shook hands with madame farewell sudarina he said and farewell to you my esteemed host do not forget what i have requested you to do

rest assured that i will not responded manilov only for a couple of days will you and i be parted from one another

with that the party moved into the drawingroom

farewell dearest children chichikov went on as he caught sight of alkid and themistocleus who were playing with a wooden hussar which lacked both a nose and one arm farewell dearest pets pardon me for having brought you no presents but to tell you the truth i was not until my visit aware of your existence however now that i shall be coming again i will not fail to bring you gifts themistocleus to you i will bring a sword you would like that would you not

i should replied themistocleus

and to you alkid i will bring a drum that would suit you would it not and he bowed in alkids direction

zeth—a drum lisped the boy hanging his head

good then a drum it shall be—such a beautiful drum what a turrrruing and a tratatataing you will be able to kick up farewell my darling and kissing the boys head he turned to manilov and madame with the slight smile which one assumes before assuring parents of the guileless merits of their offspring

but you had better stay paul ivanovitch said the father as the trio stepped out on to the verandah see how the clouds are gathering

they are only small ones replied chichikov

and you know your way to sobakevitchs

no i do not and should be glad if you would direct me

if you like i will tell your coachman and in very civil fashion manilov did so even going so far as to address the man in the second person plural on hearing that he was to pass two turnings and then to take a third selifan remarked we shall get there all right sir and chichikov departed amid a profound salvo of salutations and wavings of handkerchiefs on the part of his host and hostess who raised themselves on tiptoe in their enthusiasm

for a long while manilov stood following the departing britchka with his eyes in fact he continued to smoke his pipe and gaze after the vehicle even when it had become lost to view then he reentered the drawingroom seated himself upon a chair and surrendered his mind to the thought that he had shown his guest most excellent entertainment next his mind passed imperceptibly to other matters until at last it lost itself god only knows where he thought of the amenities of a life of friendship and of how nice it would be to live with a comrade on say the bank of some river and to span the river with a bridge of his own and to build an enormous mansion with a facade lofty enough even to afford a view to moscow on that facade he and his wife and friend would drink afternoon tea in the open air and discuss interesting subjects after which in a fine carriage they would drive to some reunion or other where with their pleasant manners they would so charm the company that the imperial government on learning of their merits would raise the pair to the grade of general or god knows what—that is to say to heights whereof even manilov himself could form no idea then suddenly chichikovs extraordinary request interrupted the dreamers reflections and he found his brain powerless to digest it seeing that turn and turn the matter about as he might he could not properly explain its bearing smoking his pipe he sat where he was until supper time
