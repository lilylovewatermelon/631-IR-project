when you feel youre alone cut off from this cruel world
your instincts telling you to run
listen to your heart those angel voices
theyll sing to you theyll be your guide back home

chorus
when life leaves us blind
love keeps us kind
it keeps us kind

verse 2
when youve suffered enough and your spirit is breaking
youre growing desperate from the fight
remember youre loved and you always will be
this melody will bring you right back home

chorus
when life leaves us blind
love keeps us kind
when life leaves us blind
love keeps us kind
