the villain took on many forms

verse 1
let he who is without sin cast the first stone
after you whos last its doom hes the worst known
thatll have your boom blown or either thirst bone
rock it to em burst clone just dont curse the throne
own his own microphone bring it everywhere he go
so he can bring it to you live in stereereo
pan it cant understand it ban it
the underhanded ranted planned it and left em stranded
the best any who profess will be remanded
yes sir request permission to be candid granted
i dont think we can handle a style so rancid
he flipped it like madlib did a old jazz standard

verse 2
dont mind me i wrote this rhyme lightly
off of two or three heines and boy was they fine g
one black one spanish one chinese
it keeps the woody shiny yearround like a pine tree
dont sign me im about to get a mil without em
crowd him off the shelf hes the villain and what about him
so and hes a jerk and you dont know him
mad how he expand work but wont show em
poor guys what a sight for old sore foureyes
now hook me with two apple pies and a small fries
all rise so far odd as a ruple
so raw break it down and make quadruple
its crucial you could see it in his pupil
and this time when he get it hell waste it on somethin useful
like getting juiced off a deucedeuce of coqui
keep it low key known to pull a okeydokey
silly goose doom is too jokey
damn he could really use a room or a ho key
egads he got enough styles to start three fads
true dat she bad i wonder do she come with kneepads
what a call what a real butterball
either i get a strike or strike out gutterball
rock it like gear for the fall
with nice inside pockets prepare for the brawl
yeah yall you could say its an earful
beware do not touch mic be careful
and just like he said i coulda told ya
mf the holder of a boulder money folder
it aint funny nigga
money folder

the musclebound karate expert concealed a razor edge
which could lop the head off of a marble statue once propelled
with notorious world takeover schemes and the most magnificent gadgets imaginable
villains rapidly grew healthy cash flow
it is explained by a more comedic villain the bald headed doom
this villain rose to incredible new heights of moneymaking revenge and extortion
such was the magnitude of the typical villain
this is no answer
very well then
a duel to the death19embed"
