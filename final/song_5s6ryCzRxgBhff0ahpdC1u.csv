chorus
i get shoppin sprees off the heezy
i get dough to blow please believe me
dont want the one on one

im his one and only nothin less
you dont wanna take it there

calls me his breezy

verse 1
let me break it down break it down
i got it on lock and
i think you better stop
i heard you been checkin for my boo

but you couldnt get a call back
and even after all that
