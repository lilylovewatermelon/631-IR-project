what town im calling home for now
and just how long ill be there before i turn around

truth is ive finally found the place
where i can start to plant some roots
its about as close to being perfect its got everything but you

theres a pathway to the ocean a salty breeze blowing
and this old man down the street makes damn good wine
its got stars that shine like diamonds on the black canvas behind em
and theres a sun out here that seems to always shine
and ive never seen water quite so blue
its got everything but you

theres a taco stand right down the corner
serves the best cold draft beer
sometimes i order up a round pretend youre right here

an a reggae band plays every friday
we drink and dance into the night
most folks round here think im a local and
id say that thats about right yeah thats about right

theres a pathway to the ocean a salty breeze blowing
and this old man down the street makes damn good wine
its got stars that shine like diamonds on the black canvas behind em
and theres a sun out here that seems to always shine
and ive never seen water quite so blue
its got everything but you
see kip moore liveget tickets as low as 49you might also likeand thats everything to me
you the only thing i need yeah

theres a pathway to the ocean a salty breeze blowing
and this old man down the street makes damn good wine
and ive never seen water quite so blue
no i aint never seen water quite so blue
its got everything but you yeahembed"
