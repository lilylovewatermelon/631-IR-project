unsure of yourself you stand divided now
which road will lead you there
last time you fell and you hit hard
your wounds have healed by now
but you still see your scars yeah
but its not the way it used to be right now
youve come so far
to just let this go my friend dont go out

chorus
the same way you did the last time
youll break when you fall
dont make the same mistakes you did all over
youve got to believe in yourself this time

verse 2
live on live it up today
this lifes your cup
so drink it up i say yeah
say its mine
so give it all up to me now
and walk that line
dont let this go my friend dont go out

chorus
the same way you did the last time
youll break when you fall
dont make the same mistakes you did all over
youve got to believe in yourself this time
