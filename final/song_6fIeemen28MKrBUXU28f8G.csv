i try to tell them im one of the
best thinkers of this class im in
i feel like

verse 1
yeah ima let the chips fall
niggas is kemba walker tryna see me pitfall
niggas shyne like a synagogue think about it
centerfold bitches prolly couldnt get a drink up out me
they say i need some guidance
but i think they need a stylist
bitch you should see my wallet
this bitch gonna need pilates
and you cant see folarin
what the fuck are you retarded
i aint hugging the corner but i hustle so enormous
a modern day goodfella im ray liotta
loud smoking so pass the l like a semicolon
the bentley is rented but i got many chauffers
foamposites if you aint got em then you pennyloafing
underrated thats temporarily for the moment
only marry your woman if mama cold as willona
see im second to no one im the messengerpoet
they slowly showin they colors they music good but they bogus
wale

they talkin wale
talkin bout folarin what they talkin wale
they talkin who they sayin wale
talkin bout folarin still in it wale
they talkin what they sayin wale
talkin bout folarin whos they talkin wale
hold up these bitchass niggas

verse 2
verse 2 gon be fucking with verse 1
especially when youre writing shit that can never be done joe
that kevin love flow
bored of the shooters
my women be in the newest
yo bitches should buy a loofah
where im from they is ruthless
babies turn into shooters
crazy talking and foolish
you catch a shell like a koopa
and i dont give a fuck see my bitches is kama sutra
one of them bitches is cute the rest of them congruent
why you talking my nigga just go and do it
niggas awful at dressing they just aight at music
im trendsetting despite of an awful debut
still got me another deal big as any nigga in music
the remedy is get your hustle on
fuck a broad unless you love a broad
well in that case brother then love her hard
put my trust in my dog put my trust in my god
less you stabler and benson i dont fuck with the law
chorus
they talkin wale
talkin bout folarin what they talkin wale
they talkin who they sayin wale
talkin bout folarin still in it wale
they talkin what they sayin wale
talkin bout folarin whos they talkin wale
hold up
so let em know
