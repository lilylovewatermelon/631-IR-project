i got a piece of land out in the countryside
lay back and smell the sun warm up the georgia pine
feels so good to be takin it easy

prechorus
why would i ever leave cause i know
i got some good friends that live down the street
got a good lookin woman with her arms round me
here in a small town where it feels like home

chorus
ive got everything i need and nothing that i dont
homegrown
homegrown

verse 2
we got a fire goin down by the riverside
sip whiskey out the bottle livin like well never die
come on and stay a while if you dont believe me

prechorus
why would i ever leave cause i know
i got some good friends that live down the street
got a good lookin woman with her arms round me
here in a small town where it feels like home
