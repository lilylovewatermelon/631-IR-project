verse
whats better than tripping is falling in love
whats better than letterman leno fallon and all the above
whats better than popping bottles trying to ball in the club
is the first caveman pops with his son ball and a club
whats better than paper is ballin it up
whats better than followers is actually fallin in love
whats better than frolicking follies fallin in mud
rolling in green pastures wanderin followin love
whats better than eating is feeding your fam
whats better than meetings is missing meetings to meet with your fam
whats better than leaning and needing a xan
is hitting your xan dreaming a dream could mean leaving the land
whats better than yelling is hollerin love
whats better than rhymes nickels dimes and dollars and dubs
is dialing up your darling just for callin her up
it aint nothing better than fallin in love
