a lover sinking in the sea
and we
will let the water fill our lungs
and sleep

love we go down we go down
breathe its over now over now
we can love we can love
we can love we can love
and the birds will sing our song in halcyon

youre free
a love is coming home to me
the sea
will pull our bodies down into the deep

love we go down we go down
breathe its over now over now
we can love we can love
we can love we can love
and the birds will sing our song in halcyon
and the birds will sing our song

the birds will all sing out
the birds will all sing out
the birds will sing our song
the birds will all sing out
