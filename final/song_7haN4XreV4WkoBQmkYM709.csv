put our heads together and think on it
maybe later on we can sleep on it
but for right now

man he sounds like such a prick
i could use another whiskey
and your cosmos getting low
while were trying to figure out
the next place we should go

your place or mine
girl we can drink on it
dust off a bottle and drink on it
feels like were doing something right
lets find a corner of the night
where you and i can just drink on it
put our heads together and think on it
maybe later on we can sleep on it
but for right now
girl we just need to drink on it
