verse 1
what is this that i feel
and what is this that i fear
in these arms that whored out
amongst the worms that mate in these fields
oh from pressure to pain i wish to stay awake
in the measure i test with your love for me
to shout against these walls
with hope that one will break free
so hear me

chorus
what is this that you keep selling me boy
im not gonna hold your hand here when you walk
youll burn in hell while theyre digging you out
youll burn in hell while theyre digging you out
im not gonna hold your hand here when you walk
youll burn in hell while theyre digging you out
youll burn in hell while theyre digging you out

verse 2
so picture this face and burn it to flake
to shelter it at home at the fireplace
and all but memory will fade
with the flick of the flame
so i have a secret
that no one should know that i shouldnt tell
but of all the but of all the worlds
this one wont feel this one just wont leave me well
you might also likechorus
what is this shit you keep selling me boy
im not gonna hold your hand here when you walk
youll burn in hell while theyre digging you out
youll burn in hell while theyre digging you out
im not gonna hold your hand here when you walk
youll burn in hell while theyre digging you out
youll burn in hell

part ii

verse 3
in the press of your back
do you feel the shore swell
oh boy im eating my way back home
in the press of your back
do you feel the shore swells good
oh boy im eating my way back home

instrumental interlude

verse 4
as father told son in the make of his final escape
should all good boys die
with god at their side at the grace of his gates
no the robot holds none
with a mind and a heart to comply
then i will disguise and grieve of those dead
when im given the time
run little rabbit
go hide in the blades of that grass
run rabbit run
instrumental interlude

breakdown
should capture be our earnest fault
breathe up through lust ill find your cure
in there ill kill kill her
in there ill kill kill kill her
part iii

verse 5
with your last breath of air
as the earth comes trembling down
would you give her this last night
and give up your life
with your last breath of air
as the earth comes trembling down
would you give her this last night
the love of your life

outro
no one runs faster than you can
no one runs faster than you
no one runs faster than you eat
to the end with you to the end with you
no one runs faster than you can
no one runs faster than you
no one runs faster than you eat
to the end with you to the end with you
no one runs faster than you can
no one runs faster than you
no one runs faster than you eat
to the end with you to the end with you
no one runs faster than you can
no one runs faster than you
no one runs faster than you eat
to the end with you to the end with you
no one runs faster than you can
no one runs faster than you
no one runs faster than you eat
