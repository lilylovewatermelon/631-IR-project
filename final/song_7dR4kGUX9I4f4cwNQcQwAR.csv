got our headlights circled chevrolet
saturday night at a river bank
silver bullets popping got my speakers rocking
a feel good song thatll take you back
watching them pretty girls work that
baby shake it just right i could do this all night

chorus
out here way back working on our laid back
tell everyone you know
sip it tip it pass it around
lets light up this two lane town
out here way back working on our laid back

verse 2
theres no last call or closing time
just good stuff passing left and right
let that homemade hit you
you know ill be right there with you
dancing in the dust and half past gone
turn it on up and sing along
dont matter what you got playing
wanna see your body swaying

chorus
out here way back working on our laid back
tell everyone you know
sip it tip it pass it around
lets light up this two lane town
out here way back working on our laid back
see jason aldean liveget tickets as low as 41you might also likebridge
out here way back you can feel that country high
out here way back you can do what you want to do tonight

chorus
out here way back working on our laid back
tell everyone you know
sip it tip it pass it around
lets light up this two lane town
out here way back

out here way back working on our laid back
tell everyone you know
sip it tip it pass it around
lets light up this two lane town
out here way back working on our laid backembed"
