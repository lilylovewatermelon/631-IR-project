counted all my mistakes and theres only one
standin out from the list of the things ive done
all the rest of my crimes dont come close
to the look on your face when i let you go
so i built you a house from a broken home
then i wrote you a song with the words you spoke
yeah it took me some time but i figured out
how to fix up a heart that i let down

chorus zayn all
now im searchin every lonely place
every corner callin out your name
tryna find you but i just dont know
where do broken hearts go
where do broken hearts go

verse 2 liam harry all
yeah the taste of your lips on the tip of my tongue
is at the top of the list of the things i want
mind is runnin in circles of you and me
anyone inbetween is the enemy
shadows come with the pain that youre runnin from
love was something you never heard enough
yeah it took me some time but i figured out
how to fix up a heart that i let down

tryna find you but i just dont know
where do broken hearts go
are you sleeping baby by yourself
or are you giving it to someone else
tryna find you but i just dont know
where do broken hearts go
where do broken hearts go

bridge harry all
tell me now tell me now
tell me where you go when you feel afraid
where do broken hearts go
tell me now tell me now
tell me will you ever love me again love me again

chorus zayn all louis
