who wants to know
all that is gold is rusting
no one will know
when seasons cease to change and
how far weve gone
how far were going
its the here and the now
and the love for the sound
of the moments that keep us moving

verse 2
waves crash along
the battered lonely lighthouse
tomorrow shes gone
and if not someday somehow
are these hands a waste
well this side of mortality is
scaring me to death
to death

dont think about it at all
just keep your head low
