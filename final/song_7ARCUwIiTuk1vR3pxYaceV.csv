fucking with the clique we got a problem
throw em in the dirt and then burn up a fucking dollar
show em what hes worth when hes six feet in the earth
since birth yung plague been rising up out the bottom
all hail the one with the long tail
sevenheaded dragon breathing fire make you all bail
all hail to the frozen shogun slice a frozen ocean open
throw him in and then claim it was all a tall tale ayy
no treasure in my chest
all that is left is a halfblackened heart thats decaying
it barely pumps blood stuck in clumps
what im paying for pills all this pain should be numb or delaying
ayy
thats it
ive had enough im gonna grab my wrist and slash it
dont need a napkin put me in the casket
ruby dead and bloody matching with the fucking maggots
verse 2 pontius pilate
god of the sun bitch i shine like the summer
grippin the ak hanging out the hummer
sent here to make all these pussyboys suffer
reign over the grey and strike fear with the thunder
i am the darkness and i am the negligent
now you not relevant out of your element
father forgive them for thinking they testing me
father forgive them whenever they rest in peace
smoke in my lungs swallowed pills in my throat
my antidote for that murder he wrote
stuck on this road i just want to go home
stuck on this dope and i cant leave it alone
knot in the rope end my life with a slice
flies will arise when i die by tonight
live by the knife bitch i been paid the price
you can see death when you look in my eyes
see uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likeverse 3 chris travis
ill cut you open dont even step close to me
im in my dungeon you cant get a hold of me
im making poetry bout me destroying my enemies
right now im already loading heat
i am no limit i stretch like a rope its my power unlimited
i just devoted you out of your soul
while you stealing your clothes
and i been had the colt you just cant take a loss

bridge chris travis
i hit the bitch then i flee
im on her bed like a flea
still on my motherfucking piece
still catch me out in the streets
with the heat

chorus chris travis
i ride the wings yuh
jump in the pit yuh
dont give a shit
roll with my bitch yuh
roll with my bitch yuh
run from my clique
i rock the wings yuh
jump in the pit yuh
dont give a shit
roll with my bitch yuh
run from my clique yuh
run from my shit14embed"
