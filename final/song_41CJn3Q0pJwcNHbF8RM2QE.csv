its only been fourteen days
and already adore the way you are to me
i wanna ignore and take it slow
cause i know where this can go
movin too fast until we crash
ive been down this road before
ooh ohoh oh oh ooh ooh

verse 2
day thirtyone still havin fun
together every day think thats enough
sorry girl that came off wrong
just tryin not to fall in
again again
im not listenin to myself
this predicament im in
goin too fast it wont end well

verse 3
six months in time really flies
feels like yesterday when i met you in july july
i cant even lie
it may be too soon to say it but its on my mind yeah
but its on my mind
will you say it back to me back to me
you said it back to me oh no
oh i cant ignore
movin too fast ive been down this road before
