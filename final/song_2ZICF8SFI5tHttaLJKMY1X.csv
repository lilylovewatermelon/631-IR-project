oh its time to let it go

verse 1
the worlds got a funny way of turning round on you
when a friend tries to stab you right in the face
losing faith in everything i thought i hoped and knew
dont sweat it
set a false pretense

prechorus
betray youre not gonna be willing to change
yeah and it doesnt seem likely to fade
betray youre not gonna be willing to change
cacacacacause you know

chorus
in sacrifice
false pretense youll hurt again
stop pretending to deny
false pretense youll hurt again

verse 2
all along you know you thought you got the best of me
you were wrong and im laughing right in your face
i cannot believe you claimed you were my family
dont sweat it
set a false pretense

bridge
oh its time to let it go

i cant seem to understand it
how youve turned out to be so cold
you tried but were caught redhanded
are you happy with your role
its funny to me how youve turned into such a joke

chorus
in sacrifice
false pretense youll hurt again
stop pretending to deny
false pretense youll hurt again
outro
so play the game until you run out
and play the game into my head2embed"
