welcome to the real world she said to me
condescendingly
take a seat take your life
plot it out in black and white
well i never lived the dreams of the prom kings
and the drama queens
id like to think the best of me
is still hiding up my sleeve

prechorus
they love to tell you
stay inside the lines
but somethings better
on the other side
chorus
i want to run through the halls of my high school
i want to scream at the
top of my lungs
i just found out theres no such thing as the real world
just a lie youve got to rise above

verse 2
so the good boys and girls take the so called right track
faded white hats grabbing credits and
maybe transfers
they read all the books but they cant find the answers
and all of our parents theyre getting older
i wonder if theyve wished for anything better
while in their memories tiny tragedies

they love to tell you
stay inside the lines
but somethings better
on the other side

chorus
i want to run through the halls of my high school
i want to scream at the
top of my lungs
i just found out theres no such thing as the real world
just a lie youve got to rise above

bridge
i am invincible
i am invincible
i am invincible
as long as im alive

chorus
i want to run through the halls of my high school
i want to scream at the
top of my lungs
i just found out theres no such thing as the real world
just a lie youve got to rise above
i just cant wait til my ten year reunion
im going to bust down the double doors
and when i stand on these tables before you
you will know what all this time was for16embed"
