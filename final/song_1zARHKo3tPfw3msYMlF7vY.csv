the silly son

among the favourite jests of all peoples from iceland to japan from india to england are the droll adventures and mishaps of the silly son who contrives to muddle everything he is set to do in vain does his poor mother try to direct him in the way he should go she gets him a wife as a last resource but a fool he is still and a fool he will always be his blunders and disasters are chronicled in penny chapbooks and in nursery rhymes of infinite variety who has not heard how

simple simon went afishing
for to catch a whale
but all the water he had got
was in his mothers pail

an adventure which recalls another nursery rhyme regarding simons still more celebrated prototypes

p122

three men of gotham
went to sea in a bowl
if the bowl had been stronger
my tale had been longer

then there is the prose history of simple simons misfortunes or his wife marjorys outrageous cruelty which tells 2 of simons wedding and how his wife marjory scolded him for putting on his roastmeat clothes ie sunday clothes the very next morning after he was married 2 how she dragged him up the chimney in a basket asmokedrying wherein they used to dry bacon which made him look like a red herring 3 how simon lost a sack of corn as he was going to the mill to have it ground 4 how simon went to market with a basket of eggs but broke them by the way also how he was put into the stocks 5 how simons wife cudgelled him for not bringing her money for the eggs 6 how simon lost his wifes pail and burnt the bottom of her kettle 7 how simons wife sent him to buy two pounds of soap but going over the bridge he let his money fall in the river also how a ragman ran away with his clothes no wonder if after this crowning misfortune poor simon drank a bottle of sack to poison himself as being weary of his life

again we have the unfortunate son or

p123

a kind wife is worth gold being full of mirth and pastime which commences thus
there was a man but one son had
and he was all his joy
but still his fortune was but bad
though he was a pretty boy

his father sent him forth one day
to feed a flock of sheep
and half of them were stole away
while he lay down asleep

next day he went with one tom goff
to reap as he was seen
when he did cut his fingers off
the sickle was so keen

another of the chapbook histories of noodles is that of simple john and his twelve misfortunes an imitation of simple simon it was still popular amongst the rustics of scotland fifty years ago

the adventures of silly matt the norwegian counterpart of our typical english booby as related in asbjornsons collection of norse folktales furnish some curious examples of the transmission of popular fictions

the mother of silly matt tells him one day that he should build a bridge across the river

p124

and take toll of every one who wished to go over it so he sets to work with a will and when the bridge is finished stands at one endat the receipt of custom three men come up with loads of hay and matt demands toll of them so they each give him a wisp of hay next comes a pedlar with all sorts of small wares in his pack and matt gets from him two needles on his return home his mother asks him what he has got that day hay and needles says matt well and what had he done with the hay i put some of it in my mouth quoth he and as it tasted like grass i threw it into the river she says he ought to have spread it on the byrefloor very good replies the dutiful matt ill remember that next time and what had he done with the needles he stuck them into the hay ah says the mother you should rather have stuck them in and out of your cap and brought them home to me well well matt will not forget to do so next time the following day a man comes to the bridge with a sack of meal and gives matt a pound of it then comes a smith who gives him a gimlet the meal he spread on the byrefloor and the gimlet he stuck in and out of his cap his mother tells him he should have come home for a bucket to hold the meal and the gimlet he should have put up his sleeve very good

p125
matt will not forget next time another day some men come to the bridge with kegs of brandy of which matt gets a pint and pours it into his sleeve next comes a man driving some goats and their young ones and gives matt a kid which he treads down into a bucket his mother says he should have led the goat home with a cord round its neck and put the brandy in a pail next day he gets a pat of butter and drags it home with a string after this his mother despairs of his improvement till it occurs to her that he might not be such a noodle if he had a wife so she bids him go and see whether he cannot find some lass who will take him for a husband should he meet any folk on his way he ought to say to them gods peace matt accordingly sets off in quest of a wife and meets a shewolf and her seven cubs gods peace says matt and then returns home when his mother learns of this she tells him he should have cried huf huf you jade wolf next day he goes off again and meeting a bridal party he cries huf huf you jade wolf and goes back to his mother and acquaints her of this fresh adventure o you great silly says she you should have said ride happily bride and bridegroom once more matt sets out to seek a wife and seeing on the road a bear taking a ride on a horse

p126

he exclaims joyfully ride happily bride and bridegroom and then returns home his mother on hearing of this new piece of folly tells him he should have cried to the devil with you again he sets out and meeting a funeral procession he roars to the devil with you his mother says he should have cried may your poor soul have mercy and sends him off for the fifth time to look for a lass on the road he sees some gipsies busy skinning a dead dog upon which he piously exclaims may your poor soul have mercy his mother now goes herself to get him a wife finds a lass that is willing to marry him and invites her to dinner she privately tells matt how he should comport himself in the presence of his sweetheart he should cast an eye at her now and then matt understands her instruction most literally stealing into the sheepfold he plucks out the eyes of all the sheep and goats and puts them in his pocket when he is seated beside his sweetheart he casts a sheeps eye at her which hits her on the nose1

this last incident as we have seen occurs in the talrs of the men of gotham ante p 41 and it is also found in a venetian

trouble and we should have had them to cook and eat on another occasion the noodle again went through the village and met some people carrying a dead man may god aid you good men he exclaimed do you wish me to help you to thresh but he got himself well thrashed once more for this illtimed speech when he reached home he howled theyve felled me to the ground beaten me and plucked my beard and hair and told of his new mishap ah noodle said his mother thou shouldst have said god give peace to his soul thou shouldst have taken off thy bonnet wept and fallen upon thy knees they would then have given thee meat and drink again he went to the village and met a marriage procession so he took off his bonnet and cried with all his might god grant peace to his soul and then burst into tears what brute is this said the wedding company we laugh and amuse ourselves and he laments as if he were at a funeral so they leaped out of the carriages and beat him soundly on the ribs home he returned crying theyve beaten me thrashed me and torn my beard and hair and related what had happened my son said his mother thou shouldst have leaped and danced with them the next time he went to the village he took his bag

pipe under his arm at the end of the street a cartshed was on fire the noodle ran to the spot and began to play on his bagpipe and to dance and caper about for which he was abused as before going back to his mother in tears he told her how he had fared my son said she thou shouldst have carried water and thrown it on the fire like the other folks three days later when his ribs were well again the noodle went through the village once more and seeing a man roasting a little pig he seized a vessel of water ran up with it and threw the water on the fire this time also he was beaten and when he got home and told his mother of his illluck she resolved never again to allow him to go abroad so he remains by the fireside as great a fool as ever

this species of noodle is also known in japan he is the hero of a farce entitled hone kaha or ribs and skin which has been done into english by mr basil hall chamberlain in his classical poetry of the japanese the rector of a buddhist temple tells his curate that he feels he is now getting too old for the duties of his office and means to resign the benefice in his favour before retiring to his private chamber he desires the curate to let him know if any persons visit

p131

the temple and bids him should he be in want of information regarding any matter to come to him a parishioner calls to borrow an umbrella the curate lends him a new one and then goes to the rector and informs him of this visitor you have donewrongsays the rector you ought to have said that you should have been happy to comply with such a small request but unfortunately the rector was walking out with it the other day when at a place where four roads meet a sudden gust of wind blew the skin to one side and the ribs to another we have tied the ribs and skin together in the middle and hung it from the ceiling something like that adds the rector something with an air of truth about it is what you should have said next comes another parishioner who wishes to borrow a horse the curate replies with great politeness the request with which you honour me is a mere trifle but the rector took it out with him a few days since and coming to the junction of four cross roads a gust of wind blew the ribs to one side and the skin to another and we have tied them together and hung them from the ceiling so i fear it would not suit your purpose it is a horse i want said the man preciselya horse i am aware of it quoth the curate and the man went off not a little perplexed after which

p132

the curate reports this new affair to the rector who says it was to an umbrella not to a horse that such a story was applicable should any one come again to borrow a horse he ought to say i much regret that i cannot comply with your request the fact is we lately turned him out to grass and becoming frolicsome he dislocated his thigh and is now lying covered with straw in a corner of the stable something like that adds the rector something with an air of truth about it is what you should say a third parishioner comes to invite the rector and the curate to a feast at his house for myself says the curate i promise to come but i fear it will not be convenient for the rector to accompany me i presume then says the man that he has some particular business on hand no not any particular business answers the curate but the truth is we lately turned him out to grass and becoming frisky he dislocated his thigh and now lies in a corner of the stable covered with straw i spoke of the rector says the parishioner yes of the rector i quite understand responds the curate very complaisantly upon which the man goes away not knowing what to make of such a strange account of the rectors condition this last affair puts the rector into a fury and he cuffs his intended successor exclaiming

as great a jolterhead as any of the foregoing was the hero of a story in cazettes continuation of the arabian nights entitled limbécille ou lhistoire de xailoun1 this noodles wife said to him one day go and buy some pease and dont forget that it is pease you are to buy continually repeat pease till you reach the marketplace so he went off with pease pease always in his mouth he passed the corner of a street where a merchant who had pearls for sale was proclaiming his wares in a loud voice saying in the name of the prophet pearls xailouns attention was at once attracted by the display of pearls and at the same time he was occupied in retaining the lesson his wife had taught him and putting his hand in

1 in le cabinet des fées 1788 tome xxxviii p 337 ffthere can be no such name as xailoun in arabic that of the noodles wife oitba may be intended for utba cazotte has so frenchified the names of the characters in his tales as to render their identification with the arabic originals where he had any such often impossible although this story is not found in any known arabian text of the book of the thousand and one nights yet the incidents for the most part occur in several eastern storybooks

p134

the box of pearls he cried out pease pease the merchant supposing xailoun played upon him and depreciated his pearls by wishing to make them pass for false ones struck him a severe blow why do you strike me said xailoun because you insult me answered the merchant do you suppose i am trying to deceive people no said the noodle but what must i say then if you will cry properly say as i do pearls in the name of the prophet he next passed by the shop of a merchant from whom some pearls had been stolen and his manner of crying pearls etc which was not nearly so loud as usual appeared to the merchant very suspicious the man who has stolen my pearls thought he has probably recognised me and when he passes my shop lowers his voice in crying the goods upon this suspicion he ran after xailoun and stopping him said show me your pearls the poor fool was in great confusion and the merchant thought he had got the thief the supposed seller of pearls was soon surrounded by a great crowd and the merchant at last discovered that he was a perfect simpleton why said he do you cry that you sell pearls what should i say then asked xailoun it is not true said the merchant not listening to him it is not true

p135

exclaimed the noodle let me repeat it is not true that i may not forget it and as he went on he kept crying it is not true his way led him towards a place where a man was proclaiming in the name of the prophet lentils xailoun induced by curiosity went up to the man his mouth full of the last words he remembered and putting his hand into the sack cried it is not true the sturdy villager gave him a blow that caused him to stagger saying what dye mean by giving me the lie about my goods which i both sowed and reaped myself quoth the noodle i have only tried to say what i ought to say well then rejoined the dealer you ought to say as i do lentils in the name of the prophet so our noodle at once took up this new cry and proceeded on his way till he came to the bank of the river where a fisherman had been casting his net for hours and had frequently changed his place without getting any fish xailoun who was amused with every new thing he saw began to follow the fisherman and that he should not forget his lesson continued to repeat lentils in the name of the prophet suddenly the fisherman made a pretence of spreading his net in order to wring and dry it and having folded in his hand the rope to which it was fastened he took hold

p136

of the simpleton and struck him some furious blows with it saying vile sorcerer cease to curse my fishing xailoun struggled and at length disengaged himself i am no sorcerer said he well if you are not answered the fisherman why do you cause me bad luck by your words every time i throw my net i didnt mean to bring you bad luck said the noodle i only repeat what i was told to repeat the fisherman then concluded that some of his enemies who wished to do him an ill turn without exposing themselves had prevailed upon this poor fellow to come and curse his fishing so he said i am sorry brother for having beaten you but you were wrong to pronounce the words you did thereby bringing bad luck to me who never did you any harm quoth the simpleton i only tried to say the words my wife told me not to forget do you know them yes well place yourself beside me and each time i cast my net you must say in the name of the prophet instead of one seven of the greatest and best but xailoun thought what his wife had said was not so long as that oh yes it was said the fisherman and take care you dont miss a single word and i shall give you some of the fish to take home with you that he might not forget xailoun repeated it

p137

very loud but as he was afraid of the cord whenever he saw the fisherman drawing in his net he ran away as fast as he could but still repeating in the name of the prophet instead of one seven of the greatest and best these words he pronounced in the midst of a crowd of people through which the corpse of the kází magistrate or judge was being carried to the burying ground and the mullahs who surrounded the bier scandalised by what they thought a horrible imprecation exclaimed how darest thou wicked wretch thus blaspheme is it not enough that death has taken one of the greatest men of baghdád the poor simpleton was skulking off in fear and trembling when his sleeve was pulled by an aged slave who told him that he ought to say may allah preserve his body and save his soul so our noodle went on repeating this new cry till he came to a street where a dead ass was being carted away may allah preserve his body and save his soul he exclaimed how he blasphemes said the folk and they set upon him with their fists and sticks and gave him a sound drubbing at length he got clear of them and by chance came to the house of his wifes mother but he only ventured to stand at the door and peep within he was recognised however and asked what he

p138

would have to eatgoats flesh ricepease yes it was pease he wanted and having got some he hastened home and after relating all his mishaps informed his wife that her sister was very sick his wife having prepared herself to go to her mothers house tells the simpleton to rock the baby should it awake and cry feed the hen that was sitting if the ass was thirsty give her to drink shut the door and take care not to go to sleep lest robbers should come and plunder the house the baby awakes and xailoun rocks it to sleep again so far well the hen seems uneasy he concludes she is troubled with insects like himself so he takes up the hen and thinking the best way to kill the insects was to stick a pin into them he unluckily kills the hen this was a serious matter and while he considers what he should do in the circumstances the ass begins to bray ah says he ive no time to attend to you just now but when i am on your back you can carry me to the river then he opened the door and let out the ass and her colt after this he sat down on the eggs and took the baby in his arms his wife returning knocks at the door let me in you fool she cries i cant for i am nursing the baby and hatching the eggs at length she contrived to force open the door and running up to her

idiot of a husband fetched him a blow that caused him to crush all the halfhatched eggs luckily she had met the ass and her foal on the road so the amount of mischief done by her stupid spouse in her absence was not so great all things considered1

the misadventures of the arabian idiot in his expedition to purchase pease present a close analogy to those of the typical english booby only the latter end tragically

a woman sent her son one day to buy a sheeps head and pluck and lest he should forget his message he kept bawling loudly as he went along sheeps head and pluck sheeps head and pluck in getting over a stile he fell and hurt himself and forgot what he was sent for so he stood a little to consider and at last he thought he recollected

1 on a similar occasion giufà the sicilian brother to the arabian fool did somewhat more mischief once his mother went to church and told him to make some porridge for his babysister giufà made a great pot of porridge and fed the baby with it and burned her mouth so that she died another time his mother on leaving home told him to feed the hen that was sitting and put her back in the nest so that the eggs should not get cold giufà stuffed the hen with food so that he killed her and then sat on the eggs himself until his mother returnedsee cranes italian popular tales pp 2967

it and began to shout liver and lights and gall and all which he was repeating when he came up to a man who was very sick the man thinking the booby was mocking him laid hold of him and after cuffing him bade the booby cry pray god send no more up so he ran along uttering these words till he came to a field where a man was sowing wheat who on hearing what he took for a curse upon his labour seized and thrashed him and told him to repeat pray god send plenty more so the young jolterhead at once changed his tune and was loudly singing out these words when he met a funeral the chief mourner punished him for what he thought his fiendish wish and bade him say pray god send the soul to heaven which he was bawling when he met a he and a shedog going to be hanged the good people who heard him were greatly shocked at his seeming profanity and striking him strictly charged him to cry a he and a shedog going to be hanged on he went accordingly repeating this new cry till he met a man and a woman going to be married when the bridegroom heard what the booby said he gave him many a good thump and bade him say i wish you much joy this he was crying at the top of his voice when he came to a pit into which two

p141

labourers had fallen and one of them enraged at what he thought his mockery of their misfortune exerted all his strength and scrambled out then beat the poor simpleton and told him to say the one is out i wish the other was glad to be set free the booby went on shouting these words till he met with a oneeyed man who like the others taking what he was crying for a personal insult gave him another drubbing and then bade him cry the one side gives good light and i wish the other did so he adopted this new cry and continued his adventurous journey till he came to a house one side of which was on fire the people hearing him bawling the one side gives good light and i wish the other did at once concluded that he had set the house ablazing so they put him in prison and the end was the judge put on the black cap and condemned him to be hanged1

next night they again took him along with them and after boring a hole in the wall of another house sent him in with strict injunctions not to make a noise or wake anybody he crept in noiselessly and entered a large

represented as being sent by his mother to sell a piece of linen which she had woven saying to him now listen attentively to what i say walk straight along the road dont take less than such a price for this linen dont have any dealings with women who chatter whether you sell it to any one you meet on the way or carry it into the market offer it only to some quiet sort of body whom you may see standing apart and not gossiping or prating for such as they will persuade you to take some sort of price that wont suit me at all the booby answers yes mamma and goes off on his errand keeping straight on instead of taking the turnings leading to villages it happened as he went along that the wife of the syndic of the next town was driving out with her maids and had got out of the carriage to walk a short distance as the day was fine her maid tells her that there goes the simple son of the poor widow by the brook what are you going to do my good lad kindly asks the lady im not going to tell you says the booby because you were chattering i see your mother has sent you to sell this linen continues the lady i will buy it of you and she offers to pay twice as much as his mother had said she wanted cant sell it to you replies he for you

p145

were chattering and he continues his journey farther along he comes to a plaster statue by the roadside so he says to himself heres one who stands apart and doesnt chatter this is the one to sell the linen to then aloud will you buy my linen good friend the statue maintained its usual taciturnity and the booby concluded as it did not speak it was all right so he said the price is soandso have the money ready by the time i come back as i have to go on and buy some yarn for mother on he went accordingly and bought the yarn and then came back to the statue some one passing by had in the meantime taken the linen finding it gone its all right says he to himself shes taken it then aloud wheres the money i told you to have ready the statue remained silent if you dont give me the money ill hit you on the head he exclaimed and raising his stick he knocked the head off and found it filled with gold coin thats where you keep your money is it all right i can pay myself so saying he filled his pockets with the coin and went home when he handed his mother the money and told her of his adventure with the quiet body by the roadside she was afraid lest the neighbours should learn of her windfall if the booby knew its value

p146

so she said to him youve only brought me a lot of rusty nails but never mind youll know better what to do next time and put the money in an earthen jar in her absence a ragman comes to the house and the booby asks him will you buy some rusty nails the man desires to see them well quoth he on beholding the treasure theyre not much worth but ill give you twelve pauls for the lot and having handed over the sum went off with his prize when his mother comes home the booby tells her what a bargain he had made for the rusty nails nails she echoes in consternation why you foolish thing they were gold coins cant help that now mamma he answers philosophically you told me they were old rusty nails by another lucky adventure however the booby is enabled to make up his mothers loss finding a treasure which a party of robbers had left behind them at the foot of a tree

the incident of a simpleton selling something to an inanimate object and discovering a hidden treasure occurs in different forms in the folktales of asiatic as well as european countries in a manuscript text of the arabian nights brought from constantinople by wortley montague and now

p147

preserved in the bodleian library oxford a more elaborate version of the italian boobys adventure with the statue is found in the story of the bangeater and his wife

in former times there lived not far from baghdád a halfwitted fellow who was much addicted to the use of bang being reduced to poverty he was obliged to sell his cow which he took to the market one day but the animal being in such a poor condition no one would buy it and after waiting till he was weary he returned homeward on the way he stopped to repose himself under a tree and tied the cow to one of the branches while he ate some bread and drank an infusion of his bang which he always carried with him in a short time it began to operate so as to bereave him of the little sense he had and his head was filled with ridiculous reveries while he was musing a bird beginning to chatter from her nest in the tree he fancied it was a human voice and that some woman had offered to purchase his cow upon which he said reverend mother of solomon1 dost thou wish to buy my

cow the bird again chattered well replied he what wilt thou give i will sell her a bargain the bird repeated her noise never mind said the fool for though thou hast forgotten to bring thy purse yet as i daresay thou art an honest woman and hast bidden me ten dinars i will trust thee with the cow and call on friday for the money the bird renewed her chattering so leaving the cow tied to a branch of the tree he returned home exulting in the good bargain he had made for the animal when he entered the house his wife inquired what he had got for the cow and he replied that he had sold her to an honest woman who had promised to pay him ten pieces of gold next friday the wife was contented and when friday arrived her noodle of a husband having as usual taken a dose of bang repaired to the tree and hearing the bird chattering as before said well good mother hast thou brought the gold the bird croaked the blockhead supposing the imaginary woman refused to pay him became angry and threw up a stone which frightening the bird it flew from its nest in the tree and alighted on a heap of ruins at some little distance he now concluded that the woman had desired him to take his money from the heap into which he accordingly dug and found a copper

vessel full of coin this discovery convinced him he was right and being withal an honest fellow he only took ten pieces then replacing the soil may allah requite thee for thy punctuality good mother he exclaimed and returned to his wife to whom he gave the money informing her at the same time of the great treasure his friend the imaginary old woman possessed and where it was concealed

the wife waited till night when she brought away the pot of gold which her foolish husband observing he said it is dishonest to rob one who has paid us so punctually and if thou dost not return it to its place i will inform the walí governor of the city she laughed at his simplicity but fearing that he would execute his threat she planned a stratagem to render it of no avail going to market she purchased some meat and fish ready cooked which she brought privately home and concealed in the house at night while her husband was sleeping off the effects of his favourite narcotic she strewed the provisions she had brought outside the door and then awakening him cried out dear husband a most wonderful thing has occurred there has been a violent storm while you slept and strange to tell it has rained pieces of broiled meat and fish which

now lie at the door the blockhead got up and seeing the food was persuaded of the truth of his wifes story the flesh and fish were gathered up and he partook with much glee of the miraculous treat but still said he would tell the walí of her having stolen the treasure of the honest old woman

in the morning he actually repaired to the walí and informed him that his wife had stolen a pot of gold which she had still in her possession upon this the walí had the woman apprehended she denied the accusation and was then threatened with death my lord said she the power is in your hands but i am an injured woman as you will find by questioning my husband who is deranged in his intellect ask him when i committed the theft the walí did so and the simpleton answered it was the evening of that night when it rained broiled fish and readycooked flesh on hearing this wretch exclaimed the walí in a fury dost thou dare to utter falsehoods before me who ever saw it rain anything but water as i hope for life replied the fool i speak the truth for my wife and myself ate of the fish and flesh which fell from the clouds the woman being appealed to denied the assertion of her husband the walí now convinced that the man

was crazy released the woman and sent her husband to the madhouse where he remained for some days till his wife pitying his condition contrived to get him set at liberty she visited her husband and counselled him should any one ask him if he had seen it rain fish and flesh to answer no who ever saw it rain anything but water then she informed the keeper that he was come to his senses and suggested he should question him and on the poor fellow answering properly he was released

in a russian variant an old man had three sons one of whom was a noodle when the old man died his property was shared between the brothers but all that the simpleton received was one ox which he took to the market to sell on his way he chanced to pass an old birchtree which creaked and groaned in the wind he thinks the tree is offering to buy his ox and so he says well you shall have it for twenty roubles but the tree only creaked and creaked and he fancied it was asking the ox on credit very good says he youll pay me tomorrow ill wait till then so he ties the ox to the tree and goes home his brothers question him about his ox and he tells them he has sold it for twenty roubles and is to get

p152

the money tomorrow at which they laugh he is they think a greater fool than ever next morning he went to the birchtree and found the ox was gone for in truth the wolves had eaten it he demanded his money but the tree only creaked and groaned as usual youll pay me tomorrow he exclaimed thats what you said yesterday ill have no more of your promises so saying he struck the old birchtree with his hatchet and sent the chips flying about now the tree was hollow and it soon split asunder from his blows and in the hollow trunk he found a pot full of gold which some robbers had hidden there taking some of the gold he returns home and shows it to his brothers who ask him how he got so much money a neighbour he replies gave it to me for my ox but this is nothing like the whole of it come along brothers and let us get the rest they go and fetch the rest of the treasure and on their way home they meet a diachok one of the inferior members of the russian clerical body though not one of the clergy who asks them what they are carrying mushrooms say the two clever brothers but the noodle cries thats not true were carrying money here look at it the diachok with an exclamation flung himself upon the gold and began stuffing it into

p153

his pockets at this the noodle grew angry dealt him a blow with his hatchet and killed him on the spot the brothers dragged the body to an empty cellar and flung it in later in the evening the eldest said to the other this business is sure to turn out badly when they look for the diachok simpleton will be sure to tell them all about it so we had better hide the body in some other place and kill a goat and bury it in the cellar this they did accordingly and after several days had passed the people asked the noodle if he had seen the diachok yes he answered i killed him some time ago with my hatchet and my brothers carried him to the cellar they seize upon him and compel him to go down into the cellar and bring out the body he gets hold of the goats head and asks was your diachok darkhaired he was had he a beard yes and horns what horns are you talking of well see for yourselves said he tossing up the head to them they saw it was a goats head and went away home1

the reader cannot fail to remark the close resemblance there is between the first parts

of the arabian and russian storie and the second parts of both reappear in many tales of the silly son the goats carcase substituted for the dead man occurs for instance in the norse story of silly matt in the sicilian story of giufà in m rivières contes populates de la kabylie du djurdjura and foolish sachúli in miss stokes indian fairy tales the incident of the pretended shower of broiled fish and flesh is found in campbells tales of the west highlands porridge and pancakes in rivières tales of the kabaïl fritters foolish sachúli sweetmeats giufà the sicilian booby figs and raisins and in m legers contes populaires slaves where curiously enough the trick is played by a husband upon his wife it is perhaps worth while reproducing the russian story from leger in a somewhat abridged form as follows

in tilling the ground a labourer found a treasure and carrying it home said to his wife see heaven has sent us a fortune but where can we conceal it she suggested he should bury it under the floor which he did accordingly soon after this the wife went out to fetch water and the labourer reflected that his wife was a dreadful gossip and by tomorrow night all the village would know their secret so he removed the

p155

treasure from its hidingplace and buried it in his barn beneath a heap of corn when the wife came back from the well he said to her quite gravely tomorrow we shall go to the forest to seek fish they say theres plenty there at present what fish in the forest she exclaimed of course he rejoined and youll see them there very early next morning he got up and took some fish which he had concealed in a basket he went to the grocers and bought a quantity of sweet cakes he also caught a hare and killed it the fish and cakes he disposed of in different parts of the wood and the hare he hooked on a fishingline and then threw it in the river after breakfast he took his wife with him into the wood which they had scarcely entered when she found a pike then a perch and then a roach on the ground with many exclamations of surprise she gathered up the fish and put them in her basket presently they came to a peartree from the branches of which hung sweet cakes see she cried cakes on a peartree quite natural replied he it has rained cakes and some have remained on this tree travellers have picked up the rest continuing their way to the village they passed near a stream wait a little said the husband i set my line early this morning and ill

p156

look if anything is caught on it he then pulled in the line and behold there was a hare hooked on to it how extraordinary cries the good wifea hare in the water why says he dont you know there are hares in the water as well as rats no indeed i knew it not they now returned home and the wife set about preparing all the nice eatables for supper in a day or two the labourer found from the talk of his acquaintances that his finding the treasure was no secret in the village and in less than a week he was summoned to the castle is it true said the lord that you have found a treasure it is not true was his reply but your wife has told me all my wife does not know what she saysshe is mad my lord hereupon the woman cries it is the truth my lord he has found a treasure and buried it beneath the floor of our cottage when on the eve before the day we went into the forest to look for fish what do you say yes it was on the day that it rained cakes we gathered a basketful of them and coming home my husband fished a fine hare out of the river my lord declared the woman to be an idiot nevertheless he caused his servants to search under the labourers cottage floor but nothing was found there and so the shrewd fellow secured his treasure

p157

the silly son figures frequently in indian storybooks sometimes a number of fools exploits are strung together and ascribed to one individual as in the tale of foolish sachúli but generally they are told as separate stories the following adventure of sachúli is also found in varied form in beschis gooroo paramartan one day sachúli climbed up a tree and sat on a long branch and began cutting off the branch between the tree and himself a man passing by called to him saying what are you doing up there you will be killed if you cut that branch off what do you say asked the booby coming down when shall i die how can i tell said the man let me go i will not let you go until you tell me when i shall die at last the man in order to get rid of him said when you find a scarlet thread on your jacket then you will die after this sachúli went to the bazaar and sat down by some tailors and in throwing away shreds a scarlet thread fell on his clothes now i shall die exclaimed the fool how do you know that the tailors inquired when he told them what the man had said about a scarlet thread at which they all laughed nevertheless sachúli went and dug a grave in the jungle and lay down in it

p158

presently a sepoy comes along bearing a pot of ghi or clarified butter which he engages sachúli to carry for him and the noodle of course lets it fall in the midst of his calculations of the uses to which he should put the money he is promised by the sepoy

the incident of a blockhead cutting off the branch on which he is seated seems to be almost universal it occurs in the jests of the typical turkish noodle the khoja nasreddín and there exist german saxon and lithuanian variants of the same story it is also known in ceylon and the following is a version from a hindú work entitled bharataka dwátrinsati thirtytwo tales of mendicant monks

in elákapura there lived several mendicant monks one of them named dandaka once went in the rainy season into a wood in order to procure a post for his hut there he saw on a tree a fine branch bent down and he climbed the tree sat on the branch and began to cut it then there came that way some travellers who seeing what he was doing said o monk greatest of all idiots you should not cut a branch on which you yourself are sitting for if you do so when the branch breaks you will fall down and die after saying this the travellers went their way the monk however paid no

p159

attention to their speech but continued to cut the branch remaining in the same posture until at length the branch broke and he tumbled down he then thought within himself those travellers are indeed wise and truthful for everything has happened just as they predicted consequently i must be dead so he remained on the ground as if dead he did not speak nor did he stand up nor did he even breathe people who came there from the neighbourhood raised him up but he did not stand they endeavoured to make him speak but could not succeed they then sent word to the other monks saying your associate dandaka fell down from a tree and died then came the monks in large numbers and when they saw that he was dead they lifted him up in order to carry him to the place of cremation now when they had gone a short distance they came upon a spot where the road divided itself before them then said some we must go to the left but others said it is to the right that we must go thus a dispute arose among them and they were unable to come to any conclusion the dead monk who was borne on a bier said friends quarrel not among yourselves when i was alive i always went by the left road then said some he always spoke the truth all

p160

that he ever said was nothing but the simple fact let us therefore take the left road this was agreed upon and as they were about to proceed towards the left some people who happened to be present said o ye monks ye are the greatest of all blockheads that ye should proceed to burn this man while he is yet alive they answered nay but he is dead then the bystanders said he cannot be dead seeing that he yet speaks they then set down the bier on the ground and dandaka persistently declared that he was actually dead and related to them with the most solemn protestations the prediction of the travellers and how it was fulfilled hereupon the other monks remained quite bewildered unable to arrive at any decision as to whether dandaka was dead or alive until at length after a great deal of trouble the bystanders succeeded in convincing them that the man was not dead and in inducing them to return to their dwelling dandaka also now stood up and went his way after having been heartily laughed at by the people1

grazzini and in our old collection tales and quicke answeres has a near affinity with jests of this class and also with the wide cycle of stories in which a number of rogues combine to cheat a simpleton out of his property in the early english jestbook1 it is in effect as follows

there once dwelt in florence a noodle called nigniaca upon whom a party of young men resolved to play a practical joke having arranged their plans one of them met him early one morning and asked him if he was not ill no says the wittol i am well enough by my faith quoth the joker but you have a pale sickly colour and went his way presently a second of the complotters came up to him and asked him if he was not suffering from an ague for he certainly looked very ill the poor fellow now began to think that he was really sick and was convinced of this when a third man in passing told him that he should be in his bedhe had evidently not an hour to live hearing this nigniaca stood stockstill saying to himself verily i have some sharp ague when a fourth man came and bade him go home at once for he was a dying man

p162

so the simpleton begged this fourth man to help him home which he did very willingly and after laying him in his bed the other jokers came to see him and one of them pretending to be a physician felt his pulse and declared the patient would die within an hour1 then standing all about his bed they said to each other now he is sinking fast his speech and sight have failed him he will soon give up the ghost let us therefore close his eyes cross his hands on his breast and carry him forth to be buried the simpleton lay as still as though he was really dead so they laid him on a bier and carried him through the city a great crowd soon gathered when it was known that they were carrying the corpse of nigniaca to his grave and among the crowd was a taverners boy who cried out what a rascal and thief

1 thus too scogin and his chamberfellow successively declared to a rustic that the sheep he was driving were pigs in fortinis novels in like manner a simpleton is persuaded that the kid he offered for sale was a capon and in the spanish el conde lucanor and the german tyl eulenspiegel a countryman is cheated out of a piece of cloth the original form of the incident is found in the hitopadesa where three sharpers persuade a bráhman that the goat he is carrying for a sacrifice is a dog this story of the florentine noodleor rather poggios versionmay have been suggested by a tale in the

is dead by the mass he should have been hanged long ago when the wittol heard himself thus vilified he lifted up his head and exclaimed i wish you scoundrel i were alive now as i am dead and i would prove thee a false liar to thy face upon which the jokers burst into laughter set down the body and ran awayleaving nigniaca to explain the whole affair to the marvelling multitude1

we read of another silly son in the kathá manjari whose father said to him one day my boy you are now grown big yet you

dont seem to have much sense you must however do something for your living go therefore to the tank and catch fish and bring them home the lad accordingly went to the tank and having caused all the waterwhich was required for the irrigation of his fathers fieldsto run to waste he picked up from the mud all the fishes he could find and took them to his father not a little proud of his exploitin the kathá sarit ságara it is related that a brahman told his foolish son one evening that he must send him to the village early on the morrow and thither the lad went without asking what he was to do returning home at night very tired he said to his father i have been to the village yes said the brahman you went thither without an object and have done no good by itand in the buddhist játakas we find what is probably the original of a worldwide story a man was chopping a felled tree when a mosquito settled on his bald head and stung him severely calling to his son who was sitting near him he said my boy there is a mosquito stinging my head like the thrust of a speardrive it off wait a bit father said the boy and i will kill him with one blow then he took up an axe and stood behind his fathers back and thinking to kill the mosquito with the axe he only killed his father

p165

among numerous variants is the story of the sicilian booby giufà who was annoyed by the flies and complained of them to the judge who told him that he was at liberty to kill a fly wherever he saw it just then a fly happened to alight on the judges nose which giufà observing he immediately aimed at it so furious a blow with his fist that he smashed his worships nose

the hopelessness of attempting to impart instruction to the silly son is farther illustrated by the story in a sinhalese collection a gúrú was engaged in teaching one of his disciples but whilst he was teaching the youth was watching the movements of a rat which was entering its hole as soon as the gúrú had finished his teaching he said well my son has all entered in to which the youth replied yes all has entered in except the tail and from the same work is the following choice example of a happy family a priest went one day to the house of one of his followers and amongst other things he said tell me now which of your four children is the bestbehaved the father replied look sir at that boy who has climbed to the top of that thatched building and is waving aloft a firebrand among them all he is the divinely excellent one whereupon the priest placed his finger on his nose

the turkish romance of the forty vazirsthe plan of which is similar to that of the book of sindibád and its derivativesfurnishes us with two stories of the same class one of which is as follows according to my friend mr gibbs complete translation the first that has been made in english recently published1

they have told that in bygone times there was a king and he had a skilful minstrel one day a certain person gave to the latter a little boy that he might teach him the science of music the boy abode a long time by him and though the master instructed him he succeeded not in learning and the master could make nothing of him he arranged a scale and said whatsoever thou sayest to me say in this scale so whatsoever the boy said he used to say in that scale now one day a spark of fire fell on the masters turban the boy saw it and chanted o master i see something shall i say it or no and he went over the whole scale then the master

p167

chanted o boy what dost thou see speak and he too went over all that the boy had gone over then the turn came to the boy and he chanted o master a spark has fallen on thy turban and it is burning the master straightway tore off his turban and cast it on the ground and saw that it was burning he blew out the fire on this side and on that and took it in his hand and said to the boy what time for chanting is this everything is good in its own place and he admonished him1

the other story tells how a king had a stupid son and placed him in charge of a cunning master learned in the sciences who declared it would be easy for him to teach the boy discretion and before dismissing him the king gave the sage many rich gifts after the boy has been long under the tuition of his learned master the latter conceiving

1 a variant of this is found in john bromyards summa prœdicantium a 26 34 as follows

quidam sedebat juxta igneum cujus vestem ignis intrabat dixit socius suus vis audire rumores ita inquit bonos et non alios cui aliusnescio nisi malos ergo inquit nolo audire et quum bis aut ter ei hoc diceret semper idem respondit in fine quum sentiret vestem combustam iratus ait socio quare non dixisti mihi quia inquit dixista quod noluisti audire rumores nisi placentes et illi non erant tales

p168

him to be well versed in all the sciences takes him to the king his father who says to him o my son were i to hold a certain thing hidden in my hand couldst thou tell me what it is yes answers the youth upon this the king secretly slips the ring off his finger and hides it in his hand and then asks the boy what have i in my hand quoth the clever youth o father it first came from the hills the king thinks to himself he knows that mines are in the hills and it is a round thing continues heit must be a millstone blockhead exclaims the irate king could a millstone be hidden in a mans hand then addressing the learned man take him away he says and teach him

lastly we have a somewhat different specimen of the silly son in the doctors apprentice whose attempt to imitate his master was so ludicrously unsuccessful he used to accompany his master on his visits to patients and one day the doctor said to a sick man to whom he had been called i know what is the matter with you and it is useless to deny ityou have been eating beans on their way home the apprentice admiring his masters sagacity begged to be informed how he knew that the patient had been eating beans boy said the doctor

p169

loftily i drew an inference an inference echoed this youth of inquiring mind and what is an inference quoth the doctor listen when we came to the door i observed the shells of beans lying about and i drew the inference that the family had had beans for dinner another day it chanced that the doctor did not take his apprentice with him when he went his rounds and in his absence a message came for him to visit a person who had been taken suddenly ill here thought the apprentice is a chance for my putting masters last lesson into practice so off he went to the sick man and assuming as knowing an air as he could he felt his pulse and then said to him severely dont deny it i see by your pulse that you have been eating a horse i shall send you some medicine when the doctor returned home he inquired of his hopeful pupil whether any person had called for him upon which the wittol proudly told him of his own exploit eaten a horse exclaimed the man of physic in the name of all thats wonderful what induced you to say such a thing quoth the youth simpering why sir i did as you did the other day when we visited the old farmeri drew an inference you drew an inference did you and how did you draw the inference that the man had

p170

eaten a horse why very readily sir for as i entered the house i saw a saddle hanging on the wall1embed"
