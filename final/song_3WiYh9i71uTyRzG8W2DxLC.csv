there is a hum thereâ€™s a hum
theres a neverending hum
and no one ever seems to notice it no one seems to notice it
you have never noticed it
never ever never ever
until now

hum

deep in the dankest corners of the human mind
of any given person that you happen to see
there rests a creature
or more specifically
a critter hiding and sitting
in the churning boiling philosophical pot
of selfaware chowder that we call thought

this critter has a name
but its different for each person
mine is named corey
and it looks like an armadillo
in kiss makeup

you might also likepicture your spirit in a delicatessen
in the slums of the universe
open sign dangling daring all parasites
giving you mosquito bites
sucking the life out of all of your customers
but fear not its your critter to the rescue
hum emanating from its lips

and fear disappears
as the parasite trips
and lands in a puddle
and thats your rebuttal
to the argument that you
werent even listening to
because of the neverending hum
the hum
