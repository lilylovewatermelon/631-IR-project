sweet daisy chain
around your neck
through your hair
in the sun
sweet glowing skin
kiss the grass
golden air fill your lungs

refrain
slow down let it all slow

verse 2
sweet orange sky
watch it fade
colours mango and blue
sweet glowing skin
kiss the grass
and the light passes through

refrain
slow down let it all slow
slow down let it all slow
slow down let it all slow
slow down let it all
see the paper kites liveget tickets as low as 26you might also likebridge
and our bones are growing stronger
every day we breathe it in
we make time to see
and find our healing
and our bones are growing stronger
every day we breathe it in
slow down let it all

verse 1
sweet daisy chain
around your neck
through your hair
in the sun

refrain
slow down let it all slow
slow down let it allembed"
