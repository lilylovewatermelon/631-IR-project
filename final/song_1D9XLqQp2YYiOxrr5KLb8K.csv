yeah

verse 1
bridge over troubled water ice in my muddy water
rich off a mixtape got rich off a mixtape
probably shouldnt be driving it just got so much harder
cant even see it straight i cant even see it straight ah
fuck with me i buy the shots
live a little cause niggas die a lot
and lie a lot but im the truth thats right i fuckin said it
the living proof that you aint gotta die to get to heaven
you girl you right there you look like you like this shit
howd i know howd i know thats me on some psychic shit
i could tell a lie if you askin me my whereabouts
but i might talk that real if you ask me what i care about
rap and bitches rap and bitches bitches and rappin
rappin and bitches until all of it switches i swear
its been two years since somebody asked me who i was
im the greatest man i said that before i knew i was
thats whats important what really happened before this
when me and my crew was all about this rapper from new orleans
singing walking like a man finger on the trigger
i got money in my pocket im a uptown nigga ah
with fame on my mind my girl on my nerves
i was pushing myself to get something that i deserve
that was back in the days acura days
i was a cold dude im gettin back to my ways
see drake liveget tickets as low as 89you might also likechorus
people always ask how i got my nice things
take my crown to the grave im an underground king
i bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
cause im down to spend whatever lately ive been on a roll
and i do it for the city cause you know the city love a nigga
do it for the city cause you know the city love a nigga
do it for the city cause you know the city love a nigga
do it for the city ugk fuck these other niggas
verse 2
sometimes i need that romance sometimes i need that pole dance
sometimes i need that stripper thats gon tell me that she dont dance
tell me lies make it sound good make it sound good
do me like the women from my town would
leather with that woodgrain persian rugs on wood floors
talking all them good things thats all im really good for
memphis tennessee know see i start to go deep back
in ridge crest with my seat back with yo gotti and emack
and these niggas got them diamonds glowin in they mouth
and they rockin furs like its snowin in the south
and every pretty girl tell me thats the shit that she like
so why am i in class if this is who im tryna be like
so i drop out lessons i was taught are quick to fade
soon as i realize that turnin papers in wont get me paid
and if i dont do nothing ima ball
im countin all day like the clock on the wall yeah i need that
making major changes to the life im livin
i had no choice i had to prove i made the right decision
that was back in the days acura days
i was a cold dude im gettin back to my ways
chorus
people always ask how i got my nice things
take my crown to the grave im an underground king
i bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
cause im down to spend whatever lately ive been on a roll
and i do it for the city cause you know the city love a nigga
do it for the city cause you know the city love a nigga
do it for the city cause you know the city love a nigga
do it for the city ugk fuck these other niggas63embed"
