verse 1
you see rain eroded zahra jewels embedded in my chest piece
armor on me especially you need to bring catastrophe
all my squad be waiting up for me to come and take the lead
now we headed out in your direction just to check on thangs
who these niggas think they talking to i make them run from me when i pull up she in slow motion while she run to me
i dont give no fuck bout none of you boys you wont be seen with me
you rappers talking shit but you still wanna feature me
all my niggas smoking where we are you cant say anything gundam gas laced inside my blunt
im smoking everything
should i pull off with his bitch and let her taste test everything
i could twist tornado thatd be worse than what the nature bring
why she looking at me like i got her ass a wedding ring
i looked back at her and i said ho do you know anything
i cant trust this bitch thats how i feel and that stick permanently
i move with my own devotion fuck whoever is in front of me
