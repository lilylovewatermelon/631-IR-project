and when you wanted me i came to you
and when you wanted someone else i withdrew
and when you asked for light i set myself on fire
and if i go far away i know
youll find another slave

chorus
now im free from what you want
now im free from what you need
now im free from what you are

verse 2
and when you wanted blood i cut my veins
and when you wanted love i bled myself again
now that ive had my fill of you ill give you up forever
and here i go far away i know you
youll find another slave

chorus
now im free from what you want
now im free from what you need
now im free from what you are
