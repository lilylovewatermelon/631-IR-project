broken hearts are made for two
one for me and one for you
tell me have you heard the news
we are now in love
so i guess that i should mention
that i am in no condition
to put you in this position
i might fuck this up
but whatever the case youre my favorite mistake
more than happy to make you
if you decide to stay know there is no escape
theres no one here to save you

hook
but youre so brave
stone cold crazy for loving me
yeah im amazed
i hope you make it out alive

verse 2
please dont take my hand if you dont plan to
take a stand and be a man who
understands that im no walk in the park
all these scars on my heart
its so dark here
but if youre a warrior theres nothing to fear
nothing to fear
you might also likehook
cause youre so brave
stone cold crazy for loving me
yeah im amazed
i hope you make it out alive38embed"
