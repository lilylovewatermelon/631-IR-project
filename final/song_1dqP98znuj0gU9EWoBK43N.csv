rocked silent in a soft lullaby
panic stirred me awakened by a ringing phone in time
where and when
would i see her
crazy were the words that scribbled out your mouth
i stuttered replacing your face to those words
where and when
would i kill her
ill wish on this ill wish with this
i ill wish
to the bitter end of my day well
where were you

prechorus
so you had your turn and you made it work
now im the laughing stock of your joke
as crazy as it may seem
i cried for you when you
told me to date all of the things
that made you end up in my life
and ill believe anything
i have no luck with girls

chorus
i overheard
that you were unhappy too
misleading trust into a relationship that makes no sense
over and out connecticut
but you had your back turned there as you faded away
at the end of my day i found out
you werent worth what i thought of you
what i thought of you
you might also likeverse 2
write this down in your diary you abuse
can we make plans can i just get through to you
is this weird
do i scare her
ill wish on this ill wish with this
i ill wish
that you could share the love you shared with others
with me

prechorus
so you had your turn and you made it work
now im the laughing stock of your joke
as crazy as it may seem
i cried for you when you
told me to date all of the things
that made you end up in my life
and ill believe anything
i have no luck with girls

chorus
i overheard
that you were unhappy too
misleading trust into a relationship that makes no sense
over and out connecticut
but you had your back turned there as you faded away
at the end of my day i found out
you werent worth what i thought of you
what i thought of you
outro
lover lover lover liar
what i thought of you
lover lover lover liar
but this isnt love
so forever let it go forever let it burn
but this isnt love
there on the backend of forever i wish i would never
hurt again
i wish i would never hurt again
no
i wish i would never hurt again
and i wish i would never hurt again
i wish i would never hurt again
i wish i would never hurt againembed"
