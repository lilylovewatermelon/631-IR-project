i thought id never see the day when youd smile at me
we always pull through oh when we try
im always wrong but youre never right

i was a few cheap shots away from the end of me
taking for granted most everything

just yesterday

chorus

we cross the world while its asleep
ill never trade it in
cause ive always wanted this and
its not a dream anymore
no
its not a dream anymore
