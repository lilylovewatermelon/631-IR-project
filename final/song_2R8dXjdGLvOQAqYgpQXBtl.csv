hahahah yeah

verse 1 mac miller
young sire slap the fuck out jon cryer
rough rider raw bust inside a vagina like i want kids
my head continues to be haunted
i burn a city down while im unconscious
maybe go and take some quaaludes conversate with jesús
batting practice with the motherfuckin ghost of babe ruth
do as a saint do turn painful to graceful
the devil on my trails im tryna find the holy grail
right there
and if mars is the farthest that man has set his target
then i dont know why i even started
im sick of bein too nice to people who dont do shit but consume light
told myself fuck the world kid just do what you like
go and have a food fight start yourself a new life
youre too bright to be inside a bunch of mediocrity
but all those big words aint gon get you paid
and those abstract ideas for sure wont get you laid
you got it made in that mad house
what the fuck you got to be sad bout go head and rap now
do what you do best
i mean thats what you do best
matter fact motherfucker you a suit vest you need to buy a new dress
i heard you and your girl live in a duplex
ima put her ass in a suplex the sun east the moon west
if you got a clue what does a clue get nothin

my milk and honey my chériechérie amore
my cinderella in her carriage by the doorway
her ruby slipper made the wizard send the scarecrow
and the lion through the forest
to the wicked witchs fortress where she scorched them in the foreplay
remember that he said hed fight the box to see the wizard
when he was visited by dorothy who came here on a blizzard
now the whole worlds in color still
how auntie em was next of kin but not her mother real
her face was careworn
i suspect she migrated from kansas up from dearborn
and had beef with mrs gulch since the very beginnin of year one
mr candyman the parables parabolic
the poetrys like the poems and psalms of ecclesiastes
lightnin should strike the stone and then moses should make a tablet
the judge will bang the wood up in parliament with the mallet
and yell hear hear finally some order to this rap shit
finally some sort of water to soil these cracked lips
i keep my shit crispy and elegant
so miss me with the irrelevant the godbody is heavensent
the hardbody is reverence since the son of byford
brother of fal every rhymes halal
every line is kosher livin la vida loca
shout out to tony toca we ballin like we suppose to25embed"
