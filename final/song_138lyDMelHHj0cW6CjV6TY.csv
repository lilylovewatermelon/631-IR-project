i am awake
under this blanket of fear
and i must say
none of the people i see belong here
now everyones asleep
i am awake and i am dreaming
i believe its time for a rude awakening

chorus
so hold on to your dreams
because your nightmares might seem like theyre your reality hold on to your dreams
because your nightmares might seem like theyre your reality

verse 2
i believe
the only thing we have to fear is
fear itself and the man behind the curtain
i heard him say
dreamers have become an endangered species
and i am aware of the rude awakening

chorus
so hold on to your dreams
because your nightmares might seem like theyre your reality hold on to your dreams
because your nightmares might seem like theyre your reality
you might also likebridge
im falling in my dream i finally hit the ground
im falling in my dream i finally hit the ground
i hit the ground

because i
i cant keep my mind
from going into dark places
because i
i cant keep my mind
from going into dark places

chorus
so hold on to your dreams
because your nightmares
might seem like theyre your reality
hold on to your dreams
because your nightmares might seem like theyre your reality

outro
im falling in my dream i finally hit the ground
im falling in my dream i finally hit the groundembed"
