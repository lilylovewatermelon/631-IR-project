we got london on da track
you was faking it all along
felt that shit inside my bone
had a feeling you had told
when i felt it in my soul
and you know your word aint strong
cause they know you getting old
ever since i been on
we give the trenches hope
yeah yeah

verse 1 lil baby
yeah keep it a buck it aint nobody fucking with us
i cant sit round and talk about other niggas
that shit old i dont care what he did
we was cool but it is what it is now
broke as fuck used to live at my mans house
i work hard they aint give me no handouts
bro aint really a opp he just fanned out
came with me we just slept on the same couch
how you play like its fuck me thеn come back and switch up and ask me for something with thе same mouth
we have spots in the hood make sure everyone good
beat that bitch for too much then we change out
we could be anywhere we gon bang out
if you see me they pay me i dont hang out
i got too many cars need a bigger garage
call the realtor tell her to change house
this shit deep i take care of my kids side of they family
im too rich to let somebody handle me
nah for real i pay rent for my young niggas mamanem
we got away on the chase i was one of them
pay attention to me you could run it up
i aint drove it in weeks gotta warm it up
you gon die if you come at us
got a richard mille its a oneofone
i was stuck on the block aint have nothing coming in
every time i fell i got back up again
im gon practice til i fucking win
we aint brothers i dont call you niggas twin
got the hittas trailing me inside a benz
everything i got on im tryna times ten
and i dont fuck with yall niggas i aint friendly
you might also likechorus lil baby
i kept it real with you why would you lie to me
you complaining and you dont even gotta be
ima turn up for everyone watching me
im on point with this shit cause i gotta be
i aint tripping i just wanna live good
would have gave you my all probably still would
when i cant get no drank i dont feel good
been all over the world but im still hood

verse 2 lil durk
i wasnt born with a silver spoon
you ask me for drugs and cant get em gone
my uncle want drugs ill give it to him
he thinking he me when i put him on
auntie fucking in the bedroom
i had to sleep inside a nigga bathroom
putting duct tape on the air mattress so the air wouldnt really leave from
real niggas on standby all that fake love i dont need none
i dont really talk cash with a bitch unless the bitch really need some
one nigga told me he started with dimes and nicks he say he gon die with a brick
one nigga told me forever gon carry his gun that nigga died with his stick
i grew up a little bit different and my uncle had cancer i had to share a room with a junkie
i told you i grew up the toughest came from nothing had to wash up with a bucket
police had told me slow down when i be in the city cause they say im starting a ruckus
fucked the bitch then give the bitch a plan b and tell her this shit come with my money
chorus lil baby
i kept it real with you why would you lie to me
you complaining and you dont even gotta be
ima turn up for everyone watching me
im on point with this shit cause i gotta be
i aint tripping i just wanna live good
would have gave you my all probably still would
when i cant get no drank i dont feel good
been all over the world but im still hood

outro lil baby
felt that shit inside my bone
and you know your word aint strong
cause they know you getting old
we got london on the track2embed"
