theres no work in walking and it fueled the talk
i would grab my shoes and then away id walk
through all the stubborn beauty id start at the dawn
until the sun had fully stopped never walking away from
just a way to pull apart dehydrate back into minerals
a lifelong walk to the same exact spot

chorus
carbons anniversary
the parting of the sensory
old old news to read
the parting of the sensory

verse 2
who the hell made you the boss
they laid traps at the exact same spot
we placed our chips in all the right spots but still lost
carbon’s on display
any shithead who had ever walked
there i opened up and i walked
could take the ship and do a much finer job
this fits like clothes made out of wasps
you don’t know when the fuck you’re goin’ to the same damn spot
oh fuck it i guess i lost
you were supposed to know it all gets lost
see modest mouse liveget tickets as low as 76you might also likechorus
the parting of the sensory
carbons anniversary
just part of the game if you please
carbons anniversary

verse 3
who the hell made you the boss
i burned my ships and then all the docks
if you say what to do i know what not to stop
i’ll follow them guys to the same damn spot
if you were the ship then who would ever get on
the weather changed and for the worse
hoooooo who the hell made you the boss
it came down on us like it had been rehearsed
hoooooo
not like you hoped but change will surely come
hoooooo like hell i made you the boss
and be awful for most but really good for some
hoooooo who the hell made you the boss
i pulled your trip to the exact same spot
hoooooo i don’t where the fuck we’re goin’ to the same dame spot
we pulled the trigger but we forgot to cock at every single shot…
carbon’s anniversary single shot
ah fuck it i guess we lost
carbon’s anniversary all right
