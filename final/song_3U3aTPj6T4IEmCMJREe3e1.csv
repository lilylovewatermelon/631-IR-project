what can you see from your window
i cant see anything from mine
flags on the side of the highway
scripture on grocery store signs
maybe eighteen is too early
maybe thirty or forty is too
did you get your chance to make peace with the man
before he sent down his angels for you

chorus 1
mamas and grandmamas love you
cause thats all they know how to do
you never planned on the bombs in the sand
or sleeping in your dress blues

verse 2
your wife said this all would be funny
when you came back home in a week
youd turn twentytwo and wed celebrate you
in a bar or a tent by the creek

your baby would just about be here
your very last tour would be up
but you wont be back theyre all dressing in black
drinking sweet tea in styrofoam cups
see zac brown band liveget tickets as low as 60you might also likechorus 2
mamas and grandmamas love you
american boys hate to lose
you never planned on the bombs in the sand
or sleeping in your dress blues

verse 3
now the high school gymnasiums ready
full of flowers and old legionnaires
nobody showed up to protest
they just sniffle and stare

theres red white and blue in the rafters
theres silent old men from the corps
what did they say when they shipped you away
to give all in some god awful war

chorus 3
nobody here could forget you
you showed us what we had to lose
you never planned on the bombs in the sand
or sleeping in your dress blues
oh you never planned on the bombs in the sand
or sleeping in your dress blues

outro
you never planned on the bombs in the sand
or sleeping in your dress blues1embed"
