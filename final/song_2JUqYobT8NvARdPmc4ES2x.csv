heres to a good guy he hooked it up
said if i was in ny i should look you up
i first time id ever saw you
and you text nothing like you look
heres to the gay bar you took me to
heres when i realized you talk so much more than i do
i heres to the highlights when i was convinced
that this was much more to you than some some night shit
i know you dont need me right now
and to you its just a late night out

outro
bitches nigga all the bitches in the neighborhood wanna fuck you nigga
they told me
i used to fuck with all of em
yeah i aint got bitches no more
but now i dont care about bitches like that my nigga that shit—
jasmine fucking wrecked my heart i dont even know how to feel about bi—you might also like56embed"
