fiendish wonder in a carnivals wake
dull caresses once again irritate
tread softly stranger
move over toward the danger that you seek
you think excitement has receded then the mirror distracts
the logic of the trance quickly reaches and grasps
handsome and faceless
and weightless your imagination runs

chorus
and now its no ones fault but yours
at the foot of the house of cards
you thought youd never get obsessed
you thought the wolves would be impressed
and youre a sinking stone
but you know what its like to hold the jewellers hands
that procession of pioneers all drowned

verse 2
in the moonlight theyre more thrilling those things that he knows
as he leads you through the grinning bubble blowers in the snow
watching his exit
was like falling off the ferry in the night
the inevitables gather to push you around
any other voice makes such a punishing sound
he became laughters assassin
shortly after he showed you what it was
you might also likechorus
and now its no ones fault but yours
at the foot of the house of cards
you thought youd never get obsessed
you thought the wolves would be impressed
and youre a sinking stone
but you know what its like to hold the jewellers hands
that procession of pioneers all drowned

outro
if youve a lesson to teach me
im listening ready to learn
theres no one here to police me
im sinking in until the return
if youve a lesson to teach
please dont deviate dont be afraid
without the last corner piece i cant calibrate
lets get it ingrained
if youve a lesson to teach me
im listening ready to learn
theres no one here to police me
im sinking in until the return
if youve a lesson to teach
please dont deviate dont be afraid
without the last corner piece i cant calibrate
lets get it ingrained
if youve a lesson to teach me
im listening ready to learn
theres no one here to police me
im sinking in until the return
if youve a lesson to teach
please dont deviate dont be afraid
without the last corner piece i cant calibrate
