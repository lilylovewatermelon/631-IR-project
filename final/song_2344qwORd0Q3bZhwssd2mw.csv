stand this
youre changing i cant stand it
my heart cant take this damage
and the way i feel cant stand it
mmm i dont understand this

verse 1 kay flock
how you love me im up in the booth booth
said im lying like show me the proof the proof
get in my bag put a sixth in a deuce deuce
she like who wockesha bitch thats juice thats juice
and you cant walk a mile in my shoes my shoes
you aint throw as much shots as i threw you aint throwin
you dont tote on the glock like i do
and you definitely dont bend that block like i do like like
lately ive been feelin alone alone
but im clutchin my chrome my chrome
pray to my mama im gon makе it home home
twenty missеd calls i aint answer my phone my phone
then i heard jb aint make it home home
they say flocka keep up and be strong strong
nah why cause that shit was wrong wrong
and i told him to keep that bitch on em
i got my front but is you behind me hind me
get goofy like martin and gina okay
or get greedy like keisha and tommy like
then get deady like whitney and bobby
i brought my pole if she think she gon line me line me
with the 30 i move extra cocky
if i aint dead or in jail they cant stop me stop me
gotti and notti and scottie my top three like
need a smooth g to spin call up gotti gotti
sosa with knocks in ya lobby lobby

if i tell him to get em i know that he got me i know it
so i got him he stay right beside me beside me
i be thinkin like she movin wocky wocky
she keep tellin me flocka you got me she got me
is you gon climb for me if it get rocky rocky
a parole shinin through like its hockey
cant box right now bullets punchin like ali ali
gotta keep it i know they gon watch me watch me
and i know that the feds tryna lock me they lock me

verse 2 g herbo
uh
fore i focused on rap i was sloppy
40 glocks used to pop where the opps be
used to drop hollows now i drop heat
if you speakin on the raq im top three
i aint talkin videos they watch me
he cant come to his hood thats not me
im a one of one lotta niggas took ls im the one that won
pull up hunnid shooters and a hunnid guns
big bro told me swerv get shit straight
really made it off rap he used to risktake
i made twothree mill off my mixtapes
all this ice you would think a nigga wrist ache
ive been eatin too good havin big steaks
everybody used to hate got the shit face
im like long live nip this a marathon
but if it really was a race you in sixth place
pussy swervo gon kill if you push me uh
gotta take drops so i been sippin basa i used to smoke lato and zookie
and i got security wit me but lil broll still pull up with a fully brr
and im still humble beast cause im from the streets but im quick to pull up on my bully
