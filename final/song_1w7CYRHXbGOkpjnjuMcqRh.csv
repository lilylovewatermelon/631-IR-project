i remember like yesterday
you had a dream in your eyes and a smile on your face
and im missing those days again yeah im missing those days again
and i forgot what really got in the way
maybe the sun that wouldnt shine should be taking the blame
cause its raining on me again yeah its raining on me again

bridge
a paradox
the key you dropped
a manifest
for what you lost was me
for my sake please

chorus
stop slowing me down stop holding me up
quit making a scene enoughs enough
lets be honest your promise was never meant to last
so im taking you on im calling you out
theres nothing left for us here now
lets be honest i promise im never lookin back for my sake
for my sake

verse 2
tell me something thats poetic at best
make me believe there was a time that you werent like the rest
and ill never ask you again and ill never ask you again
for all the moments and the memories
no one could ever say we never had a history
but im leaving that all behind
and there is nothing gonna change my mind
