i reckon you grew up in a town
that said reckon all the time
all your time so vile yet concrete
and i heard little rumors here and there
little peeps that you may never leave
i swear to god if you never leaveâ€”

verse 1
well here goes nothing i mean everything
fingers crossed every morning
after a night of no sleep
wondering if it will ever be me
but i guess im doing just fine
texting you sups and heys
with a smile or winkyface
hoping to get the same

prechorus 1
but i wont fucking wait
for you to stop lingering
youve got too clingy to this
town that you supposedly hate
and though it kills me to say
if you get stuck then im just gonna leave
see ya sucker

on the corner of canal and broadway
where that huge sign says love me
shrouded in graffiti and the stench of weed
my heart just started screaming
what if she just never leaves

prechorus 2
if you get stuck
how could i leave you
im just gonna go on without you
 way behind me
yeah its shredding me in half
but im not gonna lose you
and me too

chorus 2
on the corner of canal and broadway
where that huge sign says love me
shrouded in graffiti and the stench of weed
my heart just started screaming
maybe this isnt meant to be

outro
and i reckon you grew up
in a town that said reckon all the time
but what gives you the right to wreck everythingembed"
