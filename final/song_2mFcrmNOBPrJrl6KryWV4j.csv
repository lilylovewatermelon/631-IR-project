this will all fall down
like everything else that was
this too shall pass
and all of the words we said
we cant take back

verse 2
now every fool in town
wouldve left by now
i cant replace
all of the wasted days
the memory of your face
i cant help thinkin

prechorus 1
maybe if we ever coulda kept it all together
where would we be
a thousand lost forevers
and the promises you never were givin me
heres what im thinkin

chorus
it wont be the first heart that you break
it wont be the last beautiful girl
the one that you wrecked wont take you back
if you were the last beautiful girl in the world
last beautiful girl

so tell me one more time
how youre sorry about
the way this all went down
you needed to find your space

and the promises i never should have believed
