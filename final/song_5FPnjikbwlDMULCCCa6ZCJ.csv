i know a girl
she puts the color inside of my world
but shes just like a maze
where all of the walls all continually change
and ive done all i can
to stand on the steps with my heart in my hand
now im starting to see
maybe its got nothing to do with me

chorus
fathers be good to your daughters
daughters will love like you do
girls become lovers who turn into mothers
so mothers be good to your daughters too

verse 2
oh you see that skin
its the same shes been standing in
since the day she saw him walking away
now shes left
cleaning up the mess he made

chorus
so fathers be good to your daughters
daughters will love like you do
girls become lovers who turn into mothers
so mothers be good to your daughters too

boys you can break
you find out how much they can take
boys will be strong
and boys soldier on
but boys would be gone without warmth from
a womans good good heart

bridge 2
on behalf of every man
looking out for every girl
you are the god and the weight of her world

chorus
so fathers be good to your daughters
daughters will love like you do
girls become lovers who turn into mothers
so mothers be good to your daughters too

outro
so mothers be good to your daughters too
so mothers be good to your daughters too25embed"
