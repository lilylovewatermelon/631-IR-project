ooh yeah
verse 1 corey taylor
i did my time and i want out
so effusive fade it doesnt cut the soul is not so vibrant
the reckoning the sickening
packaging subversion pseudosacrosanct perversion
go drill your deserts go dig your graves
then fill your mouth with all the money you will save
sinking in getting smaller again
im done it has begun im not the only one

chorus corey taylor
and the rain will kill us all
throw ourselves against the wall
but no one else can see
the preservation of the martyr in me

verse 2 corey taylor
there are cracks in the road we laid
but where the temple fell the secrets have gone mad
this is nothing new but when we killed it all
the hate was all we had
who needs another mess we could start over
just look me in the eyes and say im wrong
now theres only emptiness venomous insipid
i think were done im not the only one

and the rain will kill us all
throw ourselves against the wall
but no one else can see
the preservation of the martyr in me
