im in new york thinking of you
wondering what you are up to
from this lonelyass hotel room
with a pretty goodlooking view
i am somewhere in the states
going somewhere on a plane
it doesnt really matter as long as im always far away

verse 1
or maybe on a bus for a month straight
shits fun but im going insane
like its been months since ive had sex
im just a horny little lovesick mess
and i dont wanna be the type of person who calls you up
every time i need to get off but
i guess thats who im turning into oh fuck

chorus
down at times square in the rain
theres a billboard with my face
its so weird how things have changed
think about it every day
if i ever make it back
will i find what we once had
guess i ruined us pretty bad oh
see ​girl in red liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likeverse 2
im in the same city as you
but i still dont come through
cause ive got so much to do
and thats the shittiest excuse
so dont ever take me back
lets just face the fact
i treated you like trash
and you deserve more than that

outro
my love comes out at midnight
my love comes out at midnight
my love comes out at midnight
my love comes out at midnight
my love comes out at midnight2embed"
