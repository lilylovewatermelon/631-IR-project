choke tried to wash you down with something strong
tried but the taste of blood remains taste of blood remains
cold empty mattresses and falling stars
my how they start to look the same

chorus
so keep in happiness and torture me
while i tell you lets go in style
a million hooks around a million ways to die
darling its cold outside

verse 2
no no more eyes to see the sun to see the sun
you slide into bed while i get drunk
slow conversations with a gun mean more
than ive ever said to anyone anyone

chorus
so keep in happiness and torture me
while i tell you lets go in style”
a million hooks around a million ways to die
darling let’s go inside itll be alright

but last night
you said you ended up in palm springs dancing on tables
almost fought some bitch at the club yeah
got kicked out of your hotel and lost your shoes
well fuck what am i supposed to be impressed
youre just another set of bones to lay to rest
i guess its time to say goodnight
hope you had a really good time
good time
