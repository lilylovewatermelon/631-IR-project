so heartless
so heartless

verse 1
say youre goin out late
i count down til you call me
its just one of those things
that you do when youre lonely
and youre all about the chase
but you wont ever let me catch you
and i wish i was the same
but i know im gonna let you
win again and when i do
its gonna hurt like hell
and you dont mean to
thats what i tell myself

chorus
but why you gotta be so heartless
i know you think its harmless
youre tearing me apart and
girl the hardest part is
youre so high on attention
taking miles from inches
leavе me in the darkness
nеver finish what we started
girl why you gotta be so heartless
yeah why you gotta be so heartless

well monday night was definitely not our night
tuesday night was just another fight
wednesday i thought everything would change
thursday came and it was still the same
friday night we went out on the town
saturday we should have burned it down
sunday morning came and now youre gone
i should probably know this shit by now
ah oh
yeah i should probably know this shit by now
but no no

chorus
why you gotta be so heartless
i know you think its harmless
youre tearing me apart and
girl the hardest part is
youre so high on attention
taking miles from inches
leave me in the darkness
never finish what we started
girl why you gotta be so heartless
yeah why you gotta be so heartless

bridge
why you gotta be so in between
loving me and leaving leaving
ah oh
yeah i should probably know this shit by now
but no no
chorus
why you gotta be so heartless
i know you think its harmless
youre tearing me apart and
girl the hardest part is
youre so high on attention
taking miles from inches
leave me in the darkness
never finish what we started
girl why you gotta be so heartless
why you gotta be so heartless
girl why you gotta be so heartless
girl why you gotta be so heartless
