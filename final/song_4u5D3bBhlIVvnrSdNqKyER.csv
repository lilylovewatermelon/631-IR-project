southwest texas big belt buckle
west virginia homemade whiskey
send it on up to st paul city
float it back down the mississippi

doesnt matter where you are
its the same old stripes
the same old stars
the same old highways cuttin across
the same old moon turnin on and off
canned up chevy at a traffic light
with a pretty girl on a saturday night
and willie nelson singin on the road again
lookin around its good to see
everybody out there keepin it country

broadway nashville pedalsteal
la lights on 18 wheels
ride that sun across the sky
from jackson hole to telluride
and get a little rocky mountain high
doesnt matter where you are
its the same old stripes
the same old stars
the same old highways cuttin across
the same old moon turnin on and off
cammed up chevy at a traffic light
with a pretty girl on a saturday night
and willie nelson singin on the road again
lookin around its good to see everybody out there
keepin it country
see jake owen liveget tickets as low as 138you might also likefrom muscle shows to santa rose
from bakersfield to tullahoma
from baton rouge up to buffalo
anywhere that you might call home

doesnt matter where you are
its the same old stripes
the same old stars
the same old highways cuttin across
the same old moon turnin on and off
cammed up chevy at a traffic light
with a pretty girl on a saturday night
and willie nelson singin on the road again
lookin around its good to see everybody out there
keepin it country

everybody out there keepin it country
thank god yall are keepin it country
keepin it country
keepin it countryembed"
