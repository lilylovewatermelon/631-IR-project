sometimes i wanna quit this all and become an accountant now
but im no good at math and besides the dollar is down
plant palm trees on lake michigan before it gets cold
i gotta feel the wind chill again before i get old

prechorus
i wanna scream i love you from the top of my lungs
but im afraid that someone elsell hear me

chorus
you can only blame your problems on the world for so long
before it all becomes the same old song
as soon as we hit the hospital i know were gonna leave this town
and get new passports and get get get get get out now

verse 2
all the yesmen said no comment my mouth got goin
the wrong way and all the calls started snowin
the time my dad caught me a horseshoe crab
and i asked him if throwin it back into the sea would bring our luck back

prechorus
i wanna scream i love you from the top of my lungs
but im afraid that someone elsell hear me
see fall out boy liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likechorus
you can only blame your problems on the world for so long
before it all becomes the same old song
as soon as we hit the hospital i know were gonna leave this town
and get new passports get out now

supra and the prophet are both in the business of souls

prechorus
