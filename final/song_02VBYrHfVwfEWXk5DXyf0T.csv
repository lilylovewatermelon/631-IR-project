verse 1 anderson paak  bruno mars

oh you got plans you got plans
dont say that shut your trap
im sippin wine sip sip in a robe drip drip

just shaved smooth like a newborn
we should be dancin romancin
in the east wing and the west wing
of this mansion whats happenin

every word that i say is coming straight from the heart
so if you tryna lay in these arms

and you want me like i want you tonight baby
