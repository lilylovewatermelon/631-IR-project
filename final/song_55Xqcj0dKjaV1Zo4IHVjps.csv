wasted time and money
honey treatin you like a queen
i might as well have just thrown matches at a tank of gasoline
well it all went up in a ball of flames
yeah girl you torched me good
yeah i got burned and learned that i loved you more than i should

chorus
cause my heart said a long time ago
buddy tuck your tail and run
cause it aint love
when youre stuck on the wrong end of the gun
well you put your finger on that trigger
and you shot me where i stood
i found out the hard way
i loved you more than i should
ooh yeah
more than i should yeah

verse 2
well curse the man who made the sweet perfume that cast the spell
and curse the night that made us kiss beneath the star that fell
and curse the man before me
didnt warn me when he could
and curse me most of all for loving you more than i should

cause my heart said a long time ago
buddy tuck your tail and run
cause it aint love
when youre stuck on the wrong end of the gun
well you put your finger on that trigger
and you shot me where i stood
i found out the hard way
i loved you more than i should
oh more than i should

verse 3
last night i found myself inside the strangest sweetest dream
you were standing arms wide open right in front of me
the closer i moved towards you the further away you stood
i woke up and whispered i loved you more than i should
theyll write on my gravestone
i loved you more than i should

outro
more than i should yeah
ooh
