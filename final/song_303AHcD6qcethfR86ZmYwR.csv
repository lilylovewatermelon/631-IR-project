ya know right now whatever you smoke
right now cuz they ask me and they ask me
and they ask me they ask me

verse 1
now they ask me
how you know so much at 17
what you mean
you never seen a dysfuctional teen
mama cared for me
papa wasnt there for me
older brother sold dope and murph blurr for me
times got hard i had to get harder
let me take that back i had to get smarter
16 i had me a daughter
hold up jkwon lets get shit in order
baby mama thats a whole nother story
both too young both too horney
cell phone rung but i didnt anwser
check my voice mail my grandma got cancer
now she layin up in a old folks home
when it seamed like yesterday she was home
a month later stroke poped up
her brain cells gone
the last thing she said was let no one steer you wrong im grown
you might also likehook repeat 2x
they ask me do i believe in god
so i ask them did i defeat the odds

verse 2
shit fucked up but i cant turn away now
sold dope around the town self esteem way down
jessie made me tougher he boxed me up
my mama put me in the system she locked me up
now this around the time that we lived on hanley
when i think about it i dont know none of my family
except for the immediate ones
thats why i run to the streets and the jennings hand guns
he dont talk much so everybody wanna fight him
every school i went to nobody liked him
never could it be right
id try sometimes
so i chilled by myself and cry sometimes
and all i ask from gods to buy sometime
would i bring his name in it if i was lyin
now look at what the fuck i did done
terry jones last son this is a blessing
im grown
