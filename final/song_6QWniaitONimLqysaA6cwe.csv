i hear the wind across the plain
a sound so strong that calls my name
its wild like the river its warm like the sun
yeah its here this is where i belong

chorus
under the starry skies where eagles have flown
this place is paradise its the place i call home
the moon on the mountains
the whisper through the trees
the waves on the water
let nothing come between this and me

bridge
cause everything i want is everything thats here
and when were all together theres nothing to fear

outro
and wherever i wander the one thing ive learned
its to here i will always always returnsee bryan adams liveget tickets as low as 56you might also likeembed"
