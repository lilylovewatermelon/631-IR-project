is tonight the night
that you take control of me
tell me boy
whats it really gonna be
spending time for a while
daddy come close
im straight up feeling your style
i love the way you make me feel
when you keep it real
when youre holding me
when youre spooning me
when you look sexy
when youre touching me
when youre bumping me gently
sitting here waiting in my vickys
in the mirror imagining youre with me
petit cheri and im smelling real nice
jouet cold chilling on ice
coming over at half past ten
and im wondering if im really gonna let him in
give in get it up let it go
or tell him no

chorus
should i give him some
maybe
is this the night for fun

check it out
here it is and he comes right in
and i fix us drinks and i start to think
about what im gonna do
will a brother be true
will he size my body up and down
can he beat the odds
can he play it safe
will he make me hot
when he hits the spot
that i love a lot
will he leave me hanging lonely desperately
will he go and tell all his friends
that we did it and we did it again
had me weak between the sheets
will he say i was a real big freak
maybe i should slow it down
cool off my flow
relax and let him know if this gets out
no more no glove no love
oh no

chorus
should i give him some
maybe
is this the night for fun
maybe
should i just give him some
maybe
is this the night for fun
maybe
break
maybe
pretty baby
love me
like a lady

bridge
should i say yes or no
should i just let it go
should i slow down my roll
let me think cause i really dont know
dont know what to do about it baby
if i do will i regret it
maybe i should just forget it
what about if he aint got no dough
tell me i should let him go
maybe

chorus
should i give him some
maybe
is this the night for fun
