i can’t believe the things you said
right now i wish that you would try
try to stay near me
try to be near me
before i cry
cause i am gonna need a well
to catch the pain and lift the spell
like you won’t hear me
can you try and hear me

before you lose me too
hurry up hurry up

chorus
cause i’m gonna cry if you say you don’t need me
i’m gonna cry if you act like you don’t care
promise me baby you know i can’t fake it
why don’t you hold me
tell me you love me
before i cry
