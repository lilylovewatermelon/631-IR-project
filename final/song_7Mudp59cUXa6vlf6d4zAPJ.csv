traces of your skin on all the things i found
she keeps her warmth in a little jar
rationing me tastes and its sweet so far

and i got something of a girl back home
we sing sweet nothings through a telephone
sometimes i think its nothing and nothing more
a love thats gotten grand through some romantic metaphor

oh i dont know
its been some years since ive been calm
is it something like a ring of smoke
here but for a moment then gone

and i aint much a swimmer when the waters are rough
i keep myself from hurting when the times get tough
and i been saying hit me and im bound to burst
these days i got no trouble telling love from lust

oh i dont know
its been some years since ive been calm
is it something like a ring of smoke
here but for a moment then gone

sweet unspoken promises ill always sing for june
its when the fields grown fallow that the winter comes too soon
oftentimes she crossed my mind like an old familiar tune
but its so cold that nothing grows but a flower yet to bloom
said its so cold that nothing grows but a flower yet to bloom
its so cold that nothing grows but a flower yet to bloomsee wild rivers liveget tickets as low as 103you might also likeembed"
