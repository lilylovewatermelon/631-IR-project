time for the final bout
rows of deserted houses all
our stablemates highwaybound

verse 2
give us our measly sum
getting the air inside my lungs
is heavenly starting out
with nothing but crippling doubt

bridge
well rest easy
justified

verse 3
suffered a swift defeat
ill endure countless repeats
the gift of memorys an awful curse
with age it just gets much worse

chorus
but i wont mind
i wont mind
i wont mind
i wont mindsee death cab for cutie liveget tickets as low as 147you might also like1embed"
