my maria
dont you know ive come a long long way
i been longin to see her when shes around
she takes my blues away
sweet maria
the sunlight surely hurts my eyes
im a lonely dreamer on a highway in the sky

chorus
my maria oh marie i love you girl oh my maria
maria oh marie i love you girl
maria i love you

verse 2
my maria
there were some blue and sorrow times
just my thoughts about you bring back
my peace of mind
gypsy lady
youre a miracle work for me
you set my soul free like a ship sailing on the sea

bridge
she is the sunlight when the
skies are grey
she treats me so right lady
take me away
