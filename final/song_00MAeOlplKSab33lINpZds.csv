we pray for our fathers
pray for our mothers
wishing our families well
we sing songs for the wishing of those who are kissing
but not for the missing

chorus
so this one’s for all the lost children
this one’s for all the lost children
this one’s for all the lost children wishing them well
and wishing them home

verse 2
when you sit there addressing
counting your blessings
biding your time
when you lay me down sleeping
and my heart is weeping
because im keeping a place

chorus
for all the lost children
this is for all the lost children
this one’s for all the lost children wishing them well
and wishing them home
you might also likebridge
home with their fathers
snug close and warm loving their mothers
i see the door simply wide open
but no one can find thee

chorus
lets pray for all the lost children
let’s pray for all the lost children
just think of all the lost children wishing them well
this is for all the lost children
this one’s for all the lost children
just think of all the lost children
wishing them well and wishing them home

outro
eightyfive ninety ninetyfive one hundred
here i come ready or not
last one into the forest is a rotten apple
its so quiet in the forest
look at all the trees
and all the lovely flowers
its getting dark
we better go home now8embed"
