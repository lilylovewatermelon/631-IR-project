i came along for the ride
you’re wicked with the clutch
happened so fast and it hurt so much
youre a car crash and i cant look away
i should’ve known by now im still not afraid
i do it to myself know it’s what i never say
youre a car crash and i cant look away

prechorus
all i see is shattered glass
and red lights passing my life flashing
headed for the same disaster
faster and faster and faster

chorus
i couldnt stop at the red light
stop at the red light
i couldnt stop at the red light
youre a car crash and i cant look away
