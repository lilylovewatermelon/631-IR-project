nobody move theres blood on the floor
and i cant find my heart
where did it go did i leave it in the cold
so please give it back cause its not yours to take
it mustve fell when i lost my mind
deep in the cut drowning it in pain
somebody help cause i cant find my way
nobody move nobody move

verse 2
somebody tell me how im supposed to feel
when im sitting here knowing this aint real aint real
why in the world would i give my heart to you
just to watch you throw it in the trash
ive been traveling so long i dont think i can hold on
where were you when i needed you the most
now im sitting here with a black hole in my chest
a heartless broken mess
