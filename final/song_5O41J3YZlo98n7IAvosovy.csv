im always in my feelings oh
im always in my feelings
always in my feelings
i said ohoh

verse 1
you aint gotta tell nobody
acting like you know somebody
just had to let you know
im just bad for the soul
and you know im not shit
cause im selfish and it is what it is
and i cant help it creepin on the low
and i be fuckin different hoes

chorus
but you still gon come through come through
come through come through
come through come through
come through
cause you know i got options options
all this talking aint up for discussion
i just be cheating on the low
kickin it with different hoes
invite em to all my shows and you dont even know
no you dont even know
line em up and shoot my shot like motherfuckin free throws

you know i got options
cause im fucked up and im double cupped
and my head hurt and my mind stuck yeah
and you know i got options
cause you in pain and im not
give you everything that i got
got your stomach filled up with knots
throwed like promethazine
i cant keep letting these temptations get the best of me
i seen this cover girl she hopped up out a magazine
and you gon tell me you different but thats okay to me

chorus
but you still gon come through come through
come through come through
come through come through
come through
cause you know i got options options
all this talking aint up for discussion
i just be cheating on the low
kickin it with different hoes
invite em to all my shows and you dont even know
no you dont even know
line em up and shoot my shot like motherfuckin free throws1embed"
