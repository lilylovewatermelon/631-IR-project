chorus
so im just gon put on a sad song
and sit in my room with the lights off
and put on a face that i wont show anyone

and cry out my eyes ’til the nights gone
and put on a face that i won’t show anyone
so dont call me a friend when youre not
so dont call me a friend when you’re not
so dont call me a friend when yourе not
