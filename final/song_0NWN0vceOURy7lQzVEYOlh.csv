when did we become these sinking stones
when did we build this broken home
holding each other like ransom notes
dropping our hearts to grip our brothers throats

prechorus
you cant see because you dont know
youre caught below beneath your own shadow
stuck inside half alive
do you ever stop to ask yourself why
close your mind identify
do you feel do you feel do you call this a life
all you waited for
drowning just to keep score
we always start with good intentions
but lose ourselves along the way

chorus
this is the time that we let it go
these are the words thatll take us home
singing the song thats inside us all
if we dont open our eyes were walking blind

verse 2
anchored in anger we exile ourselves
bitter blood builds our prison cells
darker water now fills our lungs
the depths of our heart have blacked the sun
see nothing more liveget tickets as low as 47you might also likeprechorus

do you ever stop to ask yourself why

we always start with good intentions
but lose ourselves along the way

chorus
this is the time that we let it go
these are the words thatll take us home
singing the song thats inside us all
if we dont open our eyes were walking blind

naked we come naked we leave
fools we are to hold tightly
we are free we are free
we are we are the key we are the jail we are the key yeah

chorus
this is the time that we let it go
yeah these are the words thatll take us home
singing the song thats inside us all
if we just open our eyes if we just open our eyes
this is the time that we let it go
and this is the pain we are forced to know
singing the song thats inside inside us all inside us all
