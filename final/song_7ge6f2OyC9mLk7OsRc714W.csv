cain got a milkeyed mule from the auction abel got a telephone
and even the last of their blueeyed babies know
that the burning man is the color of the end of day
and how every tongue that gets bit always has another word to say

verse 2
cain bought a blade from some witch at the window abel bought a bag of weed
and even the last of their browneyed babies see
that the cartoon king has a tattoo of a bleeding heart
there aint a penthouse christian wants the pain of the scab but they all want the scar
how every mouth sings of what its without so we all sing of love
and how it aint one dog whos good at fucking and denying who hes thinking of

verse 3
cain heard a cat tumble limp off the rooftop abel heard his papa pray
and even the last of the blackeyed babies say
that every saint has a chair you can borrow and a church to sell
that the wind blows cold across the back of the master and the kitchen help
theres a big pile of innocent bones still holding up the garden wall
and it was always the broken hand we learned to lean on after all oh oh oh oh
how god knows if christ came back he would find us in a poker game
after finding out the drugs were all free but they wont let you out the door againsee iron  wine liveget tickets as low as 60you might also likeembed"
