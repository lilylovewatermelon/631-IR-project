this shit feel like a circus
runnin around chasin you down
im hopin that its worth it
cause holdin you up is breakin me down

prechorus
if you want it full time want that daytoday
i got that tiger eye jumpin through the flame
make you feel alive live keep you entertained
aint no bullseye lets get straight to the truth

chorus
you you want want me more than you should know
and i want you its out of my control
i i want want you more than you should know
want want you more than i can say

verse 2
just a fatal attraction
got my heart doin gymnastics
i never feel this magic magic
your sheets pull me like magnets magnets
but i thought i was a savage
i tried to make em disappear
my feelings come to your planet planet
stuck on your lovin like rabbits rabbits
were just elephants in a room
