ive been having a hard time adjusting
i had the shiniest wheels now theyre rusting
i didnt know if youd care if i came back
i have a lot of regrets about that
pulled the car off the road to the lookout
couldve followed my fears all the way down
and maybe i dont quite know what to say
but im here in your doorway

chorus
i just wanted you to know that this is me trying
i just wanted you to know that this is me trying
verse 2
they told me all of my cages were mental
so i got wasted like all my potential
and my words shoot to kill when im mad
i have a lot of regrets about that
i was so ahead of the curve the curve became a sphere
fell behind all my classmates and i ended up here
pouring out my heart to a stranger
but i didnt pour the whiskey

chorus
i just wanted you to know that this is me trying
i just wanted you to know that this is me trying

bridge
and its hard to be at a party when i feel like an open wound
its hard to be anywhere these days when all i want is you
youre a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town

chorus
and i just wanted you to know that this is me trying
and maybe i dont quite know what to say
i just wanted you to know that this is me trying
