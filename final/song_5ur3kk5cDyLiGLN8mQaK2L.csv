staring right back in the face
a memory cant be erased
i know because i tried
start to feel the emptiness
and everything im gonna miss
i know that i cant hide
all this time is passing by

chorus 1
i think its time to just move on

chorus 2
when you come back down
if you land on your feet
i hope you find a way to make it back to me
when you come around
ill be there for you
dont have to be alone with what youre going through

verse 2
start to breathe and fake a smile
its all the same after a while
i know that you are tired
carrying the ones you lost
a picture frame with all the thoughts
i know you hold inside
i hope that you can find your way back
to the place where you belong

when you come back down
if you land on your feet
i hope you find a way to make it back to me
when you come around
ill be there for you
dont have to be alone with what youre going through

verse 3
youre coming back down
you say you feel lost can i help you find it
when you come around
from time to time we all are blinded
youre coming back down
you dont have to tell me what youre feeling
i know what youre going through
i wont be the one that lets go of you

chorus 1
