well youre standin there
you say life aint fair
wont ya tell me somethin i donâ€™t know
oh and man im sunk
redfaced and drunk
but theres a reason i stayed up all night and begged you not to go

chorus
dear i fear weve found ourselves a sticky situation
its an awkward occupation disregarding right from wrong
and you were down on washington dancing like the devil
oh and i am just a fool but i have loved you all along

verse 2
well the everyday
it gets in the way
of all the things that we could be
dont ya understand
that im an honest man
but i would steal you in a heartbeat if the choice were up to me

chorus
dear i fear weve found ourselves a sticky situation
its an awkward occupation disregarding right from wrong
and you were down on washington dancing like the devil
oh and i am just a fool but i have loved you all along

well what happens little baby when i blow this town
and aint nobody like you
got a brand new high and lonesome
its a bad dream comin true
oh whats a poor boy to do

chorus
dear i fear weve found ourselves a sticky situation
its an awkward occupation disregarding right from wrong
and you were down on washington dancing like the devil
oh and i am just a fool but i have loved you all along
