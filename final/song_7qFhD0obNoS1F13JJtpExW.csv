never been in love
cause a girl like me
never had someone to care for
never thought there could be
someone special for me
and now im all in love
cause a girl like me
waited patiently for someone
someone to care for me
and there will never be

chorus
no more lonely no more just me
ive been there before
aint going no more
and now that youre here i
never wanna say goodbye love
never wanna be without you
no more crying no denyin
im in love with you
and now that youre here i
i never wanna say goodbye love

verse 2
now its time for me
to find out what a first time love could mean
little scared but its cool
cause its worth it
now i finally fell in love
and i know that it
gots to be for real
so real
its the way that i feel
so come share my world with me
so there will never be

and now that youre here i

im in love with you
and now that youre here i
i never wanna say goodbye love

bridge
so im standing here
arms open wide
ready to give my heart
im sure this time
loves gonna last for life
baby i know things change
and there might be some rain
but the clouds are gonna fade
and the sun is gonna shine again
shine light on our love baby
so lets make it last forever

chorus
no more lonely no more just me
ive been there before
aint going no more
and now that youre here i
never wanna say goodbye love
never wanna be without you
no more crying no denyin
im in love with you
and now that youre here i
i never wanna say goodbye love1embed"
