the lights are on but youre not home
youve drifted off somewhere alone
somewhere thats safe no questions here
a quiet place where you hide from your fears

chorus
sometimes when youre out of rope
the way to climb back up is clear
the walls you build around yourself
i guess they also keep you here
are you afraid of what they think
whoever they happen to be
or are you hiding from
the scars of your own reality

verse 2
so you sedate and drown in vain
youve got a pill for every day
a suit and tie to mask the truth
its ugly head is starting to show through

chorus
sometimes when youre out of rope
the way to climb back ups unclear
the walls you build around yourself
i guess they also keep you here
are you afraid of what they think
whoever they happen to be
or are you hiding from
the scars of your own reality

the monster youre feeding your lack of perception
the things that you do to fulfill your addictions
the light at the end of your tunnel is closing
what is it that youre so afraid of exposing
youd give it all up for whats theres for the taking
whatever it takes to keep your hands from shaking
the same things youre thinking might make you feel better
the same things that probably got you here

chorus
sometimes when youre out of rope

i guess they also keep you here
