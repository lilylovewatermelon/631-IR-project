once youve found the right doctor
and have told him or her about your pain
dont dont be afraid to take what they give you
often it will be an opioid medication
some patients may be afraid of taking opioids
because theyre percieved as too strong or addictive
but that is far from actual fact
less than one percent of patients taking opioids
actually become addicted
talk my shit north north north
slicky cutthroat north north north
north ayy

verse 1 northside shawty
death addict my mathematics you cant add up
so tragic my baggage comes with no backup
breakin patterns like splittin atoms it aint happenin
cycles spin psychosis wins the world spins
on my motherfuckin dick likе a whirlwind
devilish sins devilish grins got motherfuckеrs like
here we go again this motherfucker scrim
can never stop for nada no too toxic
send his ass off to the doctor
between the xanny and suboxones lost cause lost hope
he a throwawayway way too deep
in this hole where he laylaylay lay me down to sleep
northside shawty ride curb on creep
northside shawty dont pray where he eat
but ayy ayy soon well see
a soulja by the lake buried six feet deep
less stress on me more profit for thee
middle finger pokin out for everyone to come and see
see uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likeinterlude oddy nuff da snow leopard
lately lately lately
lately ive been feelin brainwashed
ayy ayy

verse 2 oddy nuff da snow leopard
lately ive been feelin brainwashed
like my soul was rubbing against the grain lost in the same sauce
i would complain but im wearing diamond chains
cost more than i care to explain uh yeah
lately ive been feelin out of character
bitch left cause i embarrassed her but every day
i be like a thousand fuckin miles away
blowin dope remindin myself im the boss of the grey ayy
boardin the plane what the fuck is a holiday
dreamin through the day what were you saying my mistake
fleeting attention screenshots and mentions
wish i still had an away message forever stressing
live a life in the day this a day in the life
im still the fuckin same covered in spots not stripes
from broke to fuckin paid this the grey59
uicide for life rep it til i fuckin die
