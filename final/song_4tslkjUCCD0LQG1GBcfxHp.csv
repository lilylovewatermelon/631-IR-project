heading for the south lands
looking for some fun
down below that dixie mason
i know your the one
my tongue is chasing my eyes are wide
i can see paradise
i been down here once or twice
but i never seen it look so nice
ahhhhhhhhh yeahhhh
ahhhhhhhhh yeah yeah
i like it with the grass cut low
big mountain tops valley below
i love it when you scream out my name
kid rock what you say
kid rock what you say
kid rock what you say
kid rock yeahh

and ive cried a thousand times over things that i cant change
ive learned a lot you know i grow each passing day
and i blame nobody but myself for mistakes that i have made

and ive spent some lonely nights that did not have to be
