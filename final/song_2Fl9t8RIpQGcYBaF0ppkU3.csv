i know you dont mean to be mean to me
cause when you want to you can make me feel like we belong
we belong
lately you make me feel all i am is a backup plan
i say im done and then you smile at me and i forget
everything i said

prechorus
i buy into those eyes
and into your lies

chorus
you say youll call but i know you
you say youre coming home but i know you
you say youll call but i know you wont
you say youll call but i know you wont

verse 2
i wish you were where youre supposed to be close to me
but here i am just staring at this candle burning out
theres still no sound

prechorus 2
of footsteps on my stairs
or your voice anywhere
