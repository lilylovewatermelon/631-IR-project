oh how you sparkle and oh how you shine
that flush on your cheeks is more than the wine
and he must do something that i didnt do
whatever hes doing it looks good on you

chorus
you look so good in love
you want him thats easy to see
you look so good in love
and i wish you still wanted me

he must have stolen some stars from the sky
and gave them to you to wear in your eyes
i had my chances but i set you free
and now i wonder why i couldnt see

chorus
you look so good in love
you want him thats easy to see
you look so good in love
and i wish you still wanted me
