what youre looking for wont be found easily
it grows upon the mountain in a sacred place
up beyond the clouds in ancient ground so they say
and many men have died trekking up that way
instrumental

verse 2
once hes gazed upon her a man is forever changed
the bravest men return with darkened hearts and phantom pain
ages come and go but her life goes on the same
she lives to see the sun and feel the wind and drink the rain

verse 3
her colors change to mark the passing of the days
no earthly sight can match the beauty she displays
and when i die i want her lying by my side
in my grave in my grave

chorus
id give it all to love that girl
ill be the one to pluck that fleur

verse 4
im meant to find the place where all good things begin
to smell her scent and watch her dancing in the wind
and when i die i want her lying by my side
in my grave in my grave
