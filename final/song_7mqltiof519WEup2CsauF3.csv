you got me all caught up
the way you look tonight
we could head downtown
or i can turn around up here on the right
ah just look at this sky
the rain ain’t far from fallin’ down
and i wanna get to know you
better than i know this little town yes i do

prechorus
i wanna feel your heart go tictoc
while the rain from your hair dripdrops
parked out in the middle of nowhere

chorus
there’s a place i can get up against your lips
that’s where i gotta be with you lookin like this
let’s get lost somewhere
anywhere we ain’t gotta hold back
if we’re gonna go out baby
lets go out like that

verse 2
and i’ll grab your door
you can take my hand
hop up on my shoulders and i’ll walk us over
where we can dance
and i’ll leave the headlights on
so i can see your face
spin you ‘round in the mud
yeah soak it all up baby
