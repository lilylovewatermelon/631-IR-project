yes i look perfect
ice queen thats what you see
its what they all expect from me
but its all show
face it you used me
you saw the sexy clothes
my supermodel pose
what did you know

was i a game to you
was i a way to be cool
i truly cared
was i the fool

its fine for you
its fine to flirt
its fine
till someone gets hurt
till someone gets hurt

feel my heart beating
im just like her or you
people forget im human too
yes they do that
you might also likethis is performance
this is in selfdefense
i thought you had the sense
to see through that

was i too proud with you
was i too cold and forbidding
and you chose her over me
are you kidding

boys
are you kidding

poor little me
all trapped in this fabulous show
you could set me free
but if youre going go
