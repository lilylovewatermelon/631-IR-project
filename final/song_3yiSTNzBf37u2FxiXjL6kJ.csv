i never went to college
i dont have a degree
lets say i went to night school
i learned all i know on the streets
i wasnt born a rich man
i aint got no pedigree
the sweat on this old collar
thats my phd
it comes down to this
i wouldnt exist
without you it aint worth the grind
id fight for one kiss
on a night like this
you make me feel i could fly like

chorus
i could save the world
since the night your love saved me
maybe i cant save the world
but as long as you believe
maybe i could save the world

verse 2
i got to confess
sometimes im a mess
and sometimes i step out of line
like this old tattoo
i aint shiny or new
with you by my side nothing matters

bridge
they can say its blind love
but its a fool who dont believe
that id fly all the way to the moon
just to walk you down your street

chorus
i can save the world
since the night your love saved me
maybe i cant save the world
but as long as you believe
our love is even stronger
than god hoped it could be
baby all it takes is
just a little faith in me
to feel like
i can save the world 2xembed"
