yeah

verse 1
no more of taking this hatred from you
you make me feel dead when im talking to you
youll take me for granted when im not around
so burn all your bridges
cause im not going down down

prechorus
this time i will be heard
im not going to burn
its funny how the table how the table turns

chorus
you fake fake your damnation
you pray pray for salvation
cause your heart is made of stone
you can die and rot alone

verse 2
i hope youre unhappy and hurting inside
i want you to choke when you swallow your pride
lay in your coffin and sleep with your sins
give me the nails and ill hammer them in
