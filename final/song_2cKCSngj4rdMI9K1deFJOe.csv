im through with standing in line to clubs ill never get in
its like the bottom of the ninth and im never gonna win
this life hasnt turned out quite the way i want it to be
tell me what you want
i want a brand new house on an episode of cribs
and a bathroom i can play baseball in
and a king size tub big enough for ten plus me
ah so what you need
ill need a a credit card thats got no limit
and a big black jet with a bedroom in it
gonna join the mile high club at thirtyseven thousand feet
been there done that
i want a new tour bus full of old guitars
my own star on hollywood boulevard
somewhere between cher and james dean is fine for me
so how you gonna do it

prechorus chad kroeger

chorus chad kroeger
cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
and live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
