i can go downtown and drink til dawn
i could sing those sad old country songs
oh but daylight finds me bored and blue
the whole damn towns in love with you

verse 2
well the neon signs light up the block
its a livin breathin honky tonk
and your hairs wet with the morning dew
the whole damn towns in love with you
the whole damn towns in love with you

verse 3
now all the cowboys in this bar
oh and all those fools who play guitar
well theyre well aware that we are through
the whole damn towns in love with you

verse 4
well the music pours out on the street
just as clean and cool as a cotton sheet
well them long and lonesome fiddle blues
the whole damn towns in love with you
the whole damn towns in love with you
see turnpike troubadours liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likeverse 5
well your worn out favorite pair of jeans
oh i remember everything
they were things id grown accustomed to
the whole damn towns in love with you

refrain
the whole damn towns in love with you
well the whole damn towns in love with you
the whole damn towns in love with you
the whole damn towns in love with youembed"
