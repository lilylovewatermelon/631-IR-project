verse 1
hey kid who you lookin at
why you standin all up in my face like that huh
you aint never seen a baseball bat
a maniac knockin on your baseball cap
you better step about ten paces back
or youll be layin where your shoelace is at
go do what your momma told you
and dont be actin like a punk thinkin youre a soldier
i see yourself got a cell phone
i got a number you can dial son make it 911
tell em stop at hefs house on the way kid
pick up some playmates but only if theyre naked
dont know how yall do in yalls city
but round here were gettin down to the nitty gritty
and i hate to put you out like that
but youve been burnin like a fire with a mouth like that

prechorus
take me back to yesterday
rollin dice and getting laid
everything was aokay oh
but now and then a cloud rolls in
rains on my parade and then
talkin this and that again oh
see limp bizkit liveget tickets as low as 14you might also likeverse 2
lets break it down for a minute
and roll it on up in third gear for a minute
i got the 21s rubbin on my benz and
i got girlies in the back seat rubbin on my friends and
i dont really give a fuck about
what these playerhatin pussies give a fuck about
cause im a night ranger never been a stranger
my twoway pager is lookin for some danger
zoolander hit you with the magnum
everybody get your groove on if you have one
and if you aint got it then admit it
its limp bizkit time for you to get it
all around the world in this 45 pr√©vost
everywhere that we go we watch it on the tivo
and now youre layin in the bed you made
drinkin haterade think about it

prechorus
take me back to yesterday
rollin dice and getting laid
everything was aokay oh
but now and then a cloud rolls in
rains on my parade and then
talkin this and that again go
leave
chorus

verse 3
let me guess you aint that impressed
mr halitosis of the breath
livin lifestyles of the wishyouwould
from the back isles of the thriftygood
see i got room to talk kid
ive been layin this track since north cackalack
and the very first day that you fell out the sack
i was in some phat laces spinnin on my back
let me think let me roll let me ride
let me put some funk in the trunk with a vibe
and a memory that can ease your pain
like a melody from kurt cobain
cause ya never know when its all gonna end
and ya never know when youll call on a friend
so you better take a step to prepare yourself
cause the way youre livin now aint good for your health

chorus
thinkin that youre all that and then some
ive got news for you all radio is dead
so youre thinkin that youre all that and then some
man i got news for you all radio is dead
thinkin that youre all that and then some
ive got news for you all radio is dead
so youre thinkin that youre all that and then some
man i got news for you all radio is dead
