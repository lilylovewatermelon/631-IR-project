under the surface you dont know what youll find
hmm until its your time
no second chances but all we can do is try
hmm i made up my mind

i cant see you
but i hear your call
baby hold on now

if we make it or we dont we wont be alone
when i see your light shine i know im home
if youre waiting all your life you wont ever go
when i see your light shine i know im home
when i see your light shine i know im home
when i see your light shine
