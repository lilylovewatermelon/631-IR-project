monday back from the dead
im lettin it go back for another one
tuesday shoot me in the head
im takin it back takin it back ill take it back
wednesday shes lookin for a friend
shell get what she wants cant seem to get enough
thursday its more than i can stand
im holdin her down holdin her down shes down again

chorus
ive gotta find a way to find her
where could she be
four days of the week
she thinks im the enemy

verse 2
one day left me for dead
woke up on the floor time for another one
today shes leavin me again
cant take it no more out through the open door
three days shes found herself a friend
she got what she wants still never get enough
four days shes back with me again
shes pullin me down pullin me down im down again
