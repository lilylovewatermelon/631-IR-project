i was raised off of rural route 3
out past where the blacktop ends
wed walk to church on sunday morning
race barefoot back to the johnsons fence
thats where i first saw mary
on that roadside pickin blackberries
that summer i turned a corner in my soul
down that red dirt road

chorus
its where i drank my first beer
its where i found jesus
where i wrecked my first car
i tore it all to pieces
i learned the path to heaven
is full of sinners and believers
learned that happiness on earth
aint just for high achievers
ive learned ive come to know
theres life at both ends of that red dirt road

verse 2
her daddy didnt like me much
with my shackled up gto
id sneak out in the middle of the night
throw rocks at her bedroom window
wed turn out the headlights
drive by the moonlight
talk about what the future might hold
down that red dirt road

its where i drank my first beer
its where i found jesus
where i wrecked my first car
i tore it all to pieces
i learned the path to heaven
is full of sinners and believers
learned that happiness on earth
aint just for high achievers
ive learned ive come to know
theres life at both ends of that red dirt road

bridge
i went out into the world
and i came back in
i lost mary
oh i got her back again
and driving home tonight
feels like ive found a long lost friend

chorus
its where i drank my first beer
its where i found jesus
where i wrecked my first car
i tore it all to pieces
i learned the path to heaven
is full of sinners and believers
learned that happiness on earth
aint just for high achievers
ive learned ive come to know
theres life at both ends of that red dirt road
outro
yes ive learned ive come to know
theres life at both ends of that red dirt road10embed"
