verse
ayy cut all the fake shit i see through it i see through it
straight with the cartier hit with the louis it hit with my louis
stay with the glock i aint gotta get to it i aint gotta get to it
she in love with my music we fuck to my newest fuck to my newest
burn up her top fore i pass her the boot fore i pass her the stick
cg hit your block with them chops shoot a movie cg on the beat
and ill take your gun if i feel like you wont use it givin it to big30
lil bitch like the light on her face when she chew it like when she chew it
whеn we get the drop wе dont wait we get to it dont wait we get to it
everybody aint gangsta get locked get approved
no im not one of them i was hittin fore music hittin fore music
glock with the fully it twerk when you shoot it blrrrd
they dont post over there blrrrd they know where i come through i get to it
tryna pay to get me killed why you wont come do it come do
get sent out watch how i send you back to em back to em blrrrd blrrrd
yeah yeah back to em blrrrd back to em
f on the chopper play another stack for em stack for em
straight from the hood right to all platforms straight forward
small drac with the wood this a allblack boy
highspeedin on the north cant catch this tour
moncler bubble coat lowtop dior
white wock in my hands tryna get through my pour
dont play with your life ill take it enjoy blrrrd
enjoy play with your life ill take it enjoy blrrrd blrrrd
faceshots to your neck now youre hooked to a cord
im goin to go slide every time i get bored
cant go on no mission no more youll blow it
i give niggas hope im a god in the crib ayy
ayy i give niggas hope in the crib im a god im a lord lets go lets go
beat her back up she gon let me record blrrrd
we spin out a rental get dropped out a ford
far from a beginner i been makin noise
oldschool ak shit came with a sword ayy blrrrd
these the baguettes you cannot afford cannot afford
knock out his spaghetti he leakin like oil
i just sipped two pints but i still want some more some more
