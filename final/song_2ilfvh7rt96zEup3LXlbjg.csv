take off all the makeup girl
shine your light show the world
don’t be shy don’t be scared
you don’t have to hide under there
let’s throw away all the magazines
turn off the static on the tv
wish you could see yourself the way i do

chorus
nobody ever told you
nobody ever told you
you shine like a diamond glitter like gold
and you need to know what nobody ever told you
yeah
la la la la la

verse 2
mirror mirror on the wall
acting like it knows it all
tells you lies of vanity
it doesnt care whats underneath
all hung up on the negative
doesn’t have to be the way it is
wish you could see yourself the way i do
