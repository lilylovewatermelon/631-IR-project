in liquid lines mellifluously bland
and pair their rhymes as venus yokes her doves
they little think what mischief is in hand
the greater their success the worse it proves
as ovids verse may give to understand
even petrarchs self if judged with due severity
is the platonic pimp of all posterity

i therefore do denounce all amorous writing
except in such a way as not to attract
plain—simple—short and by no means inviting
but with a moral to each error tackd
formd rather for instructing than delighting
and with all passions in their turn attackd
now if my pegasus should not be shod ill
this poem will become a moral model

the european with the asian shore
sprinkled with palaces the ocean stream
here and there studded with a seventyfour
sophias cupola with golden gleam
the cypress groves olympus high and hoar
the twelve isles and the more than i could dream
far less describe present the very view
which charmd the charming mary montagu
i have a passion for the name of mary
for once it was a magic sound to me
and still it half calls up the realms of fairy
where i beheld what never was to be
all feelings changed but this was last to vary
a spell from which even yet i am not quite free
but i grow sad—and let a tale grow cold
which must not be pathetically told

the wind swept down the euxine and the wave
broke foaming oer the blue symplegades
t is a grand sight from off the giants grave
to watch the progress of those rolling seas
between the bosphorus as they lash and lave
europe and asia you being quite at ease
there s not a sea the passenger eer pukes in
turns up more dangerous breakers than the euxine

t was a raw day of autumns bleak beginning
when nights are equal but not so the days
the parcae then cut short the further spinning
of seamens fates and the loud tempests raise
the waters and repentance for past sinning
in all who oer the great deep take their ways
they vow to amend their lives and yet they dont
because if drownd they cant—if spared they wont
a crowd of shivering slaves of every nation
and age and sex were in the market ranged
each bevy with the merchant in his station
poor creatures their good looks were sadly changed
all save the blacks seemd jaded with vexation
from friends and home and freedom far estranged
the negroes more philosophy displayd—
used to it no doubt as eels are to be flayd

juan was juvenile and thus was full
as most at his age are of hope and health
yet i must own he looked a little dull
and now and then a tear stole down by stealth
perhaps his recent loss of blood might pull
his spirit down and then the loss of wealth
a mistress and such comfortable quarters
to be put up for auction amongst tartars

were things to shake a stoic neertheless
upon the whole his carriage was serene
his figure and the splendour of his dress
of which some gilded remnants still were seen
drew all eyes on him giving them to guess
he was above the vulgar by his mien
and then though pale he was so very handsome
and then—they calculated on his ransom
like a backgammon board the place was dotted
with whites and blacks in groups on show for sale
though rather more irregularly spotted
some bought the jet while others chose the pale
it chanced amongst the other people lotted
a man of thirty rather stout and hale
with resolution in his dark grey eye
next juan stood till some might choose to buy

he had an english look that is was square
in make of a complexion white and ruddy
good teeth with curling rather dark brown hair
and it might be from thought or toil or study
an open brow a little markd with care
one arm had on a bandage rather bloody
and there he stood with such sangfroid that greater
could scarce be shown even by a mere spectator

but seeing at his elbow a mere lad
of a high spirit evidently though
at present weighd down by a doom which had
oerthrown even men he soon began to show
a kind of blunt compassion for the sad
lot of so young a partner in the woe
which for himself he seemd to deem no worse
than any other scrape a thing of course

my boy said he amidst this motley crew
of georgians russians nubians and what not
all ragamuffins differing but in hue
with whom it is our luck to cast our lot
the only gentlemen seem i and you
so let us be acquainted as we ought
if i could yield you any consolation
t would give me pleasure—pray what is your nation

when juan answerd—spanish he replied
i thought in fact you could not be a greek
those servile dogs are not so proudly eyed
fortune has playd you here a pretty freak
but that s her way with all men till they re tried
but never mind—she ll turn perhaps next week
she has served me also much the same as you
except that i have found it nothing new

pray sir said juan if i may presume
what brought you here—oh nothing very rare—
six tartars and a dragchain—to this doom
but what conducted if the questions fair
is that which i would learn—i served for some
months with the russian army here and there
and taking lately by suwarrows bidding
a town was taen myself instead of widdin

have you no friends—i had—but by gods blessing
have not been troubled with them lately now
i have answerd all your questions without pressing
and you an equal courtesy should show
alas said juan t were a tale distressing
and long besides—oh if t is really so
you re right on both accounts to hold your tongue
a sad tale saddens doubly when t is long

but droop not fortune at your time of life
although a female moderately fickle
will hardly leave you as she s not your wife
for any length of days in such a pickle
to strive too with our fate were such a strife
as if the cornsheaf should oppose the sickle
men are the sport of circumstances when
the circumstances seem the sport of men

t is not said juan for my present doom
i mourn but for the past—i loved a maid
he paused and his dark eye grew full of gloom
a single tear upon his eyelash staid
a moment and then droppd but to resume
t is not my present lot as i have said
which i deplore so much for i have borne
hardships which have the hardiest overworn

on the rough deep but this last blow and here
he stoppd again and turnd away his face
ay quoth his friend i thought it would appear
that there had been a lady in the case
and these are things which ask a tender tear
such as i too would shed if in your place
i cried upon my first wifes dying day
and also when my second ran away

my third—your third quoth juan turning round
you scarcely can be thirty have you three
no—only two at present above ground
surely t is nothing wonderful to see
one person thrice in holy wedlock bound
well then your third said juan what did she
she did not run away too—did she sir
no faith—what then—i ran away from her

you take things coolly sir said juan why
replied the other what can a man do
there still are many rainbows in your sky
but mine have vanishd all when life is new
commence with feelings warm and prospects high
but time strips our illusions of their hue
and one by one in turn some grand mistake
casts off its bright skin yearly like the snake

t is true it gets another bright and fresh
or fresher brighter but the year gone through
this skin must go the way too of all flesh
or sometimes only wear a week or two—
love s the first net which spreads its deadly mesh
ambition avarice vengeance glory glue
the glittering limetwigs of our latter days
where still we flutter on for pence or praise

all this is very fine and may be true
said juan but i really dont see how
it betters present times with me or you
no quoth the other yet you will allow
by setting things in their right point of view
knowledge at least is gaind for instance now
we know what slavery is and our disasters
may teach us better to behave when masters

would we were masters now if but to try
their present lessons on our pagan friends here
said juan—swallowing a heartburning sigh
heaven help the scholar whom his fortune sends here
perhaps we shall be one day by and by
rejoind the other when our bad luck mends here
meantime yon old black eunuch seems to eye us

but after all what is our present state
t is bad and may be better—all mens lot
most men are slaves none more so than the great
to their own whims and passions and what not
society itself which should create
kindness destroys what little we had got
to feel for none is the true social art
of the worlds stoics—men without a heart

just now a black old neutral personage
of the third sex stept up and peering over
the captives seemd to mark their looks and age
and capabilities as to discover
if they were fitted for the purposed cage
no lady eer is ogled by a lover
horse by a blackleg broadcloth by a tailor
fee by a counsel felon by a jailor

as is a slave by his intended bidder
t is pleasant purchasing our fellowcreatures
and all are to be sold if you consider
their passions and are dextrous some by features
are bought up others by a warlike leader
some by a place—as tend their years or natures
the most by ready cash—but all have prices
from crowns to kicks according to their vices

the eunuch having eyed them oer with care
turnd to the merchant and begun to bid
first but for one and after for the pair
they haggled wrangled swore too—so they did
as though they were in a mere christian fair
cheapening an ox an ass a lamb or kid
so that their bargain sounded like a battle
for this superior yoke of human cattle

at last they settled into simple grumbling
and pulling out reluctant purses and
turning each piece of silver oer and tumbling
some down and weighing others in their hand
and by mistake sequins with paras jumbling
until the sum was accurately scannd
and then the merchant giving change and signing
receipts in full began to think of dining

i wonder if his appetite was good
or if it were if also his digestion
methinks at meals some odd thoughts might intrude
and conscience ask a curious sort of question
about the right divine how far we should
sell flesh and blood when dinner has opprest one
i think it is perhaps the gloomiest hour
which turns up out of the sad twentyfour

voltaire says no he tells you that candide
found life most tolerable after meals
he s wrong—unless man were a pig indeed
repletion rather adds to what he feels
unless he s drunk and then no doubt he s freed
from his own brains oppression while it reels
of food i think with philips son or rather
ammons ill pleased with one world and one father

i think with alexander that the act
of eating with another act or two
makes us feel our mortality in fact
redoubled when a roast and a ragout
and fish and soup by some side dishes backd
can give us either pain or pleasure who
would pique himself on intellects whose use
depends so much upon the gastric juice

the other evening t was on friday last—
this is a fact and no poetic fable—
just as my great coat was about me cast
my hat and gloves still lying on the table
i heard a shot—t was eight oclock scarce past—
and running out as fast as i was able
i found the military commandant
stretchd in the street and able scarce to pant

poor fellow for some reason surely bad
they had slain him with five slugs and left him there
to perish on the pavement so i had
him borne into the house and up the stair
and strippd and lookd to—but why should i ad
more circumstances vain was every care
the man was gone in some italian quarrel
killd by five bullets from an old gunbarrel

i gazed upon him for i knew him well
and though i have seen many corpses never
saw one whom such an accident befell
so calm though pierced through stomach heart and liver
he seemd to sleep—for you could scarcely tell
as he bled inwardly no hideous river
of gore divulged the cause that he was dead
so as i gazed on him i thought or said—

can this be death then what is life or death
speak but he spoke not wake but still he slept—
but yesterday and who had mightier breath
a thousand warriors by his word were kept
in awe he said as the centurion saith
go and he goeth come and forth he steppd
the trump and bugle till he spake were dumb—
and now nought left him but the muffled drum

and they who waited once and worshippd—they
with their rough faces throngd about the bed
to gaze once more on the commanding clay
which for the last though not the first time bled
and such an end that he who many a day
had faced napoleons foes until they fled—
the foremost in the charge or in the sally
should now be butcherd in a civic alley

the scars of his old wounds were near his new
those honourable scars which brought him fame
and horrid was the contrast to the view—
but let me quit the theme as such things claim
perhaps even more attention than is due
from me i gazed as oft i have gazed the same
to try if i could wrench aught out of death
which should confirm or shake or make a faith

but it was all a mystery here we are
and there we go—but where five bits of lead
or three or two or one send very far
and is this blood then formd but to be shed
can every element our elements mar
and air—earth—water—fire live—and we dead
we whose minds comprehend all things no more
but let us to the story as before

the purchaser of juan and acquaintance
bore off his bargains to a gilded boat
embarkd himself and them and off they went thence
as fast as oars could pull and water float
they lookd like persons being led to sentence
wondering what next till the caique was brought
up in a little creek below a wall
oertoppd with cypresses darkgreen and tall

here their conductor tapping at the wicket
of a small iron door t was opend and
he led them onward first through a low thicket
flankd by large groves which towerd on either hand
they almost lost their way and had to pick it—
for night was dosing ere they came to land
the eunuch made a sign to those on board
who rowd off leaving them without a word

as they were plodding on their winding way
through orange bowers and jasmine and so forth
of which i might have a good deal to say
there being no such profusion in the north
of oriental plants et cetera
but that of late your scribblers think it worth
their while to rear whole hotbeds in their works
because one poet travelld mongst the turks—

as they were threading on their way there came
into don juans head a thought which he
whisperd to his companion—t was the same
which might have then occurrd to you or me
methinks said he it would be no great shame
if we should strike a stroke to set us free
let s knock that old black fellow on the head
and march away—t were easier done than said

yes said the other and when done what then
how get out how the devil got we in
and when we once were fairly out and when
from saint bartholomew we have saved our skin
tomorrow d see us in some other den
and worse off than we hitherto have been
besides i m hungry and just now would take
like esau for my birthright a beefsteak

we must be near some place of mans abode—
for the old negros confidence in creeping
with his two captives by so queer a road
shows that he thinks his friends have not been sleeping
a single cry would bring them all abroad
t is therefore better looking before leaping—
and there you see this turn has brought us through
by jove a noble palace—lighted too

it was indeed a wide extensive building
which opend on their view and oer the front
there seemd to be besprent a deal of gilding
and various hues as is the turkish wont—
a gaudy taste for they are little skilld in
the arts of which these lands were once the font
each villa on the bosphorus looks a screen
new painted or a pretty operascene

and nearer as they came a genial savour
of certain stews and roastmeats and pilaus
things which in hungry mortals eyes find favour
made juan in his harsh intentions pause
and put himself upon his good behaviour
his friend too adding a new saving clause
said in heavens name lets get some supper now
and then i m with you if you re for a row

some talk of an appeal unto some passion
some to mens feelings others to their reason
the last of these was never much the fashion
for reason thinks all reasoning out of season
some speakers whine and others lay the lash on
but more or less continue still to tease on
with arguments according to their forte
but no one dreams of ever being short

but i digress of all appeals—although
i grant the power of pathos and of gold
of beauty flattery threats a shilling—no
method s more sure at moments to take hold
of the best feelings of mankind which grow
more tender as we every day behold
than that allsoftening overpowering knell
the tocsin of the soul—the dinnerbell

turkey contains no bells and yet men dine
and juan and his friend albeit they heard
no christian knoll to table saw no line
of lackeys usher to the feast prepared
yet smelt roastmeat beheld a huge fire shine
and cooks in motion with their clean arms bared
and gazed around them to the left and right
with the prophetic eye of appetite

and giving up all notions of resistance
they followd close behind their sable guide
who little thought that his own crackd existence
was on the point of being set aside
he motiond them to stop at some small distance
and knocking at the gate t was opend wide
and a magnificent large hall displayd
the asian pomp of ottoman parade

i wont describe description is my forte
but every fool describes in these bright days
his wondrous journey to some foreign court
and spawns his quarto and demands your praise—
death to his publisher to him t is sport
while nature tortured twenty thousand ways
resigns herself with exemplary patience
to guidebooks rhymes tours sketches illustrations

along this hall and up and down some squatted
upon their hams were occupied at chess
others in monosyllable talk chatted
and some seemd much in love with their own dress
and divers smoked superb pipes decorated
with amber mouths of greater price or less
and several strutted others slept and some
prepared for supper with a glass of rum

as the black eunuch enterd with his brace
of purchased infidels some raised their eyes
a moment without slackening from their pace
but those who sate neer stirrd in anywise
one or two stared the captives in the face
just as one views a horse to guess his price
some nodded to the negro from their station
but no one troubled him with conversation

he leads them through the hall and without stopping
on through a farther range of goodly rooms
splendid but silent save in one where dropping
a marble fountain echoes through the glooms
of night which robe the chamber or where popping
some female head most curiously presumes
to thrust its black eyes through the door or lattice
as wondering what the devil a noise that is

some faint lamps gleaming from the lofty walls
gave light enough to hint their farther way
but not enough to show the imperial halls
in all the flashing of their full array
perhaps there s nothing—i ll not say appals
but saddens more by night as well as day
than an enormous room without a soul
to break the lifeless splendour of the whole

two or three seem so little one seems nothing
in deserts forests crowds or by the shore
there solitude we know has her full growth in
the spots which were her realms for evermore
but in a mighty hall or gallery both in
more modern buildings and those built of yore
a kind of death comes oer us all alone
seeing what s meant for many with but one

a neat snug study on a winters night
a book friend single lady or a glass
of claret sandwich and an appetite
are things which make an english evening pass
though certes by no means so grand a sight
as is a theatre lit up by gas
i pass my evenings in long galleries solely
and that s the reason i m so melancholy

alas man makes that great which makes him little
i grant you in a church t is very well
what speaks of heaven should by no means be brittle
but strong and lasting till no tongue can tell
their names who reard it but huge houses fit ill—
and huge tombs worse—mankind since adam fell
methinks the story of the tower of babel
might teach them this much better than i m able

babel was nimrods huntingbox and then
a town of gardens walls and wealth amazing
where nabuchadonosor king of men
reignd till one summers day he took to grazing
and daniel tamed the lions in their den
the peoples awe and admiration raising
t was famous too for thisbe and for pyramus
and the calumniated queen semiramis

that injured queen by chroniclers so coarse
has been accused i doubt not by conspiracy
of an improper friendship for her horse
love like religion sometimes runs to heresy
this monstrous tale had probably its source
for such exaggerations here and there i see
in writing courser by mistake for courier
i wish the case could come before a jury here

but to resume—should there be what may not
be in these days some infidels who dont
because they cant find out the very spot
of that same babel or because they wont
though claudius rich esquire some bricks has got
and written lately two memoirs upont
believe the jews those unbelievers who
must be believed though they believe not you

yet let them think that horace has exprest
shortly and sweetly the masonic folly
of those forgetting the great place of rest
who give themselves to architecture wholly
we know where things and men must end at best
a moral like all morals melancholy
and et sepulchri immemor struis domos
shows that we build when we should but entomb us

at last they reachd a quarter most retired
where echo woke as if from a long slumber
though full of all things which could be desired
one wonderd what to do with such a number
of articles which nobody required
here wealth had done its utmost to encumber
with furniture an exquisite apartment
which puzzled nature much to know what art meant

it seemd however but to open on
a range or suite of further chambers which
might lead to heaven knows where but in this one
the movables were prodigally rich
sofas t was half a sin to sit upon
so costly were they carpets every stitch
of workmanship so rare they made you wish
you could glide oer them like a golden fish

the black however without hardly deigning
a glance at that which wrapt the slaves in wonder
trampled what they scarce trod for fear of staining
as if the milky way their feet was under
with all its stars and with a stretch attaining
a certain press or cupboard niched in yonder—
in that remote recess which you may see—
or if you dont the fault is not in me—

i wish to be perspicuous and the black
i say unlocking the recess pulld forth
a quantity of clothes fit for the back
of any mussulman whateer his worth
and of variety there was no lack—
and yet though i have said there was no dearth
he chose himself to point out what he thought
most proper for the christians he had bought

the suit he thought most suitable to each
was for the elder and the stouter first
a candiote cloak which to the knee might reach
and trousers not so tight that they would burst
but such as fit an asiatic breech
a shawl whose folds in cashmire had been nurst
slippers of saffron dagger rich and handy
in short all things which form a turkish dandy

while he was dressing baba their black friend
hinted the vast advantages which they
might probably attain both in the end
if they would but pursue the proper way
which fortune plainly seemd to recommend
and then he added that he needs must say
t would greatly tend to better their condition
if they would condescend to circumcision

for his own part he really should rejoice
to see them true believers but no less
would leave his proposition to their choice
the other thanking him for this excess
of goodness in thus leaving them a voice
in such a trifle scarcely could express
sufficiently he said his approbation
of all the customs of this polishd nation

for his own share—he saw but small objection
to so respectable an ancient rite
and after swallowing down a slight refection
for which he ownd a present appetite
he doubted not a few hours of reflection
would reconcile him to the business quite
will it said juan sharply strike me dead
but they as soon shall circumcise my head

cut off a thousand heads before—now pray
replied the other do not interrupt
you put me out in what i had to say
sir—as i said as soon as i have supt
i shall perpend if your proposal may
be such as i can properly accept
provided always your great goodness still
remits the matter to our own freewill

baba eyed juan and said be so good
as dress yourself and pointed out a suit
in which a princess with great pleasure would
array her limbs but juan standing mute
as not being in a masquerading mood
gave it a slight kick with his christian foot
and when the old negro told him to get ready
replied old gentleman i m not a lady

what you may be i neither know nor care
said baba but pray do as i desire
i have no more time nor many words to spare
at least said juan sure i may enquire
the cause of this odd travesty—forbear
said baba to be curious t will transpire
no doubt in proper place and time and season
i have no authority to tell the reason

then if i do said juan i ll be—hold
rejoind the negro pray be not provoking
this spirit s well but it may wax too bold
and you will find us not top fond of joking
what sir said juan shall it eer be told
that i unsexd my dress but baba stroking
the things down said incense me and i call
those who will leave you of no sex at all

i offer you a handsome suit of clothes
a womans true but then there is a cause
why you should wear them—what though my soul loathes
the effeminate garb—thus after a short pause
sighd juan muttering also some slight oaths
what the devil shall i do with all this gauze
thus he profanely termd the finest lace
which eer set off a marriagemorning face

and then he swore and sighing on he slippd
a pair of trousers of fleshcolourd silk
next with a virgin zone he was equippd
which girt a slight chemise as white as milk
but tugging on his petticoat he trippd
which—as we say—or as the scotch say whilk
the rhyme obliges me to this sometimes
monarchs are less imperative than rhymes—

whilk which or what you please was owing to
his garments novelty and his being awkward
and yet at last he managed to get through
his toilet though no doubt a little backward
the negro baba helpd a little too
when some untoward part of raiment stuck hard
and wrestling both his arms into a gown
he paused and took a survey up and down

one difficulty still remaind—his hair
was hardly long enough but baba found
so many false long tresses all to spare
that soon his head was most completely crownd
after the manner then in fashion there
and this addition with such gems was bound
as suited the ensemble of his toilet
while baba made him comb his head and oil it

and now being femininely all arrayd
with some small aid from scissors paint and tweezers
he lookd in almost all respects a maid
and baba smilingly exclaimd you see sirs
a perfect transformation here displayd
and now then you must come along with me sirs
that is—the lady clapping his hands twice
four blacks were at his elbow in a trice

you sir said baba nodding to the one
will please to accompany those gentlemen
to supper but you worthy christian nun
will follow me no trifling sir for when
i say a thing it must at once be done
what fear you think you this a lions den
why t is a palace where the truly wise
anticipate the prophets paradise

you fool i tell you no one means you harm
so much the better juan said for them
else they shall feel the weight of this my arm
which is not quite so light as you may deem
i yield thus far but soon will break the charm
if any take me for that which i seem
so that i trust for everybodys sake
that this disguise may lead to no mistake

blockhead come on and see quoth baba while
don juan turning to his comrade who
though somewhat grieved could scarce forbear a smile
upon the metamorphosis in view—
farewell they mutually exclaimd this soil
seems fertile in adventures strange and new
one s turnd half mussulman and one a maid
by this old black enchanters unsought aid

farewell said juan should we meet no more
i wish you a good appetite—farewell
replied the other though it grieves me sore
when we next meet we ll have a tale to tell
we needs must follow when fate puts from shore
keep your good name though eve herself once fell
nay quoth the maid the sultans self shant carry me
unless his highness promises to marry me

and thus they parted each by separate doors
baba led juan onward room by room
through glittering galleries and oer marble floors
till a gigantic portal through the gloom
haughty and huge along the distance lowers
and wafted far arose a rich perfume
it seemd as though they came upon a shrine
for all was vast still fragrant and divine

the giant door was broad and bright and high
of gilded bronze and carved in curious guise
warriors thereon were battling furiously
here stalks the victor there the vanquishd lies
there captives led in triumph droop the eye
and in perspective many a squadron flies
it seems the work of times before the line
of rome transplanted fell with constantine

this massy portal stood at the wide close
of a huge hall and on its either side
two little dwarfs the least you could suppose
were sate like ugly imps as if allied
in mockery to the enormous gate which rose
oer them in almost pyramidic pride
the gate so splendid was in all its features
you never thought about those little creatures

until you nearly trod on them and then
you started back in horror to survey
the wondrous hideousness of those small men
whose colour was not black nor white nor grey
but an extraneous mixture which no pen
can trace although perhaps the pencil may
they were misshapen pigmies deaf and dumb—
monsters who cost a no less monstrous sum

their duty was—for they were strong and though
they lookd so little did strong things at times—
to ope this door which they could really do
the hinges being as smooth as rogers rhymes
and now and then with tough strings of the bow
as is the custom of those eastern climes
to give some rebel pacha a cravat
for mutes are generally used for that

they spoke by signs—that is not spoke at all
and looking like two incubi they glared
as baba with his fingers made them fall
to heaving back the portal folds it scared
juan a moment as this pair so small
with shrinking serpent optics on him stared
it was as if their little looks could poison
or fascinate whomeer they fixd their eyes on

before they enterd baba paused to hint
to juan some slight lessons as his guide
if you could just contrive he said to stint
that somewhat manly majesty of stride
t would be as well and though there s not much in t
to swing a little less from side to side
which has at times an aspect of the oddest—
and also could you look a little modest

t would be convenient for these mutes have eyes
like needles which may pierce those petticoats
and if they should discover your disguise
you know how near us the deep bosphorus floats
and you and i may chance ere morning rise
to find our way to marmora without boats
stitchd up in sacks—a mode of navigation
a good deal practised here upon occasion

with this encouragement he led the way
into a room still nobler than the last
a rich confusion formd a disarray
in such sort that the eye along it cast
could hardly carry anything away
object on object flashd so bright and fast
a dazzling mass of gems and gold and glitter
magnificently mingled in a litter

wealth had done wonders—taste not much such things
occur in orient palaces and even
in the more chastend domes of western kings
of which i have also seen some six or seven
where i cant say or gold or diamond flings
great lustre there is much to be forgiven
groups of bad statues tables chairs and pictures
on which i cannot pause to make my strictures

in this imperial hall at distance lay
under a canopy and there reclined
quite in a confidential queenly way
a lady baba stoppd and kneeling signd
to juan who though not much used to pray
knelt down by instinct wondering in his mind
what all this meant while baba bowd and bended
his head until the ceremony ended

the lady rising up with such an air
as venus rose with from the wave on them
bent like an antelope a paphian pair
of eyes which put out each surrounding gem
and raising up an arm as moonlight fair
she signd to baba who first kissd the hem
of her deep purple robe and speaking low
pointed to juan who remaind below

her presence was as lofty as her state
her beauty of that overpowering kind
whose force description only would abate
i d rather leave it much to your own mind
than lessen it by what i could relate
of forms and features it would strike you blind
could i do justice to the full detail
so luckily for both my phrases fail

thus much however i may add—her years
were ripe they might make sixandtwenty springs
but there are forms which time to touch forbears
and turns aside his scythe to vulgar things
such as was marys queen of scots true—tears
and love destroy and sapping sorrow wrings
charms from the charmer yet some never grow
ugly for instance—ninon de lenclos

she spake some words to her attendants who
composed a choir of girls ten or a dozen
and were all clad alike like juan too
who wore their uniform by baba chosen
they formd a very nymphlike looking crew
which might have calld dianas chorus cousin
as far as outward show may correspond
i wont be bail for anything beyond

they bowd obeisance and withdrew retiring
but not by the same door through which came in
baba and juan which last stood admiring
at some small distance all he saw within
this strange saloon much fitted for inspiring
marvel and praise for both or none things win
and i must say i neer could see the very
great happiness of the nil admirari

not to admire is all the art i know
plain truth dear murray needs few flowers of speech
to make men happy or to keep them so
so take it in the very words of creech—
thus horace wrote we all know long ago
and thus pope quotes the precept to reteach
from his translation but had none admired
would pope have sung or horace been inspired

baba when all the damsels were withdrawn
motiond to juan to approach and then
a second time desired him to kneel down
and kiss the ladys foot which maxim when
he heard repeated juan with a frown
drew himself up to his full height again
and said it grieved him but he could not stoop
to any shoe unless it shod the pope

baba indignant at this illtimed pride
made fierce remonstrances and then a threat
he mutterd but the last was given aside
about a bowstring—quite in vain not yet
would juan bend though t were to mahomets bride
there s nothing in the world like etiquette
in kingly chambers or imperial halls
as also at the race and county balls

he stood like atlas with a world of words
about his ears and nathless would not bend
the blood of all his line s castilian lords
boild in his veins and rather than descend
to stain his pedigree a thousand swords
a thousand times of him had made an end
at length perceiving the foot could not stand
baba proposed that he should kiss the hand

here was an honourable compromise
a halfway house of diplomatic rest
where they might meet in much more peaceful guise
and juan now his willingness exprest
to use all fit and proper courtesies
adding that this was commonest and best
for through the south the custom still commands
the gentleman to kiss the ladys hands

and he advanced though with but a bad grace
though on more thoroughbred or fairer fingers
no lips eer left their transitory trace
on such as these the lip too fondly lingers
and for one kiss would fain imprint a brace
as you will see if she you love shall bring hers
in contact and sometimes even a fair strangers
an almost twelvemonths constancy endangers

the lady eyed him oer and oer and bade
baba retire which he obeyd in style
as if well used to the retreating trade
and taking hints in good part all the while
he whisperd juan not to be afraid
and looking on him with a sort of smile
took leave with such a face of satisfaction
as good men wear who have done a virtuous action

when he was gone there was a sudden change
i know not what might be the ladys thought
but oer her bright brow flashd a tumult strange
and into her dear cheek the blood was brought
bloodred as sunset summer clouds which range
the verge of heaven and in her large eyes wrought
a mixture of sensations might be scannd
of half voluptuousness and half command

her form had all the softness of her sex
her features all the sweetness of the devil
when he put on the cherub to perplex
eve and paved god knows how the road to evil
the sun himself was scarce more free from specks
than she from aught at which the eye could cavil
yet somehow there was something somewhere wanting
as if she rather orderd than was granting

something imperial or imperious threw
a chain oer all she did that is a chain
was thrown as t were about the neck of you—
and raptures self will seem almost a pain
with aught which looks like despotism in view
our souls at least are free and t is in vain
we would against them make the flesh obey—
the spirit in the end will have its way

her very smile was haughty though so sweet
her very nod was not an inclination
there was a selfwill even in her small feet
as though they were quite conscious of her station—
they trod as upon necks and to complete
her state it is the custom of her nation
a poniard deckd her girdle as the sign
she was a sultans bride thank heaven not mine

to hear and to obey had been from birth
the law of all around her to fulfill
all phantasies which yielded joy or mirth
had been her slaves chief pleasure as her will
her blood was high her beauty scarce of earth
judge then if her caprices eer stood still
had she but been a christian i ve a notion
we should have found out the perpetual motion

whateer she saw and coveted was brought
whateer she did not see if she supposed
it might be seen with diligence was sought
and when t was found straightway the bargain closed
there was no end unto the things she bought
nor to the trouble which her fancies caused
yet even her tyranny had such a grace
the women pardond all except her face

juan the latest of her whims had caught
her eye in passing on his way to sale
she orderd him directly to be bought
and baba who had neer been known to fail
in any kind of mischief to be wrought
at all such auctions knew how to prevail
she had no prudence but he had and this
explains the garb which juan took amiss

his youth and features favourd the disguise
and should you ask how she a sultans bride
could risk or compass such strange phantasies
this i must leave sultanas to decide
emperors are only husbands in wives eyes
and kings and consorts oft are mystified
as we may ascertain with due precision
some by experience others by tradition

but to the main point where we have been tending—
she now conceived all difficulties past
and deemd herself extremely condescending
when being made her property at last
without more preface in her blue eyes blending
passion and power a glance on him she cast
and merely saying christian canst thou love
conceived that phrase was quite enough to move

and so it was in proper time and place
but juan who had still his mind oerflowing
with haidees isle and soft ionian face
felt the warm blood which in his face was glowing
rush back upon his heart which filld apace
and left his cheeks as pale as snowdrops blowing
these words went through his soul like arabspears
so that he spoke not but burst into tears

she was a good deal shockd not shockd at tears
for women shed and use them at their liking
but there is something when mans eye appears
wet still more disagreeable and striking
a womans teardrop melts a mans half sears
like molten lead as if you thrust a pike in
his heart to force it out for to be shorter
to them t is a relief to us a torture

and she would have consoled but knew not how
having no equals nothing which had eer
infected her with sympathy till now
and never having dreamt what t was to bear
aught of a serious sorrowing kind although
there might arise some pouting petty care
to cross her brow she wonderd how so near
her eyes anothers eye could shed a tear

but nature teaches more than power can spoil
and when a strong although a strange sensation
moves—female hearts are such a genial soil
for kinder feelings whatsoeer their nation
they naturally pour the wine and oil
samaritans in every situation
and thus gulbeyaz though she knew not why
felt an odd glistening moisture in her eye

but tears must stop like all things else and soon
juan who for an instant had been moved
to such a sorrow by the intrusive tone
of one who dared to ask if he had loved
calld back the stoic to his eyes which shone
bright with the very weakness he reproved
and although sensitive to beauty he
felt most indignant still at not being free

gulbeyaz for the first time in her days
was much embarrassd never having met
in all her life with aught save prayers and praise
and as she also riskd her life to get
him whom she meant to tutor in loves ways
into a comfortable teteatete
to lose the hour would make her quite a martyr
and they had wasted now almost a quarter

i also would suggest the fitting time
to gentlemen in any such like case
that is to say in a meridian clime—
with us there is more law given to the chase
but here a small delay forms a great crime
so recollect that the extremest grace
is just two minutes for your declaration—
a moment more would hurt your reputation

juans was good and might have been still better
but he had got haidee into his head
however strange he could not yet forget her
which made him seem exceedingly illbred
gulbeyaz who lookd on him as her debtor
for having had him to her palace led
began to blush up to the eyes and then
grow deadly pale and then blush back again

at length in an imperial way she laid
her hand on his and bending on him eyes
which needed not an empire to persuade
lookd into his for love where none replies
her brow grew black but she would not upbraid
that being the last thing a proud woman tries
she rose and pausing one chaste moment threw
herself upon his breast and there she grew

this was an awkward test as juan found
but he was steeld by sorrow wrath and pride
with gentle force her white arms he unwound
and seated her all drooping by his side
then rising haughtily he glanced around
and looking coldly in her face he cried
the prisond eagle will not pair nor
serve a sultanas sensual phantasy

thou askst if i can love be this the proof
how much i have loved—that i love not thee
in this vile garb the distaff web and woof
were fitter for me love is for the free
i am not dazzled by this splendid roof
whateer thy power and great it seems to be
heads bow knees bend eyes watch around a throne
and hands obey—our hearts are still our own

this was a truth to us extremely trite
not so to her who neer had heard such things
she deemd her least command must yield delight
earth being only made for queens and kings
if hearts lay on the left side or the right
she hardly knew to such perfection brings
legitimacy its born votaries when
aware of their due royal rights oer men

besides as has been said she was so fair
as even in a much humbler lot had made
a kingdom or confusion anywhere
and also as may be presumed she laid
some stress on charms which seldom are if eer
by their possessors thrown into the shade
she thought hers gave a double right divine
and half of that opinion s also mine

remember or if you can not imagine
ye who have kept your chastity when young
while some more desperate dowager has been waging
love with you and been in the dogdays stung
by your refusal recollect her raging
or recollect all that was said or sung
on such a subject then suppose the face
of a young downright beauty in this case

suppose—but you already have supposed
the spouse of potiphar the lady booby
phaedra and all which story has disclosed
of good examples pity that so few by
poets and private tutors are exposed
to educate—ye youth of europe—you by
but when you have supposed the few we know
you cant suppose gulbeyaz angry brow

a tigress robbd of young a lioness
or any interesting beast of prey
are similes at hand for the distress
of ladies who can not have their own way
but though my turn will not be served with less
these dont express one half what i should say
for what is stealing young ones few or many
to cutting short their hopes of having any

the love of offspring s natures general law
from tigresses and cubs to ducks and ducklings
there s nothing whets the beak or arms the claw
like an invasion of their babes and sucklings
and all who have seen a human nursery saw
how mothers love their childrens squalls and chucklings
this strong extreme effect to tire no longer
your patience shows the cause must still be stronger

if i said fire flashd from gulbeyaz eyes
t were nothing—for her eyes flashd always fire
or said her cheeks assumed the deepest dyes
i should but bring disgrace upon the dyer
so supernatural was her passions rise
for neer till now she knew a checkd desire
even ye who know what a checkd woman is
enough god knows would much fall short of this

her rage was but a minutes and t was well—
a moments more had slain her but the while
it lasted t was like a short glimpse of hell
nought s more sublime than energetic bile
though horrible to see yet grand to tell
like ocean warring gainst a rocky isle
and the deep passions flashing through her form
made her a beautiful embodied storm

a vulgar tempest t were to a typhoon
to match a common fury with her rage
and yet she did not want to reach the moon
like moderate hotspur on the immortal page
her anger pitchd into a lower tune
perhaps the fault of her soft sex and age—
her wish was but to kill kill kill like lears
and then her thirst of blood was quenchd in tears

a storm it raged and like the storm it passd
passd without words—in fact she could not speak
and then her sexs shame broke in at last
a sentiment till then in her but weak
but now it flowd in natural and fast
as water through an unexpected leak
for she felt humbled—and humiliation
is sometimes good for people in her station

it teaches them that they are flesh and blood
it also gently hints to them that others
although of clay are yet not quite of mud
that urns and pipkins are but fragile brothers
and works of the same pottery bad or good
though not all born of the same sires and mothers
it teaches—heaven knows only what it teaches
but sometimes it may mend and often reaches

her first thought was to cut off juans head
her second to cut only his—acquaintance
her third to ask him where he had been bred
her fourth to rally him into repentance
her fifth to call her maids and go to bed
her sixth to stab herself her seventh to sentence
the lash to baba—but her grand resource
was to sit down again and cry of course

she thought to stab herself but then she had
the dagger close at hand which made it awkward
for eastern stays are little made to pad
so that a poniard pierces if t is stuck hard
she thought of killing juan—but poor lad
though he deserved it well for being so backward
the cutting off his head was not the art
most likely to attain her aim—his heart

juan was moved he had made up his mind
to be impaled or quarterd as a dish
for dogs or to be slain with pangs refined
or thrown to lions or made baits for fish
and thus heroically stood resignd
rather than sin—except to his own wish
but all his great preparatives for dying
dissolved like snow before a woman crying

as through his palms bob acres valour oozed
so juans virtue ebbd i know not how
and first he wonderd why he had refused
and then if matters could be made up now
and next his savage virtue he accused
just as a friar may accuse his vow
or as a dame repents her of her oath
which mostly ends in some small breach of both

so he began to stammer some excuses
but words are not enough in such a matter
although you borrowd all that eer the muses
have sung or even a dandys dandiest chatter
or all the figures castlereagh abuses
just as a languid smile began to flatter
his peace was making but before he ventured
further old baba rather briskly enterd

bride of the sun and sister of the moon
t was thus he spake and empress of the earth
whose frown would put the spheres all out of tune
whose smile makes all the planets dance with mirth
your slave brings tidings—he hopes not too soon—
which your sublime attention may be worth
the sun himself has sent me like a ray
to hint that he is coming up this way

is it exclaimd gulbeyaz as you say
i wish to heaven he would not shine till morning
but bid my women form the milky way
hence my old comet give the stars due warning—
and christian mingle with them as you may
and as you d have me pardon your past scorning
here they were interrupted by a humming
sound and then by a cry the sultan s coming

first came her damsels a decorous file
and then his highness eunuchs black and white
the train might reach a quarter of a mile
his majesty was always so polite
as to announce his visits a long while
before he came especially at night
for being the last wife of the emperour
she was of course the favorite of the four

his highness was a man of solemn port
shawld to the nose and bearded to the eyes
snatchd from a prison to preside at court
his lately bowstrung brother caused his rise
he was as good a sovereign of the sort
as any mentiond in the histories
of cantemir or knolles where few shine
save solyman the glory of their line

he went to mosque in state and said his prayers
with more than oriental scrupulosity
he left to his vizier all state affairs
and showd but little royal curiosity
i know not if he had domestic cares—
no process proved connubial animosity
four wives and twice five hundred maids unseen
were ruled as calmly as a christian queen

if now and then there happend a slight slip
little was heard of criminal or crime
the story scarcely passd a single lip—
the sack and sea had settled all in time
from which the secret nobody could rip
the public knew no more than does this rhyme
no scandals made the daily press a curse—
morals were better and the fish no worse

he saw with his own eyes the moon was round
was also certain that the earth was square
because he had journeyd fifty miles and found
no sign that it was circular anywhere
his empire also was without a bound
t is true a little troubled here and there
by rebel pachas and encroaching giaours
but then they never came to the seven towers

except in shape of envoys who were sent
to lodge there when a war broke out according
to the true law of nations which neer meant
those scoundrels who have never had a sword in
their dirty diplomatic hands to vent
their spleen in making strife and safely wording
their lies yclepd despatches without risk or
the singeing of a single inky whisker

he had fifty daughters and four dozen sons
of whom all such as came of age were stowd
the former in a palace where like nuns
they lived till some bashaw was sent abroad
when she whose turn it was was wed at once
sometimes at six years old—though it seems odd
t is true the reason is that the bashaw
must make a present to his sire in law

his sons were kept in prison till they grew
of years to fill a bowstring or the throne
one or the other but which of the two
could yet be known unto the fates alone
meantime the education they went through
was princely as the proofs have always shown
so that the heir apparent still was found
no less deserving to be hangd than crownd

his majesty saluted his fourth spouse
with all the ceremonies of his rank
who cleard her sparkling eyes and smoothd her brows
as suits a matron who has playd a prank
these must seem doubly mindful of their vows
to save the credit of their breaking bank
to no men are such cordial greetings given
as those whose wives have made them fit for heaven

his highness cast around his great black eyes
and looking as he always lookd perceived
juan amongst the damsels in disguise
at which he seemd no whit surprised nor grieved
but just remarkd with air sedate and wise
while still a fluttering sigh gulbeyaz heaved
i see you ve bought another girl t is pity
that a mere christian should be half so pretty

this compliment which drew all eyes upon
the newbought virgin made her blush and shake
her comrades also thought themselves undone
o mahomet that his majesty should take
such notice of a giaour while scarce to one
of them his lips imperial ever spake
there was a general whisper toss and wriggle
but etiquette forbade them all to giggle

the turks do well to shut—at least sometimes—
the women up because in sad reality
their chastity in these unhappy climes
is not a thing of that astringent quality
which in the north prevents precocious crimes
and makes our snow less pure than our morality
the sun which yearly melts the polar ice
has quite the contrary effect on vice

thus in the east they are extremely strict
and wedlock and a padlock mean the same
excepting only when the former s pickd
it neer can be replaced in proper frame
spoilt as a pipe of claret is when prickd
but then their own polygamy s to blame
why dont they knead two virtuous souls for life
into that moral centaur man and wife

thus far our chronicle and now we pause
though not for want of matter but t is time
according to the ancient epic laws
to slacken sail and anchor with our rhyme
let this fifth canto meet with due applause
the sixth shall have a touch of the sublime
meanwhile as homer sometimes sleeps perhaps
you ll pardon to my muse a few short napsembed"
