im taking over my body back in control no more shotty
i bet a lot of me was lost ts uncrossed and is undotted
i fought it a lot and it seems a lot like flesh is all i got
not anymore flesh out the door swat
i mustve forgot you cant trust me
im open a moment and close when you show it
before you know it im lost at sea
and now that i write and think about it and the story unfolds
you should take my life you should take my soul

you are surrounding all my surroundings
sounding down the mountain range of my leftside brain
you are surrounding all my surroundings
twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes

remember the moment you know exactly where youre goin
cause the next moment before you know it
time is slowin and its frozen still
and the windowsill looks really nice right
you think twice about your life it probably happens at night right
fight it take the pain ignite it
tie a noose around your mind loose enough to breathe fine
and tie it to a tree tell it you belong to me
this aint a noose this is a leash
and i have news for you you must obey me

chorus
you are surrounding all my surroundings
sounding down the mountain range of my leftside brain
you are surrounding all my surroundings
twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes

bridge
entertain my faith entertain my faith
entertain my faith entertain my faith
entertain my faith entertain my faith
entertain my faith entertain my faith
entertain my faith entertain my faith

lean with it rock with it when we gonna stop with it
lyrics that mean nothin we were gifted with thought
is it time to move our feet to an introspective beat
it aint the speakers that bump hearts its our hearts that make the beat
lean with it rock with it when we gonna stop with it
lyrics that mean nothin we were gifted with thought
is it time to move our feet to an introspective beat
it aint the speakers that bump hearts its our hearts that make the beat
lean with it rock with it when we gonna stop with it
lyrics that mean nothin we were gifted with thought
is it time to move our feet to an introspective beat
it aint the speakers that bump hearts its our hearts that make the beat
lean with it rock with it when we gonna stop with it
lyrics that mean nothin we were gifted with thought
is it time to move our feet to an introspective beat
it aint the speakers that bump hearts and its our hearts that make the beat
