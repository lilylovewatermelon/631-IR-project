five card with the fellas on a friday night
one hit a little trip to get us feeling right
boom boom coming hot out the tubes
talking big game like us boys do

then those hazel eyes fire the light
on the eye five now im throwing deuces
im gone fellas catch you on the flip side
they give me hell like what the hell
man you always bounce with poor excuses
but im out the door hauling ass to you and ninetyfive

chorus
i ride swinging dust in my truck cant get to you quick enough
tonight its you and me baby girl getting lost in our own world
the way you looking fine the way your skins on mine
were on fire damn girl you bout to blow my mind
tangling in these sheets you lock them eyes on me
beats a beer with the boys any night of the week

verse 2
girl why you laughing ive told this joke a thousand times
but dont you dare stop you know i love to hear your smile
laying you down feels so right nothing better than you by my side
yeah then you give me hell for a smell a high life on my breath
i say come on now you knew id be right here
i was up a hundred bucks when you hit me with that text
folded on a full house and threw my truck in fifth gear
see chase rice liveget tickets as low as 109you might also likechorus
i ride swinging dust in my truck cant get to you quick enough
tonight its you and me baby girl getting lost in our own world
the way you looking fine the way your skins on mine
were on fire damn girl you bout to blow my mind
tangling in these sheets you lock them eyes on me
beats a beer with the boys any night of the week
yeah hanging with them is a damn good time
but its got nothing on what what im seeing tonight
so i ride swinging dust in my truck cant get to you quick enough
tonight its you and me baby girl getting lost in our own world
the way you looking fine the way your skins on mine
were on fire damn girl you bout to blow my mind
tangling in these sheets you lock them eyes on me
beats a beer with the boys any night of the weekembed"
