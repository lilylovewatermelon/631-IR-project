verse 1 matisyahu
papa he was gone tryna make a dime

i was busy building up a reputation
did a lot of things out of desperation
back up on my feet got the motivation
now i found my faith and a good vibration

prechorus matisyahu
search for you love of creation
when youre feeling down in this place just replace them
keep a vision on the one youve been chasing
when the time comes well run to the station
weve been laced with the powers of creation
so when the sun sets you bet you must face them
remember when we were running cross the nation
we were living for the here and now
