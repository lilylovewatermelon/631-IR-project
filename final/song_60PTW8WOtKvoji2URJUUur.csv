do blondes really have more fun
or they just easier to spot in the dark
girl im just trying to cheer you up
i saw you sitting over here all alone
with a broken heart
its hurting you real bad
wish there was something that i had
id hook you up get you through it
you might need a man to hold you till it dont
im just the guy to do it

verse 2
is that your pretty boy standing there
at the end of the bar hes got some nerve
talking loud and drinking with a redhead
riding shotgun on his arm hes such a jerk
i think hes a knucklehead all those ugly things he said
were out of line man he blew it
he might need someone to put him in his place
im just the guy to do it

chorus
baby i cant mend your broken heart
i cant take away your pain
i cant promise you the sun is gonna shine
when youre walking in the rain
but if you need a hero for tonight
i can be the one let me prove it
yeah you just say the magic words
and well be gone im just the guy to do it
you might also likechorus
baby i cant mend your broken heart
and i cant take away your pain
i cant promise you the sun is gonna shine
when youre walking in the rain
oh but if you need a hero for tonight
ill be the one let me prove it
you just say the magic words
and well be gone im just the guy to do it

outro
do blondes really have more fun
or are they just easier to spot in the darkembed"
