the lights go out i am all alone
all the trees outside are buried in the snow
i spend my night dancing with my own shadow
and it holds me and it never lets me go

chorus nanna  ragnar þórhallsson
i move slow and steady
but i feel like a waterfall
yeah i move slow and steady
past the ones that i used to knoow

verse 2 nanna
my dear old friend take me for a spin
two wolves in the dark running in the wind
im letting go but ive never felt better
passing by all the monsters in my head

chorus nanna  ragnar
and i move slow and steady
but i feel like a waterfall
yeah i move slow and steady
past the ones that i used to knoow
