i know its not over
baby i worked this out for sure
its gonna be colder
now youve forced open the door
i know you better
than i ever have before
i know you

verse 2
i know youre a fighter
but you never fought for me
when i was a shelter
cause youre not heading home to me
we could be closer
we could be closer
we could be

prechorus
when its just us you show me what it feels like to be lonely
you show me what it feels like to be lost
i take your hand for you to let it go let it go let it go let it go
when its just us you show me what it feels like to be lonely
you show me what it feels like to be lost
i take your hand for you to let it go let it go let it go let it go

well take a long walk
down the alleys of these houses
and well talk
see what conversation rouses
when were alone
when were alone
it could be home
