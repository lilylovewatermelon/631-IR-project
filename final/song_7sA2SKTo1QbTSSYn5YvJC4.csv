trouble
blood is in the rocky waters
hide away your sons and daughters
eat you alive

better put your head on swivels
dancin with the very devil
butter to knife

you think youre better than them
better than them
you think theyre really your friends
really your friends
but when it comes to the end
to the end
youre just the same as them
same as them ha ha ha ha ha

chorus
so lеt it go let it go
thats the way that it goes
first yourе in then youre out

youre hot then youre cold
youre a light in the dark
just you wait and youll see
