dont wanna live as an untold story
rather go out in a blaze of glory
i cant hear you i dont fear you
i live now cause the bad die last
dodgin bullets with your broken past
well i cant hear you i dont fear you now

wrapped in your regret
what a waste of blood and sweat ohoh oh

i wanna taste love and pain
i wanna feel pride and shame
i dont wanna take my time
i dont wanna waste one line
i wanna live better days
never look back and say
