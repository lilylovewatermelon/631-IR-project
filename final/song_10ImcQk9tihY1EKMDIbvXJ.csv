i built a house for a love to grow
i was so young that it was hard to know
im as lost now as i was back then
always make a mess of everything
its about time that i face myself
all i do is bleed into someone else
painting walls with all my secret tears
filling rooms with all my hopes and fears

prechorus
but oh my
oh my
ill never learn if i never leap
ill always yearn if i never speak

chorus
to be loved and love at the highest count
means to lose all the things i cant live without
let it be known that i will choose to lose
its a sacrifice but i cant live a lie
let it be known let it be known that i tried

verse 2
im so afraid but im open wide
ill be the one to catch myself this time
tryna learn to lean into it all
aint it funny how the mighty fall
looking back i dont regret a thing
yeah i took some bad turns that i am owning
ill stand still and let the storm pass by
keep my heart safe till the time feels right

all because i wanted
