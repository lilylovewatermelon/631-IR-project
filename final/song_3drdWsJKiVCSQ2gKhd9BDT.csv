kendrick made you think about it but he is not your savior
cole made you feel empowered but he is not your savior

bron made you give his flowers but he is not your savior
he is not your savior

verse 1 kendrick lamar  baby keem

bite they tongues in rap lyrics too lowkey
scared to be crucified about a song but they wont admit it too lowkey
politically correct is how you keep an opinion so lowkey
niggas is tightlipped fuck who dare to be different too lowkey
seen a christian say the vaccine mark of the beast too lowkey
then he caught covid and prayed to pfizer for relief too lowkey
then i caught covid and started to question kyrie so lowkey
will i stay organic or hurt in this bed for two weeks too lowkey
you really wanna know do you want peace
how i get so low then watch us in the street
only one way to go one protest for you
higher threesixtyfive for me you really wanna know
vladimir making nightmares how i get so low
but thats how we all think only one way to go
the collective conscious higher
calamities on repeat huh

chorus baby keem kendrick lamar
bitch are you happy for me
milly are you happy for me
you smile in my face but are you happy for me
yeah im out the way are you happy for me
bitch are you happy for me
milly are you happy for me
you smile in my face but are you happy for me
yeah im out the way are you happy for me
bridge kendrick lamar
truth it resides in the fire
the need of its dire
deceiving the lies i know
truth it resides in the fire
the need of its dire
deceiving the lies i know

verse 3 kendrick lamar
the cat is out the bag i am not your savior
i find it just as difficult to love thy neighbors
especially when people got ambiguous favors
but they hearts not in it see everythings for the paper
the struggle for the right side of history
independent thought is like an eternal enemy
capitalists posing as compassionates be offending me
yeah suck my dick with authenticity
yeah tupac dead gotta think for yourself
yeah heroes looking for the villains to help
i never been sophisticated saving face
being manipulative such an acquired taste
i rubbed elbows with people that was for the people
they all greedy i dont care for no public speaking
and they like to wonder where ive been
protecting my soul in the valley of silence38embed"
