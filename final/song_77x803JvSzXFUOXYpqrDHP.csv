he had it hard now he just tellin his story
speak from the heart and i just tell em record me
five was my nigga ever since we was shorties
living lawless we dont respect no authority
my paper straight cant put these hoes for my priorities
im trapped inside cause i dont know who really for me
no i aint trippin i just play this shit accordingly
trapped in the field he got blood on his cleats uh uh uh

verse 1
stickin to my 40 like a velcro strap
dont go tweakin with my shorties or them shells gon clap
swing that red beam leave your head in your lap
my nigga institutionalized in them cell doors trapped
free all them real niggas locked away
still slavery its just modern day
married the game now we partin ways
do it for gang thats the hardest phase
they let it bang yeah them glocksll spray oh
had it hard so my heart kinda heavy and im scarred
cause deep feelings like machete finally made it pourin champagne on my presi
i can only give you my all if you let me uh uh uh

chorus
he had it hard now he just tellin his story
speak from the heart and i just tell em record me
five was my nigga ever since we was shorties
living lawless we dont respect no authority
my paper straight cant put these hoes for my priorities
im trapped inside cause i dont know who really for me
no i aint trippin i just play this shit accordingly
trapped in the field he got blood on his cleats
you might also likeverse 2
and i wonder would the love be the same
if i couldnt make no more hits
i hit the stu all the time with a dream in my eyes
tryna ball like a number one pick
they dont really know bout the nights i cried
just to put this cartier on my wrist
ill give up every last chain just to give my grandma one more kiss
one minute you here then you gone
lotta shit just happen so quick
but as life goes on more niggas just fade away out them pics
lookin back on them times i aint have no luck on my side
i used to wonder how bad it can get
tryna find my place in this world
used to wonder was i ever gon fit
every day high as hell just takin up space on the block
i aint even have no blick
same niggas yellin bro and shit it was jokes and shit
used to laugh when im like shit
like damn ill risk it all for the gang
still be the one niggas wont miss
i was in denial runnin from reality a lotta shit i aint wanna admit no

chorus
he had it hard now he just tellin his story
speak from the heart and i just tell em record me
five was my nigga ever since we was shorties
living lawless we dont respect no authority
my paper straight cant put these hoes for my priorities
im trapped inside cause i dont know who really for me
no i aint trippin i just play this shit accordingly
trapped in the field he got blood on his cleats1embed"
