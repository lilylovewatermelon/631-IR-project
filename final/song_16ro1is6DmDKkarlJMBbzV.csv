wizard on a weekend
willing on a weekday
are you kidding come on
fed up with the prepay
looking for a keepsake
im no emerald liar
dying for a card up my sleeve
im the gambling kind
for higher stakes and brighter takes ill play

ill make a deal with you if all you want
is not to leave love to run em up

call me when it lands
hit me up when youre close
call me when you can
call me when youre close
sugar city
pretty magic
got me good vibes
thank god i aint driving
traffic vision
blurred blue bleedin
thats a black out ladder
it dont matter anyhow
im climbing
keep my good vibes
and check coats for cool climates
in common we got
good friends rolled light on split ends
pretty magic
traffic addicts
you might also likenow i dont really know where you stay at can i get an address
never mind my phone dead forget it
i dont really know where to bake that less you tryna get in
in which case my phone dead forget it
and i never answer calls when im in the kitchen
cooking
its just a thing
its out
and i never call back when my friends all looking at me in the car
cause itd be all they wanna talk about
oh you tryna to get a deal a deal a deal
sorry on the real
but my eyes and my ears dont work well
and the floor keeps sliding out my heels
i cant feel em am i still dreaming
skull on the table a still life
is this still life
whats the meaning are we still dealing
feel like i cant act right
oh right

sugar city
pretty magic
got me good vibes
thank god i aint driving
traffic vision
blurred blue bleedin
thats a black out ladder
it dont matter anyhow
im climbing
keep my good vibes
and check coats for cool climates
in common we got
good friends rolled light on split ends
pretty magic
traffic addicts
ill make a deal with you if all you want
is not to leave love to run em up

call me when it lands
hit me up when youre close
call me when you can
call me when youre close

when were you planning on coming my way
ive been here waiting all damn day to turn the the lights down low
and turn the table on you

call me when it lands
hit me up when youre close
when you know youve won1embed"
