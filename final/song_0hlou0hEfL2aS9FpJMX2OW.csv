sitting here at the florabama
bout to open up a big old can of good times unwind
fall in and out of love in the same night
in the same night

verse 1
theres ball caps photographs dollar bills and bras
license plates from every state nailed up to the wall
spring breakers heart breakers already getting loud
talladegas on the big screen dont it make you proud

chorus
sitting here at the florabama
bout to open up a big old can of good times unwind
fall in and out of love in the same night
cant say i got a whole lot of cares
im in the redneck riviera
its getting crazy getting hammered
sitting right here at the florabama
at the florabama

verse 2
theres hot time low tide years of history
hurricanes with different names that almost took the beach
the sign that says live your life just for inspiration
gonna raise a lot of hell tonight in the in the no shoes nation
