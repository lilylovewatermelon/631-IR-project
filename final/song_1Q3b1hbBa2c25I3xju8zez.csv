now that im thinking sober
dont you try to get no closer
im just gonna get in my car and drive and drive
looking in the rear view mirror
everything is so much clearer
watch me wave it all goodbye goodbye

prechorus 1
the lights flashing giving me all the danger signs
someone to save to save but it dont work that way

chorus
think you made your greatest mistake
im not gonna call this a break
think you really blew it this time
think you could walk on such a thin line
wont be taking your midnight calls
ignore the rocks you throw at my wall
i see it written on your face
you know you made it your greatest mistake
your greatest mistake your greatest mistake your greatest mistake

verse 2
when the last straw is broken
when the last door is closing
i aint that dumb to stick around stick around
i aint got the time for looking back
when you let yourself slip through the cracks
and you just keep going down down down

lay low need some time
no one to save to save
this sick cycleâ€™s over babe

chorus
think you made your greatest mistake
im not gonna call this a break

i see it written on your face
you know you made it your greatest mistake oohoh

bridge
why you looking at me spitting the same old line
tryna creep back aint no flipping my mind
