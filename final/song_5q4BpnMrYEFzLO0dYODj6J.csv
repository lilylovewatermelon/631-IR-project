well summer slipped us underneath her tongue
our days and nights are perfumed with obsession
half of my wardrobe is on your bedroom floor
use our eyes throw our hands overboard
i am your sweetheart psychopathic crush
drink up your movements still i cant get enough
i overthink your ppunctuation use
not my fault just a thing that my mind do

chorus
a rush at the beginning
i get caught up just for a minute
but lover youre the one to blame
all that youre doing
can you hear the violence
megaphone to my chest
broadcast the boom boom boom boom
and make em all dance to it

postchorus
broadcast the boom boom boom boom
and make em all dance to it
broadcast the boom boom boom boom
and make em all dance to it
broadcast the boom boom boom boom
and make em all dance to it
broadcast the boom boom boom boom
and make em all dance to it

our thing progresses i call and you come through
blow all my friendships to sit in hell with you
but were the greatest theyll hang us in the louvre
down the back but who cares still the louvre
okay i know that you are not my type still i fall
im just the sucker who let you fill her mind but what about love
nothing wrong with it supernatural
just move in close to me closer youll feel it coasting

chorus
a rush at the beginning
i get caught up just for a minute
but lover youre the one to blame
all that youre doing
can you hear the violence
megaphone to my chest
broadcast the boom boom boom boom
and make em all dance to it

postchorus
broadcast the boom boom boom boom
and make em all dance to it
broadcast the boom boom boom boom
and make em all dance to it
broadcast the boom boom boom boom
and make em all dance to it
broadcast the boom boom boom boom
and make em all dance to it120embed"
