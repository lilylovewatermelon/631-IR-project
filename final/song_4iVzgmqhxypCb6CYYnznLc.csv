oh the warmth in your eyes swept me into your arms
was it love or fear of the cold that led us through the night
for every kiss your beauty trumped my doubt

chorus
and my head told my heart
let love grow
but my heart told my head
this time no
this time no

well be washed and buried one day my girl
and the time we were given will be left for the world
the flesh that lived and loved will be eaten by plague
so let the memories be good for those who stay

chorus
and my head told my heart
let love grow
but my heart told my head
this time no
yes my heart told my head
this time no
this time no

was the same that sent me into your arms
oh and pestilence is won when you are lost and i am gone
and no hope no hope will overcome
and if your strife strikes at your sleep
remember spring swaps snow for leaves
youll be happy and wholesome again
when the city clears and sun ascends

chorus
and my head told my heart
let love grow
but my heart told my head
this time no

chorus
and my head told my heart
let love grow
but my heart told my head
this time no
this time no7embed"
