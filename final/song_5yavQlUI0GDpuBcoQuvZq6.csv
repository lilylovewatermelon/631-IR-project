passion pain pleasure
hurts when i laugh sometimes
feels good when i cry
tell me when youre looking at me
can you see the pain in my eyes

verse
as the stars shine deep in the night sky
as the sun sits way above the clouds
as the world spins time and time again
look at myself wondering where ive been
city to city and girl with you one nights all i got to give
you dont know me no matter how i might appear
will i ever know why do i feel so alone
since a child i was told all that glitters aint gold
got lost in the moment tryna find what i wanted
so im drowning in regret and ill never forget
everything that i had before the good turned badsee trey songz liveget tickets as low as 87you might also likeembed"
