i feel like i wanna smack somebody
turn around and bitch slap somebody
but i aint goin out bro no no no
i aint givin into it no no no
anxieties bash my mind in
terrorizing my soul like bin laden
but i aint fallin down bro no no no
i wont lose control bro no no no
shackled and chained
my soul feels stained
i cant explain got an itch on my brain
lately my whole aim is to maintain
and regain control of my mainframe
my bloods boiling its beatin out propane
my train of thoughts more like a runaway train
im in a fast car drivin in a fast lane
in the rain and i might just hydroplane

prechorus william
i dont fear none of my enemies
and i dont fear bullets from uzis
ive been dealing with something thats worse than these
thatll make you fall to your knees and thats

chorus jacoby shaddix
the anxiety
the sane and the insane rivalry
paranoias brought me to my knees
lord please please please
take away my anxiety
the sane and the insane rivalry
paranoias brought me to my knees
lord please please please
take away my anxiety

my head keeps running away my brother
the only thing making me stay my brother
but i wont give into it bro no no no
gotta get myself back now
god i cant let my mind be
tell my enemy is my own
gots to find my inner wealth
gots to hold up my thoughts
i cant get caught no no no
i cant give into it now no no no
emotions are trapped set on lock
got my brain stuck goin through the motions
only i know whats up
im filled up with pain
tryin to gain my sanity
everywhere i turn its a dead end in front of me
with nowhere to go gotta shake this anxiety
got me feelin strange paranoia took over me
and its weighin me down
and i cant run any longer yo
knees to the ground

prechorus william
i dont fear none of my enemies
and i dont fear bullets from uzis
ive been dealing with something thats worse than these
thatll make you fall to your knees and thats
chorus jacoby shaddix
high anxiety
the sane and the insane rivalry
paranoias brought me to my knees
lord please please please
take away my anxiety
the sane and the insane rivalry
paranoias brought me to my knees
lord please please please
take away my anxiety
