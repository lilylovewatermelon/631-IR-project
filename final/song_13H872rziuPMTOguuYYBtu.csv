i went through hell to get to high water
and now im tryin not to drown
each time i fail it makes me try harder
ill reach the stars next time around

verse
i tripped and fell in the wishing well
i hit rock bottom pennies kept landin face down
lost all i wanted lookin for will
desire burnin well

chorus
i went through hell to get to high water
and now im tryin not to drown
each time i fail it makes me try harder
ill reach the stars next time around
