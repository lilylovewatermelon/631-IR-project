could dress up to get love
but guess what
im never gonna be that girl
whos living in a barbie world
could wake up in make up and play dumb
pretending that i need a boy
whos gonna treat me like a toy

i know the other girlies wanna wear expensive things
like diamond rings
but i dont wanna be the puppet that youre playing on a string
this queen dont need a king

chorus
oh i dont know what youve been told
but this gal right heres gonna rule the world
yeah that is where im gonna be because i wanna be
no i dont wanna sit still look pretty
you get off on your 9 to 5
dream of picket fences and trophy wives
but no im never gonna be cause i dont wanna be
no i dont wanna sit still look pretty

verse 2
mr right could be nice for one night
but then he wanna take control
and i would rather fly solo
that snow white she did right in her life
had 7 men to do the chores
cause thats not what a ladys for
