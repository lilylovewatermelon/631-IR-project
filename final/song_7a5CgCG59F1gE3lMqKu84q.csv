well daisy duke peekaboo
i mightve learned a thing or two
on a friday night joyride
out there on the county line
drag racin til the blue lights chase us
and we scattered like sparks from a black cat fuse
train bridge where we spray paint skynard
and the gold flakes glimmered in the cinnamon booze

chorus
we were livin every minute of the night
like there might never be another
we were runnin all the caution lights
we were learnin to fly with a little tail gunner
if there was somethin to burn we were burnin it
anything with a curve we were turnin it
just wildfires out there under
the hell raisin heat of the summer

verse 2
alabama on the alpine
bust a cap on a deer sign
a little back seat butterfly
homegrown angel thatll get you high
thatll get you high

we were livin every minute of the night
like there might never be another
we were runnin all the caution lights
we were learnin to fly with a little tail gunner
if there was somethin to burn we were burnin it
anything with a curve we were turnin it
just wildfires out there under
the hell raisin heat of the summer

bridge
yeah i see it clearer in the rear view mirror
than i ever did lookin out over the hood
yeah man we had some damn good times
and i sure hope everybodys doin good

chorus
we were livin every minute of the night
like there might never be another
we were runnin all the caution lights
we were learnin to fly with a little tail gunner
if there was somethin to burn we were burnin it
anything with a curve we were turnin it
just wildfires out there under
the hell raisin heat of the summer
outro
the hell raisin heat of the summer
the hell raisin heat of the summer3embed"
