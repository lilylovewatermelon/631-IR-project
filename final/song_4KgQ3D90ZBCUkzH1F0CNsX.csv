think long and hard conjure her up in your mind what would she say
what is her final statement to a cold uncaring planet
 
veronica
dear world
believe it or not i knew about fear
i knew the way loneliness stung
i hid behind smiles and crazy hot clothes
i learned to kiss boys with my tongue
 
jd
thats good
 
veronica
but oh the world it held me down uhh
it weighed like a concrete prom queen crown
 
heather chandler
no one thinks a pretty girl has feelings
no one gets her insecurity
i am more than shoulder pads and makeup
no one sees the me inside of me
jesus youre making me sound like air supply
 
jd
keep going this has to be good enough to fool the cops
 
 
mccord
whoa is it murder
 
milner
no look heres a suicide note
 
veronica heather cops
they couldnt see past my rockstar mystique
they wouldnt dare look in my eyes
but just underneath was a terrified girl
who clings to her pillow and cries
my looks were just like prison bars
 
veronica cops
theyve left me a myriad of scars
 
heather chandler
myriad nice
 
veronica heather cops
no one thinks a pretty girl has substance thats the curse of popularity

ms fleming  heather chandler
box up my clothing for goodwill
and give the poor my nordic track
donate my car to crippled kids
or to those ghetto moms on crack
give them my hats and my cds
my pumps and my flats my three tvs
 
heather chandler faculty
no one thinks a pretty girl has feelings
but i weep for all i failed to be
maybe i can help the world by leaving
maybe that the me inside of me
