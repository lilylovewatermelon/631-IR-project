verse 2 schoolboy q
you need a real nigga shorty
so come and throw that pussy shorty
see i think you and me can make it
this little verse to get you naked
see your heart aint meant for breaking
cupids never been mistaken
see i been caught up in the moment
shit my type aint quite her type but now this gangsta nigga on it
she can twist my weed and hit the yac
i can hit your type without the hat put that pussy on the map
i see qualities in a bad girl i know that ass you got
come with attitude and your swag girl you aint wrong girl
just when that door knock lose your thong girl
cause you girl cause you girl girl cause you girl girl
cause you girl girl
