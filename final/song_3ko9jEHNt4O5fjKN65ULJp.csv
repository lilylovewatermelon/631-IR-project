my presence sweet and my aura bright
diamonds good for my appetite
guess it fuckin just clicked one night
all them demons helped me see shit differently
so dont be sad for me

prechorus
how you been spending your time how
how you be using your tongue how
you be so worried bout mine mine
cant even get yourself none
you know you sound so dumb so dumb so dumb
you know you sound so dumb so dumb

chorus
so maybe you should shut up mmm
yeah maybe you should shut up
said if only you would shut up mmm
yeah thats right you should shut up ah

verse 2
i vibrate high and my circle lit
we aint really with drugs and shit
love the game so i aint nevеr miss
keep opinions muted for the hell of it
causе i like my shit mmm yep
