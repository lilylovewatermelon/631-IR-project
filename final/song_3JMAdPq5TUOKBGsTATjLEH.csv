do something with your life do something with your life

verse 1 tony oller
we broke down trying to leave town
flying down the road to change
we were born to run cali here we come
escape from nowhere usa

verse 2 malcolm kelley  tony oller
say goodbye to white picket fences
say hello to palm trees and benzes
they say you got to fall to have it all
and we dont want two kids and a wife
i dont want a job i just want a life
sometimes the underdogs rise and the mighty fall and the mighty fall

hook tony oller
this ain’t the same summer song that you used to know
cause jack left diane thirty years ago
the world is spinning too fast for you and me
so tell me whatever happened to the american dream

verse 4 malcolm kelley  tony oller

i just want to give you some real advice
never take candy from stranger
and keep your eyes open for danger
because this right here is a twisted paradise

hook tony oller
this ain’t the same summer song that you used to know

so tell me whatever happened to the american dream
