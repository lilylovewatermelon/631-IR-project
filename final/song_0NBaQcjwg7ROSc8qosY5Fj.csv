way up on the hill
where the moon shines through the tall pines
and the whole damn world stands still
im gonna take you there where you cant be found
put a blanket down and melt away

there aint nothing on this mountain but us lightning bugs and rain

girl i think i love you
barefoot and soaking wet
youre the prettiest thing this mountains ever seen
a picture i cant forget
with your sparkling eyes and these fireflies
a river in a frame

there aint nothing on this mountain but us lightning bugs and rain

never thought the view from here could get any better
but youre dancing round the fire
like you control the weather
and here in the clouds
theres a storm on the way

there aint nothing on this mountain but us lightning bugs and rain
see whiskey myers liveget tickets as low as 56you might also liketheres a special place nobody knows
way up on the hill
thats where well make our babies
in that cadillac de ville
and well sit out on the porch
just growing old
giving all the stars new names

there aint nothing on this mountain but us lightning bugs and rain
lightning bugs and rainembed"
