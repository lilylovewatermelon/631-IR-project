i need a new truck
there aint nothing wrong with mine
its got forty something thousand miles
and the engine runs just fine
no it aint tore up
aint got a scratch aint got a dent
the radio the works it dont show dirt
worth every dime i spent

prechorus
i was gonna drive it
till the wheels fell off
yeah that was before she slammed the door
said its over then got lost

chorus
i need one she aint climbed up in
that aint played her favorite songs
need some glass that we aint fogged up
that her bare feet aint been on
i need a hood that we aint laid on
kissing till that sun came up
thats all thats wrong with this one
if youre looking youre in luck
i need a new truck
see dylan scott liveget tickets as low as 28you might also likeverse 2
yeah i need it right now
not tomorrow not next week
cant take another red light
with her memory over in that seat
if i find one more
hair tie that slipped off her wrist
one more chapstick one more picture
i might push it off a bridge

chorus
i need one she aint climbed up in
that aint played her favorite songs
need some glass that we aint fogged up
that her bare feet aint been on
i need a hood that we aint laid on
kissing till that sun came up
thats all thats wrong with this one
if youre looking youre in luck
i need a new truck

bridge
nah i didnt wreck it
but it might as well be
sitting on blocks in some old shop
the way that girl wrecked me
chorus
i need one she aint climbed up in
that aint played her favorite songs
need some glass that we aint fogged up
that her bare feet aint been on
i need a hood that we aint laid on
kissing till that sun came up
thats all thats wrong with this one
if youre looking youre in luck
i need a new truck
yeah i need a new truck
yeah i need a new truckembed"
