that wasnt me at a quarter to three back in our backyard
tearing up the roses and the home grown tomatoes in my new car
and those bottles in the driveway and the bottles in the hall
well i dont know where they came from
it must be burglars in the neighborhood
i sure hope they catch those bums

chorus
well i know youve got your own version of the truth
theres only three things left now that i can do
deny deny deny

verse 2
well i was allegedly dropped by a truck stop waitress at our front door
now who you gonna believe
your sweet loving daddy or those lying eyes of yours
and that lipstick on my collar that you found this morning well
thats not lipstick at all
i was just in a hurry to get back to you honey
had myself a little fall

chorus
oh yeah youve got your own version of the truth
and theres only three things left now that i can do
deny deny deny

oh please dont answer the phone
hey aint it great being home and alone like this
that cigarette voice asking for her big boy
why should i know who that is
yeah i know it looks bad but youre looking at a victim of a circumstance or two
oh what is it now seems like nothing i do ever pleases you

chorus
i know youve got your own version of the truth
theres only three things left now that i can do
deny deny deny
oh deny deny denyembed"
