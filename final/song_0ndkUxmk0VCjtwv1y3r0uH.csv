you dont know what youve put me through
thats okay ive forgiven you
but in some way
hope it fucks with you
hope it fucks with you

prechorus

but whos to say what youre going through
ill say no names though ive wanted to
isnt it strange how it seems like

chorus
yesterday
a boy and already afraid
locked deep inside
my place to hide
to hide from how you made me feel
and i wonder
hows your brother
did he end up fucked up like me
lost in himself
crying for help
its safe to say

i learned to live without a pride
just a shell with me stuck inside
a prison not a place to hide
not a place to hide

finding himself
not needing help
