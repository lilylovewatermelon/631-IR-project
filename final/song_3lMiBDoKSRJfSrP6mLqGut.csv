dont tread the water just stay still
ill not be bothered by you until
im picking sides and pulling the strings
im living lies and shedding the skin
im open wide and letting you in
im wronging rights

chorus
believe
i dont care what you want i just want mine
shut up smart little bitch i dont need lies
i dont care what you want i just want mine
get up force it to fit
confined inside

verse 2
dont pull me under into the deep
i often wonder how it should be
im picking sides and pulling the strings
im living lies and shedding the skin
im open wide and letting you in
im wronging rights

chorus
believe
i dont care what you want i just want mine
shut up smart little bitch i dont need lies
i dont care what you want i just want mine
get up force it to fit
confined inside
