heartache hurts and you can’t move on
blue skies fade to a gray sky dawn
trying to find a place in this town
where you don’t feel six feet underground
you’re so tired you’re so scared
defeated by the troubles you can’t repair

chorus
when this world comes crashing you don’t have to look away
don’t have to give up no don’t let the angels play
a sad song to carry you home it wont be long you discover
you recover
yeah you recover

verse 2
those dark clouds cant hold much rain
after it falls theyre gonna blow away
take those sad eyes dry those tears
baby im right here yeah i’m right here

chorus
when this world comes crashing you don’t have to look away
don’t have to give up no don’t let the angels play
a sad song to carry you home it wont be long you discover
you recover
yeah you recover
