ive learned to let go
come on

verse 1
heres a middle finger coming straight from ocala
i appreciate your judgement its proved i cant trust a word you say
those must be some pair of binoculars that you see every move i make
so ill never be a liar but youll always be twofaced

prechorus 1
youll get whats coming to you
youre blinded by your instincts
im not your fucking game
im not so easily beat

chorus
im looking down at this mess that youve made
and i cant believe that i stayed
so unhappy for so long
where did i go wrong
ive got to get out of this
my hand is on the handle
and were leaving everything behind
goodbye for a lifetime
see a day to remember liveget tickets as low as 108you might also likepostchorus
ill rip that scandalous bitch in two
well bring the noise

verse 2
try to pretend that i never even knew your name
cause everything you are disgusts me
too bad i cant turn back time
so i wouldnt be here
what id give for you to disappear
so tell me girly hows your edge

prechorus 2
youve got nothing better to do
i know why you cant see straight
i thought you were better than this
youre just like everyone else

chorus
im looking down at this mess that youve made
and i cant believe that i stayed
so unhappy for so long
where did i go wrong
ive got to get out of this
my hand is on the handle
and were leaving everything behind
goodbye for a lifetime
postchorus
ill make my stand
right here with my friends
ill make my stand
right here with my friends
ill make my stand
right here with my friends
ill make my stand
right here with my friends
ill make my stand
right here with my friends
get low

outro
now i know who my friends are
im never coming home3embed"
