why dont you just go away
i cant seem to get my head straight
theres so much i need to say
it could take all day

yeah but what you got i dont need it
i cant listen to all your reasons
wake up i dont feel it
i cant listen to all your reasons

your bad mood just ties my hands
turns my cartwheels into head stands
ive done everything i can
gave all i have

yeah but what you got i dont need it
i cant listen to all your reasons
wake up i dont feel it

i cant listen to all your reasons
see matchbox twenty liveget tickets as low as 77you might also likewhy i
you dont help me none
so worn down so torn up
still in love

yeah but what you got i dont need it
i cant listen to all your reasons
wake up i dont feel it
i cant listen to all your reasons

woman i dont need it
i cant listen to all your reasons
wake up i dont feel it
i cant listen to all your reasons
