ive been falling much more deep than i wanna
i’ve been wishing i could breathe underwater
i hold my breath
i cant see what comes next
i dont know when
i’ll see dry land again

chorus
another 40 days im lost at sea
im just gonna swim until you love me
hopin that your heart will rescue me
im just gonna swim until you love me
swim until you love me
swim swim swim
swim until you love me
swim swim swim

verse 2
ive been drowning in these sheets feeling lonely
wishing you were here with me every morning
over my head
the tide comes rolling in
i dont know when
ill see dry land again
