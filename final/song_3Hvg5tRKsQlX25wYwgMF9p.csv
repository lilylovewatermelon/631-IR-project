when we were younger we thought
everyone was on our side
then we grew a little bit
and romanticized
the time i saw
flowers in your hair

prechorus 1
see it takes a boy to live
it takes a man to pretend he was there

verse 2
so then we grew a little
and knew a lot
and how we demonstrated
it to the cops
and all the things we said
we were selfassured

prechorus 2
cause its a long road to wisdom
but its a short one to bein ignored

chorus
be in my eyes
and be in my heart
be in my eyes aye aye aye
and be in my heart
you might also likeverse 3
so now i think that i could
love you back
and i hope its not too late
cause youre so attractive
and the way you move
i wont close my eyes

prechorus 3
cause it takes a man to live
it takes a woman to make him compromise

chorus
so be in my eyes
be in my heart
be in my eyes aye aye aye
and be in my heart5embed"
