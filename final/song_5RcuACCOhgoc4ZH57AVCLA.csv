what can i do its just too late to reach you
your cigarette burnt holes all through my tshirt
the truth is such a pain too horrible to name
they say dont blame the player but he played the game

chorus
its no fun to feel like a fool
when you learn your baby dont belong to you
some might laugh some might call it cruel
when you learn your baby dont belong to you

verse 2
love you for being sick and twisted
but pussy is a hell of an addiction
my heart went through a shredder
the day i learned about your baby mothers
cause youre a grown ass man now you should know better
but i still run all my errands in your sweater
cause the truth is such a pain too horrible to name
they say dont blame the player but he played the game

chorus
its no fun to feel like a fool
when you learn your baby dont belong to you
some might laugh some might call it cruel
when you learn your baby dont belong to you
you might also likebridge
i cant look closed my eyes
cant believe it couldve been mine

chorus
its no fun to feel like a fool
when you learn your baby dont belong to you
some might laugh some might call it cruel
when you learn your baby dont belong to you

outro
no fun to feel like a fool fool
its no fun to feel like a fool15embed"
