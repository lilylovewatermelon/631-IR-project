i remember working on a rooftop
in the hot summer sun all day
now i work two hours a night
it feels a lot more like play

verse 2
fore kenny joined the band
he used to hang dry wall
ben worked down at valentinos
so when you see us up here and think
man theyre lucky
you dont have to tell us cause we know

chorus
yeah were laughing all the way to the bank
cause it all just seems so funny
a bunch of guys like us
in a big tour bus
making that easy money

verse 3
desperado hauled cattle
grady drove trucks
justin had a hot dog stand
kevin sold records
and brent sold shoes
and gary was a garbage man
see brad paisley liveget tickets as low as 55you might also likechorus
yeah were laughing all the way to the bank
cause it all just seems so funny
a bunch of guys like us
in a big tour bus
making that easy money

verse 4
i used to have an exgirlfriend
that didnt understand
she said boy youre going nowhere fast
you oughta get a real job
why dont you quit that band
now she can kiss my backstage pass

chorus
yeah were laughing all the way to the bank
cause it all just seems so funny
a bunch of guys like us
in a big tour bus
making that easy money
yeah were laughing all the way to the bank
cause it all just seems so funny
a bunch of guys like us
in a big tour bus
making that easy moneyembed"
