where the people keep on killing for their metaphors
but dont leave much up to the imagination
so i want to give this imagery back
but i know it just aint so easy like that
so i turn the page
and read the story again and again and again

prechorus 1
it sure seems the same
with a different name
were breaking and rebuilding
and were growing always guessing

chorus 1
never knowing
were shocking but were nothing
were just moments
were clever but were clueless
were just human
amusing and confusing
were trying
but where is this all leading
well never know

verse 2
it all happened so much
faster than you can say disaster
want to take a timelapse
and look at it backwards find the last word
and maybe thats just the answer
that were afterbut after all
were just a bubble in a boiling pot just
one breath in a chain of thought
were moments just combusting
we feel certain but well never never know
prechorus 2
it sure seems the same
give it a different name
were begging and were needing
and were trying and were breathing

chorus 2
never knowing
were shocking but were nothing
were just moments
were clever but were clueless
were just human
amusing and confusing
were helping
rebuilding never growing
never know if you never know never know never know

bridge
knock knock coming door to door
to tell you that their metaphor is better than yours
and you can either sink or swim
and things are looking pretty grim
if you dont believe in what theyre spoonfeeding
its got no feeling
so i read it again and again and again

it sure seems the same
so many different names
our hearts are strong our heads are weak
well always be competing

chorus 3
never knowing
were shocking but were nothing
were just moments
were clever but were clueless
were just human
amusing and confusing
but the true things
all we got is questions
well never know
