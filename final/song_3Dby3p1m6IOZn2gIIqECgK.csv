gleaming twinkling
eyes like sinking
ships on waters
so inviting i almost jump in

chorus
but i dont like a gold rush gold rush
i dont like anticipatin my face in a red flush
i dont like that anyone would die to feel your touch
everybody wants you
everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
walk past quick brush
i dont like slow motion double vision in rose blush
i dont like that falling feels like flying til the bone crush
everybody wants you
but i dont like a gold rush

verse 1
what must it be like to grow up that beautiful
with your hair falling into place like dominoes
i see me padding across your wooden floors
with my eagles tshirt hanging from the door

refrain
at dinner parties i call you out on your contrarian shit
and the coastal town we wandered round had nеver seen a love as pure as it
and thеn it fades into the gray of my dayold tea
cause it could never be

cause i dont like a gold rush gold rush
i dont like anticipatin my face in a red flush
i dont like that anyone would die to feel your touch
everybody wants you
everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
walk past quick brush
i dont like slow motion double vision in rose blush
i dont like that falling feels like flying til the bone crush
everybody wants you
but i dont like a gold rush

verse 2
what must it be like to grow up that beautiful
with your hair falling into place like dominoes
my mind turns your life into folklore
i cant dare to dream about you anymore

refrain
at dinner parties i wont call you out on your contrarian shit
and the coastal town we never found will never see a love as pure as it
cause it fades into the gray of my dayold tea
cause it will never be

outro
gleaming twinkling
eyes like sinking
ships on waters
so inviting i almost jump in52embed"
