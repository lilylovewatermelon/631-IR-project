i wasnt always the brightest
until i learned how to dance
you got me thinking
love will come around but you
never gave me a chance
i might not been the tallest
until i learned how to jump
you got me thinking
love will come around but you
never say im the one

chorus chris martin
if i could make you make you fall in love with me
if i could make you make you fall in love
wish i could make you make you fall in love
maybe love will come around if you want it enough
maybe love will come around if you want it enough

postchorus
love will come around
maybe love will come around for us

verse 2 avicii
i wasnt always the bravest
they say you only live once
