dj swift on the track
i turned the preacher daughter bad i think im a devil
these niggas know what up know im bout whateva
im in the streets i keep that heat you know that i be steppin

verse 1
i miss the nawf just like my granny my heart in them trenches
yo girl gon cheat on you for nothing so im done with these bitches
i think about it every minute aint stoppin my mission
on my payroll i got hittas i pay em commision
interrogated by detectives wont tell em i did it
i told montana that i love him on dave i meant it
put twenty thousand on his head they catch him i send it
get on my knee on side the bed like father forgive me
was sellin weed fucked up my profit i aint make a dolla
the fame gettin to my niggas i cut off my partners
before i call on you i put my trust up in this choppa
movin like he cant get touched real quick i bet i stop em
nigga aint give me shit but hand out like i owe him something
i dont give a fuck if we step together ill show you something
bitches think they slick they all deceive so ill never love em
bre was my first love but she changed so ill never trust her

bridge
this the files of a nigga who aint neva bleed
this the story of a child who was in them streets

keandre dead the only thing i think about is tyler
im full of pain but wake up every morning and im smilin

chorus
