okay

verse 1
dont have to write me a letter
cause ill always be right here
closer to you than your next breath my dear

prechorus
we love every hair on your head
love you like god loves you
and you say that youre scared
might be unprepared for havin the baby blues

chorus
baby blues baby blues
if things ever go wrong
just know this is your song and we love you

verse 2
you name your babe lilac heaven
after your iphone 11
crypto forever scrеams your stupid boyfriend
fuck you kevin

prechorus
we lovе every freckle you have
we love you like god loves you
if youre ever stressed out just dance in the night
if you get those baby blues

if things ever go wrong
just know this is your song and we love you

bridge
pink slippers all on the floor woven nets over the door
its as close as well get to the dream that they had
in the one night sixties and
jason is out in the lawn
and he powerwashes every time things go wrong
if youre stressed out just know you can dance to your song
cause we got you

chorus
if you get the blues baby blues
just know this is your song
itll live on and on way past me and you
if you get the blues baby blues

so theres nothing to lose and we love you
