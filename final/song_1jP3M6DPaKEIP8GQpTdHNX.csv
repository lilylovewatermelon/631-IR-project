i copped a house on the hills on the west side
im out in cali smokin shorty we blazin
kept a 100 100 strong on the east side
hit the hood they be goin crazy
too much hate too much hate
too much pay too much pay
too much talk too much talk
too much cloth too much cloth
too much floss i take two months off
two months off too much talk
too much cloth haaan

verse 1
young blood 212 with a 12 gauge pump
try to bring the foreigns out hit the hood like trump
hills party like womens march piranhas killin sharks
you aint built dont talk too much cloth
mi young boys hit you have you drippin too much sauce coke boy baby
hooked up to the iv yeah few months off
snipe squad roof top dump free bump stacks
wanna catch me slippin like they caught meek on the steps
yeah baby tryna find her way but it aint nothin pure
twice as much baby you aint twice is more
caught a crib on the west side selena
started from the block with a pack shawty mad

i copped a house on the hills on the west side
im out in cali smokin shorty we blazin
kept a 100 100 strong on the east side
hit the hood they be goin crazy
too much hate too much hate
too much pay too much pay
too much talk too much talk
too much cloth too much cloth
too much floss i take two months off
two months off too much talk
too much cloth haaan

verse 2
too many stories too many pages
too many real niggas in too many cages
too many fake niggas with too many faces
too many war stories on too much medication
put the game in a chokehold squeeze til aint nothin left
too many round
peel my top back watch it crystal meth
too much cut coke too much floss
theres too much cutthroat theres too many bosses
puff about to hit a billi im on a hundred mil burglary
i know you heard of me fresh off that hell rap surgery
put some gravel in your car talk and bought the bar too much talk
know you heard of us nigga talkin new york
chorus
i copped a house on the hills on the west side
im out in cali smokin shorty we blazin
kept a 100 100 strong on the east side
hit the hood they be goin crazy
too much hate too much hate
too much pay too much pay
too much talk too much talk
too much cloth too much cloth
too much floss i take two months off
two months off too much talk
too much cloth haaan
