but i’ve got some things that we must attend to
i’ve been indiscriminate
but i can’t hide behind accidentals now

i’ve been saying somethings i don’t like
but what else could i identify with
i can’t sleep i’m on them vines

i knew those easy days
long days long aisles in between me
i’m living on easy line
blue vine then i’m sick i’m sleeping all the time

i said i’d be there so i’ll come and let you in
oh it’s for you leo
from across the meridian
when i was over you
my arms were trembling trembling
i said i’d be there so i’ll come and let you inyou might also likeembed"
