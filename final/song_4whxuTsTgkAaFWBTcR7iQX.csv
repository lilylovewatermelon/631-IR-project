i run around
with my own little crowd
the usual laughs
not often but loud
and in the world i knew
i didnt know about you

verse 2
chasing after the ring
on the merrygoround
just taking my fun
where it could be found
and yet what else could i do
i didnt know about you

bridge
darling now i know
i had the loneliest yesterdays
every day
in your arms i know for once in my life
that i am living

verse 3
i had a good time every time i went out
romance was a thing i kidded about
how could i know about love
i didnt know about you
