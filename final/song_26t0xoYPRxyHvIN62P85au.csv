everything was all good way back in the day
then the whole hood really went wild
long live the gang man the whole hood missin them smiles
swear the whole hood missin’ them smiles
im a sed baby 1300 block ass nigga
you can tell from my walk to my style
i aint really hop off the porch ’til a nigga got older
but i been on the block since a child
we was rugrats in the trenches now you up in the sky
stay as far from as i look up to the clouds
pray for a sign just to know you still with me so i seen the sun shine
thats how i knew that you was proud
god was there so many times couldve lost my life
or fought for it on trial
but its like he chose me to be the one with the mic in my hands
steady talkin in front of them crowds
overcame a lot by myself ever since i got rich
its like everybody wanna come around
i remember i was dead broke nigga i aint have shit
you wasn’t in the list of numbers i could dial
back against the ropes wasn’t no one there to help me fight
nigga i wanna just throw in the towel
keep my circle small never let a bitch nigga in
thats just somethin’ that i really cant allow
man im sorry but i cant yell gang with a nigga who ain’t valid
or down to do a bid with me
seem like every day its a brand new nigga in my face
tryna claim some kin to me
its a whole lot of niggas with they fuckin hand out
but cant name one thing they done did for me
hell nah you cant hit this backwood if you wasnt scrapin up change
blowin swishers in the crib with me
seem like the industry pick and choose who they want in the front
man this shit lookin rigged to me
and you talkin like you live that shit but im really from the trenches
i dont feel it so i disagree
do you really understand all the ups and downs to this lifestyle
shit fun but its bittersweet
what you know about days missing out on meals
just to make sure your brothers and your sisters eat
it was reup time i was on my grind
told the ps i aint taking no shorts
we was playin the block fuck a sport
the way that we shootin and passin the rock
you would think that we play on the court
when my niggas died they thought it was funny
so kill em and dont show remorse
its a whole lot of goofy ass niggas in the way out here
shouldve stayed on the porch
niggas aint ready to give up the spotlight
they dont wanna pass me the torch
yeah im hot right now so they gon dick ride
whether its hate or support
but was i gon make it of course
lil polo like that man on the horse
i need a lambo or a porsche
tryna run up them ms
got place to flex on these niggas like im liftin weights at the gym
i hang with some killers
few lil savages with me my shooters dont aim at the rim
he tough with his chest out we pull them tecs out
blast til we knock off a limb
have him runnin up out of his timbs
niggas know we be wettin shit
if you walk with the opps then i hope you can swimyou might also like20embed"
