hey
i cant see why people look at me and only see the color of my face oh yeah

now i wont ask you to be color blind
cause if you pick the fruit then girl youre sure to find
the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
i could say it aint so but darlin whats the use
the darker the chocolate the richer the taste
and thats where its at
now baby run and tell that run and tell that
oh sugar run and tell that run and tell that

hey yeah
i cant see why people disagree each time i tell them what i know is true no no
and if you come and see the world im from i bet your heart is gonna feel it too

yeah i could lie but baby lets be bold
vanilla can be nice but if the truth be told
the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
i could say it aint so but darlin whats the use
the darker the chocolate the richer the taste
and thats where its at
