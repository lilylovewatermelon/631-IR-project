this is a story that i have never told
i gotta get this off my chest to let it go
i need to take back the light inside you stole
youre a criminal and you steal like youre a pro

prechorus
all the pain and the truth
i wear like a battle wound
so ashamed so confused
i was broken and bruised

chorus
now im a warrior now ive got thicker skin
im a warrior im stronger than ive ever been
and my armor is made of steel you cant get in
im a warrior and you can never hurt me again

verse 2
out of the ashes im burning like a fire
you can save your apologies youre nothing but a liar
ive got shame ive got scars that i will never show
im a survivor in more ways than you know

prechorus
cause all the pain and the truth
i wear like a battle wound
so ashamed so confused
im not broken or bruised

cause now im a warrior now ive got thicker skin

bridge
theres a part of me i cant get back
a little girl grew up too fast
all it took was once ill never be the same
now im taking back my life today
nothing left that you can say
cause you were never gonna take the blame anyway

chorus
now im a warrior ive got thicker skin
im a warrior im stronger than ive ever been
and my armor is made of steel you cant get in
im a warrior and you can never hurt me again

outro

ooh yeah yeah
you can never hurt me again21embed"
