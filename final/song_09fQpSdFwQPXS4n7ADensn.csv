in the 1930s langston hughes wrote a poem lenox avenue mural

what happens to a dream deferred

does it dry up

like a raisin in the sun

or fester like a sore

and then run
does it stink like rotten meat
or crust and sugar over
like a syrupy sweet

maybe it just sags like a heavy load

or does it explode

in a society of complex controls both crude and refined secret thoughts can often he found in the arts and so it was in black society perhaps the blues however pathetic concealed anger and the jazz however joyful portended rebellion and then the poetry the thoughts no longer so secret in the 1920s claude mckay one of the figures of what came to be called the harlem renaissance wrote a poem that henry cabot lodge put in the congressional record as an example of dangerous currents among young blacks

if we must die let it not be like hogs
hunted and penned in an inglorious spot  
like men well face the murderous cowardly pack
pressed to the wall dying but fighting back
countee cullens poem incident evoked memoriesall different all the sameout of every black americans childhood

once riding in old baltimore
heartfilled headfilled with glee
i saw a baltimorean
keep looking straight at me

now i was eight and very small
and he was no whit bigger
and so i smiled but he poked out
his tongue and called me nigger

i saw the whole of baltimore
from may until december
of all the things that happened there
thats all that i remember
at the time of the scottsboro boys incident cullen wrote a bitter poem noting that white poets had used their pens to protest in other cases of injustice but now that blacks were involved most were silent his last stanza was

surely i said

now will the poets sing
but they have raised no cry

i wonder why
even outward subservienceuncle tom behavior in real situations the comic or fawning negro on the stage the selfridicule the cautionconcealed resentment anger energy the black poet paul laurence dunbar in the era of the black minstrel around the turn of the century wrote we wear the mask

we wear the mask that grins and lies
it hides our cheeks and shades our eyes

   we sing but oh the clay is vile
beneath our feet and long the mile
but let the world dream otherwise
we wear the mask

two black performers of that time played the minstrel and satirized it at the same time when bert williams and george walker billed themselves as two real coons they were nathan huggins says intending to give style and comic dignity to a fiction that white men had created

by the 1930s the mask was off for many black poets langston hughes wrote i too

i too sing america

i am the darker brother
they send me to eat in the kitchen
when company comes
but i laugh
and eat well
and grow strong

tomorrow
ill be at the table
when company comes  
gwendolyn bennett wrote

i want to see lithe negro girls
etched dark against the sky
while sunset lingers 

i want to hear the chanting
around a heathen fire
of a strange black race

i want to feel the surging
of my sad peoples soul
hidden by a minstrelsmile

there was margaret walkers prosepoem for my people

   let a new earth rise let another world be born let a bloody peace be written in the sky let a second generation full of courage issue forth let a people loving freedom come to growth let a beauty full of healing and a strength of final clenching be the pulsing in our spirits and our blood let the martial songs be written let the dirges disappear let a race of men now rise and take control

by the 1940s there was richard wright a gifted novelist a black man his autobiography of 1937 black boy gave endless insights for instance how blacks were set against one another when he told how he was prodded to fight another black boy for the amusement of white men black boy expressed unashamedly every humiliation and then

the white south said that it knew niggers and i was what the white south called a nigger well the white south had never known menever known what i thought what i felt the white south said that i had a place in life well i had never felt my place or rather my deepest instincts had always made me reject the place to which the white south had assigned me it had never occurred to me that i was in any way an inferior being and no word that i had ever heard fall from the lips of southern white men had ever made me really doubt the worth of my own humanity

it was all there in the poetry the prose the music sometimes masked sometimes unmistakably clearthe signs of a people unbeaten waiting hot coiled

in black boy wright told about the training of black children in america to keep them silent but also

how do negroes feel about the way they have to live how do they discuss it when alone among themselves i think this question can be answered in a single sentence a friend of mine who ran an elevator once told me

lawd man ef it wuznt fer them polices n them ol lynch mobs there wouldnt be nothin but uproar down here

richard wright for a time joined the communist party he tells of this period of his life and his disillusionment with the party in the god that failed the communist party was known to pay special attention to the problem of race equality when the scottsboro case unfolded in the 1930s in alabama it was the communist party that had become associated with the defense of these young black men imprisoned in the early years of the depression by southern injustice

the party was accused by liberals and the naacp of exploiting the issue for its own purposes and there was a halftruth in it but black people were realistic about the difficulty of having white allies who were pure in motive the other half of the truth was that black communists in the south had earned the admiration of blacks by their organizing work against enormous obstacles there was hosea hudson the black organizer of the unemployed in birmingham for instance and in georgia in 1932 a nineteenyearold black youth named angelo herndon whose father died of miners pneumonia who had worked in mines as a boy in kentucky joined an unemployment council in birmingham organized by the communist party and then joined the party he wrote later

all my life id been sweated and steppedon and jimcrowed i lay on my belly in the mines for a few dollars a week and saw my pay stolen and slashed and my buddies killed i lived in the worst section of town and rode behind the colored signs on streetcars as though there was something disgusting about me i heard myself called nigger and darky and i had to say yes sir to every white man whether he had my respect or not

i had always detested it but i had never known that anything could be done about it and here all of a sudden i had found organizations in which negroes and whites sat together and worked together and knew no difference of race or color  

herndon became a communist party organizer in atlanta he and his fellow communists organized block committees of unemployment councils in 1932 which got rent relief for needy people they organized a demonstration to which a thousand people came six hundred of them white and the next day the city voted 6000 in relief to the jobless but soon after that herndon was arrested held incommunicado and charged with violating a georgia statute against insurrection he recalled his trial

the state of georgia displayed the literature that had been taken from my room and read passages of it to the jury they questioned me in great detail did i believe that the bosses and government ought to pay insurance to unemployed workers that negroes should have complete equality with white people did i believe in the demand for the self determination of the black belt  that the negro people should be allowed to rule the black belt territory kicking out the white landlords and government officials did i feel that the working class could run the mills and mines and government that it wasnt necessary to have bosses at all

i told them i believed all of that—and more  

herndon was convicted and spent five years in prison until in 1937 the supreme court ruled unconstitutional the georgia statute under which he was found guilty it was men like him who represented to the establishment a dangerous militancy among blacks made more dangerous when linked with the communist party

there were others who made that same connection magnifying the danger benjamin davis the black lawyer who defended herndon at his trial nationally renowned men like singer and actor paul robeson and writer and scholar w e b du bois who did not hide their support and sympathy for the communist party the negro was not as anticommunist as the white population he could not afford to be his friends were so few—so that herndon davis robeson du bois however their political views might be maligned by the country as a whole found admiration for their fighting spirit in the black community the black militant mood flashing here and there in the thirties was reduced to a subsurface simmering during world war ii when the nation on the one hand denounced racism and on the other hand maintained segregation in the armed forces and kept blacks in lowpaying jobs when the war ended a new element entered the racial balance in the united states—the enormous unprecedented upsurge of black and yellow people in africa and asia

president harry truman had to reckon with this especially as the cold war rivalry with the soviet union began and the darkskinned revolt of former colonies all over the world threatened to take marxist form action on the race question was needed not just to calm a black population at home emboldened by war promises frustrated by the basic sameness of their condition it was needed to present to the world a united states that could counter the continuous communist thrust at the most flagrant failure of american societythe race question what du bois had said long ago unnoticed now loomed large in 1945 the problem of the 20th century is the problem of the color line

president harry truman in late 1946 appointed a committee on civil rights which recommended that the civil rights section of the department of justice be expanded that there be a permanent commission on civil rights that congress pass laws against lynching and to stop voting discrimination and suggested new laws to end racial discrimination in jobs

trumans committee was blunt about its motivation in making these recommendations yes it said there was moral reason a matter of conscience but there was also an economic reason discrimination was costly to the country wasteful of its talent and perhaps most important there was an international reason

our position in the postwar world is so vital to the future that our smallest actions have tar reaching effects   we cannot escape the fact that our civil rights record has been an issue in world politics the worlds press and radio are full of it   those with competing philosophies have stressedand are shamelessly distortingour shortcomings    they have tried to prove our democracy an empty fraud and our nation a consistent oppressor of underprivileged people this may seem ludicrous to americans but it is sufficiently important to worry our friends the united states is not so strong the final triumph of the democratic ideal is not so inevitable that we can ignore what the world thinks of us or our record

the united states was out in the world now in a way it had never been the stakes were large—world supremacy and as trumans committee said our smallest actions have farreaching effects

and so the united states went ahead to take small actions hoping they would have large effects congress did not move to enact the legislation asked for by the committee on civil rights but truman—four months before the presidential election of 1948 and challenged from the left in that election by progressive party candidate henry wallace—issued an executive order asking that the armed forces segregated in world war ii institute policies of racial equality as rapidly as possible the order may have been prompted not only by the election but by the need to maintain black morale in the armed forces as the possibility of war grew it took over a decade to complete the desegregation in the military

truman could have issued executive orders in other areas but did not the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments plus the set of laws passed in the late 1860s and early 1870s gave the president enough authority to wipe out racial discrimination the constitution demanded that the president execute the laws but no president had used that power neither did truman for instance he asked congress for legislation prohibiting discrimination in interstate transportation facilities but specific legislation in 1887 already barred discrimination in interstate transportation and had never been enforced by executive action

meanwhile the supreme court was taking stepsninety years after the constitution had been amended to establish racial equalityto move toward that end during the war it ruled that the white primary used to exclude blacks from voting in the democratic party primaries which in the south were really the electionswas unconstitutional

in 1954 the court finally struck down the separate but equal doctrine that it had defended since the 1890s the naacp brought a series of cases before the court to challenge segregation in the public schools and now in brown v board of education the court said the separation of schoolchildren generates a feeling of inferiority   that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone in the field of public education it said the doctrine of separate but equal has no place the court did not insist on immediate change a year later it said that segregated facilities should he integrated with all deliberate speed by 1965 ten years after the all deliberate speed guideline more than 75 percent of the school districts in the south remained segregated

still it was a dramatic decision—and the message went around the world in 1954 that the american government had outlawed segregation in the united states too for those not thinking about the customary gap between word and fact it was an exhilarating sign of change

what to others seemed rapid progress to blacks was apparently not enough in the early 1960s black people rose in rebellion all over the south and in the late 1960s they were engaging in wild insurrection in a hundred northern cities it was all a surprise to those without that deep memory of slavery that everyday presence of humiliation registered in the poetry the music the occasional outbursts of anger the more frequent sullen silences part of that memory was of words uttered laws passed decisions made which turned out to be meaningless

for such a people with such a memory and such daily recapitulation of history revolt was always minutes away in a timing mechanism which no one had set but which might go off with some unpredictable set of events those events came at the end of 1955 in the capital city of alabama montgomery

three months after her arrest mrs rosa parks a fortythreeyearold seamstress explained why she refused to obey the montgomery law providing for segregation on city buses why she decided to sit down in the white section of the bus

well in the first place i had been working all day on the job i was quite tired after spending a full day working i handle and work on clothing that white people wear that didnt come in my mind but this is what i wanted to know when and how would we ever determine our rights as human beings  it just happened that the driver made a demand and i just didnt feel like obeying his demand he called a policeman and i was arrested and placed in jail

montgomery blacks called a mass meeting a powerful force in the community was f d nixon a veteran trade unionist and experienced organizer there was a vote to boycott all city buses car pools were organized to take negroes to work most people walked the city retaliated by indicting one hundred leaders of the boycott and sent many to jail white segregationists turned to violence bombs exploded in four negro churches a shotgun blast was fired through the front door of the home of dr martin luther king jr the twentysevenyearold altantaborn minister who was one of the leaders of the boycott kings home was bombed but the black people of montgomery persisted and in november 1956 the supreme court outlawed segregation on local bus lines

montgomery was the beginning it forecast the style and mood of the vast protest movement that would sweep the south in the next ten years emotional church meetings christian hymns adapted to current battles references to lost american ideals the commitment to nonviolence the willingness to struggle and sacrifice a new york times reporter described a mass meeting in montgomery during the boycott

one after the other indicted negro leaders took the rostrum in a crowded baptist church tonight to urge their followers to shun the citys buses and walk with god

more than two thousand negroes filled the church from basement to balcony and overflowed into the street they chanted and sang they shouted and prayed they collapsed in the aisles and they sweltered in an eightyfive degree heat they pledged themselves again and again to passive resistance under this banner they have carried on for eighty days a stubborn boycott of the citys buses

martin luther king at that meeting gave a preview of the oratory that would soon inspire millions of people to demand racial justice he said the protest was not merely over buses but over things that go deep down into the archives of history he said

we have known humiliation we have known abusive language we have been plunged into the abyss of oppression and we decided to raise up only with the weapon of protest it is one of the greatest glories of america that we have the right of protest

if we are arrested every day if we are exploited every day if we are trampled over every day dont ever let anyone pull you so low as to hate them we must use the weapon of love we must have compassion and understanding for those who hate us we must realize so many people are taught to hate us that they are not totally responsible for their hate but we stand in life at midnight we are always on the threshold of a new dawn

kings stress on love and nonviolence was powerfully effective in building a sympathetic following throughout the nation among whites as well as blacks but there were blacks who thought the message naive that while there were misguided people who might be won over by love there were others who would have to be bitterly fought and not always with nonviolence two years after the montgomery boycott in monroe north carolina an exmarine named robert williams the president of the local naacp became known for his view that blacks should defend themselves against violence with guns if necessary when local klansmen attacked the home of one of the leaders of the monroe naacp williams and other blacks armed with rifles fired back the klan left the klan was being challenged now with its own tactic of violence a klan raid on an indian community in north carolina was repelled by indians firing rifles

still in the years that followed southern blacks stressed nonviolence on february 1 1960 four freshmen at a negro college in greensboro north carolina decided to sit down at the woolworths lunch counter downtown where only whites ate they were refused service and when they would not leave the lunch counter was closed for the day the next day they returned and then day after day other negroes came to sit silently

in the next two weeks sitins spread to fifteen cities in five southern states a seventeenyearold sophomore at spelman college in atlanta ruby doris smith heard about greensboro

when the student committee was formed   i told my older sister  to put me on the list and when two hundred students were selected for the first demonstration i was among them i went through the food line in the restaurant at the state capitol with six other students but when we got to the cashier she wouldnt take our money   the lieutenantgovernor came down and told us to leave we didnt and went to the county jail

in his harlem apartment in new york a young negro teacher of mathematics named bob moses saw a photo in the newspapers of the greensboro sitinners the students in that picture had a certain look on their faces sort of sullen angry determined before the negro in the south had always looked on the defensive cringing this time they were taking the initiative they were kids my age and i knew this had something to do with my own life

there was violence against the sitinners but the idea of taking the initiative against segregation took hold in the next twelve months more than fifty thousand people mostly black some white participated in demonstrations of one kind or another in a hundred cities and over 3600 people were put in jail but by the end of 1960 lunch counters were open to blacks in greensboro and many other places

a year after the greensboro incident a northernbased group dedicated to racial equality—core congress of racial equality—organized freedom rides in which blacks and whites traveled together on buses going through the south to try to break the segregation pattern in interstate travel such segregation had long been illegal but the federal government never enforced the law in the south the president now was john f kennedy but he too seemed cautious about the race question concerned about the support of southern white leaders of the democratic party

the two buses that left washington dc on may 4 1963 headed for new orleans never got there in south carolina riders were beaten in alabama a bus was set afire freedom riders were attacked with fists and iron bars the southern police did not interfere with any of this violence nor did the federal government fbi agents watched took notes did nothing

at this point veterans of the sitins who had recently formed the student nonviolent coordinating committee sncc dedicated to nonviolent but militant action for equal rights organized another freedom ride from nashville to birmingham before they started out they called the department of justice in washington dc to ask for protection as ruby doris smith reported    the justice department said no they couldnt protect anyone but if something happened they would investigate you know how they do

the racially mixed sncc freedom riders were arrested in birmingham alabama spent a night in jail were taken to the tennessee border by police made their way back to birmingham took a bus to montgomery and there were attacked by whites with fists and clubs in a bloody scene they resumed their trip to jackson mississippi

by this time the freedom riders were in the news all over the world and the government was anxious to prevent further violence attorney general robert kennedy instead of insisting on their right to travel without being arrested agreed to the freedom riders being arrested in jackson in return for mississippi police protection against possible mob violence as victor navasky comments in kennedy justice about robert kennedy he didnt hesitate to trade the freedom riders constitutional right to interstate travel for senator eastlands guarantee of their right to live

the freedom riders did not become subdued in jail they resisted protested sang demanded their rights stokely carmichael recalled later how he and his fellow inmates were singing in the parchman jail in mississippi and the sheriff threatened to take away their mattresses

i hung on to the mattress and said i think we have a right to them and i think youre unjust and he said i dont want to hear all that shit nigger and started to put on the wristbreakers i wouldnt move and started to sing im gonna tell god how you treat me and everybody started to sing it and by this time tyson was really to pieces he called to the trusties get him in there and he went out the door and slammed it and left everybody else with their mattresses

in albany georgia a small deepsouth town where the atmosphere of slavery still lingered mass demonstrations took place in the winter of 1961 and again in 1962 of 22000 black people in albany over a thousand went to jail for marching assembling to protest segregation and discrimination here as in all the demonstrations that would sweep over the south little black children participateda new generation was learning to act the albany police chief after one of the mass arrests was taking the names of prisoners lined up before his desk he looked up and saw a negro boy about nine years old whats your name the boy looked straight at him and said freedom freedom

there is no way of measuring the effect of that southern movement on the sensibilities of a whole generation of young black people or of tracing the process by which some of them became activists and leaders in lee county georgia after the events of 19611962 a black teenager named james crawford joined sncc and began taking black people to the county courthouse to vote one day bringing a woman there he was approached by the deputy registrar another sncc worker took notes on the conversation

registrar	what do you want
crawford	i brought this lady down to register
registrar	after giving the woman a card to fill out and sending her outside in the hall why did you bring this lady down here
crawford	because she wants to be a first class citizen like yall
registrar	who are you to bring people down to register
crawford	its my job
registrar	suppose you get two bullets in your head right now
crawford	i got to die anyhow
registrar	if i dont do it i can get somebody else to do it no reply
registrar	are you scared
crawford	no
registrar	suppose somebody came in that door and shoot you in the back of the head right now what would you do
crawford	i couldnt do nothing if they shoot me in the back of the head there are people coming from all over the world
crawford	what people
registrar	the people i work for

in birmingham in 1963 thousands of blacks went into the streets facing police clubs tear gas dogs highpowered water hoses and meanwhile all over the deep south the young people of sncc mostly black a few white were moving into communities in georgia alabama mississippi arkansas joined by local black people they were organizing to register people to vote to protest against racism to build up courage against violence the department of justice recorded 1412 demonstrations in three months of 1963 imprisonment became commonplace beatings became frequent many local people were afraid others came forward a nineteenyear old black student from illinois named carver neblett working for sncc in terrell county georgia reported

i talked with a blind man who is extremely interested in the civil rights movement he has been keeping up with the movement from the beginning even though this man is blind he wants to learn all the questions on the literacy test imagine while many are afraid that white men will burn our houses shoot into them or put us off their property a blind man seventy years old wants to come to our meetings

as the summer of 1964 approached sncc and other civil rights groups working together in mississippi and facing increasing violence decided to call upon young people from other parts of the country for help they hoped that would bring attention to the situation in mississippi again and again in mississippi and elsewhere the fbi had stood by lawyers for the justice department had stood by while civil rights workers were beaten and jailed while federal laws were violated

on the eve of the mississippi summer in early june 1964 the civil rights movement rented a theater near the white house and a busload of black mississippians traveled to washington to testify publicly about the daily violence the dangers facing the volunteers coming into mississippi constitutional lawyers testified that the national government had the legal power to give protection against such violence the transcript of this testimony was given to president johnson and attorney general kennedy accompanied by a request for a protective federal presence during the mississippi summer there was no response

twelve days after the public hearing three civil rights workers james chaney a young black mississippian and two white volunteers andrew goodman and michael schwerner were arrested in philadelphia mississippi released from jail late at night then seized beaten with chains and shot to death ultimately an informers testimony led to jail sentences for the sheriff and deputy sheriff and others that came too late the mississippi murders had taken place after the repeated refusal of the national government under kennedy or johnson or any other president to defend blacks against violence

dissatisfaction with the national government intensified later that summer during the democratic national convention in washington mississippi blacks asked to be seated as part of the state delegation to represent the 40 percent of the states population who were black they were turned down by the liberal democratic leadership including vicepresidential candidate hubert humphrey

congress began reacting to the black revolt the turmoil the world publicity civil rights laws were passed in 1957 1960 and 1964 they promised much on voting equality on employment equality but were enforced poorly or ignored in 1965 president johnson sponsored and congress passed an even stronger voting rights law this time ensuring onthespot federal protection of the right to register and vote the effect on negro voting in the south was dramatic in 1952 a million southern blacks 20 percent of those eligible registered to vote in 1964 the number was 2 million 40 percent by 1968 it was 3 million 60 percent—the same percentage as white voters

the federal government was trying—without making fundamental changes—to control an explosive situation to channel anger into the traditional cooling mechanism of the ballot box the polite petition the officially endorsed quiet gathering when black civil rights leaders planned a huge march on washington in the summer of 1963 to protest the failure of the nation to solve the race problem it was quickly embraced by president kennedy and other national leaders and turned into a friendly assemblage

martin luther kings speech there thrilled 200000 black and white americansi have a dream it was magnificent oratory but without the anger that many blacks felt when john lewis a young alabamaborn sncc leader much arrested much beaten tried to introduce a stronger note of outrage at the meeting he was censored by the leaders of the march who insisted he omit certain sentences critical of the national government and urging militant action

eighteen days after the washington gathering almost as if in deliberate contempt for its moderation a bomb exploded in the basement of a black church in birmingham and four girls attending a sunday school class were killed president kennedy had praised the deep fervor and quiet dignity of the march but the black militant malcolm x was probably closer to the mood of the black community speaking in detroit two months after the march on washington and the birmingham bombing malcolm x said in his powerful icyclear rhythmic style

the negroes were out there in the streets they were talking about how they were going to march on washington that they were going to march on washington march on the senate march on the white house march on the congress and tie it up bring it to a halt not let the government proceed they even said they were going out to the airport and lay down on the runway and not let any airplanes land im telling you what they said that was revolution that was revolution that was the black revolution

it was the grass roots out there in the street it scared the white man to death scared the white power structure in washington dc to death i was there when they found out that this black steamroller was going to come down on the capital they called in  these national negro leaders that you respect and told them call it off kennedy said look you all are letting this thing go too far and old tom said boss i cant stop it because i didnt start it im telling you what they said they said im not even in it much less at the head of it they said these negroes are doing things on their own theyre running ahead of us and that old shrewd fox he said if you all arent in it ill put you in it ill put you at the head of it ill endorse it ill welcome it ill help it ill join it

this is what they did with the march on washington they joined it became part of it took it over and as they took it over it lost its militancy it ceased to he angry it ceased to be hot it ceased to be uncompromising why it even ceased to be a march it became a picnic a circus nothing but a circus with clowns and all  

no it was a sellout it was a takeover  they controlled it so tight they told those negroes what time to hit town where to stop what signs to carry what song to sing what speech they could make and what speech they couldnt make and then told them to get out of town by sundown

the accuracy of malcolm xs caustic description of the march on washington is corroborated in the description from the other side from the establishment by white house adviser arthur schlesinger in his book a thousand days he tells how kennedy met with the civil rights leaders and said the march would create an atmosphere of intimidation just when congress was considering civil rights bills a philip randolph replied the negroes are already in the streets it is very likely impossible to get them off schlesinger says the conference with the president did persuade the civil rights leaders that they should not lay siege to capitol hill schlesinger describes the washington march admiringly and then concludes so in 1963 kennedy moved to incorporate the negro revolution into the democratic coalition 

but it did not work the blacks could not be easily brought into the democratic coalition when bombs kept exploding in churches when new civil rights laws did not change the root condition of black people in the spring of 1963 the rate of unemployment for whites was 48 percent for nonwhites it was 121 percent according to government estimates onefifth of the white population was below the poverty line and onehalf of the black population was below that line the civil rights bills emphasized voting but voting was not a fundamental solution to racism or poverty in harlem blacks who had voted for years still lived in ratinfested slums

in precisely those years when civil rights legislation coming out of congress reached its peak 1964 and 1965 there were black outbreaks in every part of the country in florida set off by the killing of a negro woman and a bomb threat against a negro high school in cleveland set off by the killing of a white minister who sat in the path of a bulldozer to protest discrimination against blacks in construction work in new york set off by the fatal shooting of a fifteenyearold negro boy during a fight with an offduty policeman there were riots also in rochester jersey city chicago philadelphia

in august 1965 just as lyndon johnson was signing into law the strong voting rights act providing for federal registration of black voters to ensure their protection the black ghetto in watts los angeles erupted in the most violent urban outbreak since world war ii it was provoked by the forcible arrest of a young negro driver the clubbing of a bystander by police the seizure of a young black woman falsely accused of spiting on the police there was rioting in the streets looting and firebombing of stores police and national guardsmen were called in they used their guns thirtyfour people were killed most of them black hundreds injured four thousand arrested robert conot a west coast journalist wrote of the riot rivers of blood years of darkness in los angeles the negro was going on record that he would no longer turn the other cheek that frustrated and goaded he would strike back whether the response of violence was an appropriate one or no

in the summer of 1966 there were more outbreaks with rock throwing looting and fire bombing by chicago blacks and wild shootings by the national guard three blacks were killed one a thirteenyearold boy another a fourteenyearold pregnant girl in cleveland the national guard was summoned to stop a commotion in the black community four negroes were shot to death two by troopers two by white civilians

it seemed clear by now that the nonviolence of the southern movement perhaps tactically necessary in the southern atmosphere and effective because it could be used to appeal to national opinion against the segregationist south was not enough to deal with the entrenched problems of poverty in the black ghetto in 1910 90 percent of negroes lived in the south but by 1965 mechanical cotton pickers harvested 81 percent of mississippi delta cotton between 1940 and 1970 4 million blacks left the country for the city by 1965 80 percent of blacks lived in cities and 50 percent of the black people lived in the north

there was a new mood in sncc and among many militant blacks their disillusionment was expressed by a young black writer julius lester

now it is over america has had chance after chance to show that it really meant that all men are endowed with certain inalienable rights   now it is over the days of singing freedom songs and the days of combating bullets and billy clubs with love    love is fragile and gentle and seeks a like response they used to sing i love everybody as they ducked bricks and bottles now they sing

too much love

too much love

nothing kills a nigger like

too much love

in 1967 in the black ghettos of the country came the greatest urban riots of american history according to the report of the national advisory committee on urban disorders they involved negroes acting against local symbols of white american society symbols of authority and property in the black neighborhoodsrather than purely against white persons the commission reported eight major uprisings thirtythree serious but not major outbreaks and 123 minor disorders eightythree died of gunfire mostly in newark and detroit the overwhelming majority of the persons killed or injured in all the disorders were negro civilians

the typical rioter according to the commission was a young high school dropout but nevertheless somewhat better educated than his nonrioting negro neighbor and usually underemployed or employed in a menial job he was proud of his race extremely hostile to both whites and middleclass negroes and although informed about politics highly distrustful of the political system

the report blamed white racism for the disorders and identified the ingredients of the explosive mixture which has been accumulating in our cities since the end of world war ii

pervasive discrimination and segregation in employment education and housing   growing concentrations of impoverished negroes in our major cities creating a growing crisis of deteriorating facilities and services and unmet human needs 

a new mood has sprung up among negroes particularly the young in which selfesteem and enhanced racial pride are replacing apathy and submission to the system

but the commission report itself was a standard device of the system when facing rebellion set up an investigating committee issue a report the words of the report however strong will have a soothing effect

that didnt completely work either black power was the new sloganan expression of distrust of any progress given or conceded by whites a rejection of paternalism few blacks or whites knew the statement of the white writer aldous huxley liberties are not given they are taken but the idea was there in black power also a pride in race an insistence on black independence and often on black separation to achieve this independence malcolm x was the most eloquent spokesman for this after he was assassinated as he spoke on a public platform in february 1965 in a plan whose origins are still obscure he became the martyr of this movement hundreds of thousands read his autobiography he was more influential in death than during his lifetime

martin luther king though still respected was being replaced now by new heroes huey newton of the black panthers for instance the panthers had guns they said blacks should defend themselves

malcolm x in late 1964 had spoken to black students from mississippi visiting harlem

youll get freedom by letting your enemy know that youll do anything to get your freedom then youll get it its the only way youll get it when you get that kind of attitude theyll label you as a crazy negro or theyll call you a crazy nigger—they dont say negro or theyll call you an extremist or a subversive or seditious or a red or a radical but when you stay radical long enough and get enough people to be like you youll get your freedom

congress responded to the riots of 1967 by passing the civil rights act of 1968 presumably it would make stronger the laws prohibiting violence against blacks it increased the penalties against those depriving people of their civil rights however it said the provisions of this section shall not apply to acts or omissions on the part of law enforcement officers members of the national guard  or members of the armed forces of the united states who are engaged in suppressing a riot or civil disturbance

 its inevitable that weve got to bring out the question of the tragic mixup in priorities we are spending all of this money for death and destruction and not nearly enough money for life and constructive development when the guns of war become a national obsession social needs inevitably suffer

king now became a chief target of the fbi which tapped his private phone conversations sent him fake letters threatened him blackmailed him and even suggested once in an anonymous letter that he commit suicide fbi internal memos discussed finding a black leader to replace king as a senate report on the fbi said in 1976 the fbi tried to destroy dr martin luther king

king was turning his attention to troublesome questions he still insisted on nonviolence riots were selfdefeating he thought but they did express a deep feeling that could not be ignored and so nonviolence he said must be militant massive nonviolence he planned a poor peoples encampment in washington this time not with the paternal approval of the president and he went to memphis tennessee to support a strike of garbage workers in that city there standing on a balcony outside his hotel room he was shot to death by an unseen marksman the poor peoples encampment went on and then it was broken up by police action just as the world war i veterans bonus army of 1932 was dispersed

the killing of king brought new urban outbreaks all over the country in which thirtynine people were killed thirtyfive of them black evidence was piling up that even with all of the civil rights laws now on the books the courts would not protect blacks against violence and injustice

was the government turning to murder and terror because the concessionsthe legislation the speeches the intonation of the civil rights hymn we shall overcome by president lyndon johnsonwere not working it was discovered later that the government in all the years of the civil rights movement while making concessions through congress was acting through the fbi to harass and break up black militant groups between 1956 and 1971 the fbi concluded a massive counterintelligence program known as cointelpro that took 295 actions against black groups black militancy seemed stubbornly resistant to destruction a secret fbi report to president nixon in 1970 said a recent poll indicates that approximately 25 of the black population has a great respect for the black panther party including 43 of blacks under 21 years of age was there fear that blacks would turn their attention from the controllable field of voting to the more dangerous arena of wealth and povertyof class conflict in 1966 seventy poor black people in greenville mississippi occupied an unused air force barracks until they were evicted by the military a local woman mrs unita blackwell said

i feel that the federal government have proven that it dont care about poor people everything that we have asked for through these years had been handed down on paper its never been a reality we the poor people of mississippi is tired were tired of it so were going to build for ourselves because we dont have a government that represents us

out of the 1967 riots in detroit came an organization devoted to organizing black workers for revolutionary change this was the league of revolutionary black workers which lasted until 1971 and influenced thousands of black workers in detroit during its period of activity

the new emphasis was more dangerous than civil rights because it created the possibility of blacks and whites uniting on the issue of class exploitation back in november 1963 a philip randolph had spoken to an aflcio convention about the civil rights movement and foreseen its direction the negros protest today is but the first rumbling of the underclass as the negro has taken to the streets so will the unemployed of all races take to the streets

attempts began to do with blacks what had been done historically with whitesto lure a small number into the system with economic enticements there was talk of black capitalism leaders of the naacp and corf were invited to the white house james farmer of corf a former freedom rider and militant was given a job in president nixons administration floyd mckissick of core received a 14 million government loan to build a housing development in north carolina lyndon johnson had given jobs to some blacks through the office of economic opportunity nixon set up an office of minority business enterprise

chase manhattan bank and the rockefeller family controllers of chase took a special interest in developing black capitalism the rockefellers had always been financial patrons of the urban league and a strong influence in black education through their support of negro colleges in the south david rockefeller tried to persuade his fellow capitalists that while helping black businessmen with money might not be fruitful in the short run it was necessary to shape an environment in which the business can continue earning a profit four or five or ten years from now with all of this black business remained infinitesimally small the largest black corporation motown industries had sales in 1974 of 45 million while exxon corporation had sales of 42 billion the total receipts of blackowned firms accounted for 03 percent of all business income

there was a small amount of change and a lot of publicity there were more black faces in the newspapers and on television creating an impression of changeand siphoning off into the mainstream a small but significant number of black leaders

some new black voices spoke against this robert allen black awakening in capitalist america wrote

if the community as a whole is to benefit then the community as a whole must be organized to manage collectively its internal economy and its business relations with white america black business firms must be treated and operated as social property belonging to the general black community not as the private property of individual or limited groups of individuals this necessitates the dismantling of capitalist property relations in the black community and their replacement with a planned communal economy

a black woman patricia robinson in a pamphlet distributed in boston in 1970 poor black woman tied male supremacy to capitalism and said the black woman allies herself with the have nots in the wider world and their revolutionary struggles she said the poor black woman did not in the past question the social and economic system but now she must and in fact she has begun to question aggressive male domination and the class society which enforces it capitalism

the system was working hard by the late sixties and early seventies to contain the frightening explosiveness of the black upsurge blacks were voting in large numbers in the south and in the 1968 democraticconvention three blacks were admitted into the mississippi delegation by 1977 more than two thousand blacks held office in eleven southern states in 1965 the number was seventytwo there were two congressmen eleven state senators ninetyfive state representatives 267 county commissioners seventysix mayors 824 city council members eighteen sheriffs or chiefs of police 508 school board members it was a dramatic advance but blacks with 20 percent of the souths population still held less than 3 percent of the elective offices a new york times reporter analyzing the new situation in 1977 pointed out that even where blacks held important city offices whites almost always retain economic power after maynard jackson a black became mayor of atlanta the white business establishment continued to exert its influence

those blacks in the south who could afford to go to downtown restaurants and hotels were no longer barred because of their race more blacks could go to colleges and universities to law schools and medical schools northern cities were busing children back and forth in an attempt to create racially mixed schools despite the racial segregation in housing none of this however was halting what frances piven and richard cloward poor peoples movements called the destruction of the black lower class—the unemployment the deterioration of the ghetto the rising crime drug addiction violence

in the summer of 1977 the department of labor reported that the rate of unemployment among black youths was 348 percent a small new black middle class of blacks had been created and it raised the overall statistics for black incomebut there was a great disparity between the newly risen middleclass black and the poor left behind despite the new opportunities for a small number of blacks the median black family income of 1977 was only about 60 percent that of whites blacks were twice as likely to the of diabetes seven times as likely to he victims of homicidal violence rising out of the poverty and despair of the ghetto

a new york times report in early 1978 said   the places that experienced urban riots in the 1960s have with a few exceptions changed little and the conditions of poverty have spread in most cities

statistics did not tell the whole story racism always a national fact not just a southern one emerged in northern cities as the federal government made concessions to poor blacks in a way that pitted them against poor whites for resources made scarce by the system blacks freed from slavery to take their place under capitalism had long been forced into conflict with whites for scarce jobs now with desegregation in housing blacks tried to move into neighborhoods where whites themselves poor crowded troubled could find in them a target for their anger in the boston globe november 1977

in boston the busing of black children to white schools and whites to black schools set off a wave of white neighborhood violence the use of busing to integrate schools—sponsored by the government and the courts in response to the black movement—was an ingenious concession to protest it had the effect of pushing poor whites and poor blacks into competition for the miserable inadequate schools which the system provided for all the poor

was the black population—hemmed into the ghetto divided by the growth of a middle class decimated by poverty attacked by the government driven into conflict with whites—under control surely in the midseventies there was no great black movement under way yet a new black consciousness had been born and was still alive also whites and blacks were crossing racial lines in the south to unite as a class against employers in 1971 two thousand woodworkers in mississippi black and white joined together to protest a new method of measuring wood that led to lower wages in the textile mills of j p stevens where 44000 workers were employed in eighty five plants mostly in the south blacks and whites were working together in union activity in tifton georgia and milledgeville georgia in 1977 blacks and whites served together on the union committees of their plants

would a new black movement go beyond the limits of the civil rights actions of the sixties beyond the spontaneous urban riots of the seventies beyond separatism to a coalition of white and black in a historic new alliance there was no way of knowing this in 1978 in 1978 6 million black people were unemployed as langston hughes said what happens to a dream deferred does it dry up or does it explode if it did explode as it had in the past it would come with a certain inevitability out of the conditions of black life in americaand yet because no one knew when it would come as a surpriseembed"
