its a lonely road full of tired men
and you can see it in their faces
and youll be home in spring i can wait til then
i heard youre on the big train

prechorus
and oh this too shall pass
this loneliness wont last for long

chorus
i wasnt there to take his place
i was ten thousand miles away
so when you hear my voice
when you say my name
may it never give you pain
but i dont wanna go but its time to leave
youll be on my mind my destiny

prechorus
and i wont fight in vain
ill love you just the same oh

chorus
i couldnt know whats in your mind
but i saw the pictures youre looking fine
and there was a time when i stood in line
for love for love for love
but i let you go oh
i let you go

and he fell apart with his broken heart
and this blood this blood this blood
oh it drains from my skin it does7embed"
