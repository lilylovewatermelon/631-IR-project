who wants that perfect love story anyway anyway
cliché cliché cliché cliché
who wants that hero love that saves the day anyway

an innocent love im misunderstood yeah
black hour glass our glass
toast to clichés in a dark past
toast to clichés in a dark past

deeper than words beyond right
die for your love beyond life
sweet as a jesus piece beyond ice
blind me baby with your neon lights
ray bans on police in sight
oh what a beautiful death lets both wear white
if you go to heaven and they bring me to hell
just sneak out and meet me bring a box of ls
she fell in love with the bad guy the bad guy

they aint see potential in me girl but you see it
if its me and you against the world then so be it

beyoncé
i dont care if they give me life
