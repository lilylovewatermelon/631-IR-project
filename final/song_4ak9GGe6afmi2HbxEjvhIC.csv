home alone tryin not to eat
distract myself with pornography
i hate the way she looks at me
i cant stand the dialogue she would never be
that satisfied its a male fantasy
im goin back to therapy

chorus
cause i loved you then and i love you now
and i dont know how
guess its hard to know when nobody else comes around
if im getting over you
or just pretending to
be alright convince myself i hate you

interlude
you want me to put it here
okay

verse 2
i got a call from a girl i used to know
we were inseparablе years ago
thought wed get along but it wasnt so
and its all i think about whеn im behind the wheel
i worry this is how im always gonna feel
but nothing lasts i know the deal

but i loved you then and i love you now
and i dont know how
guess its hard to know when nobody else comes around
if im getting over you
or just pretending to
be alright convince myself i hate you

outro
cant get over you
no matter what i do
i know i should but i could never hate you50embed"
