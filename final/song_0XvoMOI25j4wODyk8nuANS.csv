you wrap my feet in coloured blankets
so i stay here all night
you keep the one with many moons and stars
it’s always for my shoulders

chorus
so i stay here till waking hours
tell me how do you make everything feel a little easier
so i stay here till waking hours
who could ever be this good to me
i just can’t help but wonder

verse 2
you put a shirt on the ceiling light
so the room won’t be too bright
you give me time to be what i can be
you’re never ahead never behind me

chorus
so i stay here till waking hours
tell me how do you make everything feel a little easier
so i stay here till waking hours
who could ever be this good to me
i just can’t help but wondersee men i trust liveget tickets as low as 100you might also like1embed"
