its alright to cry
even my dad does sometimes
so dont wipe your eyes
tears remind you youre alive
its alright to die
cause deaths the only thing you havent tried
but just for tonight hold on

chorus 1
so live life like youre giving up
cause you act like you are
go ahead and just live it up
go on and tear me apart

verse 2
its alright to shake
even my hand does sometimes
so inside well rage
against the dying of the light
its alright to say that deaths the only thing you havent tried
but just for today hold on

chorus 2
so live life like youâ€™re giving up
cause you act like you are
go ahead and just live it up
go on and tear me apart and hold on
live life like youre giving up
cause you act like you are
go ahead and just live it up
go on and tear me apart and hold onsee ed sheeran liveget tickets as low as 81you might also like25embed"
