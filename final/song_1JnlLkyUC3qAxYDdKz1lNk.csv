verse
now i can move on to facing
big girl problems no more high school drama
graduated with honors
and im drinking coffee while i
read the paper ive been saving money
eating only top ramen

chorus
now i get a holiday
wherever i go i might stay
i dont plan on coming back
ever if i can help it

outro
now i get a holiday
i think ill stay
