its been a wreck me week
sixty plus from dawn to dusk
in the red dirt heat
busting it up for a couple of bucks
but it aint no thing
just another day til im on my way
to them cool cool sheets and you and me

chorus
working on the night shift baby
dying for your touch like crazy
racking up the overtime hours
loving how were working on the night shift baby

verse 2
gonna rock it right
no need to talk i know what you want
and what you like
cause i do too yeah
i love how you leave on the lights
not a thing between you and me
and it feels so nice when you and i are

chorus
working on the night shift baby
dying for your touch like crazy
racking up the overtime hours
loving how were working on the night shift baby

chorus
when youre working on the night shift baby
dying for your touch like crazy
racking up the overtime hours
loving how were working on the night shift baby
loving how were working on the night shift
loving how were working on the night shift
