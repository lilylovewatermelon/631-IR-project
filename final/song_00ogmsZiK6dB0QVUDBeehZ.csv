verse
i left my daddy round 97 he was lazy
couldnt hit the grind but making babies im crazy
smoking bouquet cop it from my niggas pushing daisies
like a romance push a nigga buttons like a program
i been on the j√§ger for a day girl watch me slow dance
tough as conan this the art of barbarian
i got four white girls all aryan
i wonder what their daddy think fuck em its a revolution
fuck it fuck em take a break let em fuck each other
i aint your everyday normal brother porno lover
she savin children by the low and guzzle what is muscle
and im finessing like im timmy duncan win you something
immaculate this scatter rapping no passing my blunt
dont you put me on freshman covers im posing with lunch
think they worthy of presence presently passing em up
no competing with bleachers jogging im running amuck
sweet jesus i fuck around and need a street sweeper
leave the bodies on the culdesac follow me the cult is back
sippin on that cognac and that jim jones
watching movies like damn that vince vaughn is a funny cat
fred claus and the kelly up in your closet
belly full of smog again ciggys just make me nauseous
wonder how the fuck you let a nigga make you cautious
but you jamming out to fucking marilyn and ozzy shit
ponzi scheme selling everybody dreams
killer like your neighbour im as nice as everybody seems
we just breaking bad and my brother serving walter white
hope he aint caught with that possession like a poltergeist
momma where the priests at why we gotta lease that
why we cant own that all these fed loaners
aint no forewarning came bombing and im just vietnam
if you gon be trippin like a bitch you should be a mom see the sonyou might also like56embed"
