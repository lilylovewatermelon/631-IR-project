you know its fade on sight
if you don’t come right
you know its fade on sight
if you dont come right
baby come over you should lay over
girl i want your love
you know i need it know i need it
baby come over you should lay over
girl i want your love
you know i need it know i need it

verse 1 kadhja bonet
could it be
nobody knows your baby
not before but now i want more
yeah i want you baby
could it feel the same though if i know a secret thing
’cause we cant take it back no more
never the same but we can go on
cause i just wanna be your baby

chorus miknna
baby come over you should lay over
girl i want your love
you know i need it know i need it
baby come over you should lay over
girl i want your love
you know i need it know i need it
you know its fade on sight
if you dont come right
gonna catch this flight
it was love at first sight

yeah ah look
well i get nervous every time i see you baby
it really hurts me every time you go
i think youre perfect
but you wont believe me
if i said it to the world
would you let everybody know
or would you get worried
that maybe you feel the way i do
maybe you dont lately i’ve been on the move
and it feel like an episode from a show where
i don’t really know whos the leading role
but rolling with a leader isn’t easy just believe me
on god i can see it
hope you send me your peace to exorcise my demon
maybe a shrink will probably
get a blink of what im thinking
ive been smoking ive been drinking
and i’m hoping you can see me
if you saw me tell me have you seen her
i really need her
ive only got a two seater
my car dont go in reverse
dont wanna leave her
and never see her
if i dont the hearts stinger
steve irwin she hurt me it hurt
chorus miknna
baby come over you should lay over
girl i want your love
you know i need it know i need it
baby come over you should lay over
baby i want your love
you know i need it know i need it
you know its fade on sight
if you dont come right
you know its fade on sight
if you dont come right
you know its fade on sight
if you dont come right
gonna catch this flight
it was love at first sight
you know its fade on sight
if you dont come right
gonna catch this
