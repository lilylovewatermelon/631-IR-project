conquest to the lover and your love to the fire
permanence unfolding in the absolute
forgiveness is the ultimate sacrifice
eloquence belongs to the conqueror
the pictures of time and space are rearranged
in this little piece of typical tragedy
justified candy brandy for the nerves
eloquence belongs to the conqueror

chorus serj tankian  daron malakian
you and me well all go down in history
with a sad statue of liberty
and a generation that didnt agree
you and me well all go down in history
with a sad statue of liberty
and a generation that didnt agree

verse 2 serj tankian serj tankian  daron malakian
i forgot to i forgot to let you know that
justified candy brandy for the nerves
eloquence belongs to the conqueror
conquest to the lover and your love to the fire
permanence unfolding in the absolute
forgiveness is the ultimate sacrifice
eloquence belongs to the conqueror
