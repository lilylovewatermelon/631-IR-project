yeah holding back
yeah ive always been good at that unattached yeah
waiting for whats coming next things i know i should address
i feel more together when i am a mess whoa
got some moments that just came and went
made amends with you then you overstepped
thats a line you never shoulda crossed you got no respect
stop with all the threats
like the more i get to know you i just know you less yeah
nother city i dont know well
feeling too much like my old self
backsliding backsliding
got me in the sad feels got me at a standstill
too much time alone is when it gets real ah
future doesnt pop up then the past will
upside thats a rare view
now im going downhill yeah
dont know who im close with
going through the motions
dont know who to trust when i yeah

prechorus
i lie to myself and i i cant handle it
why do i waste so much time on things that i cant fix
all these things i hold inside i just cant forget

verse 2
yeah maybe im impossible to be with
i know that you got a thousand reasons
you probably wanna leave but dont know how yeah
i dont hear a thing when you yell
guess you like to hear your own voice yeah
got me standing here with no choice
i see they tryna guess they got me all wrong
look im doing my best to try to stay calm
but i cant deal cant deal
feeling too much like my old self
backsliding backsliding
i just let the phone ring
we aint even close please
throwing out opinions from the nosebleeds ayy yeah
lot of issues that you dont see
texts that i just wont read
play it off it cuts deep though
when i dont know who im close with
going through the motions
dont know who to trust when i yeah
