i see your fingerprints
the work of your hands
its all in your hands
i see the evidence
leaving nothing to chance
the worlds in your hands

prechorus
so i rest in your promises
now i am sure of this im yours

chorus
let the waters rise
i will stand as the oceans roar
let the earth shake beneath me
let the mountains fall
you are god over the storm
and i am yours

verse 2
i hear the voice of love
calling me home
to where i belong
it cripples every fear
and the ones who will kneel
will walk away healed
