a nigga raise his voice at me and he out of there
that k will sit you down and spin you like a barber chair
jet black mink with the hood call me papa bear
stupid ass nigga i need 10 for a feature
if you hear a nigga chased me
i was running to a heater
pop and leave his head hot
somebody check him for a fever
shout to my bitch and the bitches that want to be her nigga
me and that boy curry got some shit in common
last night we put up thirty niggas couldnt stop us
he put up thirty points i put up thirty thousand
them niggas be shooting hoops
we be shooting choppas
