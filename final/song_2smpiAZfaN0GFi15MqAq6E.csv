tracing our fingers from right to left
were too drunk to even walk
and all of a sudden you bring up our problems
so i guess you wanna talk
cause they say the bigger the love the harder the fall
well im crashing through the floor

prechorus
said youre leaving
when the morning comes
all packed up

chorus
if the feelings gone
stay awake stay awake stay awake with me
just keep on holding on
stay awake stay awake stay awake with me

verse 2
all our memories are packed into boxes
stacked up against the door
cause they say the bigger the love the harder the fall
well im crashing through the floor

prechorus
i still feel your breath on my lips
as youre walking out the door
but my hand starts to slip
never felt like this before

if the feelings gone
stay awake stay awake stay awake with me
just keep on holding on
stay awake stay awake stay awake with me

ive been looking in the mirror
trying to figure myself out
ive been wondering where i went wrong
but now youre not here
its like the daylight never comes
so ill keep on holding on

prechorus
said youre leaving
when the morning comes
all packed up

chorus
if the feelings gone
stay awake stay awake stay awake with me
just keep on holding on
stay awake stay awake stay awake with me
if the feelings gone
stay awake stay awake stay awake with me
if the feelings gone
stay awake stay awake stay awake with me5embed"
