it was a long and dark december
from the rooftops i remember there was snow white snow
clearly i remember
from the windows they were watchin while we froze down below
when the futures architectured
by a carnival of idiots on show youd better lie low

chorus
if you love me wont you let me know

verse 2
was a long and dark december
when the banks became cathedrals and a fox became god
priests clutched onto bibles
hollowed out to fit their rifles and a cross was held aloft
bury me in armour
when im dead and hit the ground my nerves are poles that unfroze

chorus
and if you love me wont you let me know

interlude
ohoh

bridge
i dont wanna be a soldier
who the captain of some sinking ship would stow far below
see coldplay liveget tickets as low as 113you might also likechorus
so if you love me whyd you let me go

outro
i took my love down to violet hill
there we sat in snow all that time she was silent still
so if you love me wont you let me know
if you love me wont you let me know22embed"
