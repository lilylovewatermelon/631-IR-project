ive said this before
no matter how hard i try
i cant help be bored
while this world passes by

prechorus 1
so this revelations got no meaning
we lost it all in hopeless grieving
am i just losing grip
paint it black and just forget me
this worlds a sinking ship
cause our baggage is too heavy

chorus 1
i cant stop believing theres something to be said
what are we achieving with the bullshit that were fed
i know im not gonna stay or live to see the day
this world comes to be heres a resignation from me
a resignation from me
a resignation from me

dont tell me were close to something
that we dont even understand
were prisoners to our homes
some might say were all to blame
the outsides so unknown
i dont want you to complain

chorus 2
i cant find the answers to save humanity
i cant find the anger heres a resignation from me
a resignation from me
a resignation from me
a resignation from me
a resignation from me2embed"
