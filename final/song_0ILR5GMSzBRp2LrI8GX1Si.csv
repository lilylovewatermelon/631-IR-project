if i could find assurance to leave you behind
i know my better half would fade
and all my doubt is a staircase for you
up and out of this maze

prechorus
the first step is the one you believe in
the second one might be profound

chorus
id follow you down through the eye of the storm
dont worry ill keep you warm
id follow you down while were passin through space
i dont care if we fall from grace
ill follow you down

verse 2
you can have the money and the world the angels and the pearls
even trademark the color blue
just like the tower we never built in the shadow of all the guilt
when the other hand was pointed at you

prechorus
yeah the first step is the one you believe in
and the second one might be profound

down to where forever lies without a doubt im on your side
theres nowhere else that i would rather be
im not about to compromise give you up to say goodbye
ill guide you through the deep
ill keep you close to me

chorus
id follow you down through the eye of the storm
dont worry ill keep you warm
id follow you down while were passing through space
i dont care if we fall from grace
ill follow you

i know my better half would fade
