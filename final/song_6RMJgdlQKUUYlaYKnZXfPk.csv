i had this thought that all of our hearts are like apple seeds
waitin on sympathy waitin on love
and all that you are and all that the rain brings is empathy
right were youre meant to be right where you are

chorus
and all i know is the rain has left me still standin

verse 2
feathers will fly and lights will shine bright on the motorcade
its more like a hate parade its more like a hoax
but see through it all like youve got a gold pocket lookin glass
and i hope when youre lookin back you look back with love

chorus
and all i know is the rain has left me still standin
and you cant be sure of the morninyou might also likeembed"
