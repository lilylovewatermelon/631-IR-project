say that you love me even if its not true
and say that this storm is just passing through
baby tell me youre not leaving
its just the rainy season

verse 2
the airs getting heavy and we both know why
so dance one more dance and tell one more lie
baby lets keep make believing
that its just the rainy season

chorus
were taking on water
drop after drop were destroying this house
and each other
so make it stop
make it stop

wish i could just say it and words were enough
to keep you from being the one giving up
like the sky letting go for no reason
yeah in the rainy season
baby tell me youre not leaving
its just the rainy season
its just the rainy season
its just the rain
yeah its just the rain
its just the rainy season1embed"
