blue jeans white shirt
walked into the room you know you made my eyes burn
it was like james dean for sure
youre so fresh to death and sick as cacancer
you were sorta punk rock i grew up on hiphop
but you fit me better than my favorite sweater
and i know that love is mean ohoh and love hurts ohoh
but i still remember that day we met in december oh baby

chorus
i will love you til the end of time
i would wait a million years
promise youll remember that youre mine
baby can you see through the tears
love you more than those bitches before
say youll remember oh baby
say youll remember oh baby
ooh i will love you til the end of time

verse 2
big dreams gangsta
said you had to leave to start your life over
i was like no please stay here
we dont need no money we could make it all work
but he headed out on sunday said hed come home monday
i stayed up waiting anticipatin and pacing
but he was chasin ohoh paper ohoh
caught up in the game that was the last i heard

i will love you til the end of time
i would wait a million years
promise youll remember that youre mine
baby can you see through the tears
love you more than those bitches before
say youll remember oh baby
say youll remember oh baby
ooh i will love you til the end of time

bridge
you went out every night and baby thats alright
i told you that no matter what you did id be by your side
cause im a ride or die whether you fail or fly
well shit at least you tried
but when you walked out that door a piece of me died
told you i wanted more thats not what i had in mind
i just want it like before we were dancin all night
then they took you away stole you out of my life
you just need to remember

chorus
i will love you til the end of time
i would wait a million years
promise youll remember that youre mine
baby can you see through the tears
love you more than those bitches before
say youll remember oh baby
say youll remember oh baby
ooh i will love you til the end of time202embed"
