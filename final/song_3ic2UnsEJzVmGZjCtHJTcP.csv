but you don’t love me the way that i love you
’cause if you did girl you would not do those things you do
you kill my heart just to see if i will rise
above your anger and above your lies

chorus
but all i see of you is when you’re not so busy
oh you’re not so busy

verse 2
and you don’t love me the way that i love you
’cause if you did girl you would not do the things you do
you turned my life around and for that i am glad
however much i love you this love is getting bad

bridge
and oh my darling you could choose
the words that only you could use
but you know you’ll always be my girl girl
i’ll take you out just for a bite
and show you all the city sights
but you know you’ll always be my girl girl

verse 3
but you don’t love me the way that i love you oh
’cause if you did boy you would not do those things you do
you kill my heart just to see if i will rise
above your anger and above your lies

but all i see of you is when you’re not so busy

but you don’t love me you don’t care woman
