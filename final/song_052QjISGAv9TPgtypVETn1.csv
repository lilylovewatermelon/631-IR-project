hunter im laid out on the forest floor
arrows in my back and sides
down among the leaves and stones
you can wear my skin as armor
you can eat my flesh and bones
leave nothing that is needed
all i have is yours

chorus
and ill give myself up to your sharpened edges
i no longer cling to my life
yes im finally giving in

verse 2
teeth and hate end our relationship
of course its sad but thats the way it is
your violence always wins the day
yes your violence wins

chorus
and ill give myself up to your sharpened edges
i no longer cling to my life
yes im finally giving in

oh and you watch as the animals
lay themselves
down at your feet
a thousand bared teeth
a thousand bowed heads
yes theyre begging you for death

outro
the hunter does us all a great service
and weve done so much to deserve it
the hunter does us all a great service
and weve done so much to deserve it
the hunter does us all a great service
and weve done so much to deserve it
the hunter does us all a great service
and weve done so much to deserve it
the hunter does us all a great service
and weve done so much to deserve it â€Ž14embed"
