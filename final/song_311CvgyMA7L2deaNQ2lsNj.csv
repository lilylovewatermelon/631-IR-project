but i cant hear over your mouth
im thinking out loud
whats keeping me around
whats keeping me chained down to shapes and sounds
your parents car and your town

im nervous about staring across the room
and waiting for the walls to move
i dont see anybody else
and i dont need anybody else

im dirt beneath your feet
step all over me
i dont see anybody else
and i dont need anybody else
and i dont see anybody else
