when youre with me theres a light and i can see my way
when you speak to me its a song and i know what to say

girl you got those eyes that see
help me find the good thats inside me
cause youre the only one who really knows
how the feeling comes and why it goes

when youre with me theres a light and i can see my way
when you speak to me its a song and i know what to say
