how could you leave so unexpected
we waited we waited
for you but you just left us
we needed you i needed you

verse 1
yo i dont know what its like to be addicted to pills
but i do know what its like to be a witness it kills
mama told me she loved me im thinkin this isnt real
i think of you when i get a whiff of that cigarette smell yeah
welcome to the bottom of hell
they say pain is a prison let me out of my cell
you say you proud of me but you dont know me that well
sit in my room tears runnin down my face and i yell
into my pillowcases say you comin to get us
then call a minute later just to tell us youre not im humiliated
im in a room with a parent that i dont barely know
some lady in the corner watchin us while shes takin notes
i dont get it mom dont you want to watch your babies grow
i guess pills are more important all you have to say is no
but you wont do it will you you gon keep poppin til them pills kill you
i know youre gone but i can still feel you

chorus
why would you leave us why would you leave us
how could you leave us here
how could you leave us why would you leave us oh
hey

i got this picture in my room and it kills me
but i dont need a picture of my mom i need the real thing
now a relationship is somethin we wont ever have
but why do i feel like i lost somethin that i never had
you shoulda been there when i graduated
told me you loved me and congratulations
instead you left us at the window waitin
where you at mom
were too young to understand where you at huh
yeah i know them drugs have got you held captive
i can see it in your eyes they got your mind captured
some say its fun to get the high but i am not laughin
and what you dont realize and what youre not graspin
that i was nothin but a kid who couldnt understand it
i aint gon say that i forgive you cause it hasnt happened
i thought that maybe id feel better as time passes
if you really cared for me then where you at then

chorus
why would you leave us why would you leave us
how could you leave us here
how could you leave us why would you leave us oh
hey

verse 3
our last conversation you and i sat in the livin room
talkin bout my music and i brought you some to listen to
you started cryin tellin me this isnt you
a couple weeks later guess you were singin a different tune
you took them pills for the last time didnt you
they took you from us once i guess they came back to finish you
cryin my eyes out in the studio is difficult
music is the only place that i can go to speak to you
it took everything inside of me not to scream at your funeral
sittin in my chair that person talkin was pitiful
i wish you were here mama but every time i picture you
all i feel is pain i hate the way i remember you
they found you on the floor i could tell you felt hollow
gave everything you had plus your life to them pill bottles
you gave everything you had plus your life to them pill bottles
dont know if you hear me or not but if youre still watchin why
chorus
why would you leave us why would you leave us
how could you leave us here
how could you leave us why would you leave us oh
hey

outro
sometimes i think about like
sometimes i think about things like you know
when id have kids im like
you wont be there you know
you wont be there for any of that
and ill never get to see you again
sometimes i wish i wouldve just called you
i wish i would have just picked up the phone
i wish you were here
i mean you shouldve been there for us
you should have been here
them pills got you right
them pills got you right
i wish you were here112embed"
