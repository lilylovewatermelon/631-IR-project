was lightning from the top of a cloud
moving through the dark
a million miles an hour with somewhere to be

so why does it seem like a picture
thats hangin up on someone elses wall
lately i just havent been myself at all
its heavy on my mind

and im dreamin again
like ive always been
way down low
i still know

that the prettiest thing i ever did see
was dusty as the handle on the door
rusty as a nail stuck in the old pine floor
it looks like home to me

now im dreamin again
like ive always been
way down low
thinkin of the prettiest thing

dreamin
