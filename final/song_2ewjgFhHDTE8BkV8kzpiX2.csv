dead leaves and the dirty ground
when i know youre not around
shiny tops and soda pops
when i hear your lips make a sound
when i hear your lips make a sound
thirty notes in the mailbox
will tell you that im coming home
and i think im gonna stick around
for a while so youre not alone
for a while so youre not alone

verse 2
if you can hear a piano fall
you can hear me coming down the hall
if i could just hear your pretty voice
i dont think id need to see at all
dont think id need to see at all
soft hair and a velvet tongue
i want to give you what you give to me
and every breath that is in your lungs
is a tiny little gift to me
is a tiny little gift to me

bridge
i didnt feel so bad til the sun went down
then i come home
no one to wrap my arms around
wrap my arms around

well any man with a microphone
can tell you what he loves the most
and you know why you love at all
if youre thinking of the holy ghost
if youre thinking of the holy ghost4embed"
