im still dope—even if the bag aint coach
even if i dont smoke til the hydro roach
im still dope—rock a thrift store coat
and a fresh pair of moccasins comfortable for walkin in
no ar marketin this is my reality
still dope power walk burning off the calories
fact and not fallacy metal face family
imminent fatality taking us too casually
i got it its cool just part of the school
and im acin the lesson its time so quit stressin
still dope vibrant natural game
no ring no chain still bringin the pain
still dope—got no choice but to cope
listen take notes im showin you the ropes
still dope—very high dosage
my approach is lights out buenas noches
hold my glasses so i can get riddick
send em home tail tucked holdin they fitteds
cold as a guinness one pint miss
yo chill watch the table a fish might flip
crack jokes spit pop mad shit
thats what its made for cop that quick
drop that vic butterfingers oopsie
signed away your publishing for jordans and a loosie
the old onetwo see solo not groupie
all over they ass like sweats by juicy
cats is puss like sagwa and morris
stay spittin lines there is no chorus
deploying the troublesome sleep in bubblegum
thats a double dumb hum if you feel where im comin from
do it til ya lips are numb you gotta go for it
i stay moving forward im baby bear porridge
knicknack paddywack—fuck yall critics
this dime on the grind when it come to the spinach
conquered the id vicious like sid flow
not a nympho impress official
she rock mikes you wait to exhale
she rock shows like dmc rock cazals
she rock shells manicured nails
rock for every belle with a spliff to inhale
holdin she own cone of homegrown shrubbery
wont go hungry the flow too lovely
leavin grills dented on a suv rented
classic as vintage impalas thats all tinted
raw bidness like how them wifeys get hitted
authentic the track is so love im all in it
aww quit it of course im inclined to shine didick
line for line wit it climbin infinite
¿tu no sabe yo soy una bien mala madre
confident arent we playin it smartly
word to dios estrella is lethal
flow muy frio roll the dice chico
live crazy decent insanely frequent
strangely sleep wit one eye open not jokin outspoken
provokin and chokin ego strokin is lame
word bonder than james four alarm wit the flame
way ahead of the game we still playing the same
royalty in my veins itll always remain
forever doin my thing solo or crew i can hang
like ylang and ylang bring the yin to the yang
they got placenta for brains testing my venomous slang
fools get fitted for bangs and rented for change
some people think im deranged others a little bit strange
just tryin to rattle my cage cause im way out o they range
