late last night i was looking through pictures
flooded with memories i lied on the floor
and spread them around me like friends at a party
their faces remind me of all that ive known

chorus
still i cant forget all the hushed who and whys
all the fiction and lies all the tears and the laughs
take a walk through the past you and i hand in hand
as we look at this thing called us

verse 2
late last night i was pacing the hallway
reading the letters youd signed x and o
i turned out the lights and imagined you with me
i tried my hardest to cry but it just wouldnt come

chorus
still i cant forget all the hushed who and whys
all the fiction and lies all the tears and the laughs
take a walk through the past you and i hand in hand
as we look at this thing called us
all the hushed who and whys
all the fiction and lies all the tears and the laughs
take a walk through the past you and i hand in hand
as we look at this thing called trust

still i cant forget all the hushed who and whys
all the fiction and lies all the tears and the laughs
take a walk through the past you and i hand in hand
as we look at this thing called us
all the hushed who and whys
all the fiction and lies all the tears and the laughs
take a walk through the past you and i hand in hand
as we look at this thing called trustembed"
