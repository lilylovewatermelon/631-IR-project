in the rearview mirror i saw the setting sun on your neck
and felt the taste of you bubble up inside me
but with everybody watching us our every move we do have reputations
we keep it secret wont let them have it

prechorus
so come inside and be with me
alone with me alone with me alone

chorus
if you would let me give you pinky promise kisses
then i wouldnt have to scream your name
atop of every roof in the city of my heart
if i could see you once more to see you

bridge
come inside and be with me
alone with me alone with me alone

chorus
if you would let me give you pinky promise kisses
then i wouldnt have to scream your name
atop of every roof in the city of my heart
if i could see you if i could see you once more to see you
