trying to bend the truth
i cant pretend im who you want me to be so im
lying my way from

no chrome on the wheels im a grownup for real chill

verse 4 mike shinoda chester bennington both
yeah i remember what they taught to me
remember condescending talk of who i ought to be

trying to bend the truth
but the more i push the more im pulling away cause im
lying my way from
