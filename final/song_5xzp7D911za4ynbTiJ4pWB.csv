if heaven is a place where the angels go
well then ive got a story to tell
if heaven is a place where the angels go
then i guess youre going straight to hell

verse 1
dont wanna leave you now or never
cause were perfect together
never wanna be apart
dared to take on the simple life

there was trouble for us when i came home early
never would expect to see this
its fair to say i could not believe my eyes

prechorus
you cracked a smile but had nothing to say
so i made a list of how youre going to pay

chorus
i locked you out
left you naked in the front yard
burned all of your clothes
having nothing can be really hard
now im on the run
id do it all again
so catch me if you can
cause i took your car
with your baby in the back seat
wrecked your credit card youre in debt to a deadbeat
baby now you know how much it hurts
when i caught you in the act wearing nothing but a little smirk
you might also likeverse 2
now i feel better
but its hard to forget
i never think of looking back
cause time has no meaning when youre free
this is what you get
karma bitch
now i see who you really are
cause happiness is the best revenge

prechorus
but caught red handed with a grin on your face
didnt think youd be easy to replace

chorus
i locked you out
left you naked in the front yard
burned all of your clothes
having nothing can be really hard
now im on the run
id do it all again
so catch me if you can
cause i took your car
with your baby in the back seat
wrecked your credit card youre in debt to a deadbeat
baby now you know how much it hurts
when i caught you in the act wearing nothing but a little smirk
bridge
again and again and again and again and eyeah
if heaven is a place where the angels go
well then ive got a story to tell
if heaven is a place where the angels go
then i know im going straight to hell

chorus
i locked you out
left you naked in the front yard
burned all of your clothes
having nothing can be really hard
now im on the run
id do it all again
so catch me if you can
cause i took your car
with your baby in the back seat
wrecked your credit card youre in debt to a deadbeat
baby now you know how much it hurts
when i caught you in the act wearing nothing but a little smirk
