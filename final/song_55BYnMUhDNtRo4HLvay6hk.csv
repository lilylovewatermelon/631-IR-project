listen when i say
when i say its real
real life goes undefined
why must you be so miserable
everything you take
makes me more unreal
real lines are undefined
how can this be so miserable

chorus
under the summer rain
i burned away
under the summer rain
burn
you turned away
under the summer rain

verse 2
listen i cant make
make a sound or feel
feel fine i kissed the lies
why must they be so kissable
listen as i break
break the four wall seal
gorgeous eyes shine suicide
when will we be invisible
you might also likechorus
under the summer rain
i burned away
under the summer rain
burn
we burned away
under the summer rain
i burned away
under the summer rain
burn
you turned away

bridge
this is the fall
this is the long way down
and our lives look smaller now
and our lives look so small
will they hear you crying
this is the fall
this is the long way down
and our lives look smaller now
and our lives look so small

chorus
under the summer rain
i burned away
under the summer rain
burn
we burned away
under the summer rain
i burned away
under the summer rain
burn
we burned away
under the summer rain
burn
i burned away
under the summer rain
burn
you turned awayembed"
