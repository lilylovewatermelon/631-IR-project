forever and ever even today and after
i kept your picture forever
back in the late fifties we went to the prom and kissing
but you went home with tom ripley

chorus
throw the guy a meat bone put him on a train
thats the way it should end
living on the outskirts forty miles away
where the lonely road ends

verse 2
forever and ever even today and after
i still believe you can hear me
believer deceiver the question lies beneath the
letter i wrote you in late may

chorus
throw the guy a meat bone put him on a train
thats the way it should end
living on the outskirts forty miles away
where the lonely road ends

outro
where the lonely road ends
where the guitar gangsters singyou might also likeembed"
