i cant stop staring at you across the room
i can see you in my truck i can see you downtown
i can see you waking up i can see you laying down
see you in the lights dancing to the band
or here in my hand

so whats your name where you from
whats your drink when you get drunk
whats your sign whats your song
i want to know what turns you on
what you wear when you get home
who do you call when youre alone
every guy in here is thinking the same thing
girl whats your name

yeah weve never spoken
and youve never met me before im pretty sure
i can see you in the dark i can see you in a dress
i can see your pretty head sleeping on my chest
i cant help it its out of nowhere
oh but girl i gotta go there

whats your name where you from
whats your drink when you get drunk
whats your sign whats your song
i want to know what turns you on
what you wear when you get home
who do you call when youre alone
every guy in here is thinking the same thing
girl whats your name
