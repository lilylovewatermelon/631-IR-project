verse 1
i dont think bout anybody
but bein beside your body baby lalalalala la lalala lalalalalalala
you can leave open windows
dont care who see me out my clothes baby
yeah i like bananas and peaches
and some might say its indecent
thats just crazy thats just crazy
can i slide outta mine and into yours
heels on waitin at your door
i dont wanna play no more
leave everything on the floor

prechorus
you dont need a pole to see me strip
only thing i want zipped is your lips
take it to the top boy skinny dip
so hot your body on mine your body on
i dont even wanna get a grip
i just like it when you grab my hips
can you feel it through your fingertips how do i

how do i keep this on
how do i let you know
boy you deserve a show
deserve to get comfortable

i could tell when you locked the door
just what was going on

when can we take off all our clothes
when can we take off all our clothes when oh whoa
when can we take off all our clothes

refrain
baby youre so anxious

verse 2

let me know if you aint bout that nsfw
now its safe to finish what we started
first impression of you is you really like to party
swirlin all up on you cause you know i wanna dance
let me cordially invite you to this party in my pants
how you got me sprung and dont say sorry in advance
show me all your tatts not just the ones thats on your hands
whos your designer
is that birthday suit one of a kind uh
everything about you look like its on purpose
god was workin probably took some extra time though
ayy all up in my curves like a puzzle piece mmm
jigsaw let me see your muscleses mmm
after we fuck ima wanna cuddle
we could take it to the kitchen
ill be on the island come and eat mmm
chorus
how do i keep this on

anxious you cant take it

when can we take off all our clothes
can we take this off and get naked

when can we take off all our clothes when oh whoa
