i walked along the avenue
i never thought id meet a girl like you
meet a girl like you
with auburn hair and tawny eyes
the kind of eyes that hypnotize me through
hypnotize me through

chorus
and i ran i ran so far away
i couldnt get away

verse 2
a cloud appears above your head
a beam of light comes shining down on you
shining down on you
the cloud is moving nearer still
aurora borealis comes in view
aurora comes in view

chorus
and i ran i ran so far away
i just ran i ran all night and day
i couldnt get away

reached out a hand to touch your face
youre slowly disappearing from my view
disappearing from my view
reached out a hand to try again
im floating in a beam of light with you
a beam of light with you

chorus
and i ran i ran so far away
i just ran i ran all night and day
and i ran i ran so far away
i just ran i ran all night and day
i couldnt get away2embed"
