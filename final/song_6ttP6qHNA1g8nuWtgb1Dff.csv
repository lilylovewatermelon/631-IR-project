i asked my love to take a walk
take a walk just a little ways
and as we walked along we talked
of when would be our wedding day

chorus
and only say that youll be mine
in no others arms entwined
down beside where the waters flow
down by the banks of the ohio

verse 2
i asked her if shed marry me
and my wife forever be
she only turned her head away
and had no other words to say

chorus
and only say that youll be mine
in no others arms entwined
down beside where the waters flow
down by the banks of the ohio

verse 3
i plunged a knife into her breast
and told her she was going to rest
she cried oh willy dont murder me
im not prepared for eternity
i took her by her golden curls
and drug her down to the riverside
and there i threw her in to drown
and i watched her as she floated down
you might also likechorus
and only say that youll be mine
in no others arms entwined
down beside where the waters flow
down by the banks of the ohio

verse 4
and going home between twelve and one
i cried oh lord what have i done
ive killed the only girl i love
because she would not marry me

chorus
and only say that youll be mine
in no others arms entwined
down beside where the waters flow
down by the banks of the ohioembed"
