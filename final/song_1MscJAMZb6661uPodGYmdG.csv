how faint the tune
oh somewhere theres heaven
how high the moon
there is no moon above
when love is far away too
till it comes true
that you love me as i love you

somewhere theres music
its where you are
oh somewhere theres heaven
how near how far
the brightest night would shine
if you would come to me soon
until you will
ooh how still
my aching heart
how high the moon

somewhere theres music
its where you are
somewhere theres heaven
how near how far
the brightest night would shine
if you would come to me soon
until you will
ooh how still
my aching heart
how high the moon
