yah
big bag got em big mad
a nigga gettin to some money and his bitch bad
jumpin out the rolls truck with the temp tag
im gettin money i dont get mad ugh
ask a nigga in my hood he gon say that im stamped
and when them situations came i came out like a champ
when it was pourin down rain and i came out of it damp
but now its champagne showers when we poppin the champ ugh
we dodged all the feds and they traps
niggas cant be us cause they rats
stand tall point a finger never that
i knew a nigga had it all went to the bing aint get it back
thats why im humble as ever and i rumble whatever
dont chase hoes cause they come with this cheddar
i seen my man girl start actin bougie when he fuck up his cheddar
before you knew it niggas was fuckin her better
i knew about it and i
wanted to tell him i felt funny as ever
but when i told him he went runnin to tell her damn
remember i was down bad im talkin under the cellar
now the rolls royces come with umbrellas
for the rain and all the pain that we been through
if you dont feed your wolves they gon put you on the menu
thats why i be with family and some buls that i been knew
if money determined loyalty wed cut you with a ginsu
now i go against you facts

rule number one never count your homie pockets thinkin you deserve it
rule number two never trust a bitch thatll fuck you for some purses
rule number three save you some of that money shit you better stop splurgin
cause when its all said and done and you back at the bottom they gon treat you like you worthless
respect the game

verse 2
fuck the fame
we millionaires fuck your watch and lil chain
niggas disappear as quick as lil zane
you feelin yourself i know you got a lil lane
just hold your composure i seen this shit happen over and over
that couple hundred thousand holdin you over
that aint real money
thats bill money buy a rollie get a wheel money
catch a case pay a lawyer take a deal money
now you tapped out and got no appeal money
callin home like niggas done did you wrong
but when you had that money you couldve put niggas on
and the moment they put cuffs on you your bitch was gone
student of the game im just ahead of my class
im that nigga but i never got my head up my ass
you doin good but im ready for bad
and you wont never catch me frontin cause im used to bein second to last
respect the game
chorus
rule number one never count your homie pockets thinkin you deserve it
rule number two never trust a bitch thatll fuck you for some purses
rule number three save you some of that money shit you better stop splurgin
cause when its all said and done and you back at the bottom they gon treat you like you worthless
respect the game13embed"
