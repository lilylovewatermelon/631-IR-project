where were you when i was lost
when i was broke i heard my stomach talk
i remember when i broke the law
daddy tried to give me to the cops

chorus
if i closed the door and shut my mouth
i wouldnt be here right now
if i cared what they were talkin bout
i wouldnt be here right now
if i closed the door and shut my mouth
i wouldnt be here right now
if i cared what they were talkin bout
i wouldnt be here right now

verse 2
i was fifteen flunking out
they never let me leave the house
people saw me standing out
so niggas wanna run they mouth

chorus
if i closed the door and shut my mouth
i wouldnt be here right now
if i cared what they were talkin bout
i wouldnt be here right now
if i closed the door and shut my mouth
i wouldnt be here right now
if i cared what they were talkin bout
i wouldnt be here right now

these days dont approach me like you know what i
gave to get the trouble out my mind
living out the luggage under my eyes
word to my doubters on the eastside

outro
they cant hush me they cant push me out
you cant hush me you cant shut me out
you cant touch me you cant touch me now
you cant touch me you cant touch me now
you cant touch me you cant touch me now
without getting pat down
you cant touch me you cant touch me3embed"
