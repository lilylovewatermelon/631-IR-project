how neat im impressed
how did you come to be so blessed
youre a star you blaze
out like a sharp machine
like a whales moan
im here if thats what you want

chorus
here we are
youre pins im needles lets play
here we are
you want this then come on

verse 2
tune out everyone in the crowd
cause now its just me and you
come fall in love with the sound
make a pact to each other
when no ones around
put the cross between me and you
who wants to fuck with us now
