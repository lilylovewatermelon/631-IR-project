father hear my prayer
i need the perfect words
words that he will hear
and know theyre straight from you
i dont know what to say
i only know it hurts
to see my only friend slowly fade away

prechorus
so maybe this time ill speak the words of life
with your fire in my eyes
but that old familiar fear is tearing at my words
what am i so afraid of

chorus
cause here i go again
talkin bout the rain
and mulling over things that wont live past today
and as i dance around the truth
time is not his friend
this might be my last chance to tell him
that you love him
but here i go again here i go again

verse 2
lord you love him so you gave your only son
if he will just believe he will never die
but how then will he know what he has never heard
lord he has never seen mirrored in my life
