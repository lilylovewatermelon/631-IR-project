verse 1 bashy
ayy look yo no castaway no survivor
i aint lost and this aint shipwrecked
i feel small in this big wide world
and mommy aint said honey i shrunk the kids yet
i aint jesus but im walking on water
theres no bombs here theres no war cause
i can break out of jail with a lighter
so is there any point in making laws blud
this aint atlantis are you sure
i nearly suffocated when i touched the shore
no rain condoms it poured
and up the road youd never guess who i saw

verse 2 kano
uh uh uh its ka
look skip on the beat like ali in the gym yeah
honey im home this is where i wanna live yeah
just found it like nemo on the dlow
i dont know if its greener but its green though
on the other side of the fence bye to the ends
look no feds no stress no rent
no superficial shit this real flow
where the women look hot but the beach cold
and the speech goes like hi little lady
sex on the beach wanna try for a baby
word in the village im a little bit crazy
swagger on a hundred degrees no eighty
look if heaven had a vip
uh this is it white sand blue sea
but i dont know who they are
and im damn sure they dont know me
but i come in peace

cool white flag white flag
uhhuh no war no guns no corps
just life just love no hype just fun
no ties just me and my mind
just me and my wife but tell me if im dreamin
cause i dont wanna wake up till the evenin
and i dont wanna be left sleepin
from all the diseases that i breathe in
look respect the island no stealin
and dont bring religion here no three kings
integrated and we aint leavin
we come on a peace ting
white flag white flag
