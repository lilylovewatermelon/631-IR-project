goddamn goddamn conversations with legends
crazy how one day yo idols can turn into your brethren
bitches we severin hit up my jeweler watch him freeze us
breaking bread like im jesus money aint everything but somehow eases
better believe than think down and leave us
the baby cryin
crack cookin where my sister be fryin soul food
plus my other sister just went back to her old dude
he whoopin her ass—ill kill him ill kill him
ill motherfuckin kill him i said i really want to kill him—but i cant
cause if i do popo gon claim im the villain but i aint
see my vision from pictures i paint
do you feel it like i feel it i grip the mic and then kill it—okay im gone
as memories resurface from hella long in my past
chillin sippin sinatra from a flask
little bobby just a youngin skating was my hobby
tryna stay out of trouble my homie in jail for robbery
welfare food stamps and stealing from the sto
come home and see an eviction notice taped to my do
cant take no mo mama on drugs daddy mia
what can i say i just wanted to be a kid and play
to this day i pay homage to the gods to the greats
never stolen im from maryland
where they shoot you in the dark of the night
like christopher nolan for talking outta your colon
catch me rollin with the realest
lyricism the illest my chain is the chillest sub zero
far from a hero bitch im de niro in goodfellas
if your bitch around me best bring an umbrella
let me tap into my inner southern killer none other illa
murder the game and then resurrect it like thriller
yeah my skin is vanilla but bitch i dare ya to test my killa
we dont do it for the skrilla we do it for love
word to my homies up above we slingin like drugs
and overdose em like the dealer does logic
yeah

chorus
i swear this music in my genes like denim
lyricism seep in em like venom
yes i know the flow hotter than lucifer even though heaven sent him uh
verse 2
see my vision as ive elevated and risen
open your eyes despise lies told with deadly precision
i finally made my way up out that section 8 division
not by busting and killing though ive had my share of stealin
but by putting pen to this pad and dispersin these feelings
while the label only care about making a killin
feel my energy—i aint talking energy i mean inner g
thats the shit they never see
but i own supremacy number one—i better be
bitch i said i bet i be
take my kindness for weakness trying to get the better of me
tell me how is they gon remember me
as the artist that concocted the perfect recipe
or will they be addressing me talking less of me
just cause i was different
just cause i was doing what i love
and the fans say they love you but they push and they shove
cause they want what they want how they want when they want it
i just gave them twenty songs now they want another hunnid
i just see it as a challenge i could do it bitch i run it
worldwide tours type of shit i always wanted
while the rest of em just worry bout bitches and gettin blunted
still that same motherfucker from that ys1
only difference im stronger and better from when i begun
so when people that never knew me they tell me that i changed
that my music is different and my visions rearranged i just stop i just stop
and do my best to refrain
from having conversations with people that aint in my lane
will i die will i die will i live
give the world everything i have to give
this is feelings on the page know my wisdom not my age
understand that im a man not defined by his wage
even though its in the millions that shit dont define my brilliance
open your mind and maybe you can see the billions
of people that separated but all equal
to know the ending one must understand the prequel uh
chorus
i swear this music in my genes like denim
lyricism seep in em like venom
yes i know the flow hotter than lucifer even though heaven sent him
spit it like holy water prophetically repent em
then we gone280embed"
