you always break a heart when you break a promise
i guess i didnt practice what i preach
i know not telling you was so dishonest
but honestly the dishonesty was killing me

chorus
you asked a question and i lied
i think about it all the time
i was wrong to think im right
playing god with you and i
but the truth always comes out
in the silence it rings loud
where theres smoke theres a fire
now i know what you see
when you look at me
i will always be a liar

verse 2
and i know i wasnt doing all the right things
thought what you didnt know could never hurt so sorry bout it
but when the words slipped out it struck like lightning ooh
yeah keeping it from you just made it worse
i dont know what to do to do
cause theres no over you ooh
and i cant hear your name without feeling ashamed
afraid of losing you afraid of losing you
and so i bent the truth and so i bent the truth
and it only happened once but once was way too much yeah

you asked a question and i lied
i think about it all the time
i was wrong to think im right
playing god with you and i
but the truth always comes out
in the silence it rings loud
where theres smoke theres a fire
now i know what you see ah
when you look at me
i will always be a liar

outro
yeah i know what you see
when you look at me
i will always be a liar
yeah i know what you see
when you look at me
i will always be a liar3embed"
