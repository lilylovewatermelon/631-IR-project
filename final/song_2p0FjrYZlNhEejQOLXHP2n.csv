fine
we’re “damaged”
really “damaged”
but that does not make us “wise”
we’re not “special” we’re not “different”
we don’t choose who lives or dies
let’s be normal see bad movies
sneak a beer and watch tv
we’ll bake brownies or go bowling
don’t you want a life with me
can’t we be seventeen
that’s all i want to do
if you could let me in
i could be good with you
people hurt us

jd
or they vanish

veronica
and you’re right that really blows
but we let go—

jd
take a deep breath

then go buy some summer clothes
well go camping—

jd
play some poker

veronica
and we’ll eat some chili fries
maybe prom night

jd
maybe dancing
veronica
dont stop looking in my eyes

jd
your eyes

both
cant we be seventeen
is that so hard to do
if you could let me in
i could be good with you
let us be seventeen
if we still got the right
veronica
so what’s it gonna be
i wanna be with you

jd
i wanna be with you

veronica
wanna be with you

both
tonight

veronica
yeah we’re damaged

jd
badly damaged

both
but your love’s too good to lose

veronica
hold me tighter

jd
even closer
veronica
i’ll stay if i’m what you choose

jd
cant we be seventeen

veronica
if i am what you choose

jd
if weve still got the right

veronica
‘cause you’re the one i choose

jd
you’re the one i choose

both
you’re the one i choose17embed"
