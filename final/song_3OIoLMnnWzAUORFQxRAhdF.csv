i could find the whole meaning of life in those sad eyes
theyve seen things you never quite say but i hear
come out of hiding im right here beside you
and ill stay there as long as youll let me

because you matter to me
simple and plain and not much to ask from somebody
you matter to me
i promise you do you you matter too
i promise you do youll see
you matter to me

jenna
its addictive the minute you let yourself think
the things that i say just might matter to someone
all of this time ive been keeping my mind on the running away
and for the first time i think id consider the stay

because you matter to me
simple and plain and not much to ask from somebody
you matter to me
i promise you do you you matter too
i promise you do youll see
you matter to me
you might also likespoken
dear baby
i hope someday somebody wants to hold you for twenty minutes straight
they dont pull away they dont look at your face
and they dont try to kiss you
all they do is wrap you up in their arms and hold on tight without an ounce of selfishness in it
i hope you become addicted baby
i hope you become addicted to sayin things
and having them matter to someone

both
you matter to me
simple and plain and not much to ask from somebody
you matter to mejenna
i promise you do

you you matter too
i promise you do
you matter to medr pomatter
come out of hiding im right here beside you
as long as youll have me

i do promise you do
you matter to meboth
youll see
you matter to me2embed"
