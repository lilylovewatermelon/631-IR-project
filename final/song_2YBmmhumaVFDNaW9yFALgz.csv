more than just a dream

forty days and forty nights
i waited for a girl like you to come and save my life
recall the days i waited for you
you know the ones who said id never find someone like you

you were out of my league
all the things i believe
you were just the right kind
yeah you are more than just a dream
you were out of my league
got my heartbeat racing
if i die dont wake me
cause you are more than just a dream

from time to time i pinch myself
because i think my girl mistakes me for somebody else
and every time she takes my hand
all the wonders that remain become a simple fact

you were out of my league
all the things i believe
you were just the right kind
yeah you are more than just a dream
you were out of my league
got my heartbeat racing
if i die dont wake me
cause you are more than just a dream
you might also likeyou were out of my league
all the things i believe
you were just the right kind
yeah you are more than just a dream
you were out of my league
got my heartbeat racing
if i die dont wake me
cause you are more than just a dream

more than just a dream
more than just a dream
more than just a dream
more than just a dreamembed"
