when its all over but the shouting
when god the fathers done his final accounting
and i find out that i made the cut

boys im gonna get me a chariot
yeah
a big gold eagle on the hood
trans am chariot

gonna find my greatgreat granddaddy
that peace pipe smoking cherokee
gonna get him all schooled
in them mags and struts

then we gonna drag us a chariot
yeah
a big gold eagle painted on the hood
chariot

chorus
good lord wichita
sure hope samson aint no law dog
redneck you better outrun him
damn sure dont wanna get caught
you might also likecrime
what crime
we was all hopped up on new wine
and mamas gonna kill me if
i get kicked out of the choir
but you just gotta run them chariots

verse 2
now heres a little story happened long ago
one day ezekiel went out for a stroll
walking by the river low and behold
down came four angels in a cadillac gold
he said swing down sweet chariot
come on and give me a ride

so they scooped em up
the rig was souped up
man it had tvs inside
ol zeke was surprised cause his eyes had seen beyond
his wildest dreams
hed go on to see a thousand things

well paint that number eight on the drivers side
thats how old i was when i gave jesus my life
i stepped right up
and got washed in the blood
just a little kid singing bout a chariot
a big gold eagle painted on the hood
chariot

repeat chorus 2x

when its all over
but the shoutingembed"
