chorus
i told my mama that we good no matter the situation ooh
big crib in california where im situated ooh
and everybody think its cool because im rich and famous ooh
but they will never understand what my pain is
i told my dawgs we gon be good no matter the situation
i heard some people say i changed ever since i made it
but they the same ones on my line when they need something from mine
thats why they calls get declined i dont need the fakin

verse
im done with doin favors im done with doin fake shit
im done with fuckin with these bitches all they do is play me
im done with dealing with the pain im out here getting faded
