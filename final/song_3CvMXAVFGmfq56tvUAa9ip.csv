everybody

verse 1
everybody prays to god by different names tell me your version
you don’t have to play it down or fake it
don’t give me that bullshit
driving in the parking lot in the ‘cedes with counterfeit leather
looking like a circus clown gone crazy when we are together

chorus
heaven don’t play like violins
i been up over mountains
you’re not a book that i read
but i know how you love me

refrain
but but
but i know how you love me

verse 2
everybody frames the stars in silhouettes a great exhibition
even if the fates are wrong or innocent we all wanna listen
but it doesn’t pay to wait for so long on just a reflection
if you want to cash your stake in the answers
then ask me the questions
see odesza liveget tickets as low as 60you might also likechorus
heaven don’t play like violins
i been up over mountains
you’re not a book that i read
but i know how you love me

bridge
because of you i can’t relax
i can’t be still moving too fast
tell me what can i do i can’t relax
if i can’t be still moving too fast
am i moving too fast

refrain
but i know how you love me
but i know how you love me
everybody

outro
moving too fast or we moving too slow
moving too fast or we moving too slow
moving too fast or we moving too slow
moving too fast or we moving too slowembed"
