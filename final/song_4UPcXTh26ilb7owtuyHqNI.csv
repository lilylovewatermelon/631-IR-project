youre not alone
together we stand
ill be by your side you know ill take your hand
when it gets cold and it feels like the end
theres no place to go
you know i wont give in
no i wont give in

chorus
keep holding on
cause you know well make it through well make it through
just stay strong
cause you know im here for you im here for you
theres nothing you could say nothing you could say
nothing you could do nothing you could do
theres no other way when it comes to the truth
so keep holding on
cause you know well make it through well make it through

verse 2
so far away
i wish you were here
before its too late this could all disappear
before the doors close and it comes to an end
with you by my side i will fight and defend
ill fight and defend
