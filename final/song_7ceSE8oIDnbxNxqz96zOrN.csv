you dont have to worry any more
cause ill be your baby tonight

shut the lights and shut the shade
you dont have to be afraid
cause ill be your baby tonight

well that mockingbirds gonna sail away
were gonna forget it
that big fat moon
is gonna shine like a spoon
but were gonna let it
you wont regret it

kick your shoes off
and dont you fear
bring that bottle over here
cause ill be your baby tonight

well that mockingbirds gonna sail away
were gonna forget it
that big fat moon

but were gonna let it
you wont regret it
