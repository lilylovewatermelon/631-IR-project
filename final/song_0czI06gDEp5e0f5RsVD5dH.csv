do you ever think about running away
cause i was thinkin about leavin today
well follow forever where our hearts wanna go
maybe well live somewhere where nobody knows our names
then things might change for the good

hook 1
i wanna be somewhere so far away
to lie under the night at the end of another good day
i cant tell you how long well be gone
but as long as were together then forever is never too long
too long oh no

verse 2
do you ever think about not comin back
hoppin on a train and well burn up the tracks
well jump off somewhere that we dont know how to say
maybe hitch a ride from someone who can tell us the way
to where these things might change for the good

hook 2
i wanna be somewhere so far away
to lie under the night at the end of another good day
i cant tell you how long well be gone
but as long as were together then forever is never too
where forever is never too long
not with you right here by me
maybe maybe well just see
where this road will lead for us

i wanna be somewhere so far away
to lie under the night at the end of another good day
i cant tell you how long well be gone
but as long as were together then forever is never too
i wanna be somewhere so far away
to lie under the night at the end of another good day
i cant tell you how long well be gone
but as long as were together then forever is never too
forever is never too longembed"
