the sun set so late tonight
i wonder if you saw it too
wish i still had someone to lose
all i got are these summertime blues
bet theres a greeneyed darkhaired beauty
on some beach by monterey
lettin waves wash her pain away
but ill never know
bet theres some boys out in okie
that are prayin to get the job done
haulin hay and fightin off the sun
with ladies waitin in town

chorus
my summertime blues summertime blues
ive got nothin left to prove
im out of touch and out of tune
singin alone
to the birds up high and the souls below
all those boys who aint got no home
the beautiful girls ill never hold
this ones for you
my summertime blues
my summertime blues
see zach bryan liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likeverse 2
the quiet turns to revelry
as the sun burns away the spring
the coastlines start to sing
with the young and heartless
hilton head and the hamptons
where the rich all go to die
the young kids all get high
just to pass time
i bought a bottle of the best bourbon
a beatdown boy could buy
im gonna bury all my sorrow
as the summertime passes by

chorus
summertime blues summertime blues
ive got nothin left to prove
im out of touch and out of tune
singin alone
to the birds up high and the souls below
all those boys who aint got no home
the beautiful girls ill never hold
this ones for you
my summertime blues
my summertime blues
outro
the sun set so late tonight
i wonder if you saw it too
wish i still had someone to lose
all i got are these summertime bluesembed"
