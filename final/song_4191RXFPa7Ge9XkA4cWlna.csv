verse 1
somethings in the air right now
like im losin track of time time time
like i dont really care right now
but maybe thats fine
you werent even there that day
i was waitin on you you you
i wonder if you were aware that day
was the last straw for me and i knew

and left them by the stairs

i used to think you were shy shy
but maybe you just had nothing on your mind
maybe you were thinkin bout yourself all the time
