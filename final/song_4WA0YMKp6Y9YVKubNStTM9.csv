we got time to work it out
we got things so much better than money
now don’t we babe
don’t we have each other now
don’t we have each other now rosalia
now the medicine man raised his price
asking more for feeling nice ‘cause
because he knows we’ll pay
the bills we’ve got keep piling up
there never seems to be enough rosalia
baby don’t worry
we got time to work it out
we got things so much better than money
now don’t we babe
don’t we have each other now
don’t we have each other now rosalia
conversation one thing we never had
how come your compliments make me feel bad
i think about the future
let’s think about the future
are we gonna fall for
always wanting more and more oh rosalia
you have to leave me now i know
so far bud is all we grow
i can beg and plead but you took off
don’t go rosalia
rosalia baby don’t worry
we got time to work it out
we got things so much better than money
now don’t we babe
don’t we have each other now
don’t we have each other now rosaliayou might also likeembed"
