we have no future heaven wasnt made for me
we burn ourselves to hell as fast as it can be
and i wish that i could be the king
then id know that i am not alone

verse 2
maggots put on shirts sell each others shit
sometimes i feel so worthless sometimes i feel discarded
i wish that i was good enough
then id know that i am not alone

bridge
death is policeman death is the priest
death is the stereo death is tv
death is the tarot death is an angel
death is our god killing us all

chorus
she put the seeds in me
plant this dying tree
shes a burning string
im just the ashes
she put the seeds in me
plant this dying tree
shes a burning string
im just the ashes
she put the seeds in me
plant this dying tree
shes a burning stringyou might also like6embed"
