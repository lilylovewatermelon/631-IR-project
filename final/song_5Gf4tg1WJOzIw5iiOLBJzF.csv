there is love in your body but you cant hold it in
it pours from your eyes and spills from your skin
tenderest touch leaves the darkest of marks
and the kindest of kisses break the hardest of hearts

prechorus
the hardest of hearts
the hardest of hearts
the hardest of hearts

chorus 1
there is love in your body but you cant get it out
it gets stuck in your head wont come out of your mouth
sticks to your tongue and it shows on your face
that the sweetest of words have the bitterest taste

chorus
darling heart i loved you from the start
but youll never know what a fool ive been
darling heart i loved you from the start
but thats no excuse for the state im in

prechorus
the hardest of hearts
the hardest of hearts
the hardest of hearts

there is love in our bodies and it holds us together
but pulls us apart when were holding each other
we all need something to hold in the night
we dont care if it hurts when were holding too tight

chorus
there is love in your body but you cant get it out
it gets stuck in your head wont come out of your mouth
sticks to your tongue and it shows on your face
that the sweetest of words have the bitterest taste

chorus
darling heart i loved you from the start
but youll never know what a fool ive been
darling heart i loved you from the start
but thats no excuse for the state im in

prechorus
the hardest of hearts
the hardest of hearts
the hardest of hearts

bridge
my heart swells like the water in waves
cant stop myself before its too late
hold on to your heart
because im coming to take it
hold on to your heart
because im coming to break it
outro
hold on hold on the hardest of hearts
hold on hold on the hardest of hearts
hold on hold on the hardest of hearts
hold on hold on
the hardest of hearts hold on hold on
the hardest of hearts hold on hold on 
the hardest of hearts hold on hold on hold on hold on6embed"
