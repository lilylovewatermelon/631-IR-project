im on my way
cant settle down
stuck in ways of being an ass
and i got a lotta nerve that im ready to pass

verse 2
im on my way
cant settle down
stuck in ways of sadistic joy
my talent only goes as far as to annoy
im on my way

chorus
this is my main offender
this is what i got and it got me saying
why me

verse 3
im on my way
i get around
not all too sure about what i do
feel i gotta stop a second just to think it through
and so i stop

verse 4
im on my way
yeah i get around
thought it all over and now i spit it out
when i spit i spit on those that i care less about
im on my way
