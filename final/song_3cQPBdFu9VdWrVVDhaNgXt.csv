was the summer of 89
i fell in love and i learned to drive
me and becky didnt waste no time
went zero to sixtyfive one night
bein young was gettin old
we were headed down a dead end road
but we didnt care we were on a roll
hangin on for the ride

prechorus 1
those lines that we were crossin
carelessly tossin caution to the wind
we were wearin thin

chorus
we were livin for the minute
lovin every second of it
fearless wild and free
nothin could stop us
but one day time caught up with us
and woke us up in the middle of our dream
but not before she loved me
she loved me

verse 2
to think we thought that it would last
now lookin back i have to laugh
what a mess we made of that
now im not sure that id want it back
we learned a little bit about love
what it wasnt and what it was
it was fast and it was fun
the beginnin of the end of us
see jason aldean liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likeprechorus 2
but one day that road just ran out
yeah i still travel down it now and then
and once again

chorus
were livin for the minute
lovin every second of it
fearless wild and free
nothin could stop us
but one day time caught up with us
and woke us up in the middle of our dream
but not before she loved me

interlude

chorus
we were livin for the minute
lovin every second of it
fearless wild and free
nothin could stop us
but one day time caught up with us
and woke us up in the middle of our dream
but not before she loved me

outro
she loved me
she loved meembed"
