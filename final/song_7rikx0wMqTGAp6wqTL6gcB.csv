sometimes we fall
aint nothing new to me
dont get me wrong
i must say you gave up for this time now

chorus
stop tell me where you going
maybe the one you love isnt there
youre going under
but youre over it all so you dont care about all that i had to see
id watch you wait until you come around
around

verse 2
dont close your eyes
you need to see it all
its no surprise
that they break you down
at least they wont give you up

chorus
stop tell me where you going
maybe the one you love isnt there
youre going under
but youre over it all so you dont care about all that i had to see
id watch you wait until you come around
around

its all wonderful
living happily
to lose it all
think you have everything

chorus
stop tell me where you going
maybe the one you love isnt there
youre going under
but youre over it all so you dont care about all that i had to see
id watch you wait until you come around
around

chorus
stop tell me where you going
maybe the one you love isnt there
youre going under
but youre over it all so you dont care about all that i had to see
id watch you wait until you come around
