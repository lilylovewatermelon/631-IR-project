i feel no shame im proud of where i came from
i was born and raised in the boondocks
one thing i know no matter where i go
i keep my heart and soul in the boondocks

verse 1
i can feel that
muddy water runnin through my veins
and i can hear that
lullaby of the midnight train
and it sings to me and sounds familiar

chorus
i feel no shame im proud of where i came from
i was born and raised in the boondocks
one thing i know no matter where i go
i keep my heart and soul in the boondocks

verse 2
i can taste that honeysuckle
and its still so sweet
when it grows wild
on the banks down at old camp creek
yeah and it calls to me like a warm wind blowin

i feel no shame im proud of where i came from
i was born and raised in the boondocks

bridge 1
its where i learned about livin
its where i learned about love
its where i learned about workin hard
and havin a little was just enough
its where i learned about jesus
and knowin where i stand
you can take it or leave it
this is me this is who i am

bridge 2
give me a tin roof a front porch and a gravel road
and thatâ€™s home to me feels like home to me

chorus
i feel no shame im proud of where i came from

i keep my heart and soul in the boondocks
