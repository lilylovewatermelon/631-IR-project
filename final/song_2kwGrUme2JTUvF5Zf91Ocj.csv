book the firstclass flight fly me anywhere
making sure its somewhere far away awake me when we land
i never thought that i would be a millionaire
never in my life
on the verge of suicide i told the world its you or i
i have two sides
one that wants to see you all thrive and one that wants to see you die
fancy cars and fancy homes
wrecked and abandoned now youre regretting that loan
money on my mind i lost track of time
tried to spend it all in one night now im broke until ive died

verse 2 anthony mars
came home late night yeah
huggin on my parents tight told me that they missed me
followed by another fight wait
facebook gram likes how you doin on the mic
how you doin on the road i aint tryna tour no more
fuckin all these hoes only left me with a bigger hole
popping pills every night rotten on the inside
pain covered red eyes dont know how to get by
all they see is dollar signs all they see is dollar signs
