playing cool makes me lose my mind
i cant be someone i dont recognize
im not the type to have to say it twice
or wait for you til the end of the night

prechorus
ive been falling fast and you dont seem to move
but is it worse for me if i tell the truth
and are you just a poison that i shouldnt use
wish i could say to you
what i cant say to you

chorus
we could take it slower
wait until were older
but i might be somebody
you might not even know her
im going through changes
its a rollercoaster
but i might be somebody
you might not even know her
we could take it slower

postchorus
we could take it slower
see tate mcrae liveget tickets as low as 26you might also likeverse 2
who knows who ill be tomorrow
but i hope that you still like her the same
we might end up strangers somehow
you should get to know me today

prechorus
ive been falling fast and you dont seem to move
but is it worse for me if i tell the truth
and are you just a poison that i shouldnt use
wish i could say to you
what i cant say to you

chorus
we could take it slower
wait until were older
but i might be somebody
you might not even know her
im going through changes
its a rollercoaster
but i might be somebody
you might not even know her
we could take it slower
