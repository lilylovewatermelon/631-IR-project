taking to the floor with the reach to the sky
i loosen my tie i loosen my tie
locking down the door with the rhythm and rhyme
i loosen my tie i loosen my tie

verse 2
trying to recall what you want me to say
i shake your way i shake your way
counting on the night for a beautiful day
i shake your way i shake your way

refrain
and i say you cant get enough
no you cant get enough

chorus
given a chance
im gonna be somebody
if for one dance
im gonna be somebody
open the door
its gonna make you love me
facing the floor
im gonna be somebody
