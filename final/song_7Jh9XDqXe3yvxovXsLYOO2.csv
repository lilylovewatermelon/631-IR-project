big girl you are beautiful

verse
walks into the room feels like a big balloon
i said hey girls you are beautiful
diet coke and a pizza please diet coke im on my knees
screaming big girl you are beautiful

prechorus
you take your skinny girls i feel like im gonna die
cause a real woman needs a real man heres why
you take your girl and multiply her by four
now a whole lotta woman needs a whole lot more

chorus
get yourself to the butterfly lounge find yourself a big lady
big boy come on round and they’ll be calling you baby
no need to fantasize since i was in my braces
of a watering hole where the girls are round and curves in all the right places

postchorus
