when i look into your soft green eyes
when i see your delicate body
revealed to me as you slip off your dress
im reminded that what i feel for you will remain strong and true
long after the pleasures of the flesh

chorus
and ill go on loving you
ill go on loving you
ill go on loving you

verse 2
be it the wind or the rain or the moon up in the sky
the spin of the earth or the changes in the tide
i dont know what brought us together
what strange forces of nature
conspire to construct the present from the past

chorus
and ill go on loving you
ill go on loving you
ill go on loving you

verse 1
when i look into your soft green eyes
when i see your delicate body
revealed to me as you slip off your dress
im reminded that what i feel for you will remain strong and true
long after the pleasures of the flesh
