two kids a dog and a cautionary wife
while it was all going accordingly to plan
then billy brown fell in love with another man

he met his lover almost every single day
making excuses for his dodgy holiday
on some religion that he said he’d newly found
they didn’t know that his faith was earthly bound

brown oh billy brown
don’t let the stars get you down
don’t let the waves let you drown
brown oh billy brown
gonna pick you up like a paper cup
gonna shake the water out of every nook
oh billy brown

oh billy brown needed a place somewhere to go
he found an island off the coast of mexico
leaving his lover and his family behind
oh billy brown needed to find some peace of mind

then on his journey and his travels on the way
he met a girly who was brave enough to say…
when they made love he shared the burden of his mind
“oh billy brown you are a victim of the times”

don’t let the stars get you down
don’t let the waves let you drown
brown oh billy brown
gonna pick you up like a paper cup
gonna shake the water out of every nook

oh billy brown
oh billy brown had lived an ordinary life
two kids a dog and a cautionary wife
while it was all going accordingly to plan
then billy brown fell in love with another manembed"
