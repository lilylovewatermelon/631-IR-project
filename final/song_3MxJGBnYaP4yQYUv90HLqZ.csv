shut the door turn the light off
i wanna be with you i wanna feel your love
i wanna lay beside you
i cannot hide this even though i try
heart beats harder time escapes me
trembling hands touch skin
it makes this harder
and the tears stream down my face

prechorus harry
if we could only have this life for one more day
if we could only turn back time

chorus all
you know ill be your life your voice
your reason to be my love my heart
is breathing for this moment in time
ill find the words to say before you leave me today

verse 2 niall  harry niall harry louis
close the door throw the key
dont wanna be reminded dont wanna be seen
dont wanna be without you
my judgements clouded like tonights sky ahahah
hands are silent voice is numb
try to scream out my lungs
it makes this harder
and the tears stream down my face

your reason to be my love my heart

ill find the words to say before you leave me today

bridge zayn
flashing lights in my mind going back to the time
playing games in the street kicking balls with my feet
theres a numb in my toes standing close to the edge
theres a pile of my clothes at the end of your bed
as i feel myself fall make a joke of it all

chorus all zayn harry
