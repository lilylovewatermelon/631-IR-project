you were a whip around town with tinted windows down
alabama bound a dixieland delight
you were a summer silhouette a sunday cigarette
a hand me down cassette a turn on a dirt road dime
you were a rock back throw back
george strait tee too tight

its like the record stopped spinnin and youre gone again
and im stuck here alone
