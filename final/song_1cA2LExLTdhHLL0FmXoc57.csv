yeah its 50
one shot one kill whats the deal
yeah whats the deal

chorus
listen lil homie when it rains it pours
hollow tips and talons when it rains it pours
get caught in lead showers just because
niggas aint playin when it rains it pours
niggas get set up thats when it rains it pours
end up wet up thats when it rains it pours
it usually goes down over money and whores
but lil homie in my hood when it rains it pours

verse 1
aint nothin changed niggas doin the same ol shit
them new hollow tips in them same ol clips
in the projects niggas fuck with the same ol chicks
and somehow they still think they games so sick
now from the rip niggas know im bout my grip
i dont trick man i barely even feed a bitch
she say im stingy i say i dont need you bitch
go head leave see if i chase you shit
tell yo mammy i catch her in the streets ima get her
she know im on parole why she call police on a nigga
she just mad cause a nigga pockets on swole
when she ask to borrow some i say hell naw
i was tellin the lil homies all about this shit
to keep yo mind on yo money
and dont trust no bitch
ke ke hit high notes when them pigs came
but her ass kinda fat so niggas treat her the same
this is real

and say whats happenin to the captain

magazine from the store so he can look at the cars
and do pull ups in the park on the monkey bars
