theres a picture frame hangin at the end of the hall
pile of dust on the floor where my fist met the drywall
thats my mo leavin somethin broke everywhere i go
holes

verse 2
theres a rusty old truck door sittin in a field
that i filled full of buckshot every time i got
mad at something over nothin didnt matter at all

chorus
holes
in my life
down in my bones
from my heart
to my soul

verse 3
theres a lonely space on a big brass bed
where we first made love
and shed lay her head on my shoulder
before i told her it was over
holes

verse 4
theres a million conversations with my old man
bout who he was and who i am
that i never had i just wouldnt listen
i just kept digging myself down in em

holes
in my life
down in my bones
from my heart
to my soul
holes

bridge
well i woke up today put the shovel down
stepped out of my haze took a look around
saw a ray of light shinin through the clouds
so i climbed out
and i let it shine

chorus
down in my bones
from my heart
right through my soul
through all my holes
through all these holesembed"
