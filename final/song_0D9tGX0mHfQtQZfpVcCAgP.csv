ten years ago i got a call that nearly killed me
repeat yourself my hands are shaking
when i was told my friend was gone i felt so guilty
a thousand questions left unanswered

prechorus
ill bleed if you want me to
ill serenade before i do
ill bleed if you want me to

chorus
on and on although youre gone
candles burn without a flame on
our final call to you i know youre listening
how could you leave us that way
where did you go
ten years today

verse 2
ten years ago i stood beside the wood that held you
i must sit down my legs are shaking
we let you go with gifts of plectrums for your journey
and melodies to help you on your way

prechorus
ill bleed if you want me to
ill serenade before i do
ill bleed if you want me to

on and on although youre gone
candles burn without a flame on
our final call to you i know youre listening
how could you leave us that way
where did you go
ten years today
