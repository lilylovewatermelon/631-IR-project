go and take this the wrong way
you knew who i was with every step that i ran to you
only blue or black days
electin strange perfections in any stranger i choose

prechorus
would things be easier if there was a right way
honey there is no right way
chorus
and so i fall in love just a little oh a little bit
every day with someone new
i fall in love just a little oh a little bit
every day with someone new
i fall in love just a little oh a little bit
every day with someone new
i fall in love just a little oh a little bit
every day with someone new

verse 2
theres an art to lifes distraction
to somehow escape the burning wait the art of scrapin through
some like to imagine
the dark caress of someone else i guess any thrill will do

would things be easier if there was a right way
honey there is no right way

chorus
and so i fall in love just a little oh a little bit
every day with someone new
i fall in love just a little oh a little bit
every day with someone new
i fall in love just a little oh a little bit
every day with someone new
i fall in love just a little oh a little bit
every day with someone new

i wake at the first cringe of morning
and my hearts already sinned
how pure how sweet a love aretha
that you would pray for him

chorus
cause god knows i fall in love just a little oh a little bit
every day with someone new

every day with someone new
i fall in love just a little oh a little bit
every day with someone new
i fall in love just a little oh a little bit
every day with someone new

every day with someone new
i fall in love just a little oh a little bit
every day

love with every stranger
the stranger the better

every day with someone new
