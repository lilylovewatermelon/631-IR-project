just hold your breath
to make sure you wont wake up again
cause you ruined my 04
thats the best that i could hope for
to watch you fall apart from the inside
were gonna spread it to the world to the world
about how you lied
how you lied

verse 1
a free lesson on growing up
never trust anyone
to the point where your backs exposed
every person ive ever known was a fake and youll see your closest ones go first
who needs enemies youve got friends

prechorus
im a gentleman and youre a liar
i expect the best of you but its so hard
but its so hard
im a gentleman and youre a liar
i expect the best of you but its so hard
but its so hard

chorus
lets start over
when we reach the top well watch you bury yourself
this wasnt easy it wasnt easy
lets start over
when we reach the top well watch you bury yourself
this wasnt easy it wasnt easy

a free lesson on growing up
make the best of their worst
and never compromise what you feel is right
i make a point to be powerful when i speak
be the one that gives them nightmares when they sleep
never back down from anyone

prechorus
im a gentleman and youre a liar
i expect the best of you but its so hard but its so hard
but its so hard
im a gentleman and youre a liar
i expect the best of you but its so hard but its so hard
but its so hard

chorus
lets start over
when we reach the top well watch you bury yourself
this wasnt easy it wasnt easy
lets start over
when we reach the top well watch you bury yourself
this wasnt easy it wasnt easy

outro
i watched the weight of your world cave in to crush you
i watched the weight of your world cave in to crush you
i watched the weight of your world cave in to crush you
i watched the weight of your world cave in to crush youembed"
