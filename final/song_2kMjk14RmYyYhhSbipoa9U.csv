well it rains and it pours when youre out on your own
if i crash on the couch can i sleep in my clothes
cause ive spent the night dancing im drunk i suppose
if it looks like im laughing im really just askin to leave
this alone youre in time for the show
youre the one that i need im the one that you loathe
you can watch me corrode like a beast in repose
cause i love all the poison away with the boys in the band

prechorus
ive really been
on a bender and it shows
so why dont you blow me
a kiss before she goes

chorus
give me a shot to remember
and you can take all the pain away from me
your kiss and i will surrender
the sharpest lives are the deadliest to lead
a light to burn all the empires
so bright the sun is ashamed to rise and be
in love with all of these vampires
so you can leave like the sane abandoned me

theres a place in the dark where the animals go
you can take off your skin in the cannibal glow
juliet loves the beat and the lust it commands
drop the dagger and lather the blood on your hands romeo

prechorus
ive really been
on a bender and it shows
so why dont you blow me
a kiss before she goes

chorus
give me a shot to remember
and you can take all the pain away from me
your kiss and i will surrender
the sharpest lives are the deadliest to lead
a light to burn all the empires
so bright the sun is ashamed to rise and be
in love with all of these vampires
so you can leave like the sane abandoned me
interlude

chorus
give me a shot to remember
and you can take all the pain away from me

the sharpest lives are the deadliest to lead
a light to burn all the empires
so bright the sun is ashamed to rise and be
