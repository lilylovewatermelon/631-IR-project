i never seem to find a reason
to let you in again or forgive you
im sick of feeling like i need you
knowing i never did but i miss you

prechorus
taking and breaking and hating
i remember all you said to me now
faking forsaking and failing
my memories are all stained again

chorus
let me get inside your head
let me show you im prepared
let me stick my needles in
and let me hurt you again

verse 2
i never reach my indecision
to let you see again all i give you
im sick of feeding your attention
knowing i never did i distress you

prechorus
taking and breaking and hating
i remember all you said to me now
faking forsaking and failing
my memories are all stained again
