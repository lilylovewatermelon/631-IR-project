youve been on my mind
i grow fonder every day
lose myself in time
just thinking of your face
god only knows
why its taken me so long
to let my doubts go
youre the only one that i want

prechorus
i dont know why im scared
ive been here before
every feeling every word
ive imagined it all
youll never know if you never try
to forgive your past and simply be mine

chorus
i dare you to let me be your
your one and only
promise im worthy
to hold in your arms
so come on and give me the chance
to prove i am the one who can
walk that mile
until the end starts
