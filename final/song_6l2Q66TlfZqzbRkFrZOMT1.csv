one step two steps counting tiles on the floor
three steps four steps guess this means that im a whore
uhoh hell no how long til i reach the door
fuck me my feet are sore
im wearing last nights dress and i look like a hot ass mess
although my hair looks good cause i havent slept yet

chorus
make the elevator come a little faster
im pushing all the buttons but nothings happening
please god dont let anybody see me
please god ill do anything you ask of me
i promise no more walks of shame
so walk this way were walking were walking
walk this way were walking were walking

verse 2
last nights bubblegum no more bubbles no more yum
whered i get the wristband tell me theres no tramp stamp
one two three shoot no i know that shit aint cute
but damn it man it sure is fun party til the sun wakes up
okay now raise two hands if youve ever been guilty
and clap clap clap clap clap it out if youve walked with me

chorus
make the elevator come a little faster
im pushing all the buttons but nothings happening
please god dont let anybody see me
please god ill do anything you ask of me
i promise no more walks of shame
so walk this way were walking were walking
walk this way were walking were walking
see pnk liveget tickets as low as 32you might also likebridge
i shouldnt have let
em take my keys take my keys
they left me here with too much beer
my friends they hung me out to dry
its not my fault and thats why
im doin the walk of shame

chorus
make the elevator come a little faster
im pushing all the buttons but nothings happening
please god dont let anybody see me
please god ill do anything you ask of me
i promise no more walks of shame
so walk this way were walking were walking
walk this way were walking were walking
so walk this way were walking were walking
walk this way were walking were walking3embed"
