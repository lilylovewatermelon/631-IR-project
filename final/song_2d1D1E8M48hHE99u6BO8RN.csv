things are shaping up to be pretty odd
little deaths in musical beds
so it seems im someone ive never met
you will only hear these elegant crimes
fall on your ears from criminal dimes
they spill unfound from a pretty mouth

prechorus
and everybody gets there everybody gets their
and everybody gets their way
i never said i missed her when everybody kissed her
now i’m the only one to blame

chorus
things have changed for me and thats okay
i feel the same im on my way and i say
things have changed for me and thats okay

verse 2
i want to go where everyone goes
i want to know what everyone knows
i want to go where everyone feels the same
i never said id leave the city
i never said id leave this town
a falling out we wont tiptoe about
