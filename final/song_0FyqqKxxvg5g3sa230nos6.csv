hey boo show me youre ready
lips looking juicy like cherry

someone who understands just what a player needs
aint with those perfect girls that shit dont click with me
a very naughty girl thats what i need

verse 2 shaggy
handcuffs can you get freaky
how far will you go to please me
whips and chains girl are you down with that
strange places searching for pleasure
i want you to meet me wherever
wearing just an overcoat and hat
