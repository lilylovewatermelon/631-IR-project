i woke up early this morning around 4am
with the moon shining bright
as headlights on the interstate
i pulled the covers over my head
and tried to catch some sleep
but thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
ever since you found yourself in someone elses arms
ive been trying my best to get along
but thats ok
theres nothing left to say but

chorus
take your records take your freedom
take your memories i dont need them
take your space and take your reasons
but youll think of me
and take your cat and leave my sweater
cause we have nothing left to weather
in fact ill feel a whole lot better
but youll think of me youll think of me

verse 2
i went out driving trying to clear my head
i tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
i guess im feeling just a little tired of this
and all the baggage that seems to still exist
it seems the only blessing i have left to my name
is not knowing what we could have been
what we should have been
so

take your records take your freedom
take your memories i dont need them
take your space and take your reasons
but youll think of me
and take your cat and leave my sweater
cause we have nothing left to weather
in fact ill feel a whole lot better
but youll think of me

bridge
someday im going to run across your mind
dont worry ill be fine
im going to be alright
while youre sleeping with your pride
wishing i could hold you tight
ill be over you
and on with my life

chorus
so take your records take your freedom
take your memories i dont need them
and take your cat and leave my sweater
cause we have nothing left to weather
in fact ill feel a whole lot better
but youll think of me
take your records take your freedom
take your memories i dont need them
take your space and all your reasons
but youll think of me
and take your cat and leave my sweater
because we have nothing left to weather
in fact ill feel a whole lot better
but youll think of me youll think of me oh
outro
and youre going to think of me
