if youre waiting for your wings but you just got legs
and youre feeding all your chickens but they wont lay eggs
when you open up your drawers and see your janky clothes
just remember lifes in love with you but lets suppose
that god aint gonna drop you no hundred dollar bill
youre got to question your intentions
cause the bad ones kill

chorus
everybody wants the same thing
everybody wants the same thing
no trading places on the chain gang
it doesnt matter how you swing it
everybody wants the same thing

verse 2
when your exit sign is coming could be round any bend
now did you live your life proper did you just pretend
that you knew what you were talking about
which side was your fence
when the hammer comes down it never makes no sense
chaos is not a virtue paranoia loads the bases
just imagine giant rivers overflowing with their faces

chorus
everybody wants the same thing
everybody wants the same thing
no trading places on the chain gang
it doesnt matter how you swing it
everybody wants the same thing
