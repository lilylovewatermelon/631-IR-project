hold me like you want me
as a ghost come back and haunt me
oh oh oh
you are easy on my eyes
if this is love then make me blind
oh oh oh

chorus
if your waves could be the mountains i climb
if i could reach the peaks and touch your mind
oh oh the distance i would go
if confession leads to something real
its not a moment in time for the way i feel
oh oh oh no
im falling again
im falling again
im falling—

verse 2
reflecting in your eyes of blue
i am captured by the way you move
oh oh oh
how your voice could steal my breath
for a moment stop this beating chest
oh oh oh

if your waves could be the mountains i climb
if i could reach the peaks and touch your mind
oh oh the distance i would go
if confession leads to something real

oh oh oh no
im falling again
im falling again
im falling again
