thats it
looking back now i didnt know what it was supposed to be
and its like raising kids man
if you werent raised you dont know how to raise you know
i just did the best that i could with them because
they know fuckin well i love them
but i didnt do the best i could
i didnt know what the fuck i was doing
i didnt
i will never forget watching my mother get put in a straightjacket
and taken out of my home when i was only seven years old
she was diagnosed with dementia praecox and put in a mental institution
leaving my daddy alone with me and my little brother lloyd
i latеr had an evil stepmother who furthеr cemented the idea that i didnt need a mother
growing up without one had long lasting influence i didnt fully understand until much later in life
it bled into my relationships with family and those i had become romantically involved with
whenever i got too close to a woman i would cut her off
part of that was vindictive and partially based on fear
but it was also totally subconscious
looking back is a bitch isnt ityou might also like10embed"
