the unenlightened masses they cannot make the judgement call
give up free will forever their voices wont be heard at all
display obedience while never stepping out of line
and blindly swear allegiance let your country control your mind
let your country control your soul

chorus
live in ignorance and purchase your happiness
when blood and sweat is the real cost
thinking ceases the truth is lost
dont you worry youll be told exactly what to do
i give my people the lives they need
the righteous will succeed

bridge
the fires of greed will burn the weak
so well make freedom obsolete
making whole the fabric of society
collective consciousness controlled as you will see
mind control

outro
let your country control your soul
let your country control your soul
let your country control your soul
let your country control your soulyou might also like4embed"
