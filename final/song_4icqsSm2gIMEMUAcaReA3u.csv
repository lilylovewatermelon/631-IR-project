you are but a phoenix among feathers
youre broken by the waves among the sea
theyll let you die theyll let you wash away
but you swim as well as you fly

chorus sza
pretty little bird pretty little bird
youve hit the window a few times the window a few times
youre pretty little bird pretty little bird
you still aint scared of no heights
when the spiral down feels as good as the flight oh
when hating you feels good for the night
when the morning comes i hope youre still mine

postchorus sza
when the morning comes
if the morning comes i hope youre still mine
when the morning comes
when the morning comes i hope youre still mine if the morning comes
when the morning comes
if the morning comes

verse 2 sza
told you i like gentle giants so you softened up
and you been jackin beanin stalkin just to get to me love
i wanna be your golden goose i wanna shave my legs for you
i wanna take all of my hair down and let you lay in it
spread all of my limbs out and let you lay in it

verse 3 isaiah rashad
lately i feel like im robbin myself
like im robbin mines
diamond cerebral peek into your cortex
be faithful and free and just play in your vortex
i see you lana you fly by the pound pound
fly by the ounce ounce
fly to the south
dont mind them bitches thats cleanin my house
lord you can see lord
you see them heights that they just cant afford
i see them lights and you made for that shit
fuck all that cryin you pray for that shit but
outro sza  isaiah rashad sza
my wings dont spread like they used to
but i wanna fly with you
til we hit the heavens
but my wings dont spread like they used to
but i wanna fly with you
til we hit the heavens
til we hit the heavens
thought id seen you darling26embed"
