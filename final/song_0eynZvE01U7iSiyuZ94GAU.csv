digging in the ground
but i moonlight as an astronaut
mostly just sit around and howl

wont you come to my house tonight
we could sleep on the floor
i got this window that looks out to orion
i paid extra for

aw forget about the sun
hes forgotten us by now

kiss me so i remember how

well turn these sorrows into strangers
buy em a ticket on the train
drop em off at the station
watch em ride far away
far awaysee gregory alan isakov liveget tickets as low as 40you might also like2embed"
