irene walton chuckling i think you love mica
gabbie hanna hes really attractive and uh very athletic but he has instagram which is cool because uh they were raised like they werent allowed to have social media
irene walton yeah yeah yeah
gabbie hanna but then when they all turn 18 theyre all slowly okay for people who dont know were talking about ‘welcome to platheville’ now but ‘welcome to platheville’ is a show about this the plath family theres i think 10 kids and uh  in the 10 kids  like they werent allowed any sugar like the kid was 21 years old when he had his first cocacola uh so theyve never tried any desserts they uh theyve never watched tv or movies they never they werent allowed to listen to secular music they can only listen to christian rock and gospel so theyre like they live on a farm theyre not allowed to have friends or socialize
irene walton they dont play instruments right
gabbie hanna they all play instruments but they dont theyre not allowed to play instruments with other people except the family so theyre all pretty much like
irene walton oh geez
gabbie hanna i mean now that im like saying it its like the family itself is a cult and nobody else is invited you know what i mean
irene walton laughing
gabbie hanna theyre not evangelical type people who are like “joining the plath family”
irene walton sure sure sure
gabbie hanna they’re but the backstories are actually really sad of the family they the mom um her mom was like an alcoholic and i forget what the story was with her dad but she basically never had a family growing up so she her family is so important to her that she was like ‘im gonna make this family where nothing can tear us apart no drugs alcohol’
irene walton she’s just like ‘im gonna make a whole city’
both chuckling
gabbie hanna whos she pretty much did theres ten kids um but then the dude i told you the story about the kid
irene walton so you and i watched the first two episodes together
gabbie hanna are we spoiler alerting this
irene walton i mean i think everyone has seen it
gabbie hanna spoilers for the plath family really
irene walton i don’t know i think it did get a weird kinda cult no pun intended cult
following on tlc
gabbie hanna i mean its really interesting i wonder if there’s a new episode out
irene walton you and i watched the first two episodes
gabbie hanna yeah and then i watched some more without you
irene walton yeah and i dont have ’tlc go’ or whatever so i havent been able to watch it so after the first two i have no idea what happens and then you filled me in on something that happened about the baby
gabbie hannayeah listen im gonna tell everybody right now spoiler alert maybe this will make you watch the show so there they have ten kids we know all the kids and then they start talking about this son that they lost and we’re like damn this is like so sad that she lost this son and then theyre like showing pictures of him and like his baby clothes and then they say it was just a horrible horrible accident and i was like damn like what happened like they live on a farm it could have been like farm equipment it could have been like a tractor like the baby could have gotten into like anything can happen
irene walton inaudible
gabbie hanna dude i think about babies all the time im like ‘damn if you have a baby its like all day youre like is my baby gonna die’ thats all i cant i dont even have a baby in all day im like ‘yo is your baby gonna die’
irene walton and dustin laughing

irene walton yeah only if you hold its head wrong its a serial killer
gabbie hanna yo like this baby swallowed a watch battery now that babys dead and now that family is straight up they lost
irene walton which baby
gabbie hanna i just like read the story about a baby like this family was like “hey everybody make sure you like dont have any watch batteries accessible even on the floor like if you drop it make sure you find it cuz it will kill your baby from the inside out” its so fucking scary dude like theres glass and like if you spill some like chicken on the floor and
irene walton you know a baby died by honey in the first year
gabbie hanna it’s fucking crazy how easy it is to kill a baby
irene walton you know whats crazier is how much trial and error there
to go into to figure out what you can’t do
gabbie hanna yeah like if you like spill a little bit of chicken juice on the floor when youre making dinner and then the baby like touches it and then like puts it’s hand in its mouth the baby has salmonella salmonella salmonella
irene walton dude its far too eas its
gabbie hanna its too easy to kill a baby

gabbie hanna okay go ahead
irene walton so i was babysitting and i usually babysit like you know like four and up like kids who can like walk and take care of themselves somewhat um but every once in a while i would babysit a baby baby like a zero to one year old
gabbie hanna yeah
irene walton and so i was babysitting at like an eight month old ones and the parents had just gotten home so they were excited to see the kid it was like in the afternoon so everyone was still awake they were excited to see the kid they had to do something so they fucking for some godawful reason they put the kid on a table like a dinner table kind of vibe but the table had a bunch of playing cards on it like somebody had been playing solitaire or something
gabbie hanna ohhh
irene walton and so im trying to get all my shit together to leave because they just got home and i don’t want to be in the house when somebody else is in there disgusted noise um and so they had the baby on here so i was just kind of watching him as i was getting stuff together and theyre gone and this baby is slipping then sliding around on these
fucking cards falls off the table thank god i caught him and like i caught this baby and if i didnt come it would have been dead
gabbie hanna wow
irene walton or at least injured
gabbie hanna yo imagine driving cars with your baby in it

gabbie hanna im not doing it
irene walton were walking everywhere
gabbie hanna im not going through a red light because guess what some people
run them
irene walton mmhm
gabbie hanna and that is scary anyways back to this woman
irene walton yes
both irene and gabbie laughing
gabbie hanna everybody listening is like “what happened” so they set up the scene where like you know its a horrible horrible accident its like “oh my god like what happened in this baby” so the the journey is “damn you lost a baby” and then youre like “oh probably sick or something”
irene walton yeah
gabbie hanna and theyre like “wow horrible accident oh my god what happened in this baby” and then it reveals spoiler alert that she ran over her baby with her car
irene walton oh my god
gabbie hanna and i because i just imagine like my biggest fear is hitting somebody with a car in the first place
irene walton yeah
gabbie hanna but imagining having a baby and then not knowing your baby was about to like it just feeling the ‘bumpbump’ and you’re just like “what the fuck is that”
irene walton oh my god
gabbie hanna and its your fucking kid dude
irene walton was it do you know if it was if the baby died on impact or if they had to like take it to the hospital
gabbie hanna they didn’t go too far to detail because she was like obviously very upset talking about it
irene walton yeah how could you ever
gabbie hanna dude god bless that woman for like surviving that because i couldnt
irene walton yeah talk about that on national television dude
gabbie hanna to literally not die after that is like
irene walton yeah
gabbie hanna how do you survive and then she was saying that like afterwards it was the most she was like it “i i couldnt do anything” she was
like “i i didnt live for a year like i was a ghost”
irene walton yeah of course not
gabbie hanna yeah and then like
irene walton i didn’t live for a year after my dad died and he was like a
person who like lived his life and did everything and was just like whatever
gabbie hanna and you didnt kill him also
irene walton yeah and i wasn’t the one who ran oh my god
gabbie hanna like losing a son its hard enough just yeah yeah well the the baby was like walking around so i had to have been like 1 or 2 years old
irene walton i mean
gabbie hanna but either way
irene walton just anything yeah that’s
gabbie hanna yeah
irene walton a parent like thats what every parent says that their worst nightmare is like losing their kid before they
gabbie hanna which is like not the natural order of it
irene walton yeah
gabbie hanna and ive you know i heard people speak about losing a kid how its like the worst thing you can experience is losing your thing that you created because its not natural so that end of itself is like so fucked but then to blame yourself for that situation because i mean accident or not like  yeah how do you live with the fact that did that
irene walton yeah
gabbie hanna but honestly that she has incredible strength for
irene walton there were
gabbie hanna that was like a shocker that was like a plot to us if like the year though and that she said that it was like “oh my god”
irene walton jesus christ
gabbie hanna yeah
irene walton there was another i for sometimes i get i to weird youtube holes for a while its like i watch “penn  teller foolís” clips and then other times i watch like um oprah where
gabbie hanna for the people who dont know irene is  deep voice obsessed with penn
irene walton i i really okay i love magic
gabbie hanna okay but do your first story first we gotta stop doing that
irene walton oh laughing
gabbie hanna we’re so bad at that dude
irene walton but see it’s fun i like when people do that
gabbie hanna i like too but like whats it like i like when we talk but whats it like to listen to were doing it right now go back laughing
irene and dustin laughing
irene walton um okay so one of my youtube holes is oprahs “where are they now” even though i never watched “where were they now” in the first place
gabbie hanna laughing where were they then i dont know
irene walton who knows ive never watched oprah um but oprah had a very hard life by the way uh just a just a quick sidebar so she did aware they now about “the worst mother in the world” quote on im doing air quotes for those of you who arent watching “box of thoughts” in the “box of thoughts” youtube channel um and it was i um the im pretty sure youve heard about it but it was like i think 1520 years ago or something the mom who left her baby in the hot car
gabbie hanna i mean theres so many stories of that so i have no idea which one youre talking
irene walton that was this was like the the main one that people talked about a lot but its its that same thing of like “she was like just it was a really busy morning and she thought shed like she thought she had dropped her daughter off at daycare and she went to work which she was a teacher and administrator or something
gabbie hanna she thought she dropped her baby off whoa
irene walton yeah
gabbie hanna its like when kim kardashian left a building and then went back in and then came back out with her baby do you remember laughing
irene walton no thats
gabbie hanna paparazzi clips of her coming out and like “oh shit” then she went back and then she came back out with north
irene walton but see thats the things like that happens to parents all the fucking time
gabbie hanna yeah
irene walton 100 and like we only know that because its kim kardashian but like i guar i guarantee you if i called my mom right now and say “did you leave me somewhere” she’ll be like “yeah how many times what do you mean of course”
gabbie hanna i dont know i i dont feel like i should i i dont feel like excusing this woman for leaving her kid in the car
irene walton oh i mean thats not what im saying
gabbie hanna yeah
irene walton im saying thats just one of the like thats a terrible instance that happened my mom left me at home when we were supposed to go to the doctors whatever but like
gabbie hanna yeah like
irene walton yeah she like left her baby in the car
gabbie hanna thats like a neglect though
irene walton yeah oh bigtime
gabbie hanna like well okay i guess theres a difference between like she is a very very overwhelmed person who like genuinely was like “i dropped off my kid of course i did” and then whatever i guess the bigger issue is when people are like “im just running into the store” real quick and then leave their baby in the car because thats like an intentional dude i knew this kid who he like had a really traumatic life and he pretends like he doesnt but he told me
irene walton like to face to face or just because “i can handle it”
gabbie hanna hes like i i think that he doesnt like to express uh like whatever but one time his parents and a heatwave left him in the car like school was cancelled because it was such a bad heatwave and he they left him in the car to go shopping for barbecues and left him in the car for like two hours and when they came back they found him on the floor in the back seat with all of his clothes off and he as a kid was like “im gonna die” like he really thought he was gonna die and when he told me the story about he was like laughing about it because because we it was really hot in the car and he was like “uh has given me
memories of when like this happened” blahblahblah hes like laughing hes like “yeah is that crazy” and i was like “nah dude thats abuse like this is”
irene walton youre like “that is crazy”
gabbie hanna it’s really crazy you need to work through this chuckling
irene walton yeah
gabbie hanna ‘cause youre not processing this the way you should be processing it
irene walton thats heavy
gabbie hanna yeah it’s sad anyway ad reads
ad break
irene walton were back
gabbie hanna we’re back
irene walton thank you for listening to the ads
gabbie hanna hell yeah ouch oh my god my foot is so numb um okay there is something
irene walton is there a needle
gabbie hanna i broke it i sat on it too hard
irene walton oh
gabbie hanna okay so i would like to see what the top searches on pornhub are today
irene walton of course
gabbie hanna because the other day i was just on pornhub for no reason or just curious
irene walton of course
gabbie hanna and its had the number one search because i was searching because i preferences and
irene walton for your curiosity
gabbie hanna yes it was “frozen 2” which means enough people on pornhub
irene walton i were like
gabbie hanna not just frozen
irene walton oh
gabbie hanna frozen 2
yeah they wanted to see the new characters they were tired of just ana and el
gabbie hanna they wanted to see olaf get down with whoever the new characters are in the movie because i havent seen it so the number one search today is “shower curtain”
irene walton what does it look like when you click on shower curtain
gabbie hanna “cum on pawg after shower” but i dont see a curtain anywhere
irene walton “pawg” like the game like the disk
gabbie hanna “pawg”
irene walton oh
gabbie hanna is that a porn word that i dont know
irene walton im not sure
gabbie hanna should i google it
irene walton i’ll check
gabbie hanna “pawg”
irene walton i’ll see whats a “pawg” is
gabbie hanna “a fat ass white girl” fat is spelled with a ‘ph’ “a fat ass white girl girl with a fat ass and his white commonly said by black males is a pawg alright
gabbie hanna ive never heard that either is it because
irene walton oh its an acronym got it
gabbie hanna was it mean “fat ass white girl” with a p got it okay cool that makes sense because this is a fat ass white girl
gabbie and irene laughing
gabbie hanna okay so i also did i asked on my instagram for you guys to just give me random words because i had this thought because one time i was on pornhub not for any reason i was just curious and one of the recommended videos to me was “fucked up thot on a walmart bathroom floor” and i was like “this is strangely specific” how much walmart content is there so i looked up the word ‘walmart’ and a lot of fun things came up
irene walton yeah
gabbie hanna so now i just want to look up random words on pornhub and see what comes up this is kind of like a dane cook bit where he says something about the peanut butter smack or something like he looked up the word peanut butter on oh no no no he saw he was like “this is just the weirdest name” okay so “pickle” well
irene walton oh
gabbie irene and dustin laughing
gabbie hanna that was elli moore wants to see what happens speaking of searching on pornhub there are ten million one hundred and seventy four thousand two hundred and sixty videos on pornhub for free first of all
irene walton yeah why does anybody pay for a subscription
gabbie hanna why does people pay for porn second of all how
irene walton do you know that porn actresses really dont make very much money like
gabbie hanna no they dont at all
irene walton no
gabbie hanna like they really dont and then they have to pay for their own travel their own hotels their own hair their own makeup
their own
gabbie hanna their own like lingerie their own yeah yeah like they dont they dont make money because because its its so saturated
irene walton yeah
gabbie hanna like theres so many women who do it
they used make money 20 years ago
gabbie hanna yeah because it was like when it was really taboo so to do porn was like youre basically like shutting down every other option its like “im doing porn and thats what im doing”
irene walton yeah there’s
gabbie hanna so getting a woman to do porn was more difficult but now more people are feeling sexually free and doing what they want so like but theyre not being paid well theyre
not being treated well rashida jones did a documentary on it
irene walton really
gabbie hanna it’s really great its on netflix what the fuck is it called whats the porn documentary by rashida jones
dustin uh i dont known porn is not my world unfortunately
gabbie hanna hold on for real
dustin yeah
gabbie hanna rashida jones hold on documentary
irene walton there is a girl in my college class who like when we were all going around introducing ourselves theyd be like “whats your name what do you do” i was like “im irene i work here” and she was like “im my name and im a cam girl” and like nobody even bataneye it was just like “yeah sure”
gabbie hanna yeah its called “hot girls wanted”
irene walton gasp that was her’s
gabbie hanna yeah
irene walton i came in a long time ago
gabbie hanna yeah and it shows the the dark side of the porn
irene walton yeah seems like for sure
gabbie hanna theyre not treated well theyre not paid well its not as safe as they make it to be and there needs to be some type of regulation and it also goes towards i think its that documentary because theres another documentary i was watching on porn and how its so racist yeah a lot of the time too and like the girls were just like saying like “i just dont understand why it has to say like “big black cock” like can it just be “big cock”” you know be like even the girls were saying that so yeah um all right lets go back to we have to search pickle on pornhub which i have a feeling
irene walton i think itll be funny though because that would mean that somebody is calling their dick a pickle
gabbie hanna dude one time somebody sent me a porn that was a it was a thanksgiving special and the guy was making a turkey and then it turned into a woman on her like curled up like a turkey
irene chuckling
gabbie hanna and then he fucked her on the turkey platter and then she turned back into a turkey
irene walton thats hilarious
gabbie hanna and then he was fucking the turkey
irene walton thats brilliant
gabbie hanna yeah
irene walton thats just perfect direction thats what i call that
gabbie hanna that is ok “pickle” too much porn exists stop shooting it
gabbie dustin and irene laughing
gabbie hannawe dont need it anymore we will never run out of content you known what im so so

irene and dustin laughing

irene walton normal dicks
gabbie hanna “this fat long pickle isnt taking the place of dick sad face” “pornstars eating” this girls just eating a pickle yo im so pleasantly surprised
irene walton yeah
gabbie hanna “one pickle in my pussy” because i thought that i was just gonna get a bunch of content where guys were calling their dicks pickles but this did not disappoint
yeah i mean it was either one of the two
gabbie hanna however i do wish that these women were using cucumbers and not pickles
irene walton yeah because all the vinegar
gabbie hanna all the vinegar cannot be great for your ph

gabbie hanna i dont think so “uwu” you know that uwu think that people do online thats supposed to be like
