comes the morning when i can feel
that theres nothing left to be concealed
moving on a scene surreal
know my heart will never never be far from here

chorus
sure as im breathing sure as im sad
ill keep this wisdom in my flesh
i leave here believing more than i had
and theres a reason ill be reason ill be back

verse 2
as i walk the hemisphere
i got my wish to up and disappear
ive been wounded ive been healed
now for landing ive been landing ive been cleared

chorus
sure as im breathing sure as im sad
ill keep this wisdom in my flesh
i leave here believing more than i had
this love has got no ceilingyou might also like6embed"
