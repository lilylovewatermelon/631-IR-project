taxi driver
be my shrink for the hour
leave the meter runnin
its rush hour
so take the streets if you wanna
just outrun the demons could you

chorus
he said allahu akbar
i told him dont curse me
bobo you need prayer
i guess it couldnt hurt me
if it brings me to my knees
its a bad religion
oohoohhoo this unrequited love
to me its nothin but a oneman cult
and cyanide in my styrofoam cup
i can never make him love me
never make him love me
love me love me
love me love me oohoohhoo
love me love me oohoohhoo
love me love me oohoohhoo
love me love
