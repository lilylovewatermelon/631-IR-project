verse 1
another life another day another chance to make it great
im running to the money all the time so i can never be late
just me and my bitch even though she drive me crazy she still make my day

chorus
going through motions muddy emotions
going through motions muddy emotions
going through motions muddy emotions
back on my bullshit devil emoji
going through motions muddy emotions
going through motions muddy emotions
going through motions muddy emotions
back on my bullshit devil emoji

verse 2
boat rocking back and forth whats the commotion
i told her ima drown in her that bitch an ocean
if i cant make her smile ima be acting wild
she got a new man im gon pull up on him and shoot him down
i been goin through emotions bloody emotions
pour me a cup ima nod out
started pack smokin good dope rollin
maybe mary janell help me put the pills down
dead inside catch a look at my ghost
i pull up in a lambo or rari or rolls
got my girl by my side and they callin us goals
numb the pain take these percs to the mouth and the nose
im not a drug addict got it all wrong
im just a love addict til my heart gone
im just a love addict with the love songs
you with me is where you belong
