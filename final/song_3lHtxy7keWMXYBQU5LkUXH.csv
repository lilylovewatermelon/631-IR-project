you said i cant take no more
lying by the sycamore
and i know weve both been here before
you said fuck lets leave the blame
but heartache always feels the same
and i know weve both been here before

chorus
oh here i am settled in at your house
broken blinds keep the light coming out
and i am just the shape im in
ooh here i am settled in crying out
finding all the things that i cant do without
oh i am giving in
oh im in retrograde
oh im in retrograde
retrograde

verse 2
standing staring straight ahead
listening when stevie says mmm
come out of the darkness
feeling all ive ever known
fall away and letting go
oh come out of the darkness

ooh here i am settled in on your floor
quieting all the world outside your door
and i am reckoning
oh here i am settling freaking out
you bring me in to help me let me get me out
oh i i i im in retrograde
im in retrograde

outro
oh if only i could give in
if i could get out
if only i could break in
if you could let me out
if only i could let go
if i could sit out
if only i could get back
if i could let me out
oh im in retrograde
yeah mmm
im in retrograde
ooh ooh ooh1embed"
