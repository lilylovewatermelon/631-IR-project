working all this overtime
is good at keeping me occupied
hell with the stress
it aint killed me yet
doctor says i got to quit
get on the wagon and off of them damn cigarettes
but they aren’t killed me yet
doc you probably wonder why i dont care
why i dont change why i am not scared

chorus
cause i thought her leaving would stop my heart from beating
and getting over her would be my death
it hurts every night
when she dances through my mind
i still feel the sting of the loneliness
but it aint killed me yet

verse 2
she turned this house into a tomb
ghosts rattle in every room
theyre doing their best
but they aren’t killed me yet
so i lean on the bottle more every night
im probably past the point where i should give it a rest
but it aren’t killed me yet
no i am not saying ill never die
but until i do im on borrowed time
see eric church liveget tickets as low as 200you might also likechorus
cause i thought her leaving would stop my heart from beating
and getting over her would be my death
it hurts every night
when she dances through my mind
i still feel the sting of the loneliness
but it aint killed me yet
but it aint killed me yet

outro
it hurts every night
when she dances through my mind
i still feel the sting of loneliness
but it aint killed me yet3embed"
