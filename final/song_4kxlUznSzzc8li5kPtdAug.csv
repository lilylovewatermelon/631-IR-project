im shaking asshole
in weather remote

the snowfall oh
the snowing the color
we recover from oh

the christmastime coming
hangover approaching
weve been drinking for months

this christmastime though im coming over
coming from the north
im already done
wrapping up the presents i bought

overcoat
now take me anywhere oh
weve suffered enough
its scary to leave
when theyre leaving from work

theyre cutting us off
knowing not why
theyre calling on the telephone
roy do i know anyone
no i dont know anyoneyou might also like1embed"
