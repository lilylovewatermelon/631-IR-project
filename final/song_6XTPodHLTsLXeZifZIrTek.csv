im sorry i forsake you
im sorry that i left you
im sorry i did forget you
and im sorry that i made myself feel better
by making you feel never good enough
i know youll shine much brighter than i ever could
maybe that is why i was

chorus
scared of you
and in everything i do im still thinking of you
oh you
and i know you were scared of me
but every time i tried to love you i just fell through
too

verse 2
desculpame se te ofendi
desculpame se te esqueci
desculpame se eu te deixei
eu te deixei
e desculpame por me sentir bem com tua dor
sabes que te adoro mais sei que tu estrela é maior do que minha
do que minha
e é por isso
