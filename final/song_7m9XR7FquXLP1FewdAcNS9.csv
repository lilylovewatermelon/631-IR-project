how does a ragtag volunteer army in need of a shower
somehow defeat a global superpower
how do we emerge victorious from the quagmire
leave the battlefield waving betsy ross’ flag higher

he’s constantly confusin’ confoundin’ the british henchmen
ev’ryone give it up for america’s favorite fighting frenchman
