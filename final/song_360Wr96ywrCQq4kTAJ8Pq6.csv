tired blue boy walks my way
holding a girls hand
that basic bitch leaves finally
now i can take her man

prechorus
someone told me stay away from things that arent yours
but was he yours if he wanted me so bad

chorus
pacify her
shes getting on my nerves
you dont love her
stop lying with those words
pacify her
shes getting on my nerves
you dont love her
stop lying with those words
