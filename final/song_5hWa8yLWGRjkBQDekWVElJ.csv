ruby slipped a roofie in cream soda with a two piece
ridin uzi ridin twoseats slide two cups inside the koozie
im so slumped im so numb
swervin skrtin with the pump servin bumps
ruby da chump got to loosen the blunt
got a screw thats loose too but not the noose stuntin
gotta watch the fucking news making my debut stuntin
gettin goose from your bitch too juicin up the oven
yung ooze gotta prove that im a dime a dozen
suicidal so is my cousin
i got a gut feelin theres a blade up in my stomach
i dont fear god cause i know that he just bluffin
ima die one day open up the gates to nothin
heaven aint an option so before the buzzards start crunchin
ima keep on sayin fuck it
ima keep on sayin fuck em
ima keep on sayin nothing
unless you want to get to fuckin best keep on truckin uh

verse 2 anthony mars
curb checkin when im whippin with the leopard in the 94
hearin voices in my mind who
heroin down my nose like houston comin down
hunnid blades on the tahoe
light up my tobacco rebirth of the scarecrow
i just put my hand in my pocket found a xan ayy
cutthroat with the draco its the yung slenderman ayy
you aint seen a psycho til lil lick without his pills
my life just wanna give in every time these burdens build
on me on me on me
on me on me on mesee uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also like28embed"
