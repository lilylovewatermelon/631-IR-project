everyones afraid of their own life
if you could be anything you want
i bet youd be disappointed am i right
no one really knows the ones they love
if you knew everything they thought
i bet that you would wish that theyd just shut up

verse
well you were the dull sound of sharp math when you were alive
no ones going to play the harp when you die
and if i had a nickel for every damn dime
i’d have half the time do you mind

chorus 2
everyones afraid of their own lives
if you could be anything you want
i bet youd be disappointed am i right
am i right am i right am i right
am i right am i right am i right

and it’s our lives
its hard to remember it’s hard to remember were alive
for the first time
its hard to remember it’s hard to remember were alive
for the last time
its hard to remember it’s hard to remember to live
before you die
its hard to remember it’s hard to remember that our lives
are such a short time
its hard to remember it’s hard to remember when it takes
such a long time
its hard to remember
it’s hard to remember
