girl i see it in your eyes youre disappointed
cause im the foolish one that you anointed with your heart
i tore it apart
and girl what a mess i made upon your innocence
and no woman in the world deserves this
but here i am asking you for one more chance

prechorus harry
can we fall one more time
stop the tape and rewind
oh and if you walk away i know ill fade
cause there is nobody else

chorus harry all
its gotta be you only you
its got to be you oh only you
hey

verse 2 liam liam  zayn
now girl i hear it in your voice and how it trembles
when you speak to me i dont resemble who i was
youve almost had enough
and your actions speak louder than words
and youre about to break from all youve heard
but dont be scared i aint goin nowhere
