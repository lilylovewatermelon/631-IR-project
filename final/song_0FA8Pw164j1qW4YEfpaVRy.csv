i had to smash lil shawty with my jeans on
and i had my pistol in my pocket

im on hydroponic nigga full of bars and that red
im in camouflage and i fell in love with this bread
i dont ordinary no type of nigga i dont beg
i bet i keep that tool on me everywhere
spent a couple mill on my bitch last year
i just put a new whip on the eway
