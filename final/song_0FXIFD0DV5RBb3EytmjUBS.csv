hey you do you remember me
i used to sit next to you at school
and we indulged in all the extracurricular activities
we werent particularly cool

chorus
oh monday cycling
tuesday gymnastics
dancing on a friday night
i got bridge club on wednesday
archery on thursday
dancing on a friday night

verse 2
hey you could you ever fall for me
oh the way i fell for you
and do you dwell upon the thoughts that i occupy
or do you give yourself things to do

chorus
oh monday rowing
tuesday badminton
dancing on a friday night
i got ping pong on wednesday
needlework on thursday
dancing on a friday night
with you you rowr

monday tuesday
wednesday thursday
dancing on a friday night
let the music smother me
whole weekend recovery
dancing on a friday night

oh see the lady i adore
dancing on the dancing floor
dancing on a friday night
god the way she moves moves me
to write bad poetry
dancing on a friday night ooh
