breathe you out breathe you in
you keep coming back to tell me
youre the one who could have been
and my eyes see it all so clear
it was long ago and far away but it never disappears

prechorus
try to put it in the past
hold on to myself and dont look back

chorus
i dont wanna dream about
all the things that never were
and maybe i can live without
when im out from under
i dont wanna feel the pain
what good would it do me now
ill get it all figured out
when im out from under
from under from under from under

verse 2
so let me go just let me fly away
let me feel the space between us growing deeper
and much darker every day
watch me now and ill be someone new
my heart will be unbroken
it will open up for every one but you
you might also likeprechorus
even when i cross the line
its like a lie ive told a thousand times

chorus
i dont wanna dream about
all the things that never were
and maybe i can live without
when im out from under
i dont wanna feel the pain
what good would it do me now
ill get it all figured out
when im out from under
from under from under from under from under

bridge
and part of me still believes
when you say youre gonna stick around
and part of me still believes
we can find a way to work it out
but i know that we tried everything we could try
so lets just say goodbye forever

chorus
i dont wanna dream about
all the things that never were
and maybe i can live without
when im out from under
and i dont wanna feel the pain
what good would it do me now
ill get it all figured out
when im out from under
chorus
i dont wanna dream about
