what you would like to be
what is the destiny

what youd like to take and what youd like to leave
you know id love to see

people all around me say that im a fool
but its so hard to choose
when its just up to you

have you ever felt your life so tragedy
i was sold to play the game
but i didnt have a name
and i waited all my life to find my own

have you ever felt like you had to be
like everyone you see
so you know how to feel

did you realise it did it set you free
dyou know what my mind is made of
and i dont need to maybe
got to get rid of these inside myself

when it takes some time some time
for to draw the line draw the line
will you leave me blind
because i cant give you what you need
you might also likewhen the creeping inside
when the feeling drowned
i can make you change your mind

people all around me say that im a fool
but its so hard to choose
when its just up to you

on and on i feel my life so tradegy

when it takes some time some time
for to draw the line draw the line
will you leave me blind
because i cant give you what you need

when the creeping inside
when the feeling drowned
can i make you change your mind

take some time some time
for to draw the line draw the line
will you leave me blind
oh because i cant give you what you need

when the creeping inside
when the feeling drowned
wont you leave me blind
but i cant give you what you need
take some time
for to draw the line
will you leave me blind

when the creeping inside
when the feeling drowned
let me believe you changed your mindembed"
