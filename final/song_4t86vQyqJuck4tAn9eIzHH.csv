i bank on the funeral
cause i learned all my lessons that way
i chipped from my heaven sent
until i stole everything that i made

chorus
and this millstone is heavy as hell
and i canâ€™t see so well
and i still feel the swell
and my hands and my feet are expelled
better dead than in hell
and again with the swell

verse 2
i bank on the funeral
cause the truth is alive is okay
the salt was in other words
more flavorful in those days

chorus
and this millstone is heavy as hell
and i cant see so well
and i still feel the swell
and my hands and my feet are expelled
better dead than in hell
and again with the swell

oh and lesson learned could tell
better dead than in hell
oh and lesson learned could tell
better dead than in hell
oh and lesson learned could tell
better dead than in hell6embed"
