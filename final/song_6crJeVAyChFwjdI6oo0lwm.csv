verse 1
weve been waiting all year for this night
and the snow is glistening on the trees outside
and all the stockings are hung by the fireside
waitng for santa to arrive

prechorus
and all the love will show
cause everybody knows
its christmastime and
all the kids will see
the gifts under the tree
its the best time of the year for the family

chorus
its a wonderful feeling
feel the love in the room
from the floor to the ceiling
its that time of year
christmastime is here
and with the blessings from above
god sends you his love
and everythings okay
