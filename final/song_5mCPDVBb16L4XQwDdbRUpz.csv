seein you got ritualistic
cleansin my soul of addiction for now
cause im fallin apart yeah
tension
between us just like picket fences
you got issues that i won’t mention for now
’cause were fallin’ apart

chorus
passionate from miles away
passive with the things you say
passin up on my old ways
i cant blame you no no
passionate from miles away
passive with the things you say
passin up on my old ways
i can’t blame you no no

chorus
passionate from miles away
passive with the things you say

passive with the things you say
passin up on my old ways
i cant blame you no no
