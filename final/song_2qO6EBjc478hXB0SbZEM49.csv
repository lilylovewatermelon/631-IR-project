verse 2 neyo
got a diamond in the back sunroof top
got a diamond on my hat and my sunroof off
her mind strong but her body so soft
tattoo on her hip read “only for a boss”
she ain’t impressed with the way i ball
she said “you seen one ghost you seen ‘em all”
even though that thing cold
she said “a rolls royce or a civic daddy i’mma roll with you”
she ride for me die for me love me that’s how she do
i pulled up close and i tell her what’s true
