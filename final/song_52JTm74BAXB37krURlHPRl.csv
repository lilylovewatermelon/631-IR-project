free from the torment of sin
all this im giving up much as
the sun would decide to give in
explode into orange and
hear all the voices sing praises with hymns
mark the birth of a change
free from the torment of sin
all this im giving up

chorus
its not me
buried wreckage my soul
its not me
so who am i now

verse 2
over and over again
a light with a sharpened edge
cuts through the black empty space we call sky
beginning the cycle that stays
and i know in my heart we all die
like the day and the night
like the sun in the sky
all this im giving up

buried wreckage my soul
its not me
so who am i now
its not me
buried wreckage my soul
its not me
so who am i now who am i now

bridge
is there another side
beyond the black and white
a place i could meet you by
a place on the other side
ill let you know when i go
ill let you know when i go
when im gone
