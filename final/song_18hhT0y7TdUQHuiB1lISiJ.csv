verse 1
i guess they dont like me
but i never figured out why
i never tried to figure out why
i guess they think i dont like them either
dont like them at all
thats how life goes
thats how life goes

chorus
but i dont want to hold it back
i just need to learn how to let go
i dont know
i will never know
well never know but thats the greatest part
and i wont stop i wont stop
imma ride this wave
right to the shore of my grave
when i say goodbye to earth
when i say goodbye to earth
when i say goodbye to the third dimension
when i say goodbye to all this amnesia

verse 2
when i rock with you when i roll with you

and praise to father suns light oh

i could care less where that negativity is as im trying to float
where that stuff cant reach us

chorus
