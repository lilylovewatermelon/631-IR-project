this poisons my intoxication
i broke the needle off in my skin
picked the scabs and picked the bleeding
and assumed that it was all in vain

verse 1
a positive scab thats never healing
calloused hit me in the face
a burning bridge thats so misleading
poisons more potent now with the flame

chorus
let it bleed
and take the red for what its worth whoa
watch the fire
fill your lungs with smoke for the last time
if you feel like dying you might wanna sing

verse 2
the fire department couldnt drown the city
they didnt even try to wash it clean
and what did you think that i was sober
put me out â€˜cause im on fucking fire

verse 3
a positive scab thats never healing
i regret that i kept this clean
the most that i can do for you is keep on lying
its not a lie if you can let it sing
you might also likechorus
let it bleed
and take the red for what its worth whoa
watch the fire
fill your lungs with smoke for the last time
if you feel like dying you might wanna sing

bridge
hohohohohohohohoho
you might wanna sing
hahaha you might wanna sing
haha you might wanna sing
i want sing
you might wanna sing
you might wanna sing
you might wanna sing or scream it

refrain
this poisons my intoxication
i broke the needle off in my skin
picked the scabs and picked the bleeding
and assumed that it was all in vain

chorus
let it bleed
and take the red for what its worth whoa
watch the fire
fill your lungs with smoke for the last time
if you feel like dying
if you feel like dying
if you feel like dying you might wanna sing
outro
hahaha you might wanna sing
haha you might wanna sing
you might wanna sing or scream it3embed"
