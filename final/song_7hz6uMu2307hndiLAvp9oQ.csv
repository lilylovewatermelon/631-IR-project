come on out mary jane
im lookin through your windowpane
i heard the word youre back in town
i got some cheap cigarettes
your favorite beer girl wear the dress
i always dream about oh

verse 2
well chase the moon ride the stars
find the muscle in this car
i know its still got somethin left
yeah come on out take my hand
feel my heart girl understand
ive got a thunder poundin in my chest

chorus
hey i
cant see you as nothin but mine
and girl tonight
lets go crazy one more time

verse 3
well park the car climb the hood
turn it up when somethin good
starts playin through these rusted doors
and in the sticky sweet air tonight
ill kiss you girl til i get it right
cause i know thatll lead to more
see kip moore liveget tickets as low as 49you might also likeverse 4
the weeds have all grown around
where ill gently lay you down
and ill try to tell you how i feel
but youll place your finger on my mouth
whisper baby no not now
the night is young and we still got time to steal

chorus
hey i
cant see you as nothin but mine
and girl tonight
lets go crazy one more time
hey

verse 5
with the engine burnin through my jeans
i watch you fall fast asleep
and this smalltown sky fades from black to blue
and ill wipe a tear from my eye
but youll never know cause baby ill smile
as i wave goodbye to you

chorus
hey i
cant see you as nothin but mine
and girl tonight
lets go crazy one more time
outro
i guess ill always have this longin in my heart
and youll have a piece of me
but tonight theres a fire to start in our red burnin hearts
and youre all that ill ever need yeah2embed"
