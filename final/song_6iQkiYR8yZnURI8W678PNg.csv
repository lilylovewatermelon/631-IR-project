youre not looking for anything more than a
good time and an open door
a good band and a dance floor
then she walks in
you got a pickup line to throw but
she walks up and says hello
before you can even let it go
shes got you reeled in

prechorus
you cant escape it if you wanted to
you dont know what you got yourself into

chorus
youre blindfolded yo
walking south down the whiskey tracks
shes rolling north like a neon train
bolt of lightning in the night
speed of light you wont realize
youve been struck til you see the flame
her smilell slice you to the heart
there you are in the back of a bar
bleeding but you feel no pain
she wont cut you like a knife like a knife
that little look in her eyesll
cut you like a razor blade
you wait
see luke bryan liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likeverse 2
you aint used to playing by these rules
so you sit there and try to play it cool
do your best not to play the fool
but its too late now
you wanna see how far shell let you go
shell let you think youre in control

chorus
youre blindfolded
walking south down the whiskey tracks
shes rolling north like a neon train
bolt of lightning in the night
speed of light you wont realize
you been struck til you see the flame
her smilell slice you to the heart
there you are in the back of a bar
bleeding but you feel no pain
she wont cut you like a knife like a knife
that little look in her eyesll
cut you like a razor blade

bridge
you cant escape it if you wanted to
you dont know what you got yourself into
chorus
youre blindfolded
walking south down the whiskey tracks
shes rolling north like a neon train
bolt of lightning in the night
speed of light you wont realize
you been struck til you see the flame
her smilell slice you to the heart
there you are in the back of a bar
bleeding but you feel no pain
she wont cut you like a knife like a knife
that little look in her eyesll
cut you like a razor blade
she wont cut you like a knife like a knife
that little look in her eyesll
cut you like a razor blade
cut you like a razor blade
she cut you like a razor bladeembed"
