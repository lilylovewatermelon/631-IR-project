im so close i can taste it
the man on the moon keep playin
practical jokes plantin the mirrors and smoke that i fade away in
you be complainin and i cant explain it i guess
nothin compare to the feelin the feelin amazin
now im switchin location

im lookin for balance im in an oasis
well i need somebody to save me hmm
before i drive myself crazy

and all i know
if life is but a dream then so are we
show me somethin show me somethin somethin i can see

verse 2
yeah dont tell me to stop
let me keep goin until i cannot
life is a fantasy until you wake up in shock
hittin the ground im hittin the ground i fell from the top
you never expect to drop so hold on but

and when thats all you know it keep you on your toes
