no longer a danger to herself or others
she made up her mind and laced up her shoes
yelled down the hall but nobody answered
so she walked outside without an excuse

chorus
she can do anything she wants to
she can do whatever she wants to do
she could go home but shes not going to

verse 2
so she picks a direction its ninety to memphis
turns up the music so thoughts dont intrude
predictably winds up thinking of elvis
and wonders if he believed songs could come true

chorus
im asking for it if they do
doesnt know what she wants or what shes gonna do
a rebel without a clue

postchorus
oohooh ooh

bridge
so we spent what was left of our serotonin
to chew on our cheeks and stare at the moon
said she knows she lived through it to get to this moment
ate a sleeve of saltines on my floor and i knew then

i will do anything you want me to
i will do anything for you
i will do anything i will do anything
whatever you want me to do i will do

outro
whatever she wants
whatever she wants
whatever she wants whatever you want
whatever she wants whatever you want
i will do anything whatever you want
i will do anything whatever you want
whatever she wants whatever you want
whatever she wants whatever you want16embed"
