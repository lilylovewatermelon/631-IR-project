what can i say
i think i had enough
i think you keep playing to play
knowing that i feel sick
cmon just say it
just say you like to play
this game just to drive me wild

chorus
i let you pretend
but you know truth is that
i love you to death
like you love this game

and so i sit
and watch you play dumb
id like to see you play with the odds
on your plate instead
come on just say it
just say you like to keep this pace
just to drive me wild
