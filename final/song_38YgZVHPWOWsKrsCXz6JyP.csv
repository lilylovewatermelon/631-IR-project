i miss the sound of your voice
and i miss the rush of your skin
and i miss the still of the silence
as you breathe out and i breathe in

prechorus
if i could walk on water
if i could tell you whats next
id make you believe
id make you forget

chorus
so come on get higher loosen my lips
faith and desire and the swing of your hips
just pull me down hard
and drown me in love
so come on get higher loosen my lips
faith and desire and the swing of your hips
just pull me down hard
and drown me in love

verse 2
i miss the sound of your voice
the loudest thing in my head
and i ache to remember
