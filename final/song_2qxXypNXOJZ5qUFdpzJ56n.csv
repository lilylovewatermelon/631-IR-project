he woke up from dreaming and put on his shoes
started making his way past 2 in the morning
he hasnt been sober for days
leaning now into the breeze
remembering sunday he falls to his knees
they had breakfast together
but two eggs dont last
like the feeling of what he needs

prechorus alex gaskarth
now this place seems familiar to him
she pulled on his hand with a devilish grin
she led him upstairs she led him upstairs
left him dying to get in

chorus alex gaskarth
forgive me im trying to find
my calling im calling at night
i dont mean to be a bother
but have you seen this girl
shes been running through my dreams
and its driving me crazy it seems
im gonna ask her to marry me

verse 2 alex gaskarth
and even though she doesnt believe in love
hes determined to call her bluff
who could deny these butterflies
theyre filling his gut
waking the neighbors unfamiliar faces
he pleads though he tries
but hes only denied
now hes dying to get inside

bridge 1 alex gaskarth
the neighbors said she moved away
funny how it rained all day
i didnt think much of it then
but its starting to all make sense
oh i can see now that all of these clouds
are following me in my desperate endeavor
to find my whoever wherever she may be

bridge 2 alex gaskarth and juliet simms
im not coming back forgive me
ive done something so terrible
im terrified to speak im not calling im not calling
but youd expect that from me
im mixed up ill be blunt now the rain is just youre driving me crazy im
washing you out of my hair and out of my mind
keeping an eye on the world
from so many thousands of feet off the ground
im over you now im at home in the clouds
and towering over your head
outro alex gaskarth
well i guess ill go home now
i guess ill go home now
i guess ill go home now
i guess ill go home44embed"
