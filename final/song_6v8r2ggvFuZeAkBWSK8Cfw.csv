you wish on em party underneath em
way out there where its easy to see em stars
yeah if they line up tonight youre gonna
thank your lucky ones for shining down on you stars

chorus
you stopped and filled up
with a red and black one at the texaco
she hopped in your truck
sang along with one on the radio
big red one going down
feel like one in a small town
parked way out in the dark
and they danced on the hood
she was sitting on the shining light
then gave you that look
they were in her eyes she couldnt hide em
by the end of the night you were falling just like stars

verse 2
you stare at em swear if you could reach em
youd give her one cause shes got you seeing the stars
since that night she stole your heart

chorus
you stopped and filled up
with a red and black one at the texaco
she hopped in your truck
sang along with one on the radio
big red one going down
feel like one in a small town
parked way out in the dark
and they danced on the hood
she was sitting on the shining light
then gave you that look
they were in her eyes she couldnt hide em
by the end of the night you were falling just like stars
see cole swindell liveget tickets as low as 30you might also likebridge
she fell from em so you point your prayers at em
cause shes got you feeling about as high as em

chorus
since you stopped and filled up
with a red and black one at the texaco
she hopped in your truck
sang along with one on the radio
big red one going down
feel like one in a small town
parked way out in the dark
and they danced on the hood
she was sitting on the shining light
then gave you that look
they were in her eyes she couldnt hide em
by the end of the night you were falling just like stars
