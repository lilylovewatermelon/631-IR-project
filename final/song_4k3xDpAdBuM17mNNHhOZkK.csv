i can see it in your eyes that you wanna get out
i can see it in your eyes that you need it right now
that you need it right now
that you wanna get out
that you need it right now
that you wanna get out

chorus rainy bear  lil peep
yeah i just wanna hear the sound
drive our camaros out of town
baby we could leave right now woah
yeah i just wanna feel alive
baby take your time
smokin on this loud woah

verse 2 lil peep
girl you know you make my cold heart warm with a touch
one kiss then we fuckin i just cant get enough
put it on me thats the best part baby the trust
trust me i got nothin for you other than love
i remember eatin pussy on the back of the bus
i remember gettin nookie til the sun came up
all the places that you took me no one came with us
