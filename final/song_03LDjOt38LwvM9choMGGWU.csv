if i begged and if i cried
would it change the sky tonight
would it give me some light
should i wait for you to call
is there any hope at all
are you driftin by

chorus
when i think about it
i know that i was never there or even cared
the more i think about it
the less that i was able to share with you
i try to reach you i can almost feel you
youre nearly here and then
you disappear disappear disappear disappear
you disappear disappear disappear disappear

verse 2
and when i lie all by myself
i see your face i hear your voice
my heart stays faithful
and time has come and time has passed
if its good its got to last
it feels so right
you might also likechorus
when i think about it
i know that i was never there or even cared
the more i think about it
the less that i was able to share with you
i try to reach you i can almost feel you
youre nearly here and then
you disappear disappear disappear disappear
you disappear disappear disappear disappear
you you disappear disappear disappear disappear
you disappear

bridge
i missed all the signs one at a time
you were ready
what did i know starting our lives
now my love im ready to show

chorus
when i think about it
i know that i was never there or even cared
the more i think about it
the less that i was able to share with you
i try to reach you i can almost feel you
youre nearly here and then
you disappear
you disappear
you disappear
you disappear
