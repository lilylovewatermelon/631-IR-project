verse 1
pain hurt sadness and loneliness
balled all that shit right up
tossed it away to the bottomless pit
the part of my mind that slips
and the part of my mind so sick
i dont even like to take the trip unless im sloppy drunk
i pray for my mom how a teach had a son
that never gave a fuck about a scantron
all i wanted was to be a human being
and show all the world some new colors and scenes
imagine all types of beautiful scenery
i remember when i first had trees
smoked out a black and mild so dumb of me
now im grape cigarillo man
any young black kid guaranteed fan
hold it down humble pie on the humble
and i treat normal girls like models
reckless and young and my my moms calling
think i should hit decline
im numb faced while im thinking bout suicide

black robin hood riding high just like we should
you know the saying aint no delaying
gotta gets the getting while the gettings good
yeah demented my brain was forced to transform
wise up im checking the gate
on humble tales and minimum wage
the blogs tell it cudis lame
wearing a kilt he must be gay
lets keep it trill fuck being discreet
but some girls tweet how they miss my meat
yeah cudders hbo that vitamin water
thats money to blow cause its money for blow
dont take no shit you can blame my ma
im in the maze im in a daze im losing it
im locking in my rocketship
ill be a blip on your radar bitch
feels like things can be covered
until the day im above myself hovered
