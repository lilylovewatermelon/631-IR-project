if you wanna climb a ladder on a water tower
then well kick it with the stars for a couple hours
if you wanna then were gonna get way up high
if you wanna dip your toes where the water stops
then well let our feet hang off a fishin dock
if you wanna then were gonna have to give it a try thats right

prechorus
if you wanna go way out where there aint nobody around
and let your long hair get to fallin down
and let your red lips leave their mark all over mine

if you wanna then were gonna girl
i hope youre gonna wanna tonight
if you wanna then were gonna girl
i hope youre gonna wanna all night

verse 2
if you wanna catch a buzz and ride it til the mornin
lets get two plastic cups and baby ill get to pourin

prechorus
if you wanna go way out where there aint nobody around
and let your long hair get to fallin down
