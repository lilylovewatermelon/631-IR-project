theres no use trying to relate to that older soul
and no use trying to debate that theyve got it wrong
theres no use pining for love when youre on your own
and no use crying outside if nobodys home
theres no use flying to the moon if they wont believe
so why do i go wrong on repeat

refrain
i was blinded by a memory
like its someone else like it wasnt me
and theres every chance ill be learning fast
and the day will come and then it will pass

chorus
what do you want when i say i wont
and though i try i do the same as though i must
and in the air of today is tomorrows dust

verse 2
theres no use trying to relate to that older soul
and no use biding your time if the bell is tolled

refrain
i was blinded by a memory
like its someone else like it wasnt me
and theres every chance ill be learning fast
and the day will come and then it will pass
you might also likebridge
sympathy for the fauna
fragile life in the sauna
in the sea getting warmer
endlessly round the corner

chorus
and though i try i do the same as though i must
and in the air of today is tomorrows dust
