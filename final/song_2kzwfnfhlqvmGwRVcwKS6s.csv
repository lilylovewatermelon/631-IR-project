i dont need no no nobody else
im sitting here thinking

i look through the mirror
and all that i see
is one crazy lonely sucker looking back at me
im sitting here thinkin
sittin here drinkin bout you

im just a man on a mission
tryin to make some decision
oh what am i gonna do
cause i aint going nowhere
if i cant be somewhere with you
boo boo boo

im sitting here thinkin
sittin here drinkin bout you

oh play it my brother

ohh im just a man on a mission
tryin to make some decision
ohh what am i gonna do
cause i aint going nowhere
if i cant be some where with you
boo boo boo
