outro arthur kar
nah im on its midnight i dont care
nothings happening on a wednesday i dont care im on
im looking for the smoke
this guy sitting front row man poof who needs that
let me put my window down i need fresh air
we dont want that we want bars
the reason why we listen to 21 and the boy
thats what we do in paris we dont do fashion week
fashion week its for the last decade its not for us
its about the lights the lights that we put on in the city
the lights of the eiffel tower
im in charge of it im the one whos putting it on every day
and you try to flex next next to me on the red light with your ugly whatever flexing most expensive car v12
i drive a fourcylinder i come from nothing but im doing something and you cannot catch my drive
as fast as you try to go you will never catch me man
there is only one way and this way im driving nobody can do it
im birdman thats who i am
in paris
