youre caps on some letters the devil wont recognize
you emphasize politeness
policy got to me battered but hard to beat heart beating
and im deaf and im dumb and im numb
but i empathize to reconcile and save time
screaming your feeling repeating your needs
i can read when you seethe
i repeat i know grief when i see it
believe me i know
creature fear creeping up seeking the weak in us
quit picking meat from us wolf in the sheep in us
preaching it justice
preaching adjustment
i should just shut up and cut the
goddamn lights off
its too late to turn back now
trust me theres a few ways to renew faith
its too late to earn those all just
grab all
grab all you came for
to rectify your nature to homeostasis
youre making a scene
youre making a scene baby
to wreck the scene
to recktify us
youre making a scene
youre making a scene baby
to wreck the scene
to wreck the scene
