i wanna be a bottle blonde
i dont know why but i feel conned
i wanna be an idle teen
i wish i hadnt been so clean
i wanna stay inside all day
i want the world to go away
i want blood guts and chocolate cake
i wanna be a real fake

chorus
yeah i wish id been a
wish id been a teen teen idle
wish id been a prom queen fighting for the title
instead of being sixteen and burning up a bible
feeling super super super
feeling super super super suicidal
the wasted years the wasted youth
the pretty lies the ugly truth
and the day has come where i have died
only to find ive come alive
verse 2
i wanna be a virgin pure
a 21st century whore
i want back my virginity
so i can feel infinity
i wanna drink until i ache
i wanna make a big mistake
i want blood guts and angel cake
im gonna puke it anyway

i wish i wasnt such a narcissist
i wish i didnt really kiss the mirror when im on my own
oh god im gonna die alone
adolescence didnt make sense
a little loss of innocence
the ugly years of being a fool
aint youth meant to be beautiful
