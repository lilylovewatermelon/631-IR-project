can you see yourself
through the bruises when the makeup melts
in the dark when all the powers out
everybody talks and gets around
when the money talks
do you think it gets the point across
its a burning coal youre walking on
and in a second all the pain is gone

chorus
i said its enough
i begged and i ran in circles
i climbed to the sun
and fell in a concrete jungle
i said its done
you never know if youll get what you wish for
i climbed to the sun
and i fell i fell
in a concrete junglе

verse 2
the coyotes cry
and the sirеns pass and harmonize
fires starting every day and night
burn around us while were trapped inside
wouldnt it be nice
to play the game without a crooked die
in a world where you dont have to hide
you dont have to live in a disguise

i said its enough
i begged and i ran in circles
i climbed to the sun
and fell in a concrete jungle
i said its done
you never know if youll get what you wish for
i climbed to the sun
and i fell i fell
in a concrete jungle

breakdown
and im the fucking king
i want things that money cant buy
the price is pain to make this right
and i could buy a thousand lives
so you can try to kill me but i cant fucking die
die

chorus
i said its enough
i begged and i ran in circles
i climbed to the sun
and fell in a concrete jungle
i said its done
you never know if youll get what you wish for
i climbed to the sun
and i fell i fell
in a concrete jungle
in a concrete jungle
outro
and im the fucking king2embed"
