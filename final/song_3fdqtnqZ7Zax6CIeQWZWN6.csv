its up for discussion up for reprise
slowly rethinking if current disguise deceives me
the shattered ring
i can see it in your eyes

chorus
ready or not
loaded heart with a dagger
aim for your sweet spot
i know youd rather be scared of
i know youd rather i just disappear
now that im here
i know youd rather

verse 2
giddy up goldilocks you took too long to save me
bumping that jadakiss is dangerous for sanity
open my candy box for you sir sugar daddy
look at how drunk we are spent the night dancing
spent the night dancing

chorus
ready or not
loaded heart with a dagger
aim for your sweet spot
i know youd rather be scared of
i know youd rather i just disappear
now that im here
i know youd rather
see sza liveget tickets as low as 143you might also likebridge
take me up take me up
i wanna live in your hot love balloon
ready or not
take me up take me up
take me up take me up
in your hot love balloon
take me up take me up
i wanna live in your hot love balloon

chorus
ready or not
loaded heart with a dagger
aim for your sweet spot
i know youd rather be scared of
i know youd rather i just disappear
now that im here
i know youd rather
i know youd rather
i know youd rather
i know youd rather
i know youd rather
i know youd rather
