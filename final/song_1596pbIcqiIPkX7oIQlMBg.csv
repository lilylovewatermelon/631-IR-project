tried to play it legit
tried to dance around the trouble now im standing in it
and i just cant believe that the whole worlds laughing at me
the kids in the street the ladies uptown
everybodies smiling but the guy with the frown
and i can hardly believe that the whole worlds laughing at me
they say at playing the fool everyone must take a turn
but when the spotlight lands on you it burns oh how it burns
you never learn
cant try it again
theres no way to restart
no turning back the clock
and unbreaking my heart
and i just cant believe that the whole worlds laughing at me
yeah the whole worlds laughing
just cant believe that the whole worlds laughing at me
why me
no i just cant believe that the whole worlds laughing at meyou might also likeembed"
