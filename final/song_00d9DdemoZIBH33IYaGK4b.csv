and messily eats a chocolate bar there are food stamps in
the mothers hands

up the free cheese kay

she looks up at the bright sun shielding her eyes slightly
then looks back at the baby on the ground she takes off her
baseball cap and places it on the baby

mother

eyes you be good now

she walks away leaving the baby sitting against the wall
with the backwards baseball cap and the chocolate around his
mouth forming something that resembles a beard the kid looks
kind of familiar

concert shirt from years gone by and huge feathered hair
enters with a black skullcap wearing baby slung at her hip
she sees the first baby sitting against the wall and sets
her baby down beside him

though affleck was the bomb in
phantoms

jay
word bitch phantoms like a
motherfucker

holden and jay slap hands holden points at the monitor again

holden
now down here is where you can gauge
the buzz this is the shoot back
area its where people who read the
news get to chime in with their two
cents heres what a guy who goes by
the chickmagnet net handle of wampa
one thinks about bluntman and
chronic
reading
bluntman and chronic and their stupid
alter egos jay and silent bob only
work in small doses if at all they
dont deserve their own movie
to jay
hes got a point

jay
fuck him whats the next one say

holden
reading
bluntman and chronic is the worst
comic i ever read jay and silent
bob are stupid characters a couple
of stoners who spout dumbass
catchphrases like a thirdrate cheech
and chong or bill and ted fuck jay
and silent bob fuck them up their
stupid asses

jay
who the fuck said that shit

holden
a guy who calls himself magnolia
fan  check out what the guy after
him said jay and silent bob are
terrible onenote jokes that only
stoners laugh at  theyre fucking
clown shoes if they were real id
beat the shit out of them for being
so stupid i cant believe miramax
would have anything to so with this
shit i for one will be boycotting
this movie whos with me
leans back
and then there are about fifty more
posts from people who agree to join
spartacusheres boycott of the flick

jay
grimly
im gonna kill all these fucks

holden
ah let it go number one theyre a
bunch of jealous little dicks who
use the anonymity of the net to insult
people whore doing what they wish
they were doing and number two
theyre not really talking about you
guysthey talking about bluntman
and chronic

jay
but they said jay and silent bob
they used our real names it doesnt
matter that theres a comic book
version of us and a real version
cause nobody knows were real in
real life

holden
really

jay
yeah and all these people who read
that shit think the real jay and
silent bob are a couple of faggots
cause of that all these dicks are
writing about the comic book jay and
silent bob and maybe one night me
and lunchboxll be macking some bitch
and shell be like oooo i want to
suck youse guys dicks off whats
your names  and ill be like jay
and silent bob and shell be like
ohi read on the internet that
youse guys were little fucking
jerkoffs  and then she goes and
sucks two other guyss dicks off
instead well fuck that  we gotta
put a stop to these hateful sonsa
bitches before they ruin our good
names

holden
first off i dont know how good
your names really are secondly
theres not much you can do about
stopping this bile the internets
given everyone in america a voice
and everyone in american has chosen
to use that voice to bitch about
movies as long as theres a bluntman
and chronic movie the netnerds are
gonna have something negative to say
about it  jay steams thinking
then a light dawns on him

jay
but wait a secondif there wasnt a
bluntman and chronic movie then no
one would be saying shit about jay
and silent bob right

holden
theyre not saying anything about
you nowtheyre talking about
fictional characters

jay
oblivious to holden
to bob
so all we gotta do is stop em from
making the movie

holden
yeah and kissoff the hundreds of
thousands of dollars in royalties
youre due in the process are you
fucking retarded look im probably
not alone in the opinion that this
flick is the worst idea since greedo
shooting first i mean a jay and
silent bob movie who would pay to
see that

holden jay and silent bob pause and look at the camera for
a beat then

holden
but since it is happening you might
as well just ignore the idiots on
the internet go find banky and get
your motherfucking movie check as
you so succinctly put it thats
whats important here

jay
no holden mcneilwhats important
here is that theres a bunch of
motherfuckers we dont even know
calling us assholes on the internet
to a bunch of teenagers and guys who
cant even get laid putting a stop
to that is the most important thing
we could ever do
off monitor
when did it say theyre making that
movie

holden

jay

counts

the three girls stand at the end of a large hallway at the
other end is a glass case full of diamonds

sissy pulls and aerosol can from her utility belt and sprays
the air in the hallway she watches the decibel monitor
which rises only slightly at the sound of the spray suddenly
within the mist laser beams become apparent

sissy hands the decibel monitor to chrissy and takes a few
steps back shaking her hands to limber up she then runs
forward and does an impressive series of flips down the
hallway not touching a single laser beam

chrissy checks the decibel monitor which rises only slightly

once sissys flipping comes to a stop at the other end of
the hallway near the diamond case she makes a hand gesture
to justice justice nods and proceeds to do the same series
of flips down the hallway not tripping the alarm

chrissy checks the decibel monitor which rises only slightly

justice lands beside sissy and then sissy gestures to
chrissy

chrissy tosses the decibel monitor over the laser beams
sissy catches it and the monitor rises only slightly

then chrissy proceeds with her series of flips which are
even more impressive than the other two including running
up walls and pushing into handstand flips  when she passes
the last laser beam she lands between sissy and justice
arms in the air like a gymnast then she lets out a loud
manly fart

the decibel monitor goes red and an alarm starts ringing
through the building

chrissy
holy fuckthe little stoner was
right

sissy shutters the glass surrounding the diamonds she ours
them into a bag and races back down the hallway followed
by justice and chrissy

testing facility in boulder was the
focus of an attack by a terroristic
primate rescue syndicate calling
themselves the coalition for
liberation of itinerant treedwellers

home the joke

anchorman
in a videotape sent to authorities
this morning credit for the
liberation of an orangutan from the
lab last night is taken by these men

a video capture of jay and silent bob from prebreakin

accompanies the tape as jay and silent
bob in this chilling clip they
make it very clear that they are in
control of the clit

on screen is the clit logo a digitized voice narrates

safe now tremble before the might
of our merciless leader

the logo gives way to the video of jay and bob that sissy

justice highkicks the gun out of sissys hand it lands on
the ground discharging then everyone starts shooting and
running for cover

jay and silent bob hurl themselves over the bluntmobile

missy and chrissy flip over a lavish exquisitelypacked
craft service table labeled cast they pop back up and start
firing at willenholly willenholly leaps behind a barren
craft service table that holds a bag of smarties and a dented
can of rc cola he pops up and returns fire when both are
out of bullets they drop back down behind the table and
reload from behind his table

willenholly yells

willenholly

just a federal wildlife marshal

chrissy

talking bad girls cliches

missy

willenholly

the girls and willenholly both pop back up and open fire
again

chaka ducks behind the monitor

chaka

he races off passing justice and sissy who circle each
other defensively striking kung fu poses

sissy

throwing it all away for a little
stoner with bad pronunciation

jay os

justice rushes sissy and instead of sleek kung fu they launch
into a downanddirty girls catfight hair pulling and
screaming

behind the bluntmobile jay and bob watch all the action

ones shirt off and we see some tit

both bob and jay smile at each other nodding banky joins

banky

banky stares at silent bob agog jay rolls his eyes

jay

silent bob
shut the fuck up
to banky
we had a deal with you on the comics
for likeness rights and as were
not only the artistic basis but also
the character basis for your
intellectual property bluntman and
chronic when we said property was
optioned by miramax films you were
legally obliged to secure our
permission to transfer the concept
to another medium as you failed to
do that youre in breach of the
original contractergo you find
yourself in a very actionable
position

banky stares at bob even more agog joined by jay after a
beat jay adds

jay
yeah

justice now has the advantage over sissy holding her head
and kicking her in the face repeatedly screaming

banky
so what do you guys want to go
away and take your lady friends with
you

jay

called names on the internet anymore

banky

still free to talk shit about you on
the internet thats what the
internets for slandering others
anonymously  stopping the flick
isnt going to stop that

in the background we see justice highkick sissy into the
air

jay

justice highkicks sissy and she goes flying across the stage

sissy sails toward the craft service table landing atop
missy and chrissy knocking them out

willenholly stands to see why the girls stopped shooting

willenholly

suddenly he lets out a shriek and falls forward revealing
a tranquilizer dart in his ass and suzanne standing behind
him holding the gun up in the air  justice surveys her
handiwork for a beat then calls off toward the bluntmobile

justice

jay bob and banky pop up from behind the car and join her

his face

coda

bluntman and chronic strike back went on to make a mere 23
million at the box office it was the biggest commercial
failure in the history of miramax films  the film was roundly
drubbed as a bad idea by the denizens of the internet chat
boards and over the course of the next year while they
waited for the quick stop restraining order to expire jay
and silent bob tracked them all down and beat the shit out
of them

credits then
