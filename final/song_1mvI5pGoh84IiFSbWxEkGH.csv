verse 1
calmly feel myself evolving
appalling so much im not divulging
been stalling i think i hear applauding theyre calling
mixtapes arent my thing but its been awfully exhausting
hanging on to songs this long is daunting yeah
which caused me to have to make a call i thought was ballsy
resulting in what you see today proceed indulging
as always the onetrick ponys here so quit your sulking

verse 2
born efficient got ambition sorta vicious—yup thats me woo
not artistic unrealistic chauvinistic—not those things
go the distance so prolific posts are cryptic move swiftly
unsubmissive the king of mischief the golden ticket rare sight to see
i stay committed embrace the rigid
im playful with it yeah basically
too great to mimic you hate youre bitter
no favoritism thats fine with me
create the riddles portrayed uncivil
unsafe a little oh yes indeed
its plain and simple im far from brittle
unbreakable you following
im bruce willis in a train wreck
im like tradin in your car for a new jet
im like havin a boss getting upset
cause you asked him for less on your paycheck
im like doin headstands with a broke neck
im like watchin your kid take his first steps
im like sayin bill gates couldnt pay rent
cause hes too broke— where am i goin with this

unbelievable yes yes inconceivable
see myself as fairly reasonable
but at times i can be stubborn so
if i have to i will rock the boat
i dont tend to take the easy road
thats just not the way i like to roll
what you thinks probably unfeasible
ive done already a hundredfold
a hundredfold its probable
that i might press the envelope
ideas so astronomical
sometimes i find em comical
yeah incomparable
replay value phenomenal
beat selection remarkable
slowing me down impossible

verse 4
i dont rock no rollies
i dont hang around no phonies nope
i dont really got no trophies
i dont know why god chose me i dont know
got somethin in the cup aint codeine never
change my style they told me
now they come around like homie
man yall better back up slowly back up slowly woo
verse 5
who are you kiddin
how could you doubt me ive always delivered
rippin the teeth out of the back of my mouths
the closest you get to my wisdom
see my initial thought was to wait
but what can i say i had to come visit
check on you guys you doin alright
your year really sucked yeah thats what i figured
they cover they heads up whenever i drop
shake the whole industry put em in shock
come out the clouds like a meteor rock
then land on the earth like ready or not
aint no one like me the cream of the crop
dont even front better give me some props
i pick up your body and throw it a block
okay i admit it thats over the top—not

verse 6
deer in the headlights looks every time i step my foot
on the ground i get mistook
for a lame with no weight to his name
ground just shook
lets not beat around the bush
even my bsides throw em off like hows he do it
some say im a great influence
i dont know about that but i did do the best i could

hope nate doesnt go hollywood
you think that you dont know me good
you think that you dont know me

verse 7
i–i–i i always advance
say how i feel you know where i stand woo
raisin the bar i gotta expand
top of the charts im settin up camp
pound in my stakes i put up my tent
shoot for the stars they fall in my hand woo
stick to my guns i dont even flinch
can push all you want aint movin an inch oh
i rarely miss you know im relentless
aint got a choice no way to prevent it woo
just who i am and i dont regret it
see what i want and then i go get it
followed my gut im happy i did it
beat all the odds i aint got no limits ayy
cannot be stopped you payin attention
i aint gotta say it they know where my head is
they know where my head is head is245embed"
