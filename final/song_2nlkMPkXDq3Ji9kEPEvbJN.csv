verse 1
these streets are yours you can keep them
i dont want them
they pull me back and i surrender
to the memories i run from

prechorus
oh we have paved these streets
with moments of defeat

chorus
but even if we wont admit it to ourselves
well walk upon these streets and think of little else
so i wont show my face here anymore
oh i wont show my face here anymore

verse 2
these streets are yours you can keep them
in my mind its like you haunt them
and passing through i think i see you
in the shapes of other women

with our mistakes and flaws

chorus
but even if we wont admit it to ourselves

so i wont show my face here anymore
oh i wont show my face here anymore
