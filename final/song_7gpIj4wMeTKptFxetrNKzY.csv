we lost in translation
im honestly runnin out of patience
communication just dont seem to work
youve got it all figured out in your head
and you in denial bout all that shit that you be sayin
im tryna help us if you just listen to what i need im tryna help us
i cant tell you when but now we dont have everything

prechorus
its been two years we got some kids
we been through hella shit
travelled the world ran up the bag
we done it all and thats why its sad that

chorus
you dont know me know me
you dont know me know me
you dont know me know me
like i know you you you you
you dont know me
you dont know me
you dont know me
like i know you

verse 2
dont get me wrong i know its a lot lot
long flights long nights fast cars it nеver stops
but you could take a minute
just to pay attеntion to me for once
you should know my body by now
you should know my mind by now
and it dont seem to matter how many times i try
but i cry i say it nice
yell it out loud write it down im tired tired
you should just commit once tired
i shouldnt have to run
it should just be for fun like you
you should just know how know how
really know how to touch how to touch
never ask for way too much oh
