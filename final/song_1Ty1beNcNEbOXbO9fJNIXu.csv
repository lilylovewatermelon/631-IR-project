thinking of things to do
yeah only the cheapest things left there for you
and the only thing i learned from you
is that theres nothing left to look forward to and
i was asleep for days
and now youre the only thing keeping me awake
the calculator will make the same mistakes
yeah i see it in its face

verse 2
hold on tight to this time this place
cause everything you know will be erased
you were born inside your head
and that is where youll be when you are dead
youre just a boy you are no man
and nobody you know will understand
youre just a boy you are no man
and nobody you know will understand

chorus
welcoming you back home
the only one that you have ever known
welcoming you back home
the only one that you will ever know
