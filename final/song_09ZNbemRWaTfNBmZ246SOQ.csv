after school walking home
fresh dirt under my fingernails
and i can smell hot asphalt
cars screech to a halt to let me pass
and i cannot remember
what life was like through photographs
trying to recreate images life gives us from our past
and sometimes its a sad song

chorus
but i cannot forget
refuse to regret
so glad i met you and
take my breath away
make everyday
worth all of the pain that i have gone through
and mama ive been crying
cause things aint how they used to be
she said the battles almost won
and were only several miles from the sun

verse 2
now moving on down my street
i see people i wont ever meet
think of her take a breath
feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps
and sometimes its a sad song
see maroon 5 liveget tickets as low as 100you might also likechorus
but i cannot forget
refuse to regret
so glad i met you and
take my breath away
make everyday
worth all of the pain that i have gone through
and mama ive been crying
cause things aint how they used to be
she said the battles almost won
and were only several miles from the sun

verse 3
the rhythm of her conversation
the perfection of her creation
the sex she slipped into my coffee
the way she felt when she first saw me
hate to love and love to hate her
like a broken record player
back and forth and here and gone
and on and on and on and on

chorus
i cannot forget
refuse to regret
so glad i met you and
take my breath away
make everyday
worth all of the pain that i have gone through
and mama ive been crying
cause things aint how they used to be
she said the battles almost won
and were only several miles
she said the battles almost won
and were only several miles from the sun
yeah oh oh yeah
several miles from the sunembed"
