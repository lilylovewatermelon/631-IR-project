please tell me what is takin place
cause i cant seem to find a trace
guess it mustve got erased somehow
probably cause i always forget
every time someone tells me their name
its always gotta be the same in my world
never wore coverup
always beat the boys up
grew up in a five thousand population town
made my money by cutting grass
got fired by a fried chicken ass
all in a small town napanee

prechorus
you know i always stay up without sleepin
and think to myself
where do i belong forever
in whose arms the time and place

chorus
cant help it if i space in a daze
my eyes tune out the other way
i may switch off and go in a daydream
in this head my thoughts are deep
but sometimes i cant even speak
would someone be and not pretend
im off again in my world
see avril lavigne liveget tickets as low as 31you might also likeverse 2
i never spend less than an hour
washing my hair in the shower
it always takes five hours to make it straight
so ill braid it in a zillion braids
though it may take all friggin day
theres nothin else better to do anyway

prechorus
when youre all alone in the lands of forever
lay under the milky way
on and on its getting too late out
im not in love this time this night

chorus
cant help it if i space in a daze
my eyes tune out the other way
i may switch off and go in a daydream
in this head my thoughts are deep
but sometimes i cant even speak
would someone be and not pretend
im off again in my world

bridge
oh oh
i take some time mellow out
party it up but dont fall down
dont get caught sneak out of the house
chorus
cant help it if i space in a daze
my eyes tune out the other way
i may switch off and go in a daydream
in this head my thoughts are deep
but sometimes i cant even speak
would someone be and not pretend
im off again in my world
cant help it if i space in a daze
my eyes tune out the other way
i may switch off and go in a daydream
in this head my thoughts are deep
but sometimes i cant even speak
would someone be and not pretend
im off again in my world6embed"
