you know its hard out here for a pimp
when he tryin to get this money for the rent
for the cadillacs and gas money spent
because a whole lot of bitches talkin shit
you know its hard out here for a pimp
when he tryin to get this money for the rent
for the cadillacs and gas money spent
because a whole lot of bitches talkin shit

verse 1 juicy j
in my eyes i done seen some crazy things in the streets
gotta couple hoes working on the changes for me
but i gotta keep my game tight like kobe on game night
like taking from a girl dont know no better i know that aint right
done seen people killed done seen people deal
done seen people live in poverty with no meals

verse 2 dj paul
its fucked up where i live but thats just how it is
it might be new to you but its been like this for years
its blood sweat and tears when it come down to this shit
im trying to get rich fore i leave up out this bitch
im trying to have things but its hard fo a pimp
but im praying and im hoping to god i dont slip yeah

verse 3 juicy j
man it seems like im ducking dodging bullets everyday
niggas hating on me cause i got girls on the tray
but i gotta stay paid gotta stay above water
couldnt keep up with my hoes thats when shit got harder
north memphis where im from im 7th street bound
where people all the time end up lost and never found

verse 4 dj paul
man these hoes think we prove things leave a big head
they come hoping every night they dont end up being dead
wait i got a snow bunny and a black girl too
you pay the right price and theyll both do you
thats the way the game goes gotta keep it strictly pimping
gotta keep my hustle tight making change off these women yeah
