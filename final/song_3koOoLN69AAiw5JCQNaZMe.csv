bury me standing under your window with this cinder block in hand
yeah cause no one will ever feel like this again
and if i could move im sure it would only be to crawl
back to you i must have dragged my guts a block
they were gone by the time we talked

chorus
woah i want to hate you half as much as i hate my
self but know that i could crush you with my voice
woah i want to hate you half as much as i hate my
self you know that i could crush you with my voice

postchorus
stood on my roof and tried to see you
forgetting about me
hide the details i dont want to know a thing

verse 2
i hate the way you say my name like its something secret
my pen is the barrel of the gun remind me which side you should be on

chorus
woah i want to hate you half as much as i hate my
self but know that i could crush you with my voice
woah i want to hate you half as much as i hate my
self you know that i could crush you with my voice

stood on my roof and tried to see you
forgetting about me
hide the details i dont want to know a thing

bridge
i wish that i was as invisible as you make me feel
i wish that i was as invisible as you make me feel
woah i want to hate you half as much as i hate my
woah i want to hate you half as much as i hate my
one two three four

chorus
woah i want to hate you half as much as i hate my
self but know that i could crush you with my voice
woah i want to hate you half as much as i hate my
self you know that i could crush you with my voice5embed"
