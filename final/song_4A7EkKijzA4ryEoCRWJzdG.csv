wish i could
i could have said goodbye
i would have said what i wanted to
maybe even cried for you
if i knew it would be the last time
i would have broke my heart in two
tryin to save a part of you

chorus lady gaga
dont want to feel another touch
dont want to start another fire
dont want to know another kiss
no other name falling off my lips
dont want to give my heart away
to another stranger
or let another day begin
wont even let the sunlight in
no ill never love again
ill never love again
oh oh oh

oh

verse 2 lady gaga
when we first met
i never thought that i would fall
i never thought that id find myself lyin in your arms
mmmm mmmm
and i wanna pretend that its not true oh baby that youre gone
cause my world keeps turnin and turnin and turnin and im not movin on

bridge lady gaga
i dont wanna know this feeling unless its you and me
i dont wanna waste a moment

and i dont wanna give somebody else the better part of me
i would rather wait for you

chorus lady gaga
dont want to feel another touch
dont want to start another fire
