all those things i ever thought would never end
to think theyre now all memories sends me round the bend
to watch her airplane swaying coming in to land
there my world is hanging in someone elses hands
and if i have done something and you have to let me go
think of me as someone someone that you know
but if i dont hear something pretty soon from now
ill disconnect completely see how that works out

chorus
i wasnt daring not much a chancer
oh my darling why wont you answer
7 am midnight in dover
suns coming up now i guess its over
playing his guitar while hes dying of cancer
oh my father why wont you answer
7 am midnight in dover
suns coming up now i guess its over
