here i sit at mary anns place
oh baby the rain is always pouring when im here
saw the lightning caught your stone
oh maybe the angels of tomorrow will let me go

chorus 1 michael poulsen  pernille rosendahl
still the crying hurts in your head
well youre still beneath my feet
well oh god dont seem to follow
hear my prayers until tomorrows settlement

verse 2 michael poulsen
side by side with lucys stone
you two are forever missing colors in my home

verse 3 pernille rosendahl
do you think you can forgive
i know that your life has been a burden
a living hell

chorus 2 michael poulsen  pernille rosendahl
still the crying hurts in your head
well youre still beneath my feet
have you looked into the sky
well oh god dont seem to mind
will the fire burn the flower
or the angels sing tomorrow when im nearyou might also likeembed"
