i dont know what road were on
i dont know what were heading towards
but i know my heart is all yours
all my friends tell me id be better off on my own
and sometimes i believe em
but i know i can never leave him

the goodbyes the hellos the i need you no i dont
every time i start to close the door
you knock and i let you in
loving you is my greatest sin

verse 2
you tell me to get lost and that youre done
i see it in your eyes you wanna run
but i know you know that im the only one
i can find someone whod never make me cry
someone whod never tell me goodbye
but i know that i would never survive

i dont know why i love you
i dont know why i stay
i dont know if its worth the pain
but even when you slam the door and drive away
i still set the table for two
babe you know im waiting on you
to buy me a bouquet tell me were okay
and that youre so so sorry
and i believe you every time
but i cant lie these
