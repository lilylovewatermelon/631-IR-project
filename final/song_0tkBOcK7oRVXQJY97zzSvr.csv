in a far and distant galaxy
inside my telescope i see
a pair of eyes peer back at me
he walks and talks and looks like me
he sits around inside his house
from room to room he moves about
fills his life with pointless things
and wonders how it all turns out

dododododo
its safe to say that

chorus
i dont think you understand
theres nowhere left to turn the walls keep breaking
time is like a leaf in the wind
either its time well spent or time ive wasted
dont waste it

verse 2
afraid of what the truth might bring
he locks his doors and never leaves
desperately searching for signs
too terrified to find a thing
he battens all the hatches down
and wonders why he hears no sounds
frantically searching his dreams
he wonders what its all about

bridge
here in my mind losing my friends
fall on my face do it again
you say how do you do
man how bout you man how bout you
to be free to be sold
to be killed to be safe
in my head im alone
im not dead im ashamed
just like you ive been trying to escape
in my bones i feel cold
i give thanks to the lord
industry in the street
let me go let me be
i dont need to be here
im alone cant you see cant you see
chorus
i dont think you understand
theres nowhere left to turn these walls keep breaking
time is like a leaf in the wind
either its time well spent or time ive wasted
dont waste it30embed"
