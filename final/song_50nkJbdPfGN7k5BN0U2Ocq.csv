i see its going down today
hoping in time well bury all this pain
and will awake something inside

we tear our hearts out then we fight

feels like ive lost everything that ive known
i cannot survive alone
feels like ive lost everything that ive known

verse 2
our lives were good in every way
too late time after time
our love just turned to hate
but we stayed by each others side

we pushed our buttons far inside
we tear our hearts out then we fight
