we were two little people wrapped up in this big old world
drifting round in space out of place just a boy and girl
then you took my hand and made me a part of you
and i looked in your heart
and saw all my dreams come true

prechorus
you did the impossible
you rescued my love
you did the impossible
see i had almost given up

chorus 1
and now i love ya like summer time love ya like cherry wine
love ya like free money like a preacher loves sunday
love ya like freeze pop love ya like a milk shake
love ya like a high school girl on a first date
love ya like shootin stars love ya like a muscle car
love ya like were destined
love ya like my lover and my best friend
yeah you did the impossible

verse 2
tonight im gonna need all your attention
close the door
i wanna do things i probably shouldnt mention
like a bird im gon hum
those three words i love you i love you i love you
freeze the time let the world go by
if youre mine say you love me you love me you love me
boy take my hand and make me a part of you
and the love that you gave to me has pulled me through

chorus 2
and now i love ya like sunsets bubble baths on the jet

love ya like a holiday duncan hines yellow cake
