verse 1 gwen stefani
if i could escape i would
but first of all let me say
i must apologize for acting stank and treating you this way
cause ive been acting like sour milk all on the floor
its your fault you didnt shut the refrigerator
maybe thats the reason ive been acting so cold

chorus gwen stefani
if i could escape escape
and recreate a place thats my own world own world
and i could be your favorite girl forever perfectly together
and tell me boy now wouldnt that be sweet sweet escape
if i could be sweet be sweet
i know ive been a real bad girl ill try to change
i didnt mean for you to get hurt whatsoever
we can make it better
and tell me boy now wouldnt that be sweet sweet escape sweet escape

verse 2 gwen stefani
you melt me down im at my lowest boiling point
come help me out i need to get me out of this joint
come on lets bounce counting on you to turn me around
instead of clowning around lets look for some common ground
so baby times get a little crazy

waitin on you to come save me
i can see that youre angry by the way that you treat me
hopefully you dont leave me wanna take you with me
