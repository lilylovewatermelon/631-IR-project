i met someone by accident
that blew me away
that blew me away

it was in the darkest of my days
when you took my sorrow and you took my pain
and buried them away you buried them away

and i wish i could lay down beside you
when the day is done
and wake up to your face against the morning sun
but like everything ive ever known
youll disappear one day
so ill spend my whole life hiding my heart away

you dropped me off at the train station
put a kiss on top of my head
you watched me wave
watched me wave
then you went on home to your skyscrapers
neon lights and waiting papers
that you call home
you call it home

and i wish i could lay down beside you
when the day is done
and wake up to your face against the morning sun
but like everything ive ever known
youll disappear one day
so ill spend my whole life hiding my heart away
see brandi carlile liveget tickets as low as 189you might also likei woke up feeling heavy hearted
im going back to where i started
the morning rain
the morning rain
and although i wish that you were near
that same old road that brought me here
is calling me home
is calling me home

and i wish i could lay down beside you
when the day is done
and wake up to your face against the morning sun
but like everything ive ever known
youll disappear someday
so ill spend my whole life hiding my heart away
and i cant spend my whole life hiding my heart awayembed"
