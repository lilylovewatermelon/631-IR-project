i have waited
paralysed by my own will
viciously reminding me still
im born to believe
and i am certain no
that you and i are crashing course
driven by a holy force
i know you can see

chorus
that you will be mine
yeah you will be mine

verse 2
we balance fire in the earth we walk
will never stop me reaching forth
to see you again
with colours over all the wasted years
eternity will bring you near
i know you can see
i know you can see

chorus
that you will be mine
yeah you will be mine
but dont give me time
oh you will bе mine
you will be mine
you will bе mine
you will be mine
you will be mine
you will be mine
but dont give me time
oh you will be mine
