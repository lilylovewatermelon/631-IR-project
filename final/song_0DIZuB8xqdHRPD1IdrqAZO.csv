baby you got
some kind of control on me
feels like you got a hold on me
baby you got
my imagination running wild
infatuated with your physical damn i like your style
its something about your style its something about your smile
its something about you making me want you right now
if you dont like me then dont listen to me
lord knows i spit that g that have you coming out your clothes
im a professional when i become sexual
you need a chaperon to bring your girlfriend next to you
dont it sound like phone sex kinky when i talk switch the slang
