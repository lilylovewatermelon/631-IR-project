verse 1 jayz
relax yourself let your conscience be free
you now rollin with them thugs from the roc
aint no place on the planet that youd rather be
but in the blue flame bitch youre new to the game
cross over to the roc make yourself hot
the topic of discussion in every nail shop
its a secret society all we ask is trust
and within a week watch your arm freeze up
brassiere get right a to a d cup
weave get tight pedicure your feet up
ears get iced gear get spiced
from hoodrat to superstar theres your life
fuck with hova he can take you out of your hell
say bye to reebok say hi to chanel
say hi to gucci prada as well
take a look in the mirror be proud of yourself
