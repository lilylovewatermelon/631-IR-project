i know that youre waiting for me like a dog
but have some patience for the part of me thats lost
theres been a hundred times
when i dont recognize
any of you that love me
i try to memorize and identify
but its all getting foggy

hello hello do you know me

the old mе hides while the nеw me fights
look in my eyes hes still in there right

you used to be my heart
and now youre just a face
