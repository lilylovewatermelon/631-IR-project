fading falling lost in forever
will i find a way to keep it together
am i strong enough to last through the weather
in the hurricane of my life
can it be a conscious decision
that i look for ways to alter my vision
am i speeding towards another collision
in the alleyways of my life

prechorus
memories dont lie
you know better than
memories dont lie
you know better than
memories dont lie
you know better than
those who have fallen in

memories dont lie

please believe me
that my eyes deceive me

verse 2
shaking burning up with the fever
in the realm of pain i am the deceiver
now i lie to myself so i can believe her
as she disassembles my life
i cannot dispel the illusion
all my hopes and dreams are drowned by confusion
can i find a way to make a solution
that will reconfigure my life

prechorus
memories dont lie
you know better than
memories dont lie
you know better than
memories dont lie
you know better than
those who have fallen in
memories dont lie
you know better than
memories dont lie
you know better than
memories dont lie
you know better than
those who have fallen in

chorus
please believe me
that my ears deceive me
dont stand me up just leave me
i have fallen again this is the end

bridge
and i know that stillness shatters
we have all been frightened by the sound
of footsteps on the pavement of our lives
i stand and fight
im not afraid to die
elochai bury me tonight

chorus
please believe me
that the world deceives me
dont stand me up just leave me
i have fallen again this is the end
