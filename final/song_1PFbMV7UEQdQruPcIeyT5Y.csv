my vampire my vampires fine
my vampire my vampires okay
he wants to break the rules ive made
he wants to crash my castle gate
prince of darkness you wake up too late
i hurt too i miss you

chorus
oh no its all a mess
dont know if i should undress
the wounds you want to caress
i made it to the other side

now i dont hurt no more
and you try knock down that door
you should have been there before
i made it to the other side

verse 2
and now the sun is coming up
you pull away youve had enough
we got too close youre burning up
and now the sun is coming up
you pull away youve had enough
we got too close youre burning up
