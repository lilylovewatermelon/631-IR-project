take your mind with me

verse 1
im on my way home
about to hit the exit do you need some
cause i know you had a long day whoa
do you miss me cause i miss you
and that sexy little thing you make your lips do
way your hips move keep me thinking bout the love i wanna give you

prechorus
you deserve the world if i could give it
stars would come to you and ask permission to shine
cause only you shine
