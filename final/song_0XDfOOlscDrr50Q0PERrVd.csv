verse 2
i know that shes the key to love
she is who im thinking of when i am beatin richard up
to mental images—her face look
the closest that i got was when im poking her on facebook this girl
video chats are so exciting
cause its like she is inviting me to her world full of privacy yeah
im getting gassed up i think shes liking me
shes gullible and i just wanna take it like a pirate arg its this girl
i see her in class
not really two doors down but anytime that i pass
to take a piss in a stall i picture us in the hall
locking lips on the wall her hand grabbing my dick
my left hand on her tits ah my shits getting hard
from thoughts of datin this bitch

but all the bitches they fuck are known as bitches and sluts

and stupid walks at the beach and sharing straws in a cup
i never had that so when we holding hands walking home
i look past that the fact shes fucking guys that i hate but
