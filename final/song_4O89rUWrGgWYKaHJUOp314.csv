they said the paper get hot turn you to ashes
only thing is i dont remember me askin
fill up my bag of chips and i aint sharin a fraction
im down for whatever niggas know im bout that action
he asked me for a ballpark price i pitched him double
im taxin like they uncle but i gotta keep it subtle
and even if he notice i know he dont want no trouble
cuz theres nothing like the hustle in a nigga from the struggle

i got what you need what you want and what you dont
i do what you see what you plot and what you wont
i just served a fiend walkin out the corner store
only thing thats guaranteed is im bound to get this dough
