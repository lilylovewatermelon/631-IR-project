i get drunk and talk to god
i say im sorry for all the things im not
and i mean every word i say
and i promise i can change
when i get drunk and talk to god

verse 2
when i talk to god i tell him why were through
i tell him all the things i did and didnt do
ill say i cant be alone
and hell say son youre on your own
cause when i talk to god i tell him why were through

chorus
i wish that i could go to church but im too ashamed of me
i hate the fact it takes a bottle to get me on my knees
and i hope hell forgive the things you aint forgot
when i get drunk and talk to god

verse 3
when i talk to god i thank him for the time
all those precious years that you were mine all mine
i know hes a busy man hell help me if he can
so when i talk to god i thank him for the time

i wish that i could go to church but im too ashamed of me
