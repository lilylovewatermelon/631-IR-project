love unchanging
god your mercy never fades
and im surrounded
by your compassion and your grace

brighter than the sun
more beautiful than words could ever say
this endless light
shining over all
it leads me to your glory everlasting

in your kindness
for the broken and the lost
you gave your only son
to bear my shame upon the cross

chorus
your love
brighter than the sun
more beautiful than words could ever say
this endless light
shining over all
it leads me to your glory everlasting
