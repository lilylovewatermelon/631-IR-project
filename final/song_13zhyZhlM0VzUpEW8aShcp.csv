stressed out running late racing down the interstate
spilled hot coffee down the front of my jeans
its work work pay the rent money and my times spent
not a minute left for me to be me
been going like nothing can wait
i got to get my priorities straight

chorus
i need to live a little have some fun
take some time waste it on number one
find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop
live a little love a lot

verse 2
friday night here we go do a little dosido
kick back have a laugh catch my breath
tell the band slow it down there she is think i found
maybe ms wonderful i havent met yet
it just hit me like a wrecking ball
shes giving me a wake up call

chorus
i need to live a little have some fun
take some time waste it on number one
find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop
live a little love a lot
see kenny chesney liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likeverse 3
step back smell the rose
feel the sand between your toes
unplug unwind
step out in the sunshine

chorus
i need to live a little have some fun
take some time waste it on number one
find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop
live a little
i need to live a little have some fun
take some time waste it on number one
take the girl get a map and pick any old dot
live a little we need to live a little love a lotembed"
