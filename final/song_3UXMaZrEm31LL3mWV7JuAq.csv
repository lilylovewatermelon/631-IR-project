verse 1
how long have i known you brother
hundreds of lives thousands of years
how many miles have we wandered
under the sky chasing our fear

some kind of trouble is coming
dont know when dont know what
i will stand by you brother
till the daylight comes or im dead and gone

verse 2
ive shared my life with you brother
since i recall youve been my friend
you say were not like the others
still we must die all things must end

i know we cant stop whats coming
but i will try oh how ill try
will you fight with me brother
one last time one last fight

chorus
dont turn away dont tell me that were not the same
we face the fire together brothers till the end
dont run away  our time will come but not today
i stand beside you brother with you till the end
