on a mission started by my own admission
i will leave you all behind
by direction ill create my own protection
the real me youll never find
aspirations turn to fear and desperation
nothings ever good enough for you
burn in sorrow cause i see theres no tomorrow
youll only see what i want you to

chorus
never gonna find me
never gonna find me
well way down deep inside there is a real me
im always gonna hide and this is who youll see
never gonna find me
never gonna find me
well way down deep inside they havent found me yet
im always gonna hide and this is who youll get

verse 2
on a mission to establish my attrition
you may think that you have won
your rejection has brought on my introspection
ill escape my hole and run
accusations may destroy my motivation
i can feel it when youre pushin me
burn in sorrow cause i see theres no tomorrow
only i know which me youll see

never gonna find me
well way down deep inside there is a real me
im always gonna hide and this is who youll see
never gonna find me
never gonna find me
well way down deep inside they havent found me yet
im always gonna hide and this is who youll get

breakdown
break away run
down inside ive got to
push it way down
i did not choose this goddammit
i dont really know what i wanna say
i cant afford the throw cant make it go away now
tryna make it through fuck your decision
i cant feel myself but im burning up now
