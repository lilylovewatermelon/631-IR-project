verse 1
i can be whatever i want to be
bet not a bitch or a nigga stand in front of me
i got the devil in the pockets of my dungarees
taking a dump on anything that standing under me
i can be your dream guy or i can be your nightmare
born on halloween night it seems like a light year
double my sprite hey my guy do you got a light yeah
squash stampede plenty lion and many bison huh
seen some seen one but its not many like em
when i fry or when i die bury me with many mics yeah
i can be whatever i want to be
bet not a pussy ass nigga stand in front of me
took a stop at the light made a right on humble street

when its dark all around and you lookin for some
but in the heart of the jungle my nigga you run
you could be whatever you want but better get you a gun
better do what you want whatever you feel in your stomach
whatever you gotta do at the moment only the strong survive
only the strong in mind and soul and spirit and spine
you stand firm you rise its go time
he looks determined without being ruthless
