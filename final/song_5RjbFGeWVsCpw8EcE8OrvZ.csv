verse 4 consequence
i been pouring out some liquor for the fact that my pals gone
and trying to help his momma with the fact that her child gone
and since we used to bubble like a tub full of calgon
guess its only right that i should help her from now on
but since they got afoul on what couldve gone wrong
now they asking cons how long has this gone on
and maybe all this money might have gone to my head
cause they got me thinking money might have gone to the feds
so i had gone to the dread but he had gone up to bed
and when i came the next morning he was gone with my bread
and with that being said i had gone on my instincts
and gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
but looking back now i shouldve gone to the crib
and rented gone with the wind cause ida gone in by ten
but i had gone with my friend and we had gone to the bar
and heard a nigga talking shit so i had gone to the car
and now the judge is telling me that i had gone too far
and now we gone for twenty years doing time behind bars
and since i gone to a cell for some petty crimes
i guess i gone to the well one too many times cause im gone
break kanye west
uhuhuh uhuhuh uh uh onnn uh uhuh onnn

verse 5 kanye west
im ahead of my time sometimes years out
so the powers that be wont let me get my ideas out
and that make me wanna get my advance out
and move to oklahoma and just live at my aunts house
yeah i romance the thought of leaving it all behind
kanye step away from the lime
light like when i was on the grind
in the 1999
before model chicks was bending over
or dealerships asked me benz or rover
man if i could just get one beat on hova
we could get up off this cheapass sofa
what the summer of the chi got to offer an eighteenyearold
sell drugs or get a job you gotta play your role
my dog worked at taco bell hooked us up plural
fired a week later the manager count the churros
sometimes i cant believe it when i look up in the mirro
how we out in europe spending euros
they claim you never know what you got til its gone
i know i got it i dont know what yall on
ima open up a store for aspiring mcs
wont sell em no dream but the inspiration is free
but if they ever flip sides like anakin
youll sell everything including the mannequin
they got a new bitch now you jennifer aniston
hold on ill handle it dont start panickin stay calm
shorties at the door cause they need more
inspiration for they life they souls and they songs
they said sorry mr west is gone82embed"
