in the jungle that we roam
to search and find and to explore
all we all we all know
all we all we dont know
pushing back remove the leaves
to find something bigger than me
all we all we all know
all we all we dont know

prechorus
so far so good
so dont turn back
so far so good

chorus
its been hard
trying to find the best of it
im always hung up on the risk
dont overthink about it hard
when all thats left is rearranged
and everything is in the way
dont overthink about it
dont overthink about it

verse 2
if i think too hard and never leave
ill watch the world turn without me
all we all we all know
all we all we dont know
to hide from lions and the wolves
would never break the fears we hold
all we all we all know
all we all we dont know
