ive been up ive been down
seen the world from the ground
but i hear the drumming
now my veins are pumping
scraped my knees bruised my heart
its where you end not where you start
i see them running
cause they see me coming

prechorus
im done with the noise that life seems to bring
but ill use my voice its my turn to sing
woo woo

chorus
you know that
all my life
i have been waiting i have been waiting for this
all my life
i have been fighting i have been fighting for this
dream in my soul
and i wont let it go
you know that
all my life
they try to keep me down but i just get higher

burned my wings close to the sun

think its time i break my chains
and run with the giants giants
like smoke im rising
