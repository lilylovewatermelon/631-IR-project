listen to this track bitch

chorus
i’m my best friend and i’m my worst enemy
and no one else can hurt me unless i let them is you feeling me
and misery loves company and i had my share of misery
no mystery my infamy got me in hip hop history
first 2pac died then biggie died and that greatly impacted me
then history repeated itself through me and i made history
it’s gucci
so i don’t turn around no more i look at whats in front of me
i’m focused on the future cause yesterday is history

verse 1
a hard head makes a soft ass
guess your ma didnt teach ya that
pick a spot to beef with me and that spot i will meet you at
well let me check my schedule
i’m free tuesday three weeks from now
you bring your crew i bring my crew
just pick a time and side of town
zone 6 is my stomping ground
but i guess you know that by now
but everywhere you go you hear me
thats why youre upset right now
bought a phantom and a lamb but i’m in my vette right now
i raped the game without a rubber bank accounts are pregnant now
that day they tried to murder me a day i can’t forget about
and i dont wish no death on homie
just want him to hear me out
think about the past and all the many things we talked about
think of all the people influenced by what comes out our mouth
see gucci mane liveget tickets as low as 114you might also likechorus
i’m my best friend and i’m my worst enemy
and no one else can hurt me unless i let them is you feeling me
and misery loves company and i had my share of misery
no mystery my infamy got me in hip hop history
first 2pac died then biggie died and that greatly impacted me
then history repeated itself through me and i made history
so i don’t turn around no more i look at whats in front of me
i’m focused on the future cause yesterday is history

verse 2
i am not the perfect person
may don’t spit the perfect verses
i wouldn’t hurt a girl on purpose cause i feel they don’t deserve it
i admit my words can hurt i dissed tiny she didn’t deserve it
our song didn’t interpret it right and i’m sorry for it
ti many times encouraged told me face the game with courage
clay gave me some great advice and still today i thankful for it
me jeezy and ti share one thing in common all are poets
role model to young people tho at times man we still ignore it
and y’all gon owe respect to me and i don’t like apologies
just diss me til you satisfied
i swear it doesn’t bother me
sticks and stones will break my bones and bullets wont reflect off me
but words and insults only show the world how yall respectin me
chorus
i’m my best friend and i’m my worst enemy
and no one else can hurt me unless i let them is you feeling me
and misery loves company and i had my share of misery
no mystery my infamy got me in hip hop history
first 2pac died then biggie died and that greatly impacted me
then history repeated itself through me and i made history
it’s gucci
so i don’t turn around no more i look at whats in front of me
i’m focused on the future cause yesterday is history

verse 3
all my homies ain’t my homies
half friends no longer want me
im still hungry as i was when i did my first live performance
things i got i know they want it
things i done they haven’t done it
though they say that they my friends
i know that these niggas opponents
we can joke and laugh and party
but i know their smiles are phony
but i still pray that the lord give em all the things they wanted
all the money in the world can’t get the joy i’m felling homie
like the third day with a woman like you and not for your money
you can help someone and love someone but still theyll turn and burn you
so i warn you in advance watch out cause so called friends will con you
think mjg said it best man will i ever know
who my friends through thick and thin cause so called friends will turn to foes
chorus
i’m my best friend and i’m my worst enemy
and no one else can hurt me unless i let them is you feeling me
and misery loves company and i had my share of misery
no mystery my infamy got me in hip hop history
first 2pac died then biggie died and that greatly impacted me
then history repeated itself through me and i made history
it’s gucci
so i don’t turn around no more i look at whats in front of me
i’m focused on the future cause yesterday is history2embed"
