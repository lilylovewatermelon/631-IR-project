where are you now
whos holding you now
when your world stands still do you remember
leave were falling
we were falling
almost like a dream do you remember

seasons changed
we both changed
sometimes i go back to when

chorus
we ran put our feet in the water
we danced didnt care who could see
we sang every song to each other
summer would end but not for me
i still feel the hope in your kisses
i still feel the sun on your skin
i swear i was holding forever back then
do you remember

verse 2
where i am now
is where i should be now
youre so far away but always with me
see blake shelton liveget tickets as low as 49you might also likeand it seems like
another life
whenever i go back to when

chorus

bridge
we ran we kissed we learned to love to live

chorus
we ran put our feet in the water
we danced didnt care who could see
we sang every song to each other
summer would end but not for me
i still feel the hope in your kisses
i still feel the sun on your skin
i swear i was holding forever back then
do you remember
