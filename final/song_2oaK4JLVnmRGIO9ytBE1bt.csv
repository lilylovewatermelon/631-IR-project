comin on to the light of day we got
many moons that are deep at play so i
keep an eye on the shadow smile to see what it has to say
you and i both know everything must go away
ah what do you say
spinnin knot that is on my heart is like a
bit of light in a touch of dark you got
sneak attack from the zodiac but i see your fire spark
eat the breeze and go blow by blow and go away
oh what do you say yeah

chorus
you dont know my mind you dont know my kind
dark necessities are part of my design and
tell the world that im falling from the sky
dark necessities are part of my design

verse 2
stumble down to the parking lot you got
no time for the afterthought theyre like
ice cream for an astronaut well thats me looking for we
turn the corner and find the world at your command
playin the hand yeah

chorus
you dont know my mind you dont know my kind
dark necessities are part of my design
tell the world that im falling from the sky
dark necessities are part of my design

verse 3
ah pick you up like a paperback with the
track record of a maniac so i
move it in and we unpack its the same as yesterday
any way we roll everything must go away
