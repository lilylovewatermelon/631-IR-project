what a waste of life this is
every altercation i permit
is like a quiet sigh
from a man resigned to a place that was never his
and the hours are long
even in a world where i belong
every second stays
every minute counts against my sentence

chorus
i fall i had to let you go

verse 2
what i tried to accomplish died
every offer of faith i had to fight
and a dream unfolds
the moon is cold because the sun left early
and the days go by
even when my conscience just wont try
every week decays every mouth is rotten
i am forgotten

chorus
i fall i had to let you go
i fall my mind is all i know
i fall the table turns to dust
i fall today i let go of my trust

what a waste of a time i am
every ounce of life is just dead flesh
i cant forget
but then again you cant let me remember
when i try to speak
every word i say comes out so bleak
i dont want this i dont want you
but i dont want anyone
i dont want anyone

chorus
i fall i had to let you go
i fall my mind is all i know
i fall the table turns to dust
i fall today i let go of my trust

outro
i let go of my trust
i let go of my trust
i let go of my trust
i let go of my trust let go of my trust
i let go of my trust of my trust
i let go of my trust of my trust
i let go of my trust of my trust
i let go of my trust of my trust
i let go of my trust
i let go of my trust of my trust
i let go of my trust
i let go of my trust let go of my trust1embed"
