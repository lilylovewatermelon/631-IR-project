i thought you put me in rapture
i never asked you to dump her
thought you knew wed have a high life
barabarabarababa
and still i see your philosophy
falling through my tainted mind
would you dig my dirt
cause im so desperate
cant you see youre wasting time
it aint ever gonna feel this good honey
i failed to tell you to tell you now

chorus
that ive been fooled
cause im not cool
and scissors slide away with my pride

verse 2
speeding down a deadend track
i wanted you theres no way back
got a destructive appetite
barabarabarababa
baby please
lift me off my knees
a little smile can go for miles
i may be young but i will grow up strong
and by then shell look like her mum
it aint ever gonna feel this good honey
i failed to tell you to tell you now
you might also likechorus
that ive been fooled
cause im not cool
and scissors slide away with my pride

bridge
just to be absolutely sure of the facts
im happy to act just as a side salad
happy to act happy to pay happy to wait
babe youre great
when your oven goes ping
ill be there on your plate
when your oven goes ping
ill be there on your plate
when your oven goes ping
ill be there on your plate
when your oven goes ping
ill be there on your plate
when her oven goes bang

chorus
ive been fooled
cause im not cool
and scissors slide away with my prideembed"
