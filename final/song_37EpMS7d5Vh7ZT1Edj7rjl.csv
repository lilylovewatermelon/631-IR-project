back to the simple things

well its been such a long time
gonna dig around and try to find
that lonely fishin pole
yeah i aint gotta catch a thing
just drift off on a shady bank
and listen to the river roll

hey hey hey hey hey hey
back to the simple
back to the simple things

back to the there aint no rush
back to the nothin much
back to the back and forth front porch swing
back to the back yards
back to a million stars
back when it used to be

find a bridge to slow down on and
give that thing a whirl

for a while just be the man whos
