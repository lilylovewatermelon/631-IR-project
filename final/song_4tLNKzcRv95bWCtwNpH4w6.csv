i like fast cars and sharp dreams
chased a lot of crazy things
left behind my share of broken pieces
this morning i turned 36
when you just remember half of it
you wonder how you outlived hank and jesus

chorus
i put the rage in a river the roll in a thunder
but you kept me from goin under
when that current got too heavy
i always thought id be a heap of metal
in a cloud of smoke foot stuck to the pedal
sold for parts like a junkyard rustedout chevy
fear ive had none
what the hell made you wanna love
a man who was gonna die young

verse 2
in the mirror i saw my surprise
who knew gray hairs liked to hide on a head
that didnt think hed live past thirty
if i make it thirty more
its the brown that youll be looking for
as you run your fingers through it and say
slow down honey
see eric church liveget tickets as low as 200you might also likechorus
i put the rage in a river the roll in a thunder
but you kept me from goin under
when that current got too heavy
i always thought id be a heap of metal
in a cloud of smoke foot stuck to the pedal
sold for parts like a junkyard rustedout chevy
fear ive had none
what the hell made you wanna love
a man who was gonna die young

verse 3
call it intuition or call it crazy
just thought by now id be pushing up daisies
but ill gladly stick around if were together
so baby when you bow your head tonight
could you tell the lord ive changed my mind
and with you id like to live forever2embed"
