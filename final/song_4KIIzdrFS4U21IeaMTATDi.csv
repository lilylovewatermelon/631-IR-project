yeah growing up yeah
know a lot but i dont know enough
what you doin here

showin up for tryna show me love
why you look confused like you dont really know whats up yeah
why you always tryna judge
i know who you are yeah
why you tryna tryna front yeah
i am not the man i was look
ayy made me a promise i just hope you keep it
i dont like to get involved with things i dont believe in
i dont like to hang with people i dont trust to speak with
if you tell me that you mean it then i hope you mean it
yeah feel like i dont deserve you when i hurt your feelings
im vulnerable you got the keys to open all my secrets
youve always been there when im low to help pick up the pieces
i know i act like i dont need you yet but lately ive been thinking

chorus
yeah lately ive been thinking
yeah yeah i have been thinking

verse 2
yeah i wish that i was optimistic
i wish that i could trust my intuition
to most negative thinking makes you a pessimist but
to me negative thinking means im just realistic
thats how i feel aint that a twisted view
claim that i dont care what people think but is that really true
those the type of questions that i struggle with
thats the type of thing to keep me up at night
wondering i wonder if the pressure ive been under is too much on my shoulders
who gon care when this all fades i turn gray and get older
yeah thats the type of thing that i dont wanna answer
but just cause i dont wanna do it dont mean i dont have to
see these are lessons that you learn in life
and we only get one of em hope im learning right
i know that everything comes with a price
yeah yeah everything comes with a price
yall got no clue what i have sacrificed
and lately ive been thinking
