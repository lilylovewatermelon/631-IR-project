the truth about love comes at 3am
you wake up fucked up and you grab a pen
and you say to yourself
im gonna figure it out im gonna crack that code
gonna break it break it down
im tired of all these questions
and now its just annoying
cause no one has the answer
so i guess its up to me
to find the truth about love
as it comes and it goes
a strange fascination with his lips and toes
morning breath bedroom eyes on a smiling face
sheet marks rug burn and a sugar glaze
the shock and the awe that can eat you raw
its the truth about love

chorus
i think you just may be perfect
youre the person of my dreams
i never ever ever ever been this happy
but now something has changed
and the truth about love is its all a lie
i thought you were the one and i hate goodbyes
see pnk liveget tickets as low as 32you might also likeinterlude
oh you want the truth

verse 2
the truth about love is its nasty and salty
its the regret in the morning its the smelling of armpits
its wings and songs
and trees and birds
its all the poetry that you ever heard
terror coup detat life line forgetmenots
its the hunt and the kill
the schemes and the plots
the truth about love is its blood and its guts
purebreds and mutts
sandwiches without the crust
it takes your breath cuts and leaves a scar
but those untouched never got never got very far
its rage and its hate
and a sick twist of fate
and thats the truth about love
the truth about love

chorus
i think it just may be perfect
youre the person of my dreams
i never ever ever ever been this happy
but now something has changed
and the truth about love is its all a lie
i thought you were the one and i hate goodbyes
verse 3
oh you can lose your breath and
oh you can shoot a gun and
convince youre the only one thats ever felt this way before
it hurts inside the hurt within and
it folds together pocket thin and
its whispered by the angels lips and
it can turn you into a son of a bitch man

outro
the truth the truth the truth about love is
truth the truth the truth about love is
truth the truth the truth about love is
truth the truth the truth about love is
truth the truth the truth about love is
truth the truth the truth about love is
truth the truth the truth about love is
truth the truth the truth about love is
truth the truth the truth about love is
truth the truth the truth about love is
truth the truth the truth about love is
truth the truth the truth about love is
truth the truth the truth about love is
truth the truth the truth about love is
