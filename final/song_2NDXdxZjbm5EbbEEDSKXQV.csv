verse
its been a minute since they seen a style with no gimmicks
clouds is they limits cause we in em
eyes low squinted more ls but we winning
acting like its hard to find women when im in these hardtofind linens
remember those days it was hard to find a living
but now we got ends and its only the beginning
big pimpin fooling dimes rob em for they innocence
cake like entenmanns flow sweet like cinnamon
he a child but they treat him like a bigger man
cause when the pen in his hand they big em up like he jigga man
know you see him in the mirror fam
the ones who say you aint hot be your biggest fan like nigga damn
before he got popular he been the man
with your chick in the cam rolling through an instagram
got a whiff of grands now everybody say they distant fam
know the haters still jelly but fuck it though its the jam
