people look to me and say
is the end near when is the final day
whats the future of mankind
how do i know i got left behind

chorus
everyone goes through changes
looking to find the truth
dont look to me for answers
dont ask me i dont know know

verse 2
how am i supposed to know
hidden meanings that will never show
fools and prophets from the past
lifes a stage and were all in the cast

chorus
you gotta believe in someone
asking me who is right
asking me who to follow
dont ask me i dont know know
i dont know
i dont know know
i dont know

nobody ever told me i found out for myself
you gotta believe in foolish miracles
its not how you play the game
its if you win or lose you can choose
dont confuse win or lose its up to you
its up to you
its up to you
its up to you
go go go
