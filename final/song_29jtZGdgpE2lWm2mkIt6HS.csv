talking like we used to do
it was always me and you
shaping up and shipping out
check me in and check me out
do you like walking in the rain
when you think of love do you think of pain
you can tell me what you see
i will choose what i believe

chorus
well hold on darling
this body is yours
this body is yours and mine
well hold on my darling
this mess was yours
now your mess is mine
ah ooh
your mess is mine

verse 2
see you in the marketplace
walkin round at 800am
i got two hours before my flight
luck be on my side tonight
youre the reason that i feel so strong
the reason that im hanging on
you know you gave me all that time
well did i give enough of mine

well hold on darling
this body is yours
this body is yours and mine
well hold on my darling
this mess was yours
now your mess is mine
ooh ah ah
your mess is mine
your mess is mine
