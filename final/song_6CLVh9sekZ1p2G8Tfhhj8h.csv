ohoh just as sure as the stars in the sky
i need you to shine in my life
not just for the meanwhile for a long long time
better believe it
ohoh whenever youre not in my presence
it feels like im missing my blessings yeah
so i sleep through the daylight stay awake all night
til youre back again oh yeah yeah
you think im biased to my significant other
you hit it right on the head only been missing my lover
got a whole lot of texts in my phone and i dont reply
but the next eight bars tell you why

chorus
youre all that matters to me yeah yeah
aint worried about nobody else
if i aint with you i aint myself
you make me complete
youre all that matters to me yeah yeah
whats a king babe without a queen
there aint no i in team
you make me complete youre all that matters to me

verse 2
take the gas out the car it wont drive
thats how i feel when youre not by my side
when i wake up in the morning up under you
and only you
ohoh im grateful for your existence
faithful no matter the distance
youre the only girl i see
from the bottom of my heart please believe
