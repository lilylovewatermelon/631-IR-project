i pray to god i just dont know anymore
i pray to god i just dont know anymore
and ooh i lost the feeling but im tryina hold on
i thought the end of love is what made you strong
i pray to god i just dont know anymore

when theres no getting through i wont hold back
i will throw down everything in life i know now
ive been laying on the floor sweeping on the ground
i would give up everything in life id know how

cause i cant stop wondering
if i was too late to see the signs
if i could go back with hands up id look up to the sky
id give it id give it id give it
id give it to you
give it to you

ooh when the moon was shining bright before mornin
i made a deal with the stars to keep holdin
shining bright to come and bring me back home
the lights in my eyes they disappeared
visions in my mind about to keep me from fear
i wont let it hold me down the other way around
i dont want the words til i cant make a sound
see calvin harris liveget tickets as low as 176you might also likecause i cant stop wondering
if i was too late to see the signs
if i could go back with hands up id look up into the sky
id give it id give it id give it
id give it to you
give it to you

cant hold back reaching out
iii was living in the heat of the moment
between us i told you that
iii was living in the heat of the moment
id give it iii was living in the heat of the moment
id give it iii was living in the heat of the moment
id give it iii was living in the heat of the moment
id give it to you give it to you

id give it id give it id give it
id give it to you
give it to you

id give it id give it id give it
id give it to you
give it to youembed"
