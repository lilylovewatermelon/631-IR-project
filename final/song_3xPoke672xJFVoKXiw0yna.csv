i got a nice sized collection ill admit it
yea the night i showed it to her ill never forget it
one shot of whiskey river and she was gone long gone
she couldnt leave my willie alone

chorus
i played her everything from material girl
all of my skynyrd and merle
the beatles and the rolling stones
yea tried like hell to hook her on the man in black
she wasnt havin any of that
and she kept goin back
to the only thing that turned her on
she wouldnt leave my willie alone

verse 2
well the honeymoon sure did wear off fast
we went from huggy kissy to fighting like dogs and cats
well bad got worse when she went to cleaning out my home sweet home
and she wouldnt leave my willie alone

chorus
i played her everything from material girl
all of my skynyrd and merle
the beatles and the rolling stones
yea tried like hell to hook her on the man in black
she wasnt havin any of that
and she kept goin back
to the only thing that turned her on
she wouldnt leave my willie alone
see eric church liveget tickets as low as 200you might also likeoutro
yea im afraid its been this way my whole life long
they wont leave my willie alone
no they wontembed"
