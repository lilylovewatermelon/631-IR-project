you are a getaway car a rush of blood to the head
but me im just the covers on top of your bed
you steer away in a rear view mirror make my head swim
i keep you warm and wont ask you where youve been

prechorus
with your backless black dress soaked to the skin
when its said and done theyre all scramblin
and were friends were friends
just because we move units

chorus
strike us like matches cause everyone deserves the flames
we only do it for the scars and stories not the fame
at least everyone is trying everyone is shining
everyone deserves the flames but its such a shame such a shame

verse 2
the sounds of this small town make my ears hurt make my ears hurt
oh yeah you caught me but i caught you one worse oh
they say you want a war youve got a war but who are you fighting for
the tides out the ships run aground we drown traitors in shallow water

prechorus
with your backless black dress soaked to the skin
when its said and done theyre all scrambling
and were friends were friends
just because we move units
see fall out boy liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likechorus
strike us like matches cause everyone deserves the flames
we only do it for the scars and stories not the fame
at least everyone is trying everyone is shining
everyone deserves the flames but its such a shame such a shame

bridge
everyone is trying everyone is shining
everyone deserves the flames but its such a shame such a shame

chorus
strike us like matches cause everyone deserves the flames
we only do it for the scars and stories not the fame
at least everyone is trying everyone is shining
everyone deserves the flames but its such a shame7embed"
