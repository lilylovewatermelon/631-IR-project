chorus 1
you could have the world in the palm of your hands
you still might drop it
and everybody wanna reach inside your pockets
i tell em red light stop it
shit that give me more headaches than alcoholics

verse 1
there was nothin in my wallet just a lot of dreamin
i built a crib on top o the promised land well call it even
hmm i bring more flavor than all the seasons
winter spring summer fall
the grass is always greener til i cut it all
please leave me to my studies i give you no applause
my hands been countin money and its hard to be the boss
but somebody gotta do it it gets so exhausting
often with the bullshit and baby i been through it
enough for the both of us
so come over later and we wont let no one close to us
we could be posted up
