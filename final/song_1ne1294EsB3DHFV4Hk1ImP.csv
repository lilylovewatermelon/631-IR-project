so far lady luck hmm sure has been good to me
i should quit while im ahead but ill hang around instead
and the dealer asked what would you settle for
and i said just a little more

i need just a little more
a little more than ive got
and ive got all that i can spend and i cant spend it fast enough
but if the truth be known i cant quit on my own
and i spent all my life waitin for just a little more

havin a drink here on my favorite stool
i know that a couple has turned into a few
and the bartender says to me son i think its time you leave
if you dont mind headin for the door
but i ask for just a little more

i need just a little more a little more than ive had
and ive had all that a man should and i should leave and not come back
but if the truth be known i cant quit on my own
and i spent all my life waitin for just a little more

too many late nights and all of the above
youve tried to help me for so long
but you finally had enough
and you tell me that youre gonna leave
as youre holding on to me
but before you let me go hold me just a little more
see joe nichols liveget tickets as low as 57you might also likei need just a little more
a little more time
time for me to end all these hurtin ways of mine
and lord i know you give me all the strength that i need
but im down here on my knees prayin for
just a little more
just a little moreembed"
