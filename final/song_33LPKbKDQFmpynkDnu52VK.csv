twentyone winters ago
and she grew tired of the freezing cold
and living in the blinding snow
but this girl knew she wouldnt be there long
cause she had plans and dreams
and shed seen pictures of the sunshine state
in the pages of a magazine

so she waited them tables and she used her smile
saving every penny she can
for a oneway dixiebound amtrak ticket
headed for the promised land
her momma and daddy begged her not to go
when the day she dreamed of came
and she waved goodbye sittin way up high
from the window of a southbound train

now shes got a fire burnin deep inside
ridin on a southbound train
and the clickityclack of that railroad track
only helps to fan the flames
no more worries no more cares
she left them up in bangor maine
now shes startin a brand new life
ridin on a southbound train
see travis tritt liveget tickets as low as 58you might also likebreak

she said hello sun good mornin daytona
youre sure lookin good to me
with your ocean breeze and your tall palm trees
and your southern hospitality
now shes a knockout queenie in a string bikini
shes drivin all the boys insane
and this all started with a small town dream
and a ticket on a southbound train

cause she had a fire burnin deep inside
ridin on a southbound train
and the clickityclack of that railroad track
only helped to fan the flames
no more worries no more cares
she left them up in bangor maine
yeah she likes the boys with a southern drawl
soakin up the sunshine havin a ball
shell be the first to tell you that she owes it all
to ridin on a southbound train1embed"
