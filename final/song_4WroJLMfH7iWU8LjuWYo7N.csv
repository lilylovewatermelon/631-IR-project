cause you were out slipping
and now im out dipping
dont knock on my door
i said im not trippin
no im not complaining
cause you were out slipping
just dont knock on my door

wellim knocking at your door baby
knowing that you feel bad
because you caught me cheating
you see i feel bad
but im coming over early in the morning
im gonna be on my kneewbegging
apologizing to you baby
cause youre so sweet to me

i said im not trippin
cause you were out slipping
and now im out dipping
dont knock on my door
i said im not trippin
no im not complaining
cause you were out slipping
just dont knock on my door

when you were seen by friends of mine
theyve done seen everything

because youre someone elses baby
thats just fine cause now i got me
a piece of mind

i said im not trippin
cause you were out slipping
and now im out dipping
dont knock on my door
i said im not trippin
no im not complaining
cause you were out slipping
just dont knock on my door

stay away from my door come no more
stay away from my door come no moreembed"
