the skin that youre in is all soft now
and your bones are dry as ice
what you sitting round here for and why you sad
cause everybodys pushing out babies now

in the mornings i was getting high with you
in the mornings i was getting high with you

chorus
cause everybodys pushing
what you sitting round here for and why is that
cause everybody is pushing
cause everybody is pushing

outro
well i thought id see you around but youre dead now dead now
well i thought id see you around but youre dead now dead now dead now
well i thought id see you around but youre dead now dead now
well i thought id see you around but youre dead now dead now dead now
well i thought id see you around but youre dead now
well i thought id see you around but youre dead now
