yeah

verse 1
i hear my poisons in the multitude
why was i damned a human deemed too rude
somewhere between the madness and my mind
i live with lesions called the humankind yeah

verse 2
i wander aimlessly amongst the herd
infesting shadows i am undeterred
i give opinion cause you give no peace
they say we manifest the new disease

chorus
my head explodes my soul berates
erratic bonds they scar my face
i wont exist
i wont persist yeah

solo jim root

verse 3
i cast a weary gaze into the crowd
ten thousand reasons dropped into my mouth
my theoretics cant begin to live
so i have nothing more than life to give

erratic bonds they scar my face
i wont exist
i wont persist yeah

see the lies youve given me
this is not what i should be

everything everything everything
everything you says a lie

chorus
my head explodes my soul berates
erratic bonds they scar my face
i wont exist
i wont persist

i wont exist i wont persist
i wont exist i wont persist
