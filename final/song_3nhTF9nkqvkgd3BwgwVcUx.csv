drill bits they keep on turnin
this job aint worth the earnin
dark as hell and my lungs are burnin
and whats a man to do
its like being stabbed in the side with a switchblade knife in a barroom fight
spendin days thinkin bout the nights
and being next to you

chorus
i wanna see my blue eyed sally
headed down to the union rally
show the boss whos the boss of who
five oclock and the whistles blowin
it feels so good just knowin
when i get home ill be lying next to you
when i get home ill be lying next to you

verse 2
every day the coal car rumbles
every step just another stumble
i try to think my thoughts get jumbled
and whats a man to do
its like tryin to take flight but imâ€‹ underground in the constant night
thingsll never look too bright just a darker shade of blue
see parker mccollum liveget tickets as low as 15you might also likechorus
i wanna see my blue eyed sally
headed down to the union rally
show the boss whos the boss of who
five oclock and the whistles blowin
it feels so good just knowin
when i get home ill be lying next to you
oh babe when i get home ill be lying next to you

verse 3
stand still the days keep leavin
never had much to believe in
money aint all that theyre stealin
and whats a man to do
no one here to take my side
i think of you to feel alright
i know ill never see that light but i do it all for you

chorus
i wanna see my blue eyed sally
headed down to the union rally
show the boss whos the boss of who
five oclock and the whistles blowin
it feels so good just knowing
when i get home ill be lying next to you
when i get home ill be lying next to you
when i get home ill be lying next to youembed"
