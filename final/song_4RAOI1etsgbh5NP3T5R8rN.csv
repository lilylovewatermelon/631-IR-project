well when you go
dont ever think ill make you try to stay
and maybe when you get back
ill be off to find another way

prechorus
and after all this time that you still owe
youre still a goodfornothing i dont know
so take your gloves and get out
better get out while you can

chorus
when you go and would you even turn to say
i dont love you like i did yesterday

verse 2
sometimes i cry so hard from pleading
so sick and tired of all the needless beating
but baby when they knock you down and out
is where you oughta stay

prechorus
and after all the blood that you still owe
another dollars just another blow
so fix your eyes and get up
better get up while you can whoa whoa whoa
