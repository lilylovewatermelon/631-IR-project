i was hiding from the sun once again
i was running from time my friend
ive lost another war
so i poured one more and went home drunk again
she was up when the key hit the lock
and the clock looked at me just like the devil in disguise
i saw it in her eyes
shed be gone before the evening

chorus
so i poured another strong one
and chopped a line from here to texas
cause ive lost another good one
shes on the midnight train to memphis

verse 2
with a brand new start
i swore id love from the heart
i meant to change my ways
but ive seen better days
than the one thats here this morning mmhm
with a wife and kids at home
with a job somewhere on some assembly line
i wish i had that life
i bet you wish you had mine
see kid rock liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likechorus
so lets pour another tall one
and chop a line from here to texas
cause ive lost another good one
shes on the midnight train to memphis

interlude  david spade
dude what station is this k snooze
kid rock i thought he was the american bad ass
hes putting me to sleep
nudge me if he gets over five decibels
i knew his first album was the good one

verse 3
but thats the way i am and this is how i jam
all across the land from alabam to bandstand
doped up rebel with an attitude shit
so fuck a bitch fuck a bitch fuck a bitch
i wont switch wont quit no vices
flip the script cause im a slice the righteous
havent you heard i dont refrain
free as a bird and so i wont change
living it up giving it up fucking shit up what
im a run the track from the d to nantucket
so fuck it if you dont dig that you can suck it
yeah and it dont and it dont
verse 4
with an old suitcase
i swear ill leave this place
ill get you back in time
cant drink you off my mind
so ill see you when im sober

chorus
i been looking for some reasons
but i aint found one down in texas
i been changing with the seasons
walked in a new line back to memphisembed"
