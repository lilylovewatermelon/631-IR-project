sent from heaven
sent from heaven

verse 1
now you can wait your whole life wondering
when its gonna come or where its been
you may have got your heart broken a few times in the past
never last strong as it used to
it dont feel as good as it used to before
and all the things you used to say
things you used to do went right out the door

prechorus
ooh no more will you be the one
thats what you tell everyone around you
but you know theyve heard it all before
what more can you say
when love wont let you walk away when love
and you cant help who you love just cant help who you love
and you find yourself giving it away
when you think youre in love ooh cause

chorus
i wanna be the one who you believe
in your heart is sent from sent from heaven sent from heaven
and theres a piece of me who leaves when youre gone
because youre sent from sent from heaven ooh cause
i wanna be the one who you believe
in your heart is sent from sent from heaven
and theres a piece of me who leaves when youre gone
because youre sent from sent from heaven
