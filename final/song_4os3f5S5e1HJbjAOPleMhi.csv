without a warning youre outta control
the ground shakes and the oceans roll
this is the big one
theres nowhere to run

verse 2
on the richter scale of romance
you hit twelve and you dont stand a chance
this is the big one
im falling in love

chorus
now its beat beat beat
my hearts sending out a message
please please please dont save me tonight
sos in this situation means shes out of sight
no need to panic i tell myself
but i never felt this feeling with anybody else
this is the big one im falling in love

chorus
now its beat beat beat
