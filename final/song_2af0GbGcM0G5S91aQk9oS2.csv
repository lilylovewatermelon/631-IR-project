i cant help myself
and i dont wanna be with nobody else
i dont wanna leave my babys side
and i dont wanna kiss another guy
ill pass any test
cause nothing in this world or in the next
could make me second guess
could make me change my mind
could make me not protect what im feeling inside

prechorus
because im smart enough to know that this is a good thing
please believe it please believe it
and im smart enough to stay right where i belong
and im faithful enough to know that this is meant to be
and if its not then dont speak
dont ruin it let me dream

chorus
hear me hear me
this is for my baby
there will never be another
theres so many ways i love you
and thats just for the record babe
i need you need you
i cant wait to see you
i so love when were together
cant nobody do it better
and thats just for the record babe
