time would pass as well as the sequel to resident evil before in 1999 another franchise would establish it’s own brand of horror albeit with a more psychological effect established through ambiance environment and a town’s history that pulled the player in with it’s share of cutscenes articles to detail it’s history and often relatable characters that were no more than everyday people this was the dawn of silent hill and it was glorious the franchise made a living not just off of monster design but effective use of such as well as the constant feeling of claustrophobia and narrative the birth of it’s iconic figure pyramid head living as symbolism specifically designated for silent hill 2 as a gesture towards judgementfirst nail in the coffinit should be noted that during it’s entire construction the first 3 games rendered as classics between the franchise and horror gaming in general were all constructed by team silent all brought in by various konami directors of which mostly remained constant except for the primary directors themselves though still keeping otheraspects the same such as the writing production and soundtrack the first escalated change in the series was the introduction of silent hill 4 abandoning the city itself in change for the only person in correlation with it the antagonist walter sullivannow this major change came as a surprise to most in abandoning the town it’s loved most in order for a relative even causing most people to speculate around the internet that the entry in the series was originally supposed to be the spawn of an entirely new franchise realistically this more correlated to the start of a trend that would cause the fall of more easternorientated franchises which was attempting to market to western audiences silent hill 4 along with games like resident evil outbreak code veronica and resident evil 4 attempted to reach wider audiences by evolving with more actionorientated gameplay now this isn’t to take credit away from those games with each being good in their own sense or right but it makes the reformation in silent hill’s franchise make a lot more sensesecond nail in the coffinafter 2004 once silent hill 4 had caught enough attention resident evil 4 executed the perfect example of how to splice genres and come out successful in the end with critical acclaim something team silent was unfortunately unable to do which led to their forced disbandment by konami so in order to try and replicate their success konami began to pitch the franchise off to more western developers starting off with silent hill homecoming assembled by double helix games in 2008third nail in the coffinthis is what metaphorically and quite literally killed the order silent hill homecoming if anything served as a rehash of past deeds from the past 4 games featuring pyramid head for absolutely no reason faulty plot points with an expected twist and overall botch job on how to hand your franchise over to a random western develop team as their first video game on recorddespite this konami continued to try and find that blend of action gore and shock value that kept more western franchises held together like fear dead space and left 4 dead only leading to more decent at best releases from studios with better thoughts in concepts rather than executions finally leading up to silent hill downpour in 2012 once more developed by an inexperienced studiofinal nail in the coffinby this point it’s hard to see it get worse right but even through a simple job of remastering the graphics of two already made video games konami managed to hand the series off to one more underdeveloped company that would make unneeded changes and cause the downfall of one of the simplest job’s in the games existencethis resulted in even getting the negative attention of one of the originating members of team silent and the creator of pyramid head himself along with any and all monsters between the first 3 games masahiro ito when asked his opinion on a pair of screenshots comparing the original product to the remaster via twitterand the one thing ito had to saynow my piece…konami isn’t necessarily known to care much for it’s ip’s with the exception of kojima productions and everything metal gear if it literally wasn’t for kojima konami would’ve bankrupted awhile ago or at least had to actually focus on creating games with some integrity i mean you can even look at the longerstanding castlevania i mean lord of shadows practically steals elements from shadow of the colossus god of war and dante’s inferno and that’s before i even watched the zero punctuation review once more the problem with that was immediately trying to modernize something that’s been old for the last 3 years which is damn near 50 years gamer time in order to aim for some sort of new audience which didn’t work even with kojima’s helpi mean i do get some of the problems that works in cooperation with horror because really it’s a market that takes some damn finesse in and you probably won’t get the biggest return immediately due to not covering as accessible an experience as most actionadventure games but once you have indie developers making better games than some of the biggest blockbusters and teams available can even think about and still making money… sigh

guys like shinji mikami the original director of the resident evil 1 — 4 games as well as other creative works like viewtiful joe god hand vanquish and otherwise have lasted in this industry and thrived off creativity regardless of how many sales whatever project could pull and it’s served him well keiichiro toyama as the original director for silent hill 1 managed to thrive off of the siren series without sacrificing anything i’m just waiting for the day konami and capcom for that matter can see that it was the original psychological effect of these horror games including fatal frame that kept is up at night not some bullshit they learned off of texas chainsaw massacre or the latest robb zombie moviein consolationthough this information is only covering late 2012 it does give me some hope for the future as well as shinji directing another horror game for the first time in almost 10 years i believe it’s taken long enough for these developers to realize action sells but playing on the human mind is why we got into this it’s what quickens our heart rates cause our thoughts to go into a state irrationality makes us run away from the monsters with only 2 bullets left and even in a state where everything seems calm helps us remain in a state of fear and constant paranoia and in that way personally helps me feel alive in a sense

and i wouldn’t have it any other wayall hail the orderupdate as of gamescom2014guillermo del toro and hideo kojima working on silent hills starring norman reedusupdate as of kojimas firing  silent hills cancellationfuckkonami2embed"
