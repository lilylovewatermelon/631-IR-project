somewhere in the middle i
think i lied a little i
i said if we took it there i wasnt gonna change
but that went out the window yeah gonna break gonna break

prechorus
i know that i seem a little stressed out
but youre here now and youre turning me on
i wanna feel a different kinda tension
yeah you guessed it the kind thats fun
hate it when you leave me unattended
cause i miss ya and i need your love
when my mind is runnin wild
could you help me slow it down

chorus
put my mind at ease
pretty please
i need your hands on me
sweet relief
pretty please

verse 2

underneath your body yeah
if we take it further i swear i aint gonna break
so baby come try me
