here i stand
helpless and left for dead

verse 1
close your eyes
so many days go by
easy to find whats wrong
harder to find whats right

prechorus
i believe in you
i can show you that
i can see right through
all your empty lies
i wont stay long
in this world so wrong

chorus
say goodbye
as we dance with the devil tonight
dont you dare look at him in the eye
as we dance with the devil tonight

verse 2
trembling
crawling across my skin
feeling your cold dead eyes
stealing the life of mine

as we dance with the devil tonight

as we dance with the devil tonight
hold on
