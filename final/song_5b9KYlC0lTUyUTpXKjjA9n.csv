you make my world you make my world go round
you turn me up you turn me upside down
you make my world you make my world go round
you get me off you get me off the ground
you pick me up when i fall down
you pick me up when i fall down

verse 1 william
girl youre like an elevator cause you always pick me up
girl youre like a doctor when im sick you always stitch me up
you could be my dj im your record come and mix me up
you can be my lollipop let me let me lick you up
on the bottom on the top baby let me flip you up
you could be my soda pop coca cola sip it up
whipped cream whip it up strip unzip it up
i could be your chip you my dip let me dip it up

chorus miley cyrus  william
you make my world you make my world go round
you turn me up you turn me upside down
you make my world you make my world go round
you get me off you get me off the ground
you pick me up when i fall down
you pick me up when i fall down
you pick me up when i fall down
you pick me up when i fall down

boy youre like an elevator cause you always pick me up
boy youre like my doctor when im sick you always stitch me up

walking down lovers lane flying in a aeroplane

chorus william  miley cyrus
