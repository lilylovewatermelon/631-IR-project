you keep me in your orbit
well i know im a hard one to please
give it too much importance
my love will have you fall to your knees
i tell em this too often
know better than to bark up my tree
just for me to fall and leave
nah id rather just watch you smoke and drink yeah

prechorus
steering clear of any headaches to start
and if were being honest
id rather your body than half of your heart
or jealousridden comments
that come when you let in them feelings that i dont want
i never let em know too much
hate gettin too emotional woah yeah

chorus
im better off without him
im better off being a wild one
on the road a lot had to keep it a thousand
so that im better off not being around ya

verse 2
go on and face it ill never be ready for you ready for you
i swear my love is a curse make you head over shoes head over shoes
lets put them topics to bed and go fuck on the roof just to say that we did it
you keep insisting i listen to your proposition i dismiss em all no offense yeah
