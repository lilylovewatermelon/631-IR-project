when you came to me with your bad dreams and your fears
it was easy to see that youd been crying
seems like everywhere you turn catastrophe reigns
but who really profits from the dying

chorus
i could hold you in my arms
i could hold you forever
i could hold you in my arms oh
i could hold you forever

verse 2
when you kissed my lips with my mouth so full of questions
my worried mind that you quiet
place your hands on my face
close my eyes and say
that love is a poor mans food
dont prophesize

chorus
i could hold you in my arms
i could hold you forever
and i could hold you in my arms oh
i could hold you forever

verse 3
so now we see how it is
this fist begets the spear
weapons of war
symptoms of madness
dont let your eyes refuse to see
dont let your ears refuse to hear
or you aint never going to shake this sense of sadness

chorus
i could hold you in my arms
i could hold on forever
and i could hold you in my arms oh
i could hold on foreverembed"
