hes a twentieth century boy

and so we hold each other tightly
and hold on for tomorrow singing

shes a twentieth century girl
with her hands on the wheel
trying not to make him sick again
seeing what she can borrow
londons so nice back in your seamless rhymes
but were lost on the westway
and so we hold each other tightly
and we can wait until tomorrow singing

outro
jim stops and gets out the car
goes to a house in emperors gate
through the door and to his room
then he puts the tv on
turns it off and makes some tea
says modern life well its rubbish
im holding on for tomorrow
then susan comes into the room
shes a naughty girl with a lovely smile
says lets take a drive to primrose hill
its windy there and the views so nice
london ice can freeze your toes
like anyone i suppose youre
holding on for tomorrow ohho4embed"
