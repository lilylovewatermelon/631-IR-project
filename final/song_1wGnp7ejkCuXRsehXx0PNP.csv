chorus
rest in peace to love i gave up a long time ago long time ago straight up
hard times everybody left im the one you counted on im the one you counted on 21
my shoulder took a lot of tears woulda swore it was a fountain on shit brazy
i be cryin on the inside and smilin when the cameras on on god

verse 1
woulda never went against you ever 21
i even tried to make the grudge settle straight up
yeah i heard that you slept with a couple fellas straight up
still treated you like a virgin because i know you better on god
when she suck it take my soul she a whole devil 21
bought a wagon then i covered it with rose petals skrrt
she didnt think i was romantic cause im so ghetto
got a patek and a birkin it was fundamental
then the situation took a uturn fuck
foundation crumbled and the roof burned 21
i aint perfect i was slidin like a earthworm loco
but i never ever brought the dirt home on god
man we both played each other you was worse though 21
always blamin me because i did it first though 21
you started sleepin with your phone in your purse though
and you had that pussy nigga fragrance on your skirt ho punk bitch

rest in peace to love i gave up a long time ago long time ago straight up
hard times everybody left im the one you counted on im the one you counted on 21
my shoulder took a lot of tears woulda swore it was a fountain on shit brazy
i be cryin on the inside and smilin when the cameras on on god

verse 2
i had your back you put a knife in mine now im scarred
if you was finna lose your life i woulda gave you mine on god
i sit back and reminisce sometimes just be thinkin you know bout the old days
i used to drink my syrup while you drank your wine my old ways
cant believe what we came to 21
you wont believe what the fame do
we aint together any problems i still came through straight up
heard he put his hands on you thats what lames do pussy
got my first taste of love and i thank you thank you
savage never let another woman taint you 21
fallen victim to my feelings something i cant do never
get revenge on every bitch even if it aint you on god

chorus
rest in peace to love i gave up a long time ago fuc luv
hard times everybody left im the one you counted on one two three four five six seven eight
my shoulder took a lot of tears woulda swore it was a fountain on heavy rain thunderstorm hail comin fallin
i be cryin on the inside and smilin when the cameras on frown on the inside laugh when the flash on
outro morgan freeman
truly genuine love never really dies
but lust infatuation and unrevealed attraction are all things that over time rarely survive29embed"
