deep inside of a parallel universe
its getting harder and harder to tell what came first um
underwater where thoughts can breathe easily
far away you were made in a sea just like me

chorus
christ im a sidewinder im a california king
i swear its everywhere oh its everything

verse 2
staring straight up into the sky oh my my
a solar system that fits in your eye microcosm
you could die but youre never dead spider web
take a look at the stars in your head fields of space kid

chorus
christ im a sidewinder im a california king
i swear its everywhere oh its everything
christ im a sidewinder im a california king
i swear its everywhere oh its everything

instrumental break

verse 3

a nervous breakthrough that makes us the same bless your heart girl
