theres smoke down by the river
hear the cannon and the drum
ive got one thing to ask you honey
can you run

verse 2
you know i hate to ask so late
but the moments finally come
and there wont be time to change your mind
can you run

chorus
can you run to the freedom line of the lincoln soldiers
where the contraband can be a man
with a musket on his shoulder
ive got to stand up tall before im done
wrap these hands of mine around a gun
and chase the taste of bondage from my tongue
can you run
can you run

verse 3
im taking nothing with me
weve just got time to beat the sun
and the boys in gray are never far away
can you run
see the steeldrivers liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likechorus

verse 4
theres smoke down by the river
hear the cannon and the drum
and even if i die ive got to try
can you run
