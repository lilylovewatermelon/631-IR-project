one two three

hitched a ride i was so messed up
but i sure was glad to meet ya
you took my heart like they towed my car
and theyre both still broken down
but while it looked pretty good on paper
and ive come to find out later
that youre insane

turn me off
ive had enough
im better off without anyone
i was wrong
maybe you should stay
away

you came to stay cause they were painting your house
and youre still here six months later
you spent my money on god knows what
but it sure did cost a lot
well its a sad sad situation
and i need a god damn vacation
cause youre insane
see bowling for soup liveget tickets as low as 52you might also liketurn me off
ive had enough
im better off without anyone
i was wrong
maybe you should stay
away

im selfabsorbed selfabsorbed
and shallow too hes shallow too
and all i wanted was to sleep with you
a basket case with a pretty face
and i cant take this shit no more
anymore

turn me off
ive had enough
im better off without anyone
i was wrong
maybe you should stay

turn me off
ive had enough
im better off without anyone
i was wrong
maybe you should stay
away
away
