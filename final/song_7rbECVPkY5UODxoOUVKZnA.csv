intro labi siffre
find your dreams come true
and i wonder if you know
what it means what it means
and i wonder if you know
what it means what it means
and i wonder if you know
what it means to find your dreams
and i wonder

verse 1 kanye west  labi siffre
ive been waitin on this my whole life and i wonder
these dreams be wakin me up at night and i wonder
you say i think im never wrong and i wonder
you know what maybe youre right aight
chorus labi siffre
and i wonder if you know
what it means what it means
and i wonder if you know
what it means to find your dreams
and i wonder

verse 2 kanye west  labi siffre
you say he get on your fuckin nerves and i wonder
you hope that he get what he deserves—word and i wonder
do you even remember what the issue is
you just tryin to find where the tissue is
you can still be who you wish you is
it aint happen yet and thats what intuition is and i wonder
when you hop back in the car
drive back to the crib run back to they arms
the smokescreens the chokes and the screams
you ever wonder what it all really means

and i wonder if you know

verse 3 kanye west  labi siffre
and im back on my grind
a psychic read my lifeline told me in my lifetime
my name would help light up the chicago skyline
and thats why im and i wonder
seven oclock thats primetime
heavenll watch god callin from the hotlines
why he keep givin me hot lines
im a star how could i not shine and i wonder
how many ladies in the house if you know
how many ladies in the house without a spouse what it means
somethin in your blouse got me feelin so aroused what it means
what you about and i wonder
on that independent shit if you know
trade it all for a husband and some kids what it means
you ever wonder what it all really mean
you wonder if youll ever find your dreams
to find your dreams come true
