jackie wants a black eye
some proof that shes been hit
and john wants the answers
but the questions just dont quit
and were sitting in the rain
and were feeling like the weather
you could say that were alone
but were lonely together

chorus
were all in it together now
as we all fall apart
and were swapping little pieces
of our broken little hearts

verse 2
jackie is jumping in the quicksand
but it isnt what you think
shes safe because she knows
the more you fight the more you sink
and john is following the black cloud
to keep him from the sun
so he bends over now
something has finally begun
see dr dog liveget tickets as low as 72you might also likechorus
were all in it together now
as we all fall apart
and were swapping little pieces
of our broken little hearts


verse 3
and weve been hurting so long
that our pleasure is our pain
are we madly in love
or are we madly insane
when yesterdays love defines you
and today that love is gone
tomorrow keeps you guessing
the roller coaster is rolling on

chorus
were all in it together now
as we all fall apart
and were swapping little pieces
of our broken little hearts
were all in it together now
as we all fall apart
and were swapping little pieces
of our broken little heartsembed"
