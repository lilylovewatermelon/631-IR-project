this song is dedicated to all the ladies from all of the men
you know what i mean
simply because yall go through so much
and we want yall to know that we recognize that

verse 1
there are so many answers to the question what yall do for us
and so many reasons for the word why we love on yall
for instance how ya just take us and lift us up
and give us chance after chance and we still find a way to f things up
and sometimes yall go and blame yourselves for things we do
cause you love us so much our lies become the truth
yall try so so hard to make things work
finding a way to smile just to keep from showing youre hurtin

prechorus
its your mind versus
its your hearts versus
its your soul versus
your your body versus our bullshit
and our egos and our pride

thats why i love the word woman
time and time again yall lets us back in
man i love yall so much i gotta spell it out
