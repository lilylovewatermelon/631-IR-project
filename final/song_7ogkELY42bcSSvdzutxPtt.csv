you know you a dboi
cause when someone frontin something s like havin two daddies
one time my home boy fronted me a 8 ball at 3 oclock
at 430 he wanted the money back

its rough bein on that thang man
how you gonna front me somebody done fronted you
he aint no real real hustler the dude shootin at both of us
hit you wit a quarter pound talkin bout we coming up

a real dboi know you gotta get you own work
and you dont get high off your own supply
til later on at night

i gotta drop of bout 30 keys
