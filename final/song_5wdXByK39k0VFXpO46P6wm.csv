verse 1 bun b
now we done talked about the pinky ring
and talked about the gold grill
so tell me whats left to give really yo spine a cold chill
some call em diamonds we call em ice
it varies in the sizes the shape the color and the price
from canary yellow ruby red to baby blue
one stone or maybe two fuck it cause we all cant be babies fool
some of its jazzy some of it cant be real
nigga say its sittin platinum knowin its stainless steel shit
i seen all kinds of medallions on the necks of rappers
drug dealers marks ball players and stallions
 company shit they buy them hoes by the dozens
og nigga get a new piece pass the old down to his cousin
spell out your name your corner your clique
i know a pimp that got a piece with a bitch sucking his dick
so what you waiting for you shy men come join the fly men

verse 2 mjg
some folksll kill to have a real diamond
you get some grade a rocks and in 20 years they still shinin
no need to worry women will find em
but if they gaze at yo karats for too long it will blind em
cubic zirconia helped the whole hood fine
now that everybody can bling we having good times
im writing clever rhymes feeling like forever grind
a diamond in the rough buff me up and hear me shine
i used to hit these streets and slang hustlin in these peoples game
now its just for piece n thang i aint tryin to preach you man
i aint tryin to heat your flame i just wanna teach your brain
im so full of flavor im give some to the weak and blang
mj fucking g touch me im in reachin range
lets hit the beach and hang for pimpin ill be the blame
a career droppin this knowledge will help me explain
about my diamonds my pimpin and my piece of chain
