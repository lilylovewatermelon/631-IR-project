monday morning merle
dont worry ’bout the girl he used to love
tuesdays throwback springsteen
devils  dust

chorus
wednesday spins the beatles
thursday is the eagles
take it easy til that friday rocks his world
after saturday on jackson browne
he’s sunday morning coming down
then hes right back to missing that girl
turns up misery and gin
here we are again
at monday morning merle

verse 2
monday morning merle
lets that old broken heart get back to work
he hides all the holes and the hurt
under the dirt on his shirt
and the only way that he can get
through the days and the regret
is a song full of truth with some words he never said
with those whiskey remedies
and those old school melodies you cant forget
see cody johnson liveget tickets as low as 15you might also likechorus
thats why on wednesday spins the beatles
thursday is the eagles
take it easy til that friday rocks his world
after saturday on jackson browne
hes sunday morning coming down
and hes right back to missing that girl
turns up misery and gin
here we are again
monday morning merle

instrumental bridge

chorus
wednesday spins the beatles
thursday is the eagles
take it easy til that friday rocks his world
after saturday on jackson browne
he’s sunday morning coming down
and he’s right back to missing that girl
turns up misery and gin
here we are again
at monday morning merle

outro
thats just the way i am
sing me back home again
to monday morning merle
monday morning merleembed"
