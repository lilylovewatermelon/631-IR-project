verse 1
its your anniversary isnt it
and your man aint acting right
so you packin’ your damier luggage up callin’ my cell phone try and catch a flight
you know one thing straight i’ll be there girl whenever you call me
when you at home thats your man soon as you land you say thats all me
but shit aint all g with him no more you aint entertained
since i met you a couple months ago you aint been the same
not sayin i’m the richest man alive but i’m in the game
as long as you keep it 100 imma spend this change
hook
whenever you need me
whenever you want me
you know you can call me i’ll be there shortly
don’t care what your friends say cause they dont know me
i can be your best friend and you be my homie
