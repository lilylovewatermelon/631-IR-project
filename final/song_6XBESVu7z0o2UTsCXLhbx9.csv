mother where are you today
you took a piece of me the day you went away
no recollection or the smell of your perfume
i took a piece of you the day i left the womb
the day i left the womb

verse 2
brother put your needles down
the best thing for you is to leave this awful town
pretty soon youll have kids to feed
if you see mother tell her i can sing

chorus
please dont worry i am doing fine
youre much too busy to even find the time
so use your chemicals and take this to your grave
the boys you left are men you didnt raise

verse 3
and daddy how are you today
you must be proud of the boys that you have raised
your withered heart and everything its seen
your cuts and calloused hands you had kids to feed
you had kids to feed

please dont worry i am doing fine
youre much too busy to even find the time
so use your chemicals and take this to your grave
the boys you left are men you didnt raise5embed"
