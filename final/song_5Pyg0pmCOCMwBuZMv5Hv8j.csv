leave behind the shadows in your mind
into the beginning of your life
society breeds hatred in your heart but baby
its time to make a brand new start
lifes everchanging in your eyes
but the time for rearranging will arise

through the rain and snow
let the people know let the people know the way
and when its time to go let the people show
let the people show the way

living high pushing back the boundaries with a smile
effortless but only for a while
a deity comes to you in the night
lightens up your day without a fight
and lifes still everchanging in your eyes
but the time for rearranging will arise

chorus

if the people want to know  show them the way
if the people got to know  show them the way

flying high you left behind the shadows in your mind
the sun came out and put them out of time
the rhythm you can feels in time with mine
so come on baby lets go for a ride
and life still keeps changing in your eyes
but changes come and go  and so do i
