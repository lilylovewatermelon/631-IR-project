rippa on the beat bitch
fresh out of jail but dont think im scared to go back motherfucker
i stillll hit a nigga with that glizzy
if rap dont pop im back to stealin identity im back to credit card theft
back to credit card fraud
fresh out of jail and atlantic records dropped that bag on me
yeah them crackers just dropped that bag on me again
let me hear it

chorus
fresh out of jail made another milli
and bitch dont think i changed cause i didnt
i stillll hit a nigga with that glizzy
if rap dont pop im back to stealin identity

i just took my brothers charge like i am not rich
i took my brothers charge like i aint got shit
i guess he aint step up for me cause he aint got it in him

verse
im walkin round with fifty thousand in my denim
and i dont trust nobody im drinkin snake venom
