verse 1
you let me win you let me ride
you let me rock you let me slide
and when they lookin you let me hide
defend my honor protect my pride
the good advice i always hated
but lookin back it made me greater
you always told me forget the haters
just get my money just get my weight up
know when im lyin know when im cryin
its like you got it down to a science
why am i tryin know you aint buyin
i tried to fight it back with defiance
you make me laugh you make me hoarse
from yellin at you and gettin at you
pickin up dishes throwin em at you
why are you speakin when no one asked you
see nicki minaj liveget tickets as low as 59you might also likechorus

verse 2
what are we doin could you see through me
cause you say nicki and i say who me
and you say no you and i say screw you
then you start dressin and you start leavin
and i start cryin and i start screamin
the heavy breathin but whats the reason

tired of lettin passiveaggression
control my mind capture my soul
okay youre right just let it go
okay you got it its in the can
before i played it you knew my hand
you could turn a free throw to a goal
nigga got the peephole to my soul
