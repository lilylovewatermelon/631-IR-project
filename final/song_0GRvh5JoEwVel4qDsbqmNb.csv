you break you mend blend in with the madness
you try to love again cause what else could happen
youre trapped at the bottom of your wishing well
buried underneath the wealth
penny after penny reaching for a hand to pull you out
and then

prechorus
you wake up to sirens and quakes in your bed
searching for something to push you through the day
aching for meds that could take the pain away
every second every day

chorus
youre waiting for the
day to come when thеy will notice
it is time to wake up now
fighting battlеs at your lowest
your fire is dying out
dragging every step forward
but it wont happen again
and im not gonna pretend
i dont want the money
want the money
see bad omens liveget tickets as low as 53you might also likeverse 2
cant say im mad this is entertainment
but i want what they have and im gonna take it
and im so sorry if im cynical
my waters full of chemicals
i dont know what im made of anymore

prechorus
you wake up to sirens and quakes in your bed
searching for something to push you through the day
aching for meds that could take the pain away
every second every day

chorus
youre waiting for the
day to come when they will notice
it is time to wake up now
fighting battles at your lowest
your fire is dying out
dragging every step forward
but it wont happen again
and im not gonna pretend
i dont want the money
want the money
want the money
bridge
its time to wake up now
your fire is dying out
but it wont happen again
and im not gonna pretend

chorus
im waitin for the
day to come when they will notice
it is time to wake up now
fighting battles at your lowest
your fire is dying out
dragging every step forward
but it wont happen again
and im not gonna pretend
i dont want the money

outro
want it i want it all
want it i want it allembed"
