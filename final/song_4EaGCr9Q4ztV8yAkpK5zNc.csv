god ill give you what i can today
these scattered ashes that i hid away
i lay it all at your feet
from the corners of my deepest shame
the empty places where ive worn your name
show me the love i say i believe

prechorus
oh help me to lay it down
o lord i lay it down

chorus
oh let this be where i die
my lord with thee crucified
be lifted high as my kingdoms fall
once and for all once and for all

verse 2
there is victory in my saviors loss
in the crimson flowing from the cross
pour over me pour over me yes

chorus
oh let this be where i die
my lord with thee crucified
be lifted high as my kingdoms fall
once and for all once and for all
