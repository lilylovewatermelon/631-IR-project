before i proceed to assign to its proper place the fourth of the factors which control the formation of dreams i shall cite a few examples from my collection of dreams partly for the purpose of illustrating the cooperation of the three factors with which we are already acquainted and partly for the purpose of adducing evidence for certain unsupported assertions which have been made or of bringing out what necessarily follows from them it has of course been difficult in the foregoing account of the dreamwork to demonstrate my conclusions by means of examples examples in support of isolated statements are convincing only when considered in the context of an interpretation of a dream as a whole when they are wrested from their context they lose their value on the other hand a dreaminterpretation even when it is by no means profound soon becomes so extensive that it obscures the thread of the discussion which it is intended to illustrate this technical consideration must be my excuse if i now proceed to mix together all sorts of things which have nothing in common except their reference to the text of the foregoing chapter

we shall first consider a few examples of very peculiar or unusual methods of representation in dreams a lady dreamed as follows a servantgirl is standing on a ladder as though to clean the windows and has with her a chimpanzee and a gorilla cat later corrected angora cat she throws the animals on to the dreamer the chimpanzee nestles up to her and this is very disgusting this dream has accomplished its purpose by a very simple means namely by taking a mere figure of speech literally and representing it in accordance with the literal meaning of its words monkey like the names of animals in general is an opprobrious epithet and the situation of the dream means merely to hurl invectives this same collection will soon furnish us with further examples of the employment of this simple artifice in the dreamwork

another dream proceeds in a very similar manner a woman with a child which has a conspicuously deformed cranium the dreamer has heard that the child acquired this deformity owing to its position in its mothers womb the doctor says that the cranium might be given a better shape by means of compression but that this would injure the brain she thinks that because it is a boy it wont suffer so much from deformity this dream contains a plastic representation of the abstract concept childish impressions with which the dreamer has become familiar in the course of the treatment

in the following example the dreamwork follows rather a different course the dream contains a recollection of an excursion to the hilmteich near graz there is a terrible storm outside a miserable hotel the water is dripping from the walls and the beds are damp the latter part of the content was less directly expressed than i give it the dream signifies superfluous the abstract idea occurring in the dreamthoughts is first made equivocal by a certain abuse of language it has perhaps been replaced by overflowing or by fluid and superfluid fluous and has then been brought to representation by an accumulation of like impressions water within water without water in the beds in the form of dampness everything fluid and super fluid that for the purposes of dreamrepresentation the spelling is much less considered than the sound of words ought not to surprise us when we remember that rhyme exercises a similar privilege

the fact that language has at its disposal a great number of words which were originally used in a pictorial and concrete sense but are at present used in a colourless and abstract fashion has in certain other cases made it very easy for the dream to represent its thoughts the dream has only to restore to these words their full significance or to follow their change of meaning a little way back for example a man dreams that his friend who is struggling to get out of a very tight place calls upon him for help the analysis shows that the tight place is a hole and that the dreamer symbolically uses these very words to his friend be careful or youll get yourself into a hole76 another dreamer climbs a mountain from which he obtains an extraordinarily extensive view he identifies himself with his brother who is editing a review dealing with the far east

in a dream in der grune heinrich a spirited horse is plunging about in a field of the finest oats every grain of which is really a sweet almond a raisin and a new penny wrapped in red silk and tied with a bit of pigs bristle the poet or the dreamer immediately furnishes the meaning of this dream for the horse felt himself pleasantly tickled so that he exclaimed the oats are pricking me i feel my oats

in the old norse sagas according to henzen prolific use is made in dreams of colloquialisms and witty expressions one scarcely finds a dream without a double meaning or a play upon words

it would be a special undertaking to collect such methods of representation and to arrange them in accordance with the principles upon which they are based some of the representations are almost witty they give one the impression that one would have never guessed their meaning if the dreamer himself had not succeeded in explaining it

1 a man dreams that he is asked for a name which however he cannot recall he himself explains that this means i shouldnt dream of it

2 a female patient relates a dream in which all the persons concerned were singularly large that means she adds that it must deal with an episode of my early childhood for at that time all grownup people naturally seemed to me immensely large she herself did not appear in the dream

the transposition into childhood is expressed differently in other dreams by the translation of time into space one sees persons and scenes as though at a great distance at the end of a long road or as though one were looking at them through the wrong end of a pair of operaglasses

3 a man who in waking life shows an inclination to employ abstract and indefinite expressions but who otherwise has his wits about him dreams in a certain connection that he reaches a railway station just as a train is coming in but then the platform moves towards the train which stands still an absurd inversion of the real state of affairs this detail again is nothing more than an indication to the effect that something else in the dream must be inverted the analysis of the same dream leads to recollections of picturebooks in which men were represented standing on their heads and walking on their hands
4 the same dreamer on another occasion relates a short dream which almost recalls the technique of a rebus his uncle gives him a kiss in an automobile he immediately adds the interpretation which would never have occurred to me it means autoerotism in the waking state this might have been said in jest

5 at a new years eve dinner the host the patriarch of the family ushered in the new year with a speech one of his sonsin law a lawyer was not inclined to take the old man seriously especially when in the course of his speech he expressed himself as follows when i open the ledger for the old year and glance at its pages i see everything on the asset side and nothing thank the lord on the side of liability all you children have been a great asset none of you a liability on hearing this the young lawyer thought of x his wifes brother who was a cheat and a liar and whom he had recently extricated from the entanglements of the law that night in a dream he saw the new years celebration once more and heard the speech or rather saw it instead of speaking the old man actually opened the ledger and on the side marked assets he saw his name amongst others but on the other side marked liability there was the name of his brotherinlaw x however the word liability was changed into lieability which he regarded as xs main characteristic77

6 a dreamer treats another person for a broken bone the analysis shows that the fracture represents a broken marriage vow etc

7 in the dreamcontent the time of day often represents a certain period of the dreamers childhood thus for example 515 am means to one dreamer the age of five years and three months when he was that age a younger brother was born

8 another representation of age in a dream a woman is walking with two little girls there is a difference of fifteen months in their ages the dreamer cannot think of any family of her acquaintance in which this is the case she herself interprets it to mean that the two children represent her own person and that the dream reminds her that the two traumatic events of her childhood were separated by this period of time 3 12 and 4 34 years

9 it is not astonishing that persons who are undergoing psycho analytic treatment frequently dream of it and are compelled to give expression in their dreams to all the thoughts and expectations aroused by it the image chosen for the treatment is as a rule that of a journey usually in a motorcar this being a modern and complicated vehicle in the reference to the speed of the car the patients ironical humour is given free play if the unconscious as an element of waking thought is to be represented in the dream it is replaced appropriately enough by subterranean localities which at other times when there is no reference to analytic treatment have represented the female body or the womb below in the dream very often refers to the genitals and its opposite above to the face mouth or breast by wild beasts the dreamwork usually symbolizes passionate impulses those of the dreamer and also those of other persons of whom the dreamer is afraid or thus by means of a very slight displacement the persons who experience these passions from this it is not very far to the totemistic representation of the dreaded father by means of vicious animals dogs wild horses etc one might say that wild beasts serve to represent the libido feared by the ego and combated by repression even the neurosis itself the sick person is often separated from the dreamer and exhibited in the dream as an independent person

one may go so far as to say that the dreamwork makes use of all the means accessible to it for the visual representation of the dreamthoughts whether these appear admissible or inadmissible to waking criticism and thus exposes itself to the doubt as well as the derision of all those who have only hearsay knowledge of dreaminterpretation but have never themselves practised it stekels book die sprache des traumes is especially rich in such examples but i avoid citing illustrations from this work as the authors lack of critical judgment and his arbitrary technique would make even the unprejudiced observer feel doubtful

10 from an essay by v tausk kleider und farben in dienste der traumdarstellung in interna zeitschr fur ps a ii 1914

a a dreams that he sees his former governess wearing a dress of black lustre which fits closely over her buttocks that means he declares this woman to be lustful

b c in a dream sees a girl on the road to x bathed in a white light and wearing a white blouse

the dreamer began an affair with a miss white on this road

11 in an analysis which i carried out in the french language i had to interpret a dream in which i appeared as an elephant i naturally had to ask why i was thus represented vous me trompez answered the dreamer trompe  trunk

the dreamwork often succeeds in representing very refractory material such as proper names by means of the forced exploitation of very remote relations in one of my dreams old brucke has set me a task i make a preparation and pick something out of it which looks like crumpled tinfoil i shall return to this dream later the corresponding association which is not easy to find is stanniol and now i know that i have in mind the name of the author stannius which appeared on the title page of a treatise on the nervous system of fishes which in my youth i regarded with reverence the first scientific problem which my teacher set me did actually relate to the nervous system of a fish the ammocoetes obviously this name could not be utilized in the picturepuzzle
here i must not fail to include a dream with a curious content which is worth noting also as the dream of a child and which is readily explained by analysis a lady tells me i can remember that when i was a child i repeatedly dreamed that god wore a conical paper hat on his head they often used to make me wear such a hat at table so that i shouldnt be able to look at the plates of the other children and see how much they had received of any particular dish since i had heard that god was omniscient the dream signified that i knew everything in spite of the hat which i was made to wear

what the dreamwork consists in and its unceremonious handling of its material the dreamthoughts may be shown in an instructive manner by the numbers and calculations which occur in dreams superstition by the way regards numbers as having a special significance in dreams i shall therefore give a few examples of this kind from my collection

1 from the dream of a lady shortly before the end of her treatment

she wants to pay for something or other her daughter takes 3 florins 65 kreuzer from her purse but the mother says what are you doing it costs only 21 kreuzer this fragment of the dream was intelligible without further explanation owing to my knowledge of the dreamers circumstances the lady was a foreigner who had placed her daughter at school in vienna and was able to continue my treatment as long as her daughter remained in the city in three weeks the daughters scholastic year would end and the treatment would then stop on the day before the dream the principal of the school had asked her whether she could not decide to leave the child at school for another year she had then obviously reflected that in this case she would be able to continue the treatment for another year now this is what the dream refers to for a year is equal to 365 days the three weeks remaining before the end of the scholastic year and of the treatment are equivalent to 21 days though not to so many hours of treatment the numerals which in the dream thoughts refer to periods of time are given money values in the dream and simultaneously a deeper meaning finds expression for time is money 365 kreuzer of course are 3 florins 65 kreuzer the smallness of the sums which appear in the dream is a self evident wishfulfilment the wish has reduced both the cost of the treatment and the years school fees

2 in another dream the numerals are involved in even more complex relations a young lady who has been married for some years learns that an acquaintance of hers of about the same age elise l has just become engaged thereupon she dreams she is sitting in the theatre with her husband and one side of the stalls is quite empty her husband tells her that elise l and her fiance had also wished to come to the theatre but that they only could have obtained poor seats three for 1 florin 50 kreuzer and of course they could not take those she thinks they didnt lose much either

what is the origin of the 1 florin 50 kreuzer a really indifferent incident of the previous day the dreamers sisterin law had received 150 florins as a present from her husband and hastened to get rid of them by buying some jewellery let us note that 150 florins is 100 times 1 florin 50 kreuzer but whence the 3 in connection with the seats in the theatre there is only one association for this namely that the fiance is three months younger than herself when we have ascertained the significance of the fact that one side of the stalls is empty we have the solution of the dream this feature is an undisguised allusion to a little incident which had given her husband a good excuse for teasing her she had decided to go to the theatre that week she had been careful to obtain tickets a few days beforehand and had had to pay the advance bookingfee when they got to the theatre they found that one side of the house was almost empty so that she certainly need not have been in such a hurry

i shall now substitute the dreamthoughts for the dream it surely was nonsense to marry so early there was no need for my being in such a hurry from elise ls example i see that i should have got a husband just the same and one a hundred times better if i had only waited antithesis to the haste of her sisterin law i could have bought three such men for the money the dowry our attention is drawn to the fact that the numerals in this dream have changed their meanings and their relations to a much greater extent than in the one previously considered the transforming and distorting activity of the dream has in this case been greater a fact which we interpret as meaning that these dreamthoughts had to overcome an unusual degree of endo psychic resistance before they attained to representation and we must not overlook the fact that the dream contains an absurd element namely that two persons are expected to take three seats it will throw some light on the question of the interpretation of absurdity in dreams if i remark that this absurd detail of the dreamcontent is intended to represent the most strongly emphasized of the dreamthoughts it was nonsense to marry so early the figure 3 which occurs in a quite subordinate relation between the two persons compared three months difference in their ages has thus been adroitly utilized to produce the idea of nonsense required by the dream the reduction of the actual 150 florins to 1 florin 50 kreuzer corresponds to the dreamers disparagement of her husband in her suppressed thoughts

3 another example displays the arithmetical powers of dreams which have brought them into such disrepute a man dreams he is sitting in the bs house the bs are a family with which he was formerly acquainted and he says it was nonsense that you didnt give me amy for my wife thereupon he asks the girl how old are you answer i was born in 1882 ah then you are 28 years old

since the dream was dreamed in the year 1898 this is obviously bad arithmetic and the inability of the dreamer to calculate may if it cannot be otherwise explained be likened to that of a general paralytic my patient was one of those men who cannot help thinking about every woman they see the patient who for some months came next after him in my consultingroom was a young lady he met this lady after he had constantly asked about her and he was very anxious to make a good impression on her this was the lady whose age he estimated at 28 so much for explaining the result of his apparent calculation but 1882 was the year in which he had married he had been unable to refrain from entering into conversation with the two other women whom he met at my house the two by no means youthful maids who alternately opened the door to him and as he did not find them very responsive he had told himself that they probably regarded him as elderly and serious

bearing in mind these examples and others of a similar nature to follow we may say the dreamwork does not calculate at all whether correctly or incorrectly it only strings together in the form of a sum numerals which occur in the dreamthoughts and which may serve as allusions to material which is insusceptible of representation it thus deals with figures as material for expressing its intentions just as it deals with all other concepts and with names and speeches which are only verbal images

for the dreamwork cannot compose a new speech no matter how many speeches and answers which may in themselves be sensible or absurd may occur in dreams analysis shows us that the dream has taken from the dreamthoughts fragments of speeches which have really been delivered or heard and has dealt with them in the most arbitrary fashion it has not only torn them from their context and mutilated them accepting one fragment and rejecting another but it has often fitted them together in a novel manner so that the speech which seems coherent in a dream is dissolved by analysis into three or four components in this new application of the words the dream has often ignored the meaning which they had in the dreamthoughts and has drawn an entirely new meaning from them78 upon closer inspection the more distinct and compact ingredients of the dreamspeech may be distinguished from others which serve as connectives and have probably been supplied just as we supply omitted letters and syllables in reading the dreamspeech thus has the structure of breccia in which the larger pieces of various material are held together by a solidified cohesive medium

neurosis behaves in the same fashion i know a patient who involuntarily and unwillingly hears hallucinates songs or fragments of songs without being able to understand their significance for her psychic life she is certainly not a paranoiac analysis shows that by exercising a certain license she gave the text of these songs a false application oh thou blissful one oh thou happy one this is the first line of christmas carol but by not continuing it to the word christmastide she turns it into a bridal song etc the same mechanism of distortion may operate without hallucination merely in association

strictly speaking of course this description is correct only for those dreamspeeches which have something of the sensory character of a speech and are described as speeches the others which have not as it were been perceived as heard or spoken which have no accompanying acoustic or motor emphasis in the dream are simply thoughts such as occur in our waking life and find their way unchanged into many of our dreams our reading too seems to provide an abundant and not easily traceable source for the indifferent speechmaterial of dreams but anything that is at all conspicuous as a speech in a dream can be referred to actual speeches which have been made or heard by the dreamer
we have already found examples of the derivation of such dream speeches in the analyses of dreams which have been cited for other purposes thus in the innocent marketdream chapter v a where the speech that is no longer to be had serves to identify me with the butcher while a fragment of the other speech i dont know that i dont take that precisely fulfils the task of rendering the dream innocent on the previous day the dreamer replying to some unreasonable demand on the part of her cook had waved her aside with the words i dont know that behave yourself properly and she afterwards took into the dream the first indifferentsounding part of the speech in order to allude to the latter part which fitted well into the phantasy underlying the dream but which might also have betrayed it

here is one of many examples which all lead to the same conclusion

a large courtyard in which dead bodies are being burned the dreamer says im going i cant stand the sight of it not a distinct speech then he meets two butcher boys and asks well did it taste good and one of them answers no it wasnt good as though it had been human flesh

the innocent occasion of this dream is as follows after taking supper with his wife the dreamer pays a visit to his worthy but by no means appetizing neighbour the hospitable old lady is just sitting down to her own supper and presses him among men a composite sexually significant word is used jocosely in the place of this word to taste it he declines saying that he has no appetite she replies go on with you you can manage it all right or something of the kind the dreamer is thus forced to taste and praise what is offered him but thats good when he is alone again with his wife he complains of his neighbours importunity and of the quality of the food which he has tasted i cant stand the sight of it a phrase that in the dream too does not emerge as an actual speech is a thought relating to the physical charms of the lady who invites him which may be translated by the statement that he has no desire to look at her

the analysis of another dream which i will cite at this stage for the sake of a very distinct speech which constitutes its nucleus but which will be explained only when we come to evaluate the affects in dreams is more instructive i dream very vividly i have gone to bruckes laboratory at night and on hearing a gentle knocking at the door i open it to the deceased professor fleischl who enters in the company of several strangers and after saying a few words sits down at his table then follows a second dream my friend fl has come to vienna unobtrusively in july i meet him in the street in conversation with my deceased friend p and i go with them somewhere and they sit down facing each other as though at a small table while i sit facing them at the narrow end of the table fl speaks of his sister and says in threequarters of an hour she was dead and then something like that is the threshold as p does not understand him fl turns to me and asks me how much i have told p of his affairs at this overcome by strange emotions i try to tell fl that p cannot possibly know anything of course because he is not alive but noticing the mistake myself i say non vixit then i look searchingly at p and under my gaze he becomes pale and blurred and his eyes turn a sickly blue and at last he dissolves i rejoice greatly at this i now understand that ernst fleischl too is only an apparition a revenant and i find that it is quite possible that such a person should exist only so long as one wishes him to and that he can be made to disappear by the wish of another person

this very pretty dream unites so many of the enigmatical characteristics of the dreamcontent the criticism made in the dream itself inasmuch as i myself notice my mistake in saying non vixit instead of non vivit the unconstrained intercourse with deceased persons whom the dream itself declares to be dead the absurdity of my conclusion and the intense satisfaction which it gives me that i would give my life to expound the complete solution of the problem but in reality i am incapable of doing what i do in the dream ie of sacrificing such intimate friends to my ambition and if i attempted to disguise the facts the true meaning of the dream with which i am perfectly familiar would be spoiled i must therefore be content to select a few of the elements of the dream for interpretation some here and some at a later stage

the scene in which i annihilate p with a glance forms the centre of the dream his eyes become strange and weirdly blue and then he dissolves this scene is an unmistakable imitation of a scene that was actually experienced i was a demonstrator at the physiological institute i was on duty in the morning and brucke learned that on several occasions i had been unpunctual in my attendance at the students laboratory one morning therefore he arrived at the hour of opening and waited for me what he said to me was brief and to the point but it was not what he said that mattered what overwhelmed me was the terrible gaze of his blue eyes before which i melted away as p does in the dream for p has exchanged roles with me much to my relief anyone who remembers the eyes of the great master which were wonderfully beautiful even in his old age and has ever seen him angered will readily imagine the emotions of the young transgressor on that occasion

but for a long while i was unable to account for the non vixit with which i pass sentence in the dream finally i remembered that the reason why these two words were so distinct in the dream was not because they were heard or spoken but because they were seen then i knew at once where they came from on the pedestal of the statue of the emperor joseph in the vienna hofburg are inscribed the following beautiful words

saluti patriae vixit
non diu sed totus79
he lived for the safety of the public not for a long time but always the motive of the mistake patriae fatherland for publicae has probably been correctly divined by wittels

from this inscription i had taken what fitted one inimical train of thought in my dreamthoughts and which was intended to mean that fellow has nothing to say in the matter he is not really alive and i now recalled that the dream was dreamed a few days after the unveiling of the memorial to fleischl in the cloisters of the university upon which occasion i had once more seen the memorial to brucke and must have thought with regret in the unconscious how my gifted friend p with all his devotion to science had by his premature death forfeited his just claim to a memorial in these halls so i set up this memorial to him in the dream josef is my friend ps baptismal name80

according to the rules of dreaminterpretation i should still not be justified in replacing non vivit which i need by non vixit which is placed at my disposal by the recollection of the kaiser josef memorial some other element of the dreamthoughts must have contributed to make this possible something now calls my attention to the fact that in the dream scene two trains of thought relating to my friend p meet one hostile the other affectionate the former on the surface the latter covered up and both are given representation in the same words non vixit as my friend p has deserved well of science i erect a memorial to him as he has been guilty of a malicious wish expressed at the end of the dream i annihilate him i have here constructed a sentence with a special cadence and in doing so i must have been influenced by some existing model but where can i find a similar antithesis a similar parallel between two opposite reactions to the same person both of which can claim to be wholly justified and which nevertheless do not attempt to affect one another only in one passage which however makes a profound impression upon the reader brutuss speech of justification in shakespeares julius caesar as caesar loved me i weep for him as he was fortunate i rejoice at it as he was valiant i honour him but as he was ambitious i slew him have we not here the same verbal structure and the same antithesis of thought as in the dreamthoughts so i am playing brutus in my dream if only i could find in my dreamthoughts another collateral connection to confirm this i think it might be the following my friend fl comes to vienna in july this detail is not the case in reality to my knowledge my friend has never been in vienna in july but the month of july is named after julius caesar and might therefore very well furnish the required allusion to the intermediate thought that i am playing the part of brutus81 

strangely enough i once did actually play the part of brutus when i was a boy of fourteen i presented the scene between brutus and caesar in schillers poem to an audience of children with the assistance of my nephew who was a year older than i and who had come to us from england and was thus a revenant for in him i recognized the playmate of my early childhood until the end of my third year we had been inseparable we had loved each other and fought each other and as i have already hinted this childish relation has determined all my later feelings in my intercourse with persons of my own age my nephew john has since then had many incarnations which have revivified first one and then another aspect of a character that is ineradicably fixed in my unconscious memory at times he must have treated me very badly and i must have opposed my tyrant courageously for in later years i was often told of a short speech in which i defended myself when my father his grandfather called me to account why did you hit john i hit him because he hit me it must be this childish scene which causes non vivit to become non vixit for in the language of later childhood striking is known as wichsen german wichsen  to polish to wax ie to thrash and the dreamwork does not disdain to take advantage of such associations my hostility towards my friend p which has so little foundation in reality he was greatly my superior and might therefore have been a new edition of my old playmate may certainly be traced to my complicated relations with john during our childhood i shall as i have said return to this dream later on
