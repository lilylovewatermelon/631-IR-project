this is the next century
where the universals free
you can find it anywhere
yes the future has been sold
every night were gone
and to karaoke songs
how we like to sing along
though the words are wrong

chorus
it really really really could happen
yes it really really really could happen
when the days they seem to fall through you
well just let them go

verse 2
no one here is alone
satellites in every home
yes the universals here
here for everyone
every paper that you read
says tomorrows your lucky day
well heres your lucky day

chorus
it really really really could happen
yes it really really really could happen
if the days they seem to fall through you
well just let them go
well it really really really could happen
yes it really really really could happen
when the days they seem to fall through you
well just let them go
