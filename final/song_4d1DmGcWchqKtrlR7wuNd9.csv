verse 1 lil 23rds
fuck yall fuck yall fuck yall i will never switch never change
take the gold take the cash throw it in the flames
looking deranged walking round with a blood stain
give me the keys to the range or the mustang
drive that motherfucker off a hill and blame it all on the pain pills
no devil no god but the same feel
red dot with the mod and the frame filled
uicide is the name of the freewilled
you know i got them—
bitches by dozen from rappin with cousin
they say that we buzzing but i dont hear nothing
but sheep that sleep layin on the concrete
constantly suffering but god do i love it
so fuck it ill climb up just so i can plummet
ashes to ashes from something to nothing
give me the casket im kickin the bucket

verse 2 yung mutt
in my hand i got a pair of dice
they told me roll a seven bear in mind i want a six
i recognize that heaven mythological
and so the pair of dice swallowed whole
and now i got abdominal tears in spite of theological paradigms
rrrotten and paralyzed in a tropical paradise
im about to go fahrenheit bitch im poppin a terabyte
all these parasites a problem in my logical pair of eyes
politics opposite of innocuous verified
in the hospital bed my chronic is sterilized
televise the terrifying chronicles of enterprise
possibly is scared of heights
but the obstacle therein lies the prodigal errant fight
