hate the price of fame cause it cost too much uhyeah boy
lame niggas these niggas talk too much uhyeah
im ready for whatever somebody better tell em uhyeah boy
i said im ready for whatever hey hey yeah

verse 1
even though my head in the clouds im planted on the pavement
how im walking round people staring at amazement
i play a lot of games on where i be and i aint playing with it
they so judgmental maybe they dont understand
if your life was in jeopardy eryday is you telling me
you wouldnt need weaponry just because of your felony
consider this at least i got erybody sweating me
on the streets its people who wont rest unless i rest in peace
killed my folk a year ago still in my sleep they threaten me
paranoia stressing me aint nobody protecting me
im dealing with the pressure from my partner dying next to me
think cause no ones arrested they coming for me eventually
this was all the things i was going through mentally
this could be the reason i ignored the penitentiary
not mentioning new orleans niggas coming in the city
killing all summer long aint nobody pay attention

prehook
now is it that hard to understand if you listen
either die or go to jail—thats a hell of a decision
but im wrong and i know it my excuses unimportant

verse 2
im a man i aint perfect—i admit it im guilty
but understand feel me yuh i was riding filthy
cause niggas out there plotting plotting to rob me and kill me yuh
five hundred thousand every year spent on security hey
my future was bright but now its gettin blurry
cause niggas in a hurry to find me and bury me
but surely godll deliver me up out it
im a fighter to the heart i forever be about it
im a father to my sons sons asset to my community
look all that i done my good outweigh the negativity
ayy mentally i was focused on not letting history repeat itself
that’s why heat was kept in the vicinity
yes officially i broke the law but not maliciously
through all of the publicity was anyone considering
my position and the logic hid in my decision ayy
but they caught me with it now im off to prison period bye
