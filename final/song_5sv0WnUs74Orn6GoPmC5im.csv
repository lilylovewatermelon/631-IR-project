oh yeah we been in the rain
been on the rocks but we found our way
weve ordered pizza to an aeroplane
slept on the beach like we were castaways
weve been in the storm
been to an irish bar in central rome
driven to hospitals with broken bones
weve shared a toothbrush and shared our home

prechorus
weve seen the moon reflect on the rollin tide
been up at 5am watchin the sunrise
because thе world looks better when im by your sidе
oh i oh i oh i

chorus
when you and i collide
you bring me to life
yeah you bring me to life
you bring me to life
when you and i collide
you bring me to life
yeah you bring me to life
you bring me to life

we been on the road
weve watched the blossom fall to earth like snow
fumbled in cubicles in tokyo
and been to funerals in rented clothes

prechorus
mmm we drank your fathers whiskey when your grandma died
you brought me to the morning through my darkest night
yeah the world hurts less when im by your side
oh i oh i oh i

chorus
when you and i collide
you bring me to life
yeah you bring me to life
you bring me to life
when you and i collide
you bring me to life
yeah you bring me to life
yeah you bring me to life

head first collidin
dreamers collidin

your love let the light in
head first collidin
dreamers collidin
universe collidin
outro
we made love in the sky
overslept and missed the northern lights
you lost your wedding ring but i didnt mind
‘cause i got a feelin baby well be fine8embed"
