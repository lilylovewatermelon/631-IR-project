if i ever had a wish in the whole world
i wouldve listened to my brother when he spoke to me
and i never wouldve played with my conscience
in the fields where i was in their company

prechorus
but you gave me wings and i used them
i used them i used them on my youth
and you gave me wings and i used them
i used them and i wont lose them
now i found my feet count to one two three
and im taking off tonight now im free
as i walk my feet on the cold concrete
and i and i and i

chorus
i can feel my dreams
when im in my city
i fall on my knees
for my for my city
were going off the dream
in my in my city
and thats where ill stay
and thats where ill stay in my city

rolling down the streets in my new town
with the lights blinding and my heart weighed down
i think ill get a job with stealing peoples thunder
but the folks back home ill make them proud

prechorus
but you gave me wings and i used them
i used them i used them on my youth
yeah you gave me wings and i used them
i used them and i wont lose them i dont wanna lose them

chorus
i can feel my dreams
when im in my city
i fall on my knees
for my for my city
were going off the dream in my
in my in my city
and thats where ill stay city
and thats where ill stay in my city

shoulders ache for wanted wings
my city shakes the fear in me
chorus

when im in my city
i fall on my knees
for my for my city
were going off the dream in my city
in my in my city
and thats where ill stay
