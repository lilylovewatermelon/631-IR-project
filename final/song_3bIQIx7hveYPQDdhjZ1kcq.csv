thats right youre right we will do our thing tonight alright
take me through the future
its time youre fine just another color coded crime
incision and a suture
you told my friend we would get it on no matter when
a supercavitation
lets go you show me something no one will ever know
a love hallucination

chorus anthony kiedis
another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car
take it much too far
surrender to the brave inside a lover that another tried
take it too my ride

postchorus anthony kiedis  anna waronker
you dont have to keep it if its mine
another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car
another place maybe another time
surrender to the brave inside a lover that another tried

verse 2 anthony kiedis
complete repeat sittin in your car and on your street
lost in california
lets steal this wheel take a spin to find out how we feel
just around the corner
slow down for sound turn it up and no we canâ€™t be found
the body that we transcend
asleep you weep find out that the trick is never cheap
a melancholy girlfriend
see red hot chili peppers liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likechorus anthony kiedis
