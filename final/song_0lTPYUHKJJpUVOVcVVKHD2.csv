one two three

verse 1
our days are running thin
our hopes will start to fall
i can feel the world collapse around me
from within
and letters keep coming by
to let us know when time will die
and please god will you forgive us
and give us one more try

chorus
if you will then well go
as fast as we go far
maybe well be forgotten
when the world is torn apart

verse 2
ive been up all night long
counting days that all went wrong
i opened my bedroom window
i wish this pain was gone
there are no useful drugs
to escape from feeling numb
i remember an amazing birthday
i remember when i was young

if you will then well go
as fast as we go far
maybe well be forgotten
when the world is torn apart
cause the sun wont be so blinding
and the rains will finally come
the ashes will slowly pile up
just to prove were finally done

chorus
if you will then well go
as fast as we go far
maybe well be forgotten
when the world is torn apart
cause the sun wont be so blinding
and the rains will finally come
the ashes will slowly pile up
just to prove were finally done
