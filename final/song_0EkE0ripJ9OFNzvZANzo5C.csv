come into my life
regress into a dream
we will hide
and build a new reality
draw another picture
of a life you couldve had
follow your instincts
and choose the other path

bridge
you should never be afraid
youre protected from trouble and pain
why why
is this a crisis in your eyes again

chorus
come to be how did it come to be
tied to a railroad no love to set us free
watch our souls fade away
and our bodies crumbling
dont be afraid
i will take the blow for you

outro
and ive had recurring nightmares
that i was loved for who i am
and missed the opportunity
to be a better manyou might also like17embed"
