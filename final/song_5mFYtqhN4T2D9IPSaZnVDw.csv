two black cadillacs driving in a slow parade
headlights shining bright in the middle of the day
one is for his wife
the other for the woman who loved him at night
two black cadillacs meeting for the first time

chorus
and the preacher said he was a good man
and his brother said he was a good friend
but the women in the two black veils didn’t bother to cry
bye bye bye bye
yeah they took turns layin a rose down
threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
hes not the only one who had a secret to hide
bye bye bye bye bye bye

postchorus
two black cadillacs
two black cadillacs

verse 2

it was the first and the last time they saw each other face to face
they shared a crimson smile and just walked away
and left the secret at the grave
