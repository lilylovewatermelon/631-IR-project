verse 1
oh great intentions
ive got the best of interventions
but when the ads come
i think about it now

verse 2
in my infliction
entrepreneurial conditions
take us to glory
i think about it now

chorus
cannot conversations cull united nations
if you got the patience celebrate the ancients
cannot all creation call it celebration
or united nation put it to your head

verse 3
oh great white city
ive got the adequate committee
where have your walls gone
i think about it now

chicago in fashion
the soft drinks expansion
oh columbia
from paris incentive
like cream of wheat invented
the ferris wheel

verse 4
oh great intentions
covenant with the imitation
have you no conscience
i think about it now

verse 5
oh god of progress
have you degraded or forgot us
where have your laws gone
i think about it now

chorus
ancient hieroglyphic or the south pacific
typically terrific busy and prolific
classical devotion architect promotion
lacking in emotion think about it now
bridge
chicago the new age
but what would frank lloyd wright say
oh columbia
amusement or treasure
these optimistic pleasures
like the ferris wheel

chorus
cannot conversations cull united nations
if you got the patience celebrate the ancients

part ii carl sandburg visits me in a dream

verse 6
i cried myself to sleep last night
and the ghost of carl he approached my window
i was hypnotized i was asked to improvise
on the attitude the regret
of a thousand centuries of death

chorus
even with the heart of terror and the superstitious wearer
i am riding all alone
i am writing all alone
even in my best condition
counting all the superstition
i am riding all alone
i am running all alone
verse 7
and we laughed at the beatitudes of a thousand lines
we were asked at the attitudes
they reminded us of death

chorus
even with the rest belated everything is antiquated
are you writing from the heart
are you writing from the heart
even in his heart the devil has to know the water level
are you writing from the heart
are you writing from the heart

verse 8
and i cried myself to sleep last night
for the earth and materials
they may sound just right to me

chorus
even with the rest belated everything is antiquated
are you writing from the heart
are you writing from the heart

outro
even in his heart the devil has to know the water level
are you writing from the heart
are you writing from the heart10embed"
