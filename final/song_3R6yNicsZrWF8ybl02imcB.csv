charleston girl in a darkened room
and you dont know her like i do
we took the fire escape to her room
and got stoneraging blind
left my money in the trusting hands
of them old steele brothers in a fastgrass band
one day im gonna drive up there
and give them half my mind

verse 2
i dont know if its the wine or the coke
that makes her sound like her jaw is broke
shes working hard to make some sense
but she aint got a dime
i wish to god that i could help her out
i wish i knеw what she was talkin bout
i wish to god that i could get away
but im way too drunk to drive

chorus
all i know is that whеn i am good and sober
i am leavin west virginia for a while
dont know why but every time i cross that river
lord theres somethin tears me up makes me wild
see tyler childers liveget tickets as low as 39you might also likeverse 3
charleston girl with raven hair
bloodshot eyes and skin so fair
i believe if i could find my keys
id try to drive away
i never planned to leave so soon
i didnt know that he was sweet on you
go ahead and take her
cause she aint worth the time

chorus
all i know is that when i am good and sober
i am leavin west virginia for a while
dont know why but every time i cross that river
lord theres somethin tears me up makes me wildembed"
