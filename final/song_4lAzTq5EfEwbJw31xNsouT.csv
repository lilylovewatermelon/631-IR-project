great times are coming
coming down the boulevard
coming down your avenue
i can see it from a bird’s eye view
great times are coming
coming to your ghetto too
coming down the avenue
i can see it form a bird’s eye view

here come the good times
let the good times just roll in
we ain’t got no time to be slowing
bring ‘em on bring the good times
let the good times just roll in
we ain’t got no time to be slowing
bring ‘em on bring the good times

verse
i’m fired up and ready to go
lit the fuse i’m about to blow
on the top come from below
plant the seed imma watch it grow
got big dreams like dr king
big things to the extremes
i’m a tech feme check scheme
knowledge up on the steam steam
bread the stack president’s black
came for the hood now i’m headed back
get my people off the track
get my people out the track
you might also likeprehook
we’re saying ayo
if you buy that bush get out my wayo
i’m about to do it do it big that’s the way it go
cause baby i just wanna live my life

hook
great times are coming
coming down the boulevard
coming down your avenue
i can see it from a bird’s eye view
great times are coming
coming to your ghetto too
coming down the avenue
i can see it form a bird’s eye view

here come the good times
let the good times just roll in
we ain’t got no time to be slowing
bring ‘em on bring the good times
let the good times just roll in
we ain’t got no time to be slowing
bring ‘em on bring the good times

outro
i hope you’re ready
great times are coming
i hope you’re ready
i see them coming around
i hope you’re ready
great times are coming
i hope you’re ready
i see them coming aroundembed"
