well im not a vampire but i feel like one
sometimes i sleep all day because i hate the sunlight
my hands are always shaking bodys always aching and the dark is when i feed
well i can lure any woman that i want to in my bed with me

prechorus
and whiskey seems to be my holy water
mothers better lock your doors and hide your daughters

chorus
im insane well i can feel it in my bones
coursing through my veins when did i become so cold
for goodness sakes where is my selfcontrol
if home is where my heart is then my heart has lost all hope

verse 2
well im not a zombie but i feel like one today
selfinduced comatose chemical daze
my head is always spinning from this dizzy blurry vision and my stomach has had enough
i feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby cause im always throwing up

prechorus
hi my name is ronnie im an addict
daddy shouldve never raised me on black sabbath
see falling in reverse liveget tickets as low as 105you might also likechorus
im insane well i can feel it in my bones
coursing through my veins when did i become so cold
for goodness sakes where is my selfcontrol
if home is where my heart is then my heart has lost all hope

cause im going straight to hell
and im taking you down with me
cause you know damn well

chorus
im insane i can feel it in my bones
coursing through my veins when did i become so cold
im insane well i can feel it in my bones
coursing through my veins when did i become so cold
for goodness sakes where is my selfcontrol
if home is where my heart is then my heart has lost all hope all hope20embed"
