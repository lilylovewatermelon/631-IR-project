verse 3
ice cube i take a funky beat and reshape it
locate a dope break and then i break it
and give it that gangsta lean
dead in your face as i turn up the bass
i make punk suckers run and duck because
i dont try to hide cause you know that i love to
jack a fool for his beat and then im outtie
so when i come to your town dont crowd me
cause i know youre gonna wanna kick it with me
but i know none of yall can get with me
so you think youre protected
well you are til you put a funky beat on a record
then i have to show and prove and use your groove
cause suckers cant fade the cube
and if i jack ya and ya keep comin
i have you marks a hundred miles and runnin
stop stop stop stop stop
