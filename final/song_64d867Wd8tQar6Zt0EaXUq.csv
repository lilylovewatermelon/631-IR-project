are you somewhere two drinks in when that vinyl needle drops
do you ride that melody all the way back to little rock
like i do

when it comes to you
does it hit you like a hurricane in that gulf coast town
does that salty summer air still blow your heart around
like a memory can do

when it comes to you
does the midnight ever make you want me back again
does the silence ever fall like rain upon your skin
and do you ever wonder if some hеarts are born to win
or born to lose
cause girl i do

whеn it comes to you
are you at some twolane red light behind denver plates
does that colorado chill steal your breath away
like i used to

when it comes to you
does the midnight ever make you want me back again
does the silence ever fall like rain upon your skin
and do you ever wonder if some hearts are born to win
or born to lose
cause girl i do

makes me think of us makes me wonder what it does

when it comes to you
does the lonely ever make you want my love again
do you ever miss the beautiful we were back then
and do you ever wonder if some hearts are born to win
or born to lose
cause girl i do
when it comes to you
mmm when it comes to you1embed"
