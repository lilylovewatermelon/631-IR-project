verse 1

i get it when i want to
i’m on the way down
i’m getting fixed without you
you gave me a bandaid
i put it on my heartbreak
and all you got is pictures in your hand

chorus
dont you wish you could hold
the angel in the centerfold
the fantasy you couldn’t control
i walked away from you i walked away from you
dont you wish you could hold
the pretty little paper doll
the one you couldn’t quite control
i walked away from you
