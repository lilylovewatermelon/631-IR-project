wanderers this morning came by
where did they go graceful in the morning light
to banner fair to follow you softly
in the cold mountain air

verse 2
through the forest down to your grave
where the birds wait and the tall grasses wave
they do not know you anymore more more more

chorus
dear shadow alive and well
how can the body die
you tell me everything
anything true

verse 3
into town one morning i went
staggering through premonitions of my death
i dont see anybody that dear to me

chorus
dear shadow alive and well
how can the body die
you tell me everything
anything true
