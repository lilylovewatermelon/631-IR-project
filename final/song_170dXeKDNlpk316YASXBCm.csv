sun wont shine moon wont glow
this star of mine is my star no more
i did you wrong and this i know
come keep me warm please girl im so cold
woah let me talk to you

verse 1
cold winter nights by myself
blankets just wont do i need your help
cause i dont wanna miss the way your body feels no more
no i dont
its only been two days since youve been gone
but those few moments feel so long
now im sitting at the edge of the bed with my hands on my head
and the only thing i been thinking while i been alone is that

chorus
i cant let you go i wont let you leave
one thing that i know is baby you were made for me for sure
my life is in your hands im meant to be your man
were made to be together
so baby no dont go
girl if you dont know id give my heart id give my soul for sure
im right here on my knees
if you were to leave id lose my everything

you complete me baby
dont you let nothing come between us hey
alcohol has been my best friend
and i admit some tears have passed my chin
crying in the bed over you just aint manly
but i dont give a damn no
cause i could wash these pillow cases i could change these sheets baby
but i need you back in the crib cooking up some of that good chicken and gravy
mash potatoes homemade lemonade
want you back to the old days you been with me since i had long braids

chorus
and i cant let you go i wont let you leave
one thing that i know is baby you were made for me for sure
my life is in your hands im meant to be your man
were made to be together
so baby no dont go
girl if you dont know id give my heart id give my soul for sure
im right here on my knees
if you were to leave id lose my everything

bridge
girl my heart wont beat right i cant sleep nights
ooh youre haunting my dreams
all i know is i hold onto memories
when you touch i touch you
when you moaning you scream oh baby
girl you know just what you do to me
i acted so stupidly
and unless you want to take away my soul no dont go
chorus
i cant let you go i wont let you leave
one thing that i know is baby you were made for me for sure
my life is in your hands im meant to be your man
were made to be together
so baby no dont go
girl if you dont know id give my heart id give my soul for sure
im right here on my knees
if you were to leave id lose my everything

outro
dont you go away stop i cant
no baby no dont you go away i just i just need time
dont you leave me girl dont do this
dont you leave me girl please
dont you leave me girl i got a lot on my mind
dont you leave me girl baby babe baby stop it okay
