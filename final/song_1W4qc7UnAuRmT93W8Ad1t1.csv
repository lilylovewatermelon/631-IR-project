intro sample  joey bada
say brain—what do you wanna do tonight
the same thing we do every night pinky try to take over the world
who the fuck is this joey bada nigga son

chorus
ayo who the fuck passed you the mic
and said that you could flow
point em out bitch i wanna know
who the fuck passed you the mic

verse
check
puffin on stramonium underground like potholes but going fossil
these bars like art in the smithsonian
these flows is for custodians homeless men horny obgyn dudes
browsing my laptop lookin at red fallopian tube
they like yo joey you rude im like if only you knew
im only in school for cosmology thats why i act as lonely as you
you see im wise beyond my years and my peers
so my voice over the snares is the only way they hear
what i got behind my membrane but ive been smoking chem strains
so lately ive been having hard times with remembering
but be patient my studies prove egyptians aint shit
cause i believe that we could be like neo in the matrix
but fuck it im erratic momma lock me in the attic please
til i draw enough static in my somatic anatomy
and come out imputed with fusions of blueprints and illmatics
i’ve been going raw this just how i feel rappin
we gave yall sur tactics so yall can’t even gas us
we taught you how to be prepared but still attacking the masses
yall better get yall caskets cause we ‘bout to annihilate
the new babylon era my empire gate’s in the empire state
i’m on the higher platform look at the way they clap for ‘em
never fuck with phony men cause i don’t like my back torn
nigga ask kwon this that top ramen you ain’t used to
keep it neutral to scruple and tell ‘em no beef like noodles
keep it neutral just so you can scruple
i tell ‘em no beef like noodles

it’s world domination nation you’re tuned into my station
always got a doobie and a motherfucking eighth lit
always got the trees so what the fuck you mean
i ain’t about to rise to the top with my fucking team
it’s world domination nation you’re tuned into my station
always got a doobie and a motherfucking eighth lit
always got the trees so what the fuck you mean
i ain’t about to rise to the top with my fucking team

chorus
ayo who the fuck passed you the mic

and said that you could flow
