an fmv plays of a man in red clothes named tatsuya suou he is sitting
in a garage sleeping and he recalls a moment ago where he had met maya
at a train station not to long ago then he starts to have several
flashbacks from events that happened on the other side such as the
joker and saying goodbye to eikichi lisa and jun and etc and it
shows maya dying and tatsuya hears mayas last words before she died
please forget about mego on without me then tatsuya wakes up
and next he is at araya shrine just staring at it he has an image of
it burning and then the image fades away 

araya shrine

walks up to him
