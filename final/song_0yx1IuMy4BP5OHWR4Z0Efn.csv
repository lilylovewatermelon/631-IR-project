when the time is right and the night is bright
we will see the things weve come to find
ive been searching for just a little more
but the days girl just slip away oh yeah
and the red sunset that we just met girl
i can see forever yeahyeah oh
oh yeah

chorus
come and see the minds eye we can find it if we try
come and see the minds eye transfixed upon the why
come and see the minds eye we can find it if we try

verse 2
well they say its right if it feels alright
when your love burns up in the mire
so i burnt a fire for a lost desire
see it burning higher yeah

chorus
oh come and see the minds eye we can find it if we try
come and see the minds eye transfixed upon the why
come and see the minds eye we can find it if we try oh yeah
