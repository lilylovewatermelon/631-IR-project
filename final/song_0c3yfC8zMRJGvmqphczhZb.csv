am i better off dead am i better off a quitter
they say im better off now than i ever was with her
as they take me to my local down the street
im smiling but im dying trying not to drag my feet

verse 2
they say a few drinks will help me to forget her
but after one too many i know that im never
only they cant see where this is gonna end
they all think im crazy but to me its perfect sense

chorus
and my mates are all there trying to calm me down
cause im shouting your name all over the town
im swearing if i go there now
i can change her mind turn it all around
and i know that im drunk but ill say the words
and shell listen this time even though theyre slurred
so i dialed her number and confessed to her
im still in love but all i heard was nothing

verse 3
so i stumble there along the railings and the fences
i know if i faced her face that shell come to her senses
every drunk step i take leads me to her door
if she sees how much im hurting shell take me back for sure
