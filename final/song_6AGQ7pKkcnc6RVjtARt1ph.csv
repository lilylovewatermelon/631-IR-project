ill keep my sights on a waking dream
i gave my life to the vile beneath
i am but one of a dying breed
hate kills this world but it wont kill me

chorus
wake up the victim of violence
shut the breath of the lifeless
im breaking the silence
im falling apart for you
wake up the victim of violence
shut the breath of the lifeless
im chasing the righteous
becoming a part of you

verse 2
fake plastic life full of wasted years
love lost inside diabolic fear
i feel no fault for the fault i feel
hope drains this world but it wont drain me

chorus
wake up the victim of violence
shut the breath of the lifeless
im breaking the silence
im falling apart for you
wake up the victim of violence
shut the breath of the lifeless
im chasing the righteous
becoming a part of you
