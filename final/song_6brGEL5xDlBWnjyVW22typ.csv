thats my shorty doowop
yeah thats my shorty doowop
i love the things you do
thats my shorty doowop
and i cant wait to be alone with you

baby bash
i bet you never seen a shorty so fly
pushing candy paint with the chrome chopping by
throwing up playa ways to my partnas on the block
they all show love to my shorty doowop
in the juicy fruit jeans bumping three fifteens
living every fantasy a ghetto girl dreams
watch her swang and bang as she bend another corner
looking way cool coming through with the doja
now after two honey buns i discovered the buzz
imma call the shorty she gon color me love
and through the thick of it all she excepted collect calls
when her daddy got caught up by the laws

hook russell lee

baby bash
for real do for real do for real do
she the girl in the movie and im the hero
stuck with me when i violated prole
and came up when she started with zero
baby bash latino robert deniro
she got with me cause her hubby was a weirdo
and yes sir she looking so mighty mighty
love it cause im fresh and clean and so tighty
the last piece to the puzzle the grind the hustle
respect when im good and love me when im in trouble
and yes sir oh no
and yes sir she looking so throwed
