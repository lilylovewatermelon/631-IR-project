come on in take a seat
tell me how you feel this weak
are you cursed are you blessed
are you still inside the mess

refrain 1
all those feelings wrapped around you
hold you down so you cant break through

verse 2
its a trap so dont ask
its a shadow on you back
it dont burn it dont bleed
still it cuts you at the knee

refrain 2
all this pressure that surrounds you
holds you down but you know you gotta break through

chorus
hey cest la vie
remember me i made you
dressed and trained you
hey its bitter sweet
you cant kill me with kindness
i dont buy it
strip down show me flesh and bone
