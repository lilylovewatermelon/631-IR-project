verse 1
you once were someone i could dignify ah ah
a guiding force in which i thought i could rely
i watched as you began to metamorphosize ah
cant face it anymore its eating me alive

prechorus
im not able to recognize
where does the answer lie
youre no longer the same
is there nothing more that i can do

chorus
who who who
the hell are you
who who who
the fuck are you

verse 2
you were someone in whom i could confide ah ah
but you pushed me further away with every single lie
you used to have a soul but it has surely died ah
what happened
when did you turn to the other side

for every words a lie
you are forever changed
and theres nothing more
that i can do

you and i we were once so
you and i it was once incredible
you and i we were once so
you and i we were indivisible
you and i we were once two of a kind
where did all your innocence go
now i wonder how it happened
that you and i we were once so
you and i we were once inseparable
you and i we were once like gemini it was undeniable
you and i we were once two of a kind
where did my deliverance go
can there be a mend to this divide
prechorus
im not able to recognize
where does the answer lie
youre no longer the same
is there nothing more that i can do

where does the answer lie
where does the answer lie
its eating me alive
who who who

where does the answer lie
where does the answer lie
its eating me alive
