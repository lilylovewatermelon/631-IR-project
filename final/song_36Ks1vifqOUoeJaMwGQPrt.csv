i couldve been working overtime
or at home trying to make that truck run right
instead of wading out in that stream
all day long barely catching a thing
just me and dad
im glad he talked me in to that

chorus
it was time well wasted
and theres no way i trade a few more dollars in my pocket i couldve spent
for a day ill never forget
no i didnt get a thing done
but i sure soaked up every minute of the memory we were making
and i count it all as time well wasted

verse 2
those leaves were a foot deep in the yard
and wash me was written all over the car
but watching movies all day with you
wasnt on my list of things to do
but we laid on that couch
girl we never left the house

2nd chorus
it was time well wasted
and theres no way i trade a few more things that i couldve crossed off my list
for a day ill never forget
no i didnt get a thing done
but i sure soaked up every minute of the memory we were making
and i count it all as time well wasted
see brad paisley liveget tickets as low as 55you might also likebridge
this world spins too fast if you let it
theres always one more thing to do
but looking back i never have regretted
taking off early or calling in sick
or loving away a sunday afternoon

chorus
it was time well wasted
and theres no way i trade a few more dollars or things crossed off my list
for a day ill never forget
no i didnt get a thing done
but i sure soaked up every minute of the memory we were making
and i count it all as time well wasted

outro
i count it all as time well wastedembed"
