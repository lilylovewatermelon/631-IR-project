sometimes i feel the weight
of codependency
i dont deserve the blame
i just dont feel the same
the feelings i attained
they trickle down the drain
im just not entertained
there isnt much to gain

chorus
why you bother me
dont depend on me no
unless youre swallowing
i could use your deep throat

verse 2
we dont gotta be
together together forever forever
causе i could cause i could do better do bеtter
why settle why settle for lesser for lesser
or hector or hector or jacob or jacob
or kenny or kenny theres plenty through the city
so be good or ill be tempted temper tantrum
said i love you never meant it
you was handsome with a heavy dick
a cannon you do damage
you really workin with your resources
and baby i aint mad at it
its just that i dont like that tieddown shit
if you not tryna put the leg work in
you might also likechorus
please dont bother me
dont depend on me no
are you following
ill never ask for that much
