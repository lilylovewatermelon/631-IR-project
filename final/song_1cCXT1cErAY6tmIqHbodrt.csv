yeah huh
yeah

verse 1
look me and lil sandra bagging cds in the bubble wrap
people recognize me from the tv but im done with that
people dont wanna see me succeed this shit come with that
even when i come back i dont know if its me thats gonna be coming back
soon as i left i had to make peace with that
dropped out of school cause nobody was teaching that
the best western is where a nigga was sleeping at
daemen college booking me to pull up and speak the facts
even if they make a movie bout us this shitll be hard to reenact
dislocated shoulder its hard to be always reaching back
all these ious its hard for me to be keeping track
friends that dedicated they life to just keepin me intact
hard to pay 40 pay noel pay niko back
all the nights i needed to vent to someone and cj sat
all the nights chubbs was pulling up where i need him at
all the times mark was making sure that my luggage packed
or times he had to double back ohoh ohoh
i mean even with his salary you cant put no prices on that
there is no salary cap there is no payin him back for real
i wonder what it couldve been if i had snakes in the mix
actually i never wanna know cause we made it like this
shots gotta fly either way now i make it or miss
overtime hours all good we take it in shifts
what would you do if it wasnt this thats a hard one
the finish line is where i like to pull up and start from
pain is just a place that i go to get the bars from
anxietys a drug that i use to get the job done
delusionals a space i like to think that im far from
my son is the one thing i hate to be apart from
bet against me dont know where they getting the odds from
i know that when its done im going wherever gods from
but i still dont know where i get the calm from
where i get the calm from yeah

verse 2
look gotta hold my head high with two dry eyes
i told you everything is fine dawg but i lied
i be tryna draw the line but its a fine line
and im drownin out the noise from the sideline
sometime its louder than the voice i got in my mind
i cant even hear myself when i get quiet time
like how they tellin me im done when im in my prime
theyve been tryna push a narrative since 09
and they even had my ass convinced a couple times
but that aint even the half i had tougher times
only look for sympathy inside my mothers eyes
and its whatever with them niggas on the other side
we got problems we could never really put aside
i cracked the door for us all put my foot inside
i tried to kill them boys with kindness but they wouldnt die
so now i kill em all for acting like they couldnt die yeah
my hard work doesnt just pay off it pays all the family debts off
im taking heads off future out here like irving azoff
houses paid off label paid off
my soul for the money wasnt the tradeoff
unlike most of you boys that fade off
i feel guilty taking some days off
please dont google my net worth the numbers are way off
i mean if you comparin it to what i really made off with
im more like bernie with all the earnings that they came off
trust me it was nothin light holmes
they tried to give me a slice of the pie and i took the knife home
i know you love me
cant picture bein a hubby finger too stubby to fit a ring on
unless kawhi wanna run it back
other than that the stringsll be unattached
certified lover boy im not the one for cuddling or none of that
yall music gets watered down when you love em back
and you know what im on blowing past ya owning masters
said youre like a father figure to me but now daddys not around so im a bastard
oh of course the only villain that show remorse when i owe you more
soft spot for all the ones that came before i cant ignore it
im always tryna rekindle
from the bottom to the top man whats it like in the middle
from the lemon faced radio host that love to be bitter
to my dogs in the game who wasnt pick of the litter
for the young gs out here starting from the beginning
nobody praying for you when you winning dont forget it winning dont forget it
outro
woah woah woahwoah
woah woah
woah woahwoah woah
woah woah ah
said its hard when it starts to fade away
said its hard when it starts to fade away
yeah ooh yeah
said its hard when it starts to fade away
hard when it starts to fade away
its hard when the memories start to fade away
said its hard when the memories start to fade away
yeah yeah yeah yeah
ooh ooh so beautiful
yeah yeah yeah16embed"
