seemed to stop my breath
my head on your chest waiting to cave in
from the bottom of my
hear your voice again
could we dim the sun and wonder where weve been
maybe you and me so kiss me like you did
my heart stopped beating such a softer sin

chorus
im melting
im melting
in your eyes
i lost my place
could stay a while
and im melting
in your eyes
like my first time
that i caught fire
just stay with me
lay with me now

verse 2
never caught my breath
every second im without you im a mess
ever know each other
trust these words are stones
my cuts aren’t healing
learning how to love

im melting
im melting
in your eyes
i lost my place
could stay a while
and im melting
in your eyes
like my first time
that i caught fire
just stay with me
lay with me now

verse 3
you can stay and watch me fall
and of course ill ask for help
just stay with me now
we could take our heads off stay in bed
just make love thats all
just stay with me now

chorus
im melting
im melting
in your eyes
i lost my place
could stay a while
and im melting
in your eyes
like my first time
that i caught fire
just stay with me
lay with me now
im melting
im melting
in your eyes
i lost my place
could stay a while
and im melting
in your eyes
like my first time
that i caught fire
just stay with me
lay with me now
outro
in your eyes
let’s sleep till the sun burns out
im melting in your eyes4embed"
