blame it on what youve been through
blame it on what youre into
blame it on your religions
blame it on politicians

chorus
weve been blowing up
were the issue
its our condition
weve been blowing up
were the issue
our detonation
weve been blowing up
were the issue
were ammunition
were ammunition
were ammunition
we are the fuse and the ammunition

verse 2
i have no generation
show me my motivation
one world one desperation
one hope and one salvation

look what a mess weve made of love
