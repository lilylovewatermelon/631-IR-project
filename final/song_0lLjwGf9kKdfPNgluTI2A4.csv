one two three four

verse 1
sappy pathetic little me
that was the girl i used to be
you had me on my knees

verse 2
id trade you places any day
id never thought you could be that way
but you looked like me on sunday

chorus
you came in with the breeze
on sunday morning
you sure have changed since yesterday
without any warning
i thought i knew you whoaoh
i thought i knew you whoaoh
i thought i knew you well
so well

verse 3
youre trying my shoes on for a change
they look so good but fit so strange
out of fashion so i can complain
see no doubt liveget tickets as low as 425you might also likechorus
oh you came in with the breeze
on sunday morning
you sure have changed since yesterday
without any warning
i thought i knew you whoaoh
i thought i knew you whoaoh
i thought i knew you well
so well

bridge
i know who i am but who are you
youre not looking like you used to
youre on the other side of the mirror
so nothings looking quite as clear
thank you for turning on the lights
thank you now youre the parasite
i didnt think you had it in you
and now youre looking like i used to

chorus
you came in with the breeze
on sunday morning
you sure have changed since yesterday
without any warning
and you want me badly
cause you cannot have me
i thought i knew you whoaoh
but ive got a new view whoaoh
i thought i knew you well
oh well
outro
ooh on sunday morning
without a warning
sunday morning
i thought i knew you
sunday morning
oh you want me badly
you cannot have me
sunday morning
sunday morning
