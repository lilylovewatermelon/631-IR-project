verse 1
i stare at my reflection in the mirror
why am i doing this to myself
losing my mind on a tiny error
i nearly left the real me on the shelf
no no no no no

chorus
dont lose who you are in the blur of the stars
seeing is deceiving dreaming is believing
its okay not to be okay
sometimes its hard to follow your heart
tears dont mean youre losing everybodys bruising
just be true to who you are
