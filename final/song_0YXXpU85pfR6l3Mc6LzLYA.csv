a river in july two kids on summer break
another record high clothes scattered on the bank
the rush of jumping in i wanna feel that again

verse 2
sun going down build a fire in the dirt
youre dancing all around ooh wearing my tshirt
the way you pull me in i wanna feel that again

chorus
guitar coming through the speakers
that song you never want to end
gimme some of that you and me
some of that way back when
a little bit of wild and free
i want to feel that again

verse 3
nothing but a blur gravel road a flatbed ford
always was the cure ooh whenever we got bored
sideways round the bend yeah i wanna feel that again

chorus
guitar coming through the speakers
that song you never want to end
gimme some of that you and me
some of that way back when
a little bit of wild and free
i want to feel that again yeah
