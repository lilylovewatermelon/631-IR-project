come on

verse 1
lets take them back to the days
when we were family
my breath was your breath when we were young
i think its funny how the times have changed
throw being jealous in the mix and now all i know of you is a name
couldnt have came at a better time
this ends right now

chorus
we gave all of ourselves to entertain you
were only hurting us
we gave all of ourselves to entertain you
were only hurting ourselves

verse 2
im a god amongst the ants and your girlfriends
and you act like you dont even know
cause you havent been here for too long
i called this right from the start
i turn my back for one second now all i hear is a shot in the dark
use my name like you know me
youre all the same
see a day to remember liveget tickets as low as 108you might also likebreakdown
keep running your mouth
keep running your mouth
motherfucker oh

chorus
we gave all of ourselves to entertain you
were only hurting us
we gave all of ourselves to entertain you
were only hurting ourselves

postchorus
hurting ourselves
hurting ourselves
hurting ourselves

outro
mark my words were taking over the world
mark my words were taking over the world
mark my words were taking over the world
mark my words were taking over the worldembed"
