im not about
to blow it now for all the cows
for all the cows

its funny how
money allows
all to browse and be endowed

this wish is true
it falls into
pieces new the cow is you
the cow is you

my kind has all run out
as if kinds could blend
some time if time allows

everything worn in
everything worn in
everything worn in like its a friend

i said youre all
a painted doll
and it caused the walls to fall
see foo fighters liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likehow far is he
impatiently
thats as far as far can be
as far could be

my kind has all run out
as if kinds could blend
some time if time allows

everything worn in
everything worn in
everything worn in like its a friend

im called a cow
im not about
to blow it now
for all the cows

its funny how
money allows
all to browse
and be endowed and be endowed

my kind has all run out
as if kinds could blend
some time if time allows
everything worn in
everything worn in
everything worn in like its a friendembed"
