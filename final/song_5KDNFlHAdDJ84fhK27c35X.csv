youre such an inspiration for the ways
that i will never ever choose to be

postchorus
oh so many ways for me to show you
how your savior has abandoned you

verse 1
fuck your god
your lord your christ he did this
took all you had and left you this way
still you pray you never stray you never
never taste of the fruit
never thought to question why

chorus
its not like you killed someone
its not like you drove a hateful spear into his side
praise the one who left you broken down and paralyzed
he did it all for you
he did it all for you

postchorus
oh so many ways for me to show you
how your dogma has abandoned you
you might also likeverse 2
pray to your christ to your god
never taste of the fruit
never stray never break never
choke on a lie
even though hes the one who did this to you
never thought to question why

chorus
not like you killed someone
its not like you drove a spiteful spear into his side
talk to jesus christ as if he knows the reasons why
he did it all for you oh
he did it all for you woah
he did it all for you15embed"
