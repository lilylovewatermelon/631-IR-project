sorry you missed me ill get back to you as soon as i can thank you and god bless

verse 1
got the news on friday mornin
but a tear i couldnt find
you showed me how i am supposed to live
and now you showed me how to die
i was lost til sunday morning
i woke up to face my fear
while writing you this goodbye song i found a tear

chorus
im gonna miss that smile
im gonna miss you my friend
even though it hurts the way it ended up
id do it all again
so play it sweet in heaven
cause thats right where you wanna be
im not cryin cause i feel so sorry for ya
im cryin for me

verse 2
i got up and dialed your number
and your voice came on the line
with that old familiar message
ive heard a thousand times
it just said sorry that i missed you
leave a message and god bless
i know that you think im crazy
but i had to hear your voice i guess

im gonna miss that smile

even though it hurts the way it ended up
id do it all again
so play it sweet in heaven
cause thats right where you wanna be
im not cryin cause i feel so sorry for ya
im cryin for me
