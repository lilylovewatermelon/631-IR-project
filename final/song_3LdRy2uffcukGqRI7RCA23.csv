verse 1 hussein fatal
i focus my locus thought on the enemy
sick of the hennessy its necessary to finish me
im antisocial immortal when it come to the vocal
jersey them niggas down and wont approach em til its time to smoke em
hussein the terrorist
nigga they think im crazy and creepy
and as we speak they try to find me a therapist
rapid fire i clap an eye til you die a liar
strapped and next hittin corners dropped em didnt want to spin the tires
my man will find ya
this 357 anaconda is enough to brand ya mama then turn around and hand you drama
military comradery oulaw til they body me
havoc i gotta have it steady blastin at prodigy
mobb 6 feet deep you try to bust me til death
and i suppose you got the dopest moves like chucky on fresh
you know the verdict who what when and why he died murdered
get your physical diverted and your vision deserted
you might also likeverse 2 2pac
now ever since mama got fucked and papa ducked out
look at us murderous thugs showin less love than a drug house
similar to savages its a wonder we manage
bring chaos causin damage in the quest for cabbage
they ask my style similar to cash when flaunted
most wanted by the population murder you for it
exploit your weakness revenge flow deep without release
criminal orders across the water bringin war to the streets
why fear me fear the shit i speak
once this shit drop its heard on every fuckin street
like the sound of police
who run the streets really in every hood legends grow
from the hustlas up in harlem to shot callers in o
and though congress dont want us to progress we stressed
my homie buried at an early age hustled to death
his last breath a lesson i possess like jewels
stay thugged out keep it movin

hey where that nigga

verse 3 yaki kadafi
halfway thugs dont budge when we stalk the streets
sort of like chalk and narcotics when they walk the beat
you speak the beef pussy draw down and drop it
hit you with 6 shots lay the law down and throw the shells in my pocket
gettin mines with nine cocked extortin
blocks pop with 22s in my socks with the butt hangin out the chocolate
you never seen time i travel across dream crime
my rolls like a million dollar bill folded with green lines
wit my pulse racin drink my henny straight no chasin
catch my body like cases 5 minutes from the station
verse 4 young noble
hit the hole like allen iverson with confidence
no finger prints that mean there was no evidence or proof that i was present
at the scene of the crime around 10 niggas bleed
after they made this punk fag motherfucka bleed
money was bloody as shit yall niggas shoulda seen it
bust a cap and freak with bowin off to one knee shit
the glock to your head nigga dont make no sudden action
hit innocent bystanders when he blastin dumped fuckin backwards
little homies puttin work for stripes
but is it worth your life and grides runnin red lights
i wish somebody would have told me then
since im an outlaw like napoleon aint no cell they can hold me in
or cage me in crazy like arabians
hold this spot like them niggas gon fade me in
havin a fiend page me page me
when they want the product nigga i got the smoke
got this weed and the coke what you need what you want
what you workin with im on some ol immortal shit
outlawz we straight hurtin shit use artillery to murder with
put on the block gangsta party and like pac
lifes hard from the ox me and my niggas on top party

verse 5 nuttso
runnin my glock put the lead in pop fuck the law
carry steel cause i live on the nigga side of the law
ridin foes cause i cant let hoes catch me slippin
quick to blow and dispose if you plot on hittin
ridin high blazin kryptonite got a nigga dazin
burpin and smirkin at enemies before i grave em
ride up with the iron up i see him he slippin
at a stop light on this lonely night
this motherfucka trippin
slide on him so i can dump and put it in him
damn i guess this motherfucker know the vicinity
hit the pedal now we high speedin
with my metal tryna make these motherfuckers die speedin
up the way i seen him slow down

caught em runnin on e thats kinda funny to me
they knew they was funkin with me but they dumb to see

verse 6 2pac
open up fire watch em expire when my shells split em
plus all them trickniggas bitchin can go to hell with em
fuck em they phony claimin they homies but they foes
speakin on thug niggas daily while we nailin they hoes
explode boldly at my stage shows and formation
words are known to spray blaze as i raise my thug nation
a crooked thought cops get bought no longer caught
out on bail raisin hell nigga fuck what you thought
did you cry when my girl died
put out the hit politic niggas worldwide grabbin my dick
i’ll never learn take away the pain with sherm
throwin gas on my enemies watchin em burn
kamikaze i’m shootin up the casket take the body
whip the corpse like a piñata and party
