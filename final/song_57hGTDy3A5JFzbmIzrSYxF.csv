theres a plane and i am flying
theres a mountain waiting for me

my sugar sweet is so attainable
this behavior so unexplainable
the days just slip and slide
like they always did
the trouble is my head
wont let me forget
i took one last good look around
so many unusual sounds
i gotta get my feet on the ground

help me get down
i can make it help me get down
if i only knew the answer

if i only knew the answer
and if all our days are numbered

if i only knew the answer
if i change my way of living
and if i pave my streets with good times
will the mountain keep on giving

and if all of our days are numbered
then why do i keep counting5embed"
