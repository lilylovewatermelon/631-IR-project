open call for prison architects
send me your blueprints asapÂ 
stack the walls such that i cannot breathe
man is breedin forever because of the weather
i hope soon to leave from the east
no more absolutes no more absolutes
stick your penitentiary clothes inside the vent and run along leigh

verse 2
amateur sea salt gatherers colonized
theyre good enough for conrad hilton not good enough for my eyes
i trust you will tell me if i am making a fool of myself
man is breedin forever breedin forever they come out and blister the sea
oh yeahyou might also likeembed"
