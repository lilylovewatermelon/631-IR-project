no theres no denying chemistry this strong
yes pretend its right but we both know its wrong
thinking about the storm advancing
thinking about the lightning dancing
in your eyes
but i cant shake these memories that rain inside

prehook
tension builds
i think were underthinking part time thrills
chorus 1
i know i know how to drive you wild
you know you know how to make me smile
but i need you to be
my ancient history

verse 2
damn pick up the phone uhoh im drunk again
and you know my intentions cause its 2am
its fun and games until we both get hurt
we play with fire cause we like the way it burns
no use in patching up a sinking ship
this is the last time we do this baby
this is the last time you taste my lips
you might also likechorus 2
i know i know how to drive you wild
you know you know how to make me smile
but i need you to be
my ancient history
i know i know who you really are
you know you know how to break my heart
but i need you to be
my ancient history

bridge
yeah its the way you let me throw you across the bed
got you running through my head
when i know i should be sleeping
but i cant escape
youre addicted to the lust
the imaginary trust
that youre begging for me screaming for it
here we go now its time to cut the cord
and abandon all support
were through

chorus 3
i know i know how to drive you wild
you know you know how to make me smile
but i need you to be
my ancient history
i know i know who you really are
you know you know how to break my heart
but i need you to be
my ancient history
outro
i know i know
you know you know
no baby dont come back dont come back
but i need you to be
my ancient history3embed"
