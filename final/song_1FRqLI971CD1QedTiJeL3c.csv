i dont want a lot for christmas
there is just one thing i need
i dont care about the presents
underneath the christmas tree
i just want you for my own
more than you could ever know
make my wish come true
you know that all i want for christmas
is you

verse 1
i wont ask for much this christmas
i wont even wish for snow
no im just gonna keep on waiting
underneath the mistletoe
theres no sense in hanging stockings
there upon the fireplace
cause santa he wont make me happy
with a toy on christmas day

hook
i just want you here tonight
holding on to me so tight
girl what can i do
you know that all i want for christmas
is you

and all the lights are shining
so brightly everywhere
and the sound of childrens
laughter fills the air
and everyone is singing
i can hear those sleigh bells ringing
santa wont you bring me the one i really love
wont you please bring my baby to me

chorus
i dont want a lot for christmas
this is all im asking for
no i just wanna see my baby
standing right outside my door
oh i just want you for my own
more that you could ever know
make my wish come true
you know that all i want for christmas
is you
is youembed"
