verse 1 chris king
if her ex nigga play it girl you know we do that to break
got a lot of lovin but its hard to get out of em
put my neck up on the line but they just a formality
rip my heart up out my chest like a fuckin fatality
semiautomatic wes for the gang and comradery
give my baby girl the world and everything thats inside of it
got these scars up on my knuckles and she know im not proud of it
designer pussy what she giving she like gucci and prada me yeah
ima catch a body come and suck on and slop on me
she wanna get a friend involved i told her its possible
you cant ignore the drip girl you gotta acknowledge it
more than your pride ima need you to swallow it
