girl like to marry
save up all your usds for british universities

cut to the chase youre a big disgrace
with a skip and a beat and youre in this place
if youd have known better then youd have written a letter
complaining all the time about the dull rainy weather

i dont know ifthis what you this what youve come for
i dont know ifthis what youre this what youre looking for

go go away
you know weve changed
so much more than your playground
youll be safer stay uptown

go go away
you know weve changed
so much more than your playground
youll be safer stay uptown
you might also likego go away
cut to the chase youre a big disgrace
with a skip and a beat and youre in this place
go go away
if youd have known better then youd have written a letter
complaining all the time about the dull rainy weather
go go away
i dont know if this what youve this what youve come for
hahahaha
