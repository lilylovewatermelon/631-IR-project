he wears his heart safetypinned to his backpack
his backpack is all that he knows
shot down by strangers whose glances can cripple
the heart and devour the soul

chorus
all alone he turns to stone
while holding his breath half to death
terrified of whats inside to
save his life he crawls like a worm from a bird
all alone crawls like a worm from a bird

whispered postchorus
dont tell on me dont tell on me
no dont you tell on me please
its okay dont tell on me please

verse 2
out of his mind the weight pushes him whisperin
mustve been out of his mind out of his mind
midday delusions of pushing this out of his head
may be out of his mind out of his mind

chorus
all alone he turns to stone
while holding his breath half to death
terrified of whats inside to
save his life he crawls like a worm crawls like a worm
crawls like a worm from a bird crawls like a worm
all alone crawls like a worm from a bird
all alone crawls like a worm from a bird
all alone crawls like a worm
crawls like a worm from a bird

all he knows
if he cant relieve it it grows
all alone and so it goes and so it goes
he crawls like a worm
crawls like a worm from a bird
and he crawls like a worm
he crawls like a worm
he crawls like a worm
crawls like a

interlude
out of his mind the weight pushes him whispering
mustve been out of his mind

chorus
all alone he turns to stone
while holding his breath half to death
terrified of whats inside to
save his life he crawls like a worm from a bird
all alone hes holding his breath half to death
holding his breath half to death
terrified to save his life
he crawls like a worm he crawls like a worm
crawls like a worm from a bird crawls like a worm
all alone crawls like a worm from a bird
all alone crawls like a worm from a bird
all alone crawls like a worm crawls like a worm
crawls like a worm from a bird
