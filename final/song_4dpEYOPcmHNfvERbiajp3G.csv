sweetie little jean where did you go
everyones been searching high and low
and your mothers worried sick
dearest daddy lost his grip
while the whole worlds watching
candlelight vigils being held in silence
on the channel four
and theyve knocked on every door
every place youve been before

refrain
how long will we let it go
i think we should just let go

chorus
i i want you back back
lets get back
lay my weary head against your bones
where all my troubles will be dead and gone

refrain
how long will we let it go
i think we should just let go

verse 2
has melancholy taken you for good
you know that i would save you if i could
watched your laughter turn to tears
then you vanished in thin air
well we pinned your missing persons picture up
on every motherloving post
hows it feel to be a ghost
youre the one i love the most

i i want you back back
lets get back
lay my weary head against your breast
where all our troubles will be laid to rest

verse 3
i pushed and i pulled til i pushed you aside
now all that is left are the tears that you cried
im sorry love for all of the damage done
my only hope is someday to be back beside you

chorus
i i want you back back
lets get back
lay my weary head against your bones
where all our troubles will be dead and gone

refrain
how long will we let it go
i think we should just let go19embed"
