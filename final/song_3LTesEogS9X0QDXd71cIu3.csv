pray for me if you still believe
sometimes i just feel like nobodys listening
or moves in a way that i cannot see
save the music now ringing in my ears

prechorus
my dreams go bad baby
my trials they die lately
my truths they hide waiting
patiently circling my mind
im all faded im gazing dilated
to the back with the bad baby fighting for

chorus
now theyre standing in the door
saying thats my shit thats my shit
thats what everybody wants some more of
singing you may be the death of me
no disrespect baby but thats my shit thats my shit
thats what everybodys on the floor for
singing you may be the death of me

postchorus
you ohh you ohh
you ohh you may be the death of me
you ohh you ohh
