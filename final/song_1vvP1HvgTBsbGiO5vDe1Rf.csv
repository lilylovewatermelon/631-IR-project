girl i know we just had the talk
said we needed some time to cool it off
and ive been on my side of town just staying low
you come walking in this little bar
like you could set off that fire alarm
and one little drink wont hurt but dont you know

chorus
girl were lightning striking matches
thats what always happens
when we get too close
when you start dancing in the neon
whisper baby dream on
then the whiskey hits the coke
next thing you know were going up in smoke

verse 2
we start out slow like a cigarette
burn all night like we always did
theyll be sweeping up the ashes when we go
yeah were playing with a fire we cant control
and we both know

chorus
girl were lightning striking matches
thats what always happens
when we get too close
when you start dancing in the neon
whisper baby dream on
then the whiskey hits the coke
next thing you know were going up in smoke

going up going up going up in smoke
going up going up going up in smoke
going up going up going up in smoke
going up up up in smoke

chorus
girl were lightning striking matches
thats what always happens
when we get too close
when you start dancing in the neon
whisper baby dream on
then the whiskey hits the coke
next thing you know were going up in smoke
yeah were going up in smoke
yeah were going up in smokeembed"
