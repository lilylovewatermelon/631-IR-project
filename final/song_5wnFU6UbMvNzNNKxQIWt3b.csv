verse 3 ali
i rip grass
and smash with a 44 mag this nigga jag
from the front to the back i heard it crash nigga you sassin i hurt em bad
you heard him laugh talkin trash bout whoopin my ass
i never let a nigga do that who that get his brains blew back with a new gat
yellin true that hollow tips is goin clean through that
and i didnt have to get my whole team just to do that
in a blue hat with a black baggy karl kani
an iced out ring just to score on your eye
hard to die like bruce lee get a victory
cats is sick like hiv if they feelin weak
we be nikki sacks jackie frost scratchy
danny terrio dutch schultz to the motorola
money hold up whippin the rover high roller dog
what you holdin im paid so controllin yall
yiggidy yes yall like das efx is be next
to rep that midwest its sets and projects
verse 4 kyjuan
now once kyjuan say hit the safe raise the stakes
tics in fifty states might as well blaze the cake
i got moves to make transactions to handshakes
drugs for papes now im sellin cds and tapes
funerals and wakes caused by greed and hate
a snake is still a snake no matter the size or shape
those that hate anchored with weights found in the lake
come off the chain my main you tied to the gate
first you caught a case second you caught the babes
third you caught me with your date that was no mistake
good things come to those who wait
so if you waitin on them tics huh they gon be late
in your house with your spouse im doin the nasty
im a felon ask jay i rob industries and ashtrays
branson and hashy 
and wrap somethin and burn the place ya heard me

verse 5 nelly
watch me load up the ammo cock it back slow
in the back door infrared low
tell me somethin that i dont already know
like which one of these closets contain cash flow
got three little problems i just thought you should know
peep im addicted to yes and im allergic to no
im obsessed with dough money makin and the hoes
anything other than satisfaction gon blow
heard through the grapevine you lookin for me
couldnt be cause if it was you would be bookin from me
shook when ya see nelly rollin in the gs3
hangin out the sunroof like bing bing bing
back the car up pop the trunk now
can ya hold ya breath cause ima flood this town
that ass scream ninesecondfive right here
neighbors on the lawn like nelly why right here
chorus st lunatics
call the cops why i see a robbery in progress
lunatics about to steal the show

call the cops why i see a robbery in progress
lunatics about to steal the show
ayy where are you guys from again
from the stl mo 314
