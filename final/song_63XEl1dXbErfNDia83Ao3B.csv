evelyns asleep
on the grave yard shift again
selling gasoline

and theres kids smoking on south first
see high school was just a blur to her
and everything just found their place it seemed

theres an old folk song on the radio
sounding thin and dark and haunted
theres a bag of weed in the back beneath the books

and she cant stand the sight of this culdesac
like an old crow king of the lamppost
and this window hasnt been this clean since it last rained

well she pictures up a different day
driving west to east la
and there aint no sign of a dime but hey
anyone can dream
anyone can dream

and all the college girls come in when the bars let out and theyâ€™re hungry
making such a mess evelyn just talks trash as shes sweeping up
see gregory alan isakov liveget tickets as low as 40you might also liketheres a thin dark cloud in the evening air
after every sunny day
theres a bum who lives in the parking lot
wash the windows just to say hey

all the tables nice and clean
evelyns asleep
on the grave yard shift again
