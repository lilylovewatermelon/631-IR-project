youre gonna break another heart youre gonna tell another lie

verse 1
well here i am and there you go youre gone again
i know youre gonna be the way youve always been
breakin hearts and tellin lies is all you know
another guy gives you the eye and there you go

chorus
there you go youre gone again
i should have known i couldnt win
there you go youre by his side
youre gonna break another heart youre gonna tell another lie

verse 2
because i love you so i take much more than i should take
i want you even though i know my heart is gonna break
you build me up and for a while im all aglow
then your fickle heart sees someone else and there you go

chorus
there you go youre gone again
i should have known i couldnt win
there you go youre by his side
youre gonna break another heart youre gonna tell another lieyou might also likeembed"
