lying all alone and restless
unable to lose this image
sleepless unable to focus on
anything but your surrender

prechorus
tugging a rhythm to the vision thats in my head
tugging a beat to the sight of you lying
so delighted with a new understanding
something about a little evil that makes that
unmistakable noise i was hearing
unmistakable sound that i know so well
spent and sighing with a look in your eyes
spent and sweating with a look on your face like

chorus
sweet revelation
sweet surrender
surrender surrender surrender
