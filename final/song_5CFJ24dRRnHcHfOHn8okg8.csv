i wanna scream
until no sound comes out and youve learned your lesson
i wanna swallow these pills to get to sleep
so i dont have to make a bad impression

prechorus
i need to start to be myself
cause im sick of everybody else

chorus
i wont let you bring me down
its here and now im breaking out
i will learn to love again
but i will stand a broken man

verse 2
i wanna run but only far enough to make you miss me
i wanna take back all the shit that i have done
but i guess you were better off without me

prechorus
i need to start to be myself
cause im sick of everybody else

chorus
i wont let you bring me down
its here and now im breaking out
i will learn to love again
but i will stand a broken man

i took one big step and i looked away
and then i thought of all the things that i wanted to say
im always too late
you never got your story straight
im always up late
i think im everything you hate
i took one big step and i looked away
and then i thought of all the things that i wanted to say
im always too late
you never got your story straight
im always up late
i think im everything you hate
i took one big step and i looked away
and then i thought of all the things that i wanted to say
im always too late
you never got your story straight
im always up late
i think im everything you hate

chorus
i wont let you bring me down
its here and now im breaking out
i will learn to love again
but i will stand a broken man
i took one big step and i looked away and i thought of all the things that i wanted to say
i wont let you bring me down
im always too late you never got your story straight im always up late i think im everything you hate
its here and now im breaking out
i took one big step and i looked away and i thought of all the things that i wanted to say
i will learn to love again
im always too late you never got your story straight
but i will stand a broken manembed"
