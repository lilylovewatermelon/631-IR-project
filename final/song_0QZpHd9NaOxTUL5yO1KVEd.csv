follow me down
down into a hole in the ground
i dug it just for you
exactly how you wanted me to

verse 2
its been over a year
the snow isnt what brought us to tears
the ambulance came way too late
and they lied to your face

chorus
im calling to see how things are there
i want you to know how much i care
i wish i could take away your pain
i fear ill come home to see your grave

verse 3
mother please dont cry
im states away and begging to die
i left you all alone
im scared every time i come home
we made it through the mess
the doctor said theyre doing their best
their best just wasnt enough
and we cried all through the month

im calling to see how things are there

i wish i could take away your pain
i fear ill come home to see your graveembed"
