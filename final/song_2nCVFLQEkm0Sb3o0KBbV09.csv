verse 3 project pat
im on the north side of memphis
you could come get this
shooting 50round drums at you son of bitches
for my riches ill murk you on the front porch
blood on my money like that phone on the full floor
pockets used to be malnutrition  cambodian
come through with a k and sweep your hood like the custodian
throw a couple of bands throw a couple of bows
who wants to kill for me bring em on a couple of shows
if you aint from my hood then you can get it quicker
my niggas ride with that k since they full of liquor
cause they full of fiends cause they full of green
stay with this shit nawmean2embed"
