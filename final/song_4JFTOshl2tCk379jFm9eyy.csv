oh no i just keep on falling
back to the same old
and wheres hope when misery comes crawling
oh my wayay
with your faith youll trigger a landslide
victory
and kill off this common sense of mine

and it takes acquired minds
to taste to taste to taste this wine
you cant down it with your eyes
so we dont need the headlines
we dont need the headlines we just want
we want the airwaves back
we want the airwaves back

chorus
everybody sing
like its the last song you will ever sing
tell me tell me do you feel the pressure now
everybody live
like its the last day you will ever see
tell me tell me do you feel the pressure now
