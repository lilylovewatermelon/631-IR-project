its a cold cold world outside aint on the worst crew
i aint got no one that i can trust i got my guard up so high
cant even be with you

verse 1
tell me bae now can we please stop fighting i need you on side me
i might lose my life tonight
later on im gon be maybach riding world war iii inside me
tryna see why nothing i do aint right okay okay
he dont give a fuck about nobody but hisself oh
he wouldnt give one dime or care if i left oh
know he got shit popping but at home he got shit going on
leave that shit alone let me lean pass me my styrofoam
dont conversate about me with your friends
confiscating bring back backends
love me right and bring back my mind
and dont never leave like ones back then
shine right and have fun with your girls
i just wanna see you set some trends
they dont love me like way back then
wasnt even there for me even most my mans nah
i just wanna ball out fall off in my big home
all these drugs that im on from depression got me on
po threatening one on one just wan be left alone
they tryna say top wrong they tryna say top wrong
smiling been riding round all day im loaded now tryna fuck you in the coupe woo
next time i flood you with diamonds im going extravagant do your wrist too
panic i buy you a patek you better go tat it just like nene too uh

oh tell me now
is you tryna break me or you tryna make me something better off

verse 2
for shit that i painted for shit that they see
for shit that i live and the things that i breathe
they dont want me to succeed i still aint make it out
i see it all in my dreams of me banging out
wrist rock
all these niggas they done flipflopped
catch me out on scene with a big glock
know that i might leave out here but i been staying up
hoping all my pain i spilled starts one day paying off
hope my daddy get that appeal and they let my mans out
we got a drop now okay load up lets ride out
i cant take a risk without my stick whats just my sign now
how the fuck im talking bout cant take a risk all by myself at all
better not get yourself involved

refrain
its a cold cold world outside aint on the worst crew
i aint got no one that i can trust i got my guard up so high
i cant even be with you

chorus
oh tell me now
is you tryna break me or you tryna make me something better off
oh tell me now
is you tryna break me or you tryna make me something better off2embed"
