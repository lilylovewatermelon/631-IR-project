took the breath from my open mouth
never known how it broke me down
i went in circles somewhere else
shook the best when your love was home
storing up on your summer glow
you went in search of someone else

chorus
and i hear your ship is comin in
your tears a sea for me to swim
and i hear a storm is comin in
my dear is it all weve ever been

verse 2
caught the air in your woven mouth
leave it all ill be hearing how you went
in search of someone else
they taught the hand that taut the bride
both our eyes locked to the tide
we went in circles somewhere else

chorus
and i hear your ship is comin in
your tears a sea for me to swim
and i hear a storm is comin in
my dear is it all weâ€™ve ever been
