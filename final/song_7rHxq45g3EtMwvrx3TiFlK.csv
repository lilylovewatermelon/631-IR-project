looking for to make some sense out of nothing
looking for the hunger to hang on
looking for to know if youre really worth it
looking for a reason not to be gone

verse 1
your signs are fading baby
i cant read them anymore
cant you see where im standing baby
i got one foot out the door
you better show me something fast
cause my patience for you arenâ€™t going to last

chorus
looking for to make some sense out of nothing
looking for the hunger to hang on
looking for to know if youre really worth it
looking for a reason not to be gone

verse 2
if there isnt nothing there
well thats my time you are wasting
if you say youre giving all youve got
well thats my chain your yanking
love is on a slippery slope
barely hanging on at the end of my rope

verse 3
so tell me what youre going to do keep me around
and baby whatever it is you better do it now now now
