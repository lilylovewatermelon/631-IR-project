like gospel hymns that you called in the air
come down come down sweet reverence
unto my simple house and ring
and ring

ring like silver ring like gold
ring out those ghosts on the ohio
ring like clear day wedding bells
were we the belly of the beast or the sword that fell
we’ll never tell

come to me clear and cold on some sea
watch the world spinning waves mad machine
now i’ve been crazy couldn’t you tell
i threw stones at the stars but the whole sky fell
now i’m covered up in straw belly up on the table
well i drank and sang and passed in the stable

that tall grass grows high and brown
well i dragged you straight in the muddy ground
and you sent me back to where i roam
well i cursed and i cried but now i know
now i know

the moon was just a sliver back then
and i ached for my heart like some tin man
when it came oh it beat and it boiled and it rang
oh its ringing

ring like crazy ring like hell
turn me back into that wild haired gale
ring like silver ring like gold
turn these diamonds straight back into coal
turn these diamonds straight back into coal9embed"
