i never said it but i know that i
cant picture anything past twentyfive
not like i care to know the timing
not like im looking for that silence
self diagnosing til im borderline
ill do whatever helps to sleep at night
until im feeling like an island
until im strong enough to hide it
what was i thinking looking for a sign
as if ive ever seen the stars align
somebody take over the driving
somebody notice how im trying
somebody notice how im trying

chorus
when im toeing that line all of the time
calling it fine calling it fine
toeing that line all of the timе
calling it fine calling it fine

verse 2
how do you call it when yourе in your head
like when you really keep inside of it
i only talk into the mirror
im only scared of getting bigger
at least ill never turn to cigarettes
my brother shielded me from all of that
he said that smoking was a killer
he said he knows that ive been bitter
maybe im waiting for the go ahead
the validation that i never get
most of the game is unfamiliar
most of the girls are getting thinner

toeing that line all of the time
calling it fine calling it fine
toein that line all of the time
calling it fine calling it fine

bridge
all of me a wound to close
but i leave the whole thing open
i just wanted you to know
i was never good at coping
all of me a wound to close
but i leave the whole thing open
i just wanted you to know
i was never good at coping
all of me a wound to close
but i leave the whole thing open
i just wanted you to know
i was never good at coping
all of me a wound to close
but i leave the whole thing open
i just wanted you to know
i was never good at coping

outro
i never said it but i know that i
cant picture anything past twentyfive
not like i care to know the timing
not like im looking for that silence
i never said it but i know that i
i bury baggage til its out of sight
i think its better if i hide it
i really hope that i survive this4embed"
