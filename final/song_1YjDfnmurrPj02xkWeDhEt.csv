or so im told

the sky before my eyes is never colour grey
or so they say

i guess ive known the truth since i was pretty young
that i never knew my mothers mother tongue
ill fake all of my words till they point out to me
the crowds of purple orchid flowers
i cant see
ill borrow cords and play along until they shine
theyre still not mine still not mine still not mine still not mine
breathing all these postcards in until they land
still secondhand
she gave me half my bones and made me one my lungs
but the same cold air is filling both of them
meanwhile a crocodile points out whats left behind
the field of yellow daffodils you tried
but couldnt find
ive known since i was pretty young
ive never known my mothers mother tongue
ive known since i was pretty young
ive never known my mothers mother tongue
im putting on a smile made out of plasticine
