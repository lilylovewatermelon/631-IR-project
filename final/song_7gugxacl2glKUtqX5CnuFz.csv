verse 1
the wheels stay spinnin on the civic boy im always on the move
when you grindin all the time theres a lot of shit to do
thats why i got q cause he keep me on the routine
i be too skeed trying to kick it like bruce lee
clean shoes boy new feet
and im never in the car with only two seats
i got a whip full of people all fresh call em 10 deep
motherfucker we the future like next week
young people dont see you as an equal
they just see you as deceitful tryna send you back to preschool

verse 2
i got a brand new phone rocking brand new clothes
leaving every single party with a brand new ho
yeah ive done a little travelin circlin the globe
always keep it movin inertia on these hoes
boy im an asshole girls call him a douchebag
this some oldschool shit but no boom bap
this aint new swag its the same old me
the youngin get respect from the games ogs
cameras flashin when we passin so we stay lowkey
go to mexico to party where the pesos be
on the turnpike bitch and your tank on e
with my head out the window screaming get like me
ho you should know the way i roll
take a couple shots all to superman these hoes
you aint nothin with your wack rap
used to be the class clown but now i get the last laugh
chorus

if you tryna feel the vibes throw your hands up in the sky
motherfucker get em up up up up up up
get em up up up up up up
if you in the ride turn the volume real high
if you tryna feel the vibes throw your hands up in the sky
motherfucker get em up up up up up up
