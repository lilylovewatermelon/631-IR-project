ooh ahah
ooh ahah

verse 1
if you werent born with it
you can buy a couple ornaments
just be sure to read the warning kids
cause pretty soon youll be bored of it haha
sexual hey girl if you wanna feel sexual
you can always call up a professional
they stick pins in you like a vegetable haha

prechorus
kids forever kids forever
baby soft skin turns into leather
dont be dramatic its only some plastic
no one will love you if youre unattractive

chorus
oh mrs potato head tell me
is it true that pain is beauty
does a new face come with a warranty
will a pretty face make it better
oh mr potato head tell me
how did you afford her surgery
do you swear youll stay forever
even if her face dont stay together

verse 2
if you want a little more confidence
potatoes turn to french fries yeah its common sense
all you needs a couple more condiments
and a hundred thousand dollars for some compliments haha
its such a waste
when little girls grow into their mothers face
but little girls are learning how to cut and paste
and pucker up their lips until they suffocate haha

prechorus
kids forever kids forever
baby soft skin turns into leather
dont be dramatic its only some plastic
no one will love you if youre unattractive
