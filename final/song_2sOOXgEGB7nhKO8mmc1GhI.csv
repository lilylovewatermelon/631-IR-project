your eyes are fragile and timeless its beautiful
theres power in the words you whisper
he treats you cold and so mindless
that he dont see the setting sun
your eyes are open when you kiss him

verse dominic fike
your eyes are drawn to the wine list wine baby baby
the usual the towers in your world are sinkin
and if youre lookin for signs then you should know ooh
theres power in the words youre thinkin

chorus dominic fike

walk on the edge with someone new
talk to your man talk to your man
