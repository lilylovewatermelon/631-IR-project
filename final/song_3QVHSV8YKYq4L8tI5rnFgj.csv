ayo
this a song about
my my stepdad
lets see if this ever happened to you
i i hate
my my stepdad

verse 1
one thing that sticks in my craw
when i was six and i saw my stepfather hittin my ma
socked her right in her eyeball
im startin to think im psychotic
with all the pictures i draw of
shit that ive already witnessed it’s probably twisted my thoughts
all i can hear is drama with mom and him
i can always hear em arguin down the hallways
the walls are thin so the noise is startin to feel like the norm
our dog pissed on the carpet he stomped it so hard
doctors had to put it down
he killed my chihuahua this motherfucker

chorus
i i hate
my my stepdad stepdad
so tonight im sayin byebye stepdad stepdad

outside i look like im calm
inside im a tickin time bomb
cause of this motherfucker who sticks his dick in my mom my mom
last night he said i left the kitchen light on
but he walked in there this morning and purposely flipped it i saw him
hickory switch to my bottom i counted sixtynine times
he swatted me with it id cry
he just started hittin me harder
god i wish i could just jaw him
if i could get my weight up
but im just a second grader
this prick is bigger than i am
but ive been readin at school about this shit called liquid cyanide
im fantasizin at night when hes sleepin at just the right time
sneak up with a lethal injection
and put him down like they did to my dog
im talkin euthanasia euthanasia like kids in taiwan
this fuckin shits like saigon saigon
neighbors called police on him
so many battery charges this dudes like lithiumion
then mom and him let bygones bygones
just be bygones
so on eggshells i walk and just try not to piss this guy off
but this is why i
chorus
i i hate
my my stepdad stepdad
so tonight im sayin byebye stepdad stepdad

verse 3
so this year im goin into the fifth and im tall
im five foot six on my block im the toughest kid but i got
way bigger fish to fry
which is why im tryin to get this bitch to fly off
the handle and wait for the fist to fly to put this guy in a pine box
hes always lookin for chaos but tonight ive cooked up a plan
so this christmas i got some color books and some crayons
im layin on the floor in the living room with some friends colorin
he walks by kicks my arm and goes oops and just laughs
i yelled for mom mom and as shes rushin to my defense
i stood up and said fuck you punk and i took off and ran
to my bedroom as i fled
knowin shit would hit the fan
slammed the door and hid behind it with an aluminum bat
he kicked it in
i swung it hard as i could at his head
his noodle went splat he fell right at the foot of my bed
im a little bit scared but my angers overtooken the fear
i threw down the bat and just started whoopin his ass
beat him with my bare hands the big bad wolf aint so bad
dingdong the pussy is dead the bully finally gets his
stomped him until he pissed enough to fill a twoliter with
then buried him next to my dog
and if i go to juvie for this ima tell em
chorus
i i hate
my my stepdad stepdad
so tonight im sayin byebye stepdad stepdad
cause i i hate
my my stepdad stepdad
so tonight im sayin byebye stepdad stepdad68embed"
