looking back now well it makes me laugh
we were growing our hair we were cuttin class
knew it all already there was nothing to learn
we were striking matches just to watch em burn
listen to our music just a little too loud
we were hanging in there with the outcast crowd
heading to the rapids with some discount beer
it was a long train trestle but we had no fear

prechorus
and man i dont know
where the time goes
but it sure goes fast just like that

chorus
we were wannabe rebels who didnt have a clue
in our rock n roll tshirts and our typically bad attitudes
had no excuses for the things that wed done
we were brave we were crazy we were mostly
young
young

verse 2
talked a good game when we were out with the guys
but in the backseat we were awkward and shy
girls were a mystery that we couldnt explain
and i guess there are some things that are never gonna change

we were wannabe rebels who didnt have a clue
