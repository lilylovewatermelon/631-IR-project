cause of you my chains were broken
you were there with your arms wide open
unchanging love more than a blessing
cause of you my chains were broken
you were there with your arms wide open

verse 1
i was so confused at a tender age
so caught in a world full of hate
used to make the wrong choices along the way
i know that i gotta make a change
finally the loving inside
i started to do some meditation
but it was you oh most high
cuff em in the outside
