im all grown up now baby cant you see

verse 2
stacy do you remember when i mowed your lawn mowed your lawn
your mom came out with just a towel on towel on
i could tell she liked me from the way she stared way she stared
and the way she said you missed a spot over there spot over there
and i know that you think its just a fantasy
but since your dad walked out your mom could use a guy like me
