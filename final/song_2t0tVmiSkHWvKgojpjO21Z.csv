i aint gonna work on maggies farm no more
no i aint gonna work on maggies farm no more
well i wake up in the morning fold my hands and pray for rain
i got a head full of ideas that are drivin me insane
its a shame the way she makes me
scrub the floor
i aint gonna work on nah
i aint gonna work on maggies farm no more
i aint gonna work for maggies brother no more
nah i aint gonna work for maggies brother no more
well he hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime
and he asks you with a grin if youre havin a good time
then he fines you every time you slam the door
i aint gonna work for nah
i aint gonna work for maggies brother no more
i aint gonna work for maggies pa no more
no i aint gonna work for maggies pa no more
well he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks
his bedroom window it is made out of bricks
the national guard stands around his door
i aint gonna work for nah
i aint gonna work for maggies pa no more
you might also likei aint gonna work for maggies ma no more
no i aint gonna work for maggies ma no more
well she talks to all the servants about man and god and law
and everybody says shes the brains behind ma
shes sixtyeight but she says shes twentyfour
i aint gonna work for nah
i aint gonna work for maggies ma no more

guitar riff

i aint gonna work on maggies farm no more
no i aint gonna work on maggies farm no more
well i try my best to be just like i am
but everybody wants you
to be just like them
they sing while they slave and i just get bored
i aint gonna work on nah
i aint gonna work on maggies farm no more3embed"
