im tired of your open mouth
crawling inside my skin
endless pain we never quit
the fight within that prides begun
saying its too late
what a mans got hell learn to hate

verse 2
forget the time i said i would
replace that with i never will
beyond the facts held in your face
ignore the facts beyond your nose
saying its too late
what a mans got hell learn to hate

bridge
grow up

not without meaning
no response no revealing

outro
just grow up
