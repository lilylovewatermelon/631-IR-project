water comes
you cool me down
when im cold inside
you are warm and bright
you know you are so good for me yeah

with your childs eyes
you are more than you seem
you see into space
i see in your face
the places youve been
the things you have learned
they sit with you so beautifully yeah

you know theres no need to hide away
you know i tell the truth
we are just the same
and i can feel everything you do
hear everything you say
even when youre miles away
cause i am me the universe and you

and just like stars burning bright
making holes in the night
we are building bridges
you might also likeand you know theres no need to hide away
you know i tell the truth
we are just the same
and i can feel everything you do
hear everything you say
even when youre miles away
cause i am me the universe and you
im the universe and you

when youre on your own
ill send you a sign
just so you know
that i am me the universe and you
the universe and you
the universe and you
the universe and you
i am the universe and you2embed"
