i never really had a problem because of leaving
but everything reminds me of her this evening
so if i seem a little out of it sorry
but why should i lie everything reminds me of her

verse 2
the spin of the earth impaled a silhouette
of the sun on the steeple
and i gotta hear the same sermon
all the time now from you people

verse 3
why are you staring into outer space crying
just because you came across it and lost it
everything reminds me of her
everything reminds me of her
