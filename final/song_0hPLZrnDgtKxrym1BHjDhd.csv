verse 1 21 savage
lot of model bitches check for me
nigga don’t check for me less you got checks for me
i kept a stick like a hobo no checkin me
way back when dlo had the spot in trestletree
so many hoes had to get a vasectomy
she left her body home and brought her neck to me
i did a walkthrough they sent a jet to me
yall niggas show price less than my travel fee
one of my arms worth a ticket
watch so much that a car came with it
back in the day i used to rob with no mask on
shit on my wrist i woulda killed the whole house for
and i went to school high i aint go to class though
i was with the ogs learnin bout the glass bowl
caught me with a deuce five mama kicked my ass bro
break yourself leave his brains on the dashboard

we got four choppers that’s full 21
way before rappin’ on god i was trappin sneakin’ my glock in lacura on god
