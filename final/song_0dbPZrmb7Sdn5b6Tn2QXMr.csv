when its said and done youre the only one
youre the only one
and when its said and done youre the only one
youre the only one

verse
whoever said this pain would ever go away
didn’t know what it meant to be here without you
is everything you see reminding you of me
does it hurt when you breathe too
cause it does when i do
cause it does when i do

chorus
when anybody says your name i wanna run away
i keep remembering i cant forget you
it doesnt matter what i try it happens anyway
its been forever and i cant forget you
with every single day it wont go away
the way i feel about you
and when its said and done youre the only one
and i cant regret you so i cant forget you

when its said and done youre the only one
youre the only one
and when its said and done youre the only one
youre the only one

and yesterday was proof that tomorrow will too
no matter what they say cant drink it all away
cause all that i do is think about you
is think about you

chorus

i keep remembering i cant forget you

and i cant regret you so i cant forget you

stop haunting my dreams
