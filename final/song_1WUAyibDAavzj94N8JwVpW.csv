silly boy dont talk to me
i dont have the energy
please dont ask to
dance with me tonight

i do better on my own
i dont mean to come off cold
but my dear im all danced out tonight

now the gin is hitting me
and its almost half past three

im sorry if i cant go for another swing

chorus
youre a charmer thats for sure
but i cant stand anymore
shame i wouldve danced with you tonight
