but i had to carry you
and you pushed me in
and now my feet cant touch the bottom of you

prechorus

chorus
stuck your tongue down the throat of somebody
who loves you more
so i will wait for the next time you want me
like a dog with a bird at your door
mmm

verse 2
we hate tears in heaven
but its sad that his baby died
and we fought about john lennon
until i cried

prechorus
and then went to bed upset

chorus
but now i am dreaming and youre singing at my birthday
and ive never seen you smiling so big
its nautical themed and theres something im supposed to say
but cant for the life of me remember what it is
you might also likebridge
and if i could give you the moon
i would give you the moon

chorus
you are sick and youre married and you might be dying
but youre holding me like water in your hands
when you saw the dead little bird you started crying
but you know the killer doesnt understand23embed"
