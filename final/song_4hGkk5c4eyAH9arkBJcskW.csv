sleep like a freak and i eat like a animal
step up to the team thats something you aint ready for
wake up in a dying world looking like the antidote
heard you talking down let me see where the anna go

verse
yeah its just like that
thinking they creative cause they ass can rap
chris said get back
pussy boy take a lap you dont really want that
as i post up at the house
looking out the window blowing smoke laying down
i cut back to the scene from the past
used to sound like stone cold when we used to break glass
never saw the teacher so i never missed math
never went to school so i never ditched class

chorus
sleep like a freak and i eat like a animal
step up to the team thats something you aint ready for
wake up in a dying world looking like the antidote
heard you talking down let me see where the anna go

outro
where the anna go see where the anna go
