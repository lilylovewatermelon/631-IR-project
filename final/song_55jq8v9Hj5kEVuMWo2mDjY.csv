his fate was sealed
she could see him comin like a hundred other liars
it was no big deal
rosa had a lover on the shady side of town
tito he was king op the streets
she was his possession like a jewel on his crown
johnny better run better run

better hide your heart
better hold on tight
better say your prayers
cause theres trouble tonight
when pride and love battle with desire
better hide your heart
cause youre playin with fire
ah ah ah ah hey hey heydo do do do

the ride was over but the story doesnt end
he took her heart
she looked him in the eye
and said they couldnt meet again
you could see the trouble start
the word went out that rosas messin with someone
it was on the street
tito looked for johnny with a vengeance and a gun
johnny better run better run
see bonnie tyler liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likejohnnys holdin rosa on a rooftop in the night
as time stood still
they couldnt hear him comin
till he had them both in sight
you could feel the chill
a shot rang out like thunder
and the blood was on her hands
with nothing won
when someone lies there dyin
lovers finally understandembed"
