theres a blue rocking chair
sitting in the sand
weathered by the storms and well oiled hands
it sways back and forth with the help of the winds
seems to always be there like an old trusted friend

chorus
ive read a lot of books
wrote a few songs
looked at my life where its going where its gone
ive seen the world through a bus windshield but nothing compares
to the way that i see it
to the way that i see it
to the way that i see it when i sit in that old blue chair

verse 2
from that chair ive caught a few fish and some rays
and ive watched boats sail in and out of cinnamon bay
i let go of a lover that took a piece of my heart
i prayed many times for forgiveness and a brand new start

chorus
ive read a lot of books
wrote a few songs
looked at my life where its going where its gone
ive seen the world through a bus windshield but nothing compares
to the way that i see it
to the way that i see it
to the way that i see it when i sit in that old blue chair
see kenny chesney liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likeverse 3
that chair was my bed one new years night
when i passed out from too much cruzan and diet
and woke up to a hundred mosquito bites
i swear got them all sitting right there
in that old blue chair

outro
theres a blue rocking chair
sitting in the sand
weathered by the storms and well oiled handsembed"
