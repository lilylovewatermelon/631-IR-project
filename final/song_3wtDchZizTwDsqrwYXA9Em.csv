my best friends ship is sinkin
she thinks her mans been cheatin
and me i put my dog down yesterday
and when the walls start fallin
i can hear the whiskey callin
sounds like we could both just use a drink

prechorus
aint that how life goes
no we aint alone

chorus
someones cryin someones kissin
someones smilin someones bitchin
someones celebratin
while someones heart is breakin
if youre on cloud nine or youve been knocked down
theres a neon light on the edge of town
so if the world just keeps on spinnin
well be keeping bars in business

verse 2
theres a couple in a back booth
just got back from cancun
getting blue moon drunk in that honeymoon phase
and by the window theres an old man
with a ring still on his left hand
even though shes been gone
ten years to the day

while someones heart is breakin

well be keeping bars in business
keeping bars in business

bridge
yeah aint that how life goes

chorus

keeping bars in business
outro
