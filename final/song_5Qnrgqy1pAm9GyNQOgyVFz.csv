the evil it spread like a fever ahead
it was night when you died my firefly
what could i have said to raise you from the dead
oh could i be the sky on the fourth of july
chorus 1
well you do enough talk
my little hawk why do you cry
tell me what did you learn from the tillamook burn
or the fourth of july
were all gonna die

verse 2
sitting at the bed with the halo at your head
was it all a disguise like junior high
where everything was fiction future and prediction
now where am i my fading supply

chorus 2
did you get enough love my little dove
why do you cry
and im sorry i left but it was for the best
though it never felt right
my little versailles
you might also likeverse 3
the hospital asked should the body be cast
before i say goodbye my star in the sky
such a funny thought to wrap you up in cloth
do you find it all right my dragonfly

chorus 3
shall we look at the moon my little loon
why do you cry
make the most of your life while it is rife
while it is light
well you do enough talk
my little hawk why do you cry
tell me what did you learn from the tillamook burn
or the fourth of july
were all gonna die

outro
were all gonna die
were all gonna die
were all gonna die
were all gonna die
were all gonna die
were all gonna die
were all gonna die98embed"
