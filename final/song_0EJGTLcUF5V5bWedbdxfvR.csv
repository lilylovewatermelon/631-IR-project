we can insist on havoc
bring it to us
pleasure our insides
you said leave me for dead
how can your love
program the head

verse 2 alice glass
we get so fed up with it
nuts and bolts for granted
run i can do it
as your bodies fall apart

verse 3 alice glass
robotic love
im programmed to rust
aids robot
is grinding iron bolts

verse 4 alice glass
robot hunks have one agenda
they wanna play with my placenta
are we now deserving
when our cyborg parts are burning
i know were just diseased appliances
where will you live
what will you die for
sex is killing me

baby i know
wrong time wrong place wrong fucking race
just because we dont feel flesh
doesnt mean we dont fear death19embed"
