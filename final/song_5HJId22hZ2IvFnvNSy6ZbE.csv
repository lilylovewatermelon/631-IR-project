she dont throw any tshirt on and walk to a bar
she dont text her friends and say i gotta get laid tonight
she dont say its okay i never loved him anyway
she dont scroll through her phone just looking for a bandaid

chorus both
its different for girls when their hearts get broke
they cant tape it back together with a whiskey and coke
they dont take someone home and act like its nothing
they cant just switch it off every time they feel something
a guy gets drunk with his friends and he might hook up
fast forward through the pain pushing back when the tears come on
but its different for girls

verse 2 elle king dierks bentley  elle king
she dont sleep all day and leave the house a wreck
she dont have the luxury to let herself go
she wont call just to curse
found a wall she can punch
when the going gets tough yeah the guys they can just act tough

chorus both
its different for girls when their hearts get broke
they cant tape it back together with a whiskey and coke
they dont take someone home and act like its nothing
they cant just switch it off every time they feel something
a guy gets drunk with his friends and he might hook up
fast forward through the pain pushing back when the tears come on
but its different for girls

when love disappears they cant pretend it was never there

outro both
a guy gets drunk with his friends and he might hook up
fast forward through the pain pushing back when the tears come on
