verse 1
life will come our way
it has only just begun
the world will die alone
the frail will fall below
time will take our place
we return it back to one
the calm before the cold
the long and lonely road

prechorus
look for the light that leads me home
chorus
tired of feeling lost
tired of letting go
tear the whole world down
tear the whole world down
failure

verse 2
drive the cloud away
we will fall from last to none
the dark before the dawn
the war will carry on

chorus
tired of feeling lost
tired of letting go
tear the whole world down
tear the whole world down
tired of wasted breath
tired of nothing left
tear the whole world down
tear the whole world down
failure
