far from the evergreen of old assam
far from the rainfall on the trails of old saigon
straight from the poster town of scorn and ritz
to bring you the wilder side of gold and glitz

chorus 1
run neon tiger theres a lot on your mind
they promised just to pet you but dont you let them get you
away away oh run
under heat of the southwest sun

verse 2
took to the spotlight like a diamond ring
came from the woodwork in the hopes they might
redeem themselves from poor decisions to win big

chorus 2
run neon tiger theres a lot on your mind
theyll strategize and maim you but dont you let them tame you
youre far too pure and bold
to suffer the strain of the hand and its hold

bridge
i dont want to be kept i dont want to be caged
i dont want to be damned oh hell
i dont want to be broke i dont want to be saved
i dont want to be sol
give me rolling hills and tonight can be the night
that i stand among the thousand thrills
mister cut me some slack cause i dont want to go back
i want a new day and age
come on girls and boys everyone make some noise
see the killers liveget tickets as low as 56you might also likechorus 3

theyll hunt you down and gut you ill never let em touch you
away away oh run
im begging you neon tiger run
under the heat of
under the heat of
under the heat of southwest sun

theres a lot on your mind1embed"
