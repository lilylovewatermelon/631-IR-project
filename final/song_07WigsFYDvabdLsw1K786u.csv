im on the line
im on the line
once i clean my mirror im a be feeling fine
trying to get there is all thats on my mind
when im on the line

verse 1
now even though i run my race
with a smile on my face
it aint easy
no it aint easy
feel like the life of the party
but its all in your mind
on the line

chorus
im on the line
im on the line
once i clean my mirror im a be feeling fine
even when youre falling just pretend youre flying
when youre on the line

verse 2
im with everybody but im still alone
just look down thats my line youre standing on
lets keep it friendly well be just fine
but dont cross that line
