yeah its what ive become that i fear the most
i never thought it could get so wrong
i believe theres a part of me that i cannot beat
a part of me that i cant defeat
this side of me that just doesnt belong

judgin by the weight of my fucked up world
i think maybe i should take a step back from this
i need to quit pushin just let it roll roll roll

push me push me
the things that you say
push me push me
the waves that you made
push me push me
so ill play god now
blow you blow you away
