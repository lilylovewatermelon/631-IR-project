looking for places to go
boys in the street are talking about leaving theyre leaving
looking for places to go

andy built his coffin down in carolina
told me he was running from something
but i think hes just out chasing girls
when mary moved all of her shit to chicago
her mother made sure that she left with her bible
but you wont find her face on sundays

chorus
all my friends are talking about leaving about leaving
but all my friends are sitting in their graves
all my friends are talking about leaving about leaving
but all my friends are sitting in their graves

is it any wonder why we all leave home
people say i knew you when you were six years old
and you say but ive changed ive changed ive changed ive changed

mom and dad if only you could see me now
been here for a year and now i own this town
cause ive changed ive changed ive changed ive changed

one day well all be ghosts
tripping around in someone elses home
one day well all be ghosts ghosts ghosts
ghosts ghosts ghosts

one day well all be found
no longer lost were just hanging around
one day well all be found found found
