old friend of mine
down by the sea side
skipping stones
we watch the changing tides
far from home
now we sleep in rolls
stories told
walkin down windy roads

verse 2
the water flow
down in the valley
where we arose
and hike the mountain side
cobblestones
all through the cities
on the road
weve come to know that
time is all we have

prechorus
so we go
and wont look back

chorus
we will run
with a heart that is oh so young
we have come
to a place we can go as one
we will run
see hollow coves liveget tickets as low as 47you might also likeverse 3
we found a place
among those five towns
along the coast
where colors came to life
on the road
so many faces
both young and old
weve come to klnow that
time is all we have

prechorus
so we go
and wont look back

bridge
we will run
with a heart that is oh so young
we have come
to a place we can go as one
and ohh
my life
was lost in time
but now
i see
my heart is free
chorus
we will run
with a heart that is oh so young
we have come
to a place we can go as one

we will run
with a heart that is oh so young
we have come
to a place we can go as one1embed"
