this is for my peoples who just lost somebody
your best friend your baby your man or your lady
put your hand way up high
we will never say bye no no no
mamas daddies sisters brothers friends and cousins
this is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers
lift your head to the sky cause we will never say bye

verse 1
as a child there were them times
i didnt get it but you kept me in line
i didnt know why you didnt show up sometimes
on sunday mornings and i missed you
but im glad we talked through
all them grown folk things separation brings
you never let me know it
you never let it show because you loved me and obviously
theres so much more left to say
if you were with me today facetoface

chorus
i never knew i could hurt like this
and every day life rolls on
i wish i could talk to you for a while
miss you but i try not to cry
as time goes by
and its true that youve reached a better place
still id give the world to see your face
and be right here next to you
but its like youre gone too soon
now the hardest thing to do is say bye bye

verse 2
and you never got a chance to see how good ive done
and you never got to see me back at number one
i wish that you were here to celebrate together
i wish that we could spend the holidays together
i remember when you used to tuck me in at night
with the teddy bear you gave to me that i held so tight
i thought you were so strong youd make it through whatever
its so hard to accept the fact youre gone forever

chorus
i never knew i could hurt like this
and every day life rolls on
i wish i could talk to you for a while
miss you but i try not to cry
as time goes by as time goes by
and its true that youve reached a better place
still id give the world to see your face
and be right here next to you
but its like youre gone too soon
now the hardest thing to do is say bye bye oh
