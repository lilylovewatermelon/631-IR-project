well well what do i say
looks like what goes around comes around
and everyone will have their final say
sometime someday
looks like i only love god when the sun shines my way
looks like im into divinity only when i can see its sweet sweet rays

chorus
i say what i mean but i dont mean what i say
well well its fine out today
i say what i mean but i dont mean what i say
well well its fine out

verse 2
well well what do i say
ive never seen a bad day look quite this way
and well well what do i do
when all of my thoughts run right back to you
looks like i meant to speak with logic
but hon the carnal always gets in the way
well well this fire was more funner than proper grammar anyway

chorus
i say what i mean but i dont mean what i say
well well its fine out today
i say what i mean but i dont mean what i say
well well its fine out

then you get to the part where your heart just wants to die
then you get to the part where your heart screams it just sighs
then you get to the part where your heart knows its a crime
so it flies like a bird its heard its heard its heard the word

chorus
i say what i mean but i dont mean what i say
well well its fine out today
i say what i mean but i dont mean what i say
well well its fine out
i say what i mean but i dont mean what i say
well well its fine out today
i say what i mean but i dont mean what i say
well well its fine out
i say what i mean but i dont mean what i say
well well its fine out today

outro
today today today today
