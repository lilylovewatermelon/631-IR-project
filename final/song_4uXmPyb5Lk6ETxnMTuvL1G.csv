verse 3 dj paul
now when it comes to gettin bread i got the keys to the bakery
a lot of dudes swear they playin man they some fakery
let me catch a girl up out some work and in my sight
and believe im gon be at ya in the daylight with a flashlight
im tryna get paid however money is made
a lot dudes like to pay ladies to get laid
but me i aint no pimp i just love to borrow
paper from a fat bitch a ugly bitch a model for real

verse 4 juicy j
well you know me by the juice man hangin out with big triece
standin on the porch drinkin liquor drunk smokin weed
tryna get a paycheck but work fur aint came yet
thats why i stay in a girl ear to keep that pussy wet
so i could get paid and relax in the shade
and say fuck a nine to five cuz a nigga tired of slavin
its never easy for a playa in tha hood on tha come up
if i meet a gal with three kids or more she get done up
