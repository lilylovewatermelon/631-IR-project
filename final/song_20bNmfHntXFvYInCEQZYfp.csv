latte foam art
tiny pumpkins
fuzzy comfy socks
coffee table made out of driftwood
a bobblehead of ruth bader ginsburg

some random quote from lord of the rings
incorrectly attributed to martin luther king

her favorite photo of her mom
the caption says
i cant believe it
its been a decade since youve been gone
mama i miss you
i miss sitting with you in the front yard
still figuring out how to keep living without you
its got a little better but its still hard
mama i got a job i love and my own apartment
mama i got a boyfriend and im crazy about him
your little girl didnt do too bad
mama i love you give a hug and kiss to dad

three little words a couple of doves
and a ring on her finger from the person that she loves
