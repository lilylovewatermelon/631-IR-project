every day i look around
seems that no oness satisfied
could it be that underneath
weve all got something to hide
from the moment we arrive
we want to fill the space inside
we all need to feel alive

chorus
if its love that keeps us breathin
give us something to believe in
is it fear that makes us blind
tell me why is love so hard to find
if we hear so much about it
and we cant go on without it
let the mystery unwind
tell me why is love so hard to find

verse 2
all i know is when you find it
even earth can feel like youre in heaven
tell me know unlock my secret
help us all to find the hidden treasure
from the moment we arrive
we want to fill the space inside
we all need to feel alive
