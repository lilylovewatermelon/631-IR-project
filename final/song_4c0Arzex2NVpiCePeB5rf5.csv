verse 1
im full of regret
for all things that i have done and said
and i dont know
if itll ever be okay to show
my face around here face around here
sometimes i wonder if i disappear

would you ever turn your head and look
see if im gone
cause i fear

there is nothing left to say to you
that you wanna hear that you wanna know i think i should go
the things ive done are way too shameful oh

a helpless victim of a spiders web
