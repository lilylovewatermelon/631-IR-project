piecing it all back together again
didnt get along been four years since
we had it all and you were my friend
those days got away hope you find solace in this
i was 15 when i first felt loneliness
cut my hair only listened to loveless

chorus
grown apart and were so far gone
but im waving the white flag
sending my love back move on

verse 2
laughing at me you kick me when im down
oh how can you pretend you didnt say that now
wish you the best i know that youre stressed out
but you know in small towns
what goes around comes back around mmmyou might also like5embed"
