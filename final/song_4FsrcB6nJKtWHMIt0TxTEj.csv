verse 2
hey they seem surprised with the look thats in their eyes
how i could be myself and do away with their disguise
i advise homies to stay homies
few people you can trust all the ogs told me
when i was just a shawty strummin my guitar
playin my piano had a band in my garage
sittin down with the homies playin playstation
tryna find a crib where their parents on vacation
hey why you grillin put a smile on your face bitch
we takin shots all around gettin wasted
came a long way from freestylin in my basement
show some love to the people that i came with cause
