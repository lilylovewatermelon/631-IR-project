dont call my name out your window as im leavin
cause i wont even turn my head
and dont send your kin folk to give me no dang talkin
cause ill be gone like i said

youd can say the same ole things
that youve been sayin all along
just lay there in your bed
and keep you mouth shut till im gone
no dont give me that old familiar cry n cuss n moan
understand your man
oh understand your man
huh

 instrumental 

oh party boys

you can give my other suit to the salvation army
and everything else i leave behind
i aint takin nothin thatll slow down my travelin
while i untangle my mind

no i aint gonna repeat what i said anymore
while im breathin air that aint been breathed before
yet ill be as gone as a wild goose in winter
then youll understand your man meditate on it
youll understand your man you hear me talkin now
understand your man i told you so
understand your man
huh
