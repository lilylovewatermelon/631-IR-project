oh my god is she dead—

heather duke spoken

truly a heather

how 
gangsta you are

yo 
girl 
feel a bit punchy
she’s 
not 
looking so well
still 
you’ve 
earned that red scrunchie
come
join 
heather in hell

veronica’s dad spoken

veronica spoken
you don’t know what my world looks like

heather chandler ram and kurt
time’s up go say your prayers
veronica’s running on running on fumes now
veronica’s totally fried
veronica’s gotta be tripping on ‘shrooms now
thinking that she can hide

notify next of kin
veronica’s trying to keep him out now
too late
he got in
