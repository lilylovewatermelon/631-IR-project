peace be still you are with me
in this hope i abide
jesus be my sustainer
strengthen me in this trial

chorus
and i know its only for a moment
and everything is working for your glory
but i need your perfect love to hold me
safe within your promise
til the storm has passed

verse 2
when this burden is lifted
ill give praise to your name
but until it is finished
ill give praise just the same

chorus
and i know its only for a moment
and everything is working for your glory
but i need your perfect love to hold me
safe within your promise
til the storm has passed

as an anchor for our soul

we will never be alone 6x
we will never be alone

chorus
and i know its only for a moment
and everything is working for your glory
but i need your perfect love to hold me
safe within your promise
til the storm has passed 2x
