oh aw baby its been so long
oh aw baby its been so long

verse 1
mogul and they know that logo on my floor mat
courtside chamberlain throwback match my rolex
everywhere i go flex valet park on some loc shit
whole lot of smoke in that rari that thang potent
burnin rubber wearin cameras they was undercovers
under pressure made statements turned on they brothers
never judge you but the streetsll never love you
i wonder what it come to in your brain for you to run to
ones that hate us handcuff us and mace us
call us dumb niggas cause our culture is contagious
thirdgeneration south central gangbangers
that lived long enough to see it changin
think its time we make arrangements
finally wiggle out they mazes
find me out in different places
im the spook by the door this the infiltration
double back dressed in blue laces

chorus
oh aw baby its been so long
oh aw baby its been so long

they killed dr sebi he was teachin health
i fuck with rick ross cause he teachin wealth
dropped out of school ima teach myself
made my first mil on my own i dont need your help
all black tom ford its a special evenin
city council meetin they got hussle speakin
billiondollar project bout to crack the cement
so what if our investments had become strategic
summer 018 man its such a season
bout to make my partners look like fuckin geniuses
we was in the regal it was me and steven
we done took a dream and turned it to a zenith
anything i wanted everything i needed
gotta pace yourself its all about your breathin
you can have it all its all about your reasons
i done took my name and carved it in the cement

chorus
oh aw baby its been so long
oh aw baby its been so long

verse 3
i flashback on that shootout at the beach twenty deep
you tried to squeeze your gun jammed and they released
blood on your tee how many stains i see three
the bitch started to panic so i made her switch seats
drivin now police chopper hear it flyin now
really not too spooked calmly asked me am i dyin now
all i know is keep you calm and collected
crackin jokes like nigga now you gon be finally respected
see your blood leakin got my foot on this gas
tossed the 40 we pulled up to daniel free and see crash
you know the alibi they started shootin we was standin by
aint see nothing but the flare from the talons fly
i wasnt there i was passin by
matter fact dont say shit im just gon drop you in the back and slide
thats your weed all the cash is mine
ill take em both to the spot plus your phone til you back online
chorus
oh aw baby its been so long
