this is for them twentysomethings
time really moves fast you were just sixteen
this is for them thirtysomethings
that didnt turn out exactly how your mom and dad wanted you to be
this is for them fortysomethings
well raise up your glass and laugh like a mother
this is for them fiftysomethings
hell youre halfway there baby take it to the head

prechorus
mom and dad tried to hide the world
said the worlds just too big for a little girl
eyes wide open cant you see
i had my first heels by the age of thirteen
mom and dad tried to hide the boys
i swear that just made em want me more
at fourteen they asked me what i wanna be
i said baby twentyone so i get me a drink

chorus
im not a teacher baby but i can teach you somethin
not a preacher but we can pray if you wanna

but im great at writin physical love letters
im a freak all day aaall night ooh

and im crazy all day aaall night
