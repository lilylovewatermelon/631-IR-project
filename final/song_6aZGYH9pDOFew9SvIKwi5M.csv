at a time in pop music where immediacy counts more than ever pusha t’s official debut album got pushed back so many times that it had started to become the rapworld shorthand for a project left to die on the shelf but instead of becoming a liability my name is my name’s repeated delays ended up becoming an advantage pusha’s bluntly unadorned flow has always been best suited to skeletal arrangements revisit the decadeold “grindin’” if you need a vivid reminder so my name dropping into the thick of a craze for minimalist rap worked out pretty well for him as one of the more ardent affiliates of kanye’s good music crew it’s not surprising that the album shares some of yeezus’ stark sonics but the beats are more comfortably luxurious with so much experience working with strippeddown sounds pusha has become a master of making a lot out of very little push never oversells his songs but listen through my name enough times and you start uncovering the wealth of subtle hooks it has hiding in plain sight —miles raymer

preview track numbers on the boards49 julia holter – loud city songread pitchforks original loud city song review here
try to make yourself a work of art like me sang julia holter the experimental la pop singer on her debut record the one based on an ancient greek play this years loud city song is the first holter record to be made outside of her bedroom but compared to that early sentiment it feels especially external the album is based on the 1958 parisian musical gigi but was also inspired by holters life in the city—it is set distinctly within the context of the urban pastoral conjuring the ambient noise of a bustling metropolitan area through swarming horns or images of patrons walking on the streets with a coolsung cabaret piece loud city song thus feels big alive and more ambitious than anything holter has done working with free jazz instrumentation of trombones strings and double bass to explore a new sense of theatricality one of her most miraculous talents is how she takes these high concepts and keeps them inviting and unpretentious while still requiring valuable patience and a certain steadiness of mind to appreciate the record as one full cohesive and uplifting piece —jenn pelly

preview track maxims i48 speedy ortiz – major arcanaread pitchforks original major arcana review here

if there’s a lesson to be learned from major arcana it’s that retroactivity doesn’t need to be of the museumdisplay variety the sophomore album by massachusetts’ speedy ortiz strains the strangled chords and corkscrew interplay of 90s guitar heroes like helium’s mary timony polvo’s ash bowie and chavez’s matt sweeney into jaggedly axed anthems but singerguitarist sadie dupuis’ syrupandsnakevenom inkwell overflows with hereandnow urgency as does the whole album’s springloaded tenseness “tiger tank” strikes a harrowing harmonic itch that dupuis’ vocal melody circles but refuses to scratch and “gary” lurches between darkness and dawn like a synesthesiastricken vampire “plough” on the other hand is a singsong cipher that pits pop hooks against pinprick riffage and a disorienting falsetto trill that taunts logic nirvana’s in utero celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2013 but major arcana is the real celebration—as well as the overdue prompt to mutate or die —jason heller

preview track no below47 the range – nonfictionread pitchforks original nonfiction review here

james hinton’s debut as the range nonfiction came out of nowhere what it did not do was come out of nowhere to floor you knock you backward or slap you in the face the effect was more like the polite dosey doe you dance when bumping into a stranger oh um heh sorry yep nonfiction will pass without incident if you let it but it managed to graze many of the years trends—a reexploration of grime of breakbeats and of drum  bass—while maintaining its personality and isolation sampladelic music is rarely so selfcontained the interjecting voices—mostly anonymous grime mcs—dont feel like conversations but footnotes references to outside texts nonfiction pilfers many of its samples from deepcrate youtube clips but the album avoids commenting on technology or media consumption hinton mined the service like you would a zine a pirate radio station or any other mercurial broadcast that feels like its beamed directly to you by internalizing its strangeness and mimicking its appeal —andrew gaerig

preview track metal swing46 mia – matangiread ptichforks original matangi review here

lets have a brief moment of stocktaking 2013 is a year in which jay z is recording advertisements for smartphones and kanye west is recording minimalist industrial rap as means of revenge against the fashion industry the two men duking it out for the title of soul king are both white and the de rigeur style of rapping is… singing beyoncé is on track to sell a record number of an album she didnt even promote who could blame maya arulpragasam for making an album that feels a bit strange matangi sounds like mias spiritual side picked a fight with her inner rebel her inner rebel slapped back and then they cracked up about it and hopped in bed to create a record full of humor amidst the grimy lurch and clatter of these beats—her best since kala—is a rare relaxed version of mia saying some truly leftfield whimsical stuff shes making fun of angelina jolies lara croft shes rattling off lines like theres 36 chambers in my wutent and my blood type is no negative shes singing her own loopy offkey version of a bedroom jam over a weeknd beat and calling it “sexodus” and for once everyone else is making her seem relatively normal —carrie battan

preview track come walk with me45 fuck buttons – slow focusread pitchforks original slow focus review here

fuck buttons’ debut 2008s street horrrsing featured distorted nearblackmetal vocals along with the expansive lowtech electronics letting the listener know there were humans in the room then came 2009s tarot sport a less ducttaped collection that found benjamin power and andrew hung disappearing a bit into the background exploring electronic music more head on without entirely tightening the seams four years later they offered up their selfproduced third album slow focus a finely polished collection that matches the shiny decadence of the jewels on its cover its also the moment fuck buttons removed their fingerprints entirely from the equation giving us alien otherworldly sounds to mull over with less noiserock mediation and its a revelation the music’s as muscular as ever its just more efficient—maximalist minimalism—and no matter how many times you listen to these seven tracks you discover previously unlit corners unlike the past compositions theres no levity or moments to catch your breath each songs pile of colorful synthesizers and deep dark percussion adds up to a goforbroke anthem and they obviously havent reached their limit the way the duos learned to layer and accrue detail you get the sense that these whirling pulsing pieces could snowball endlessly growing larger and more beautiful each second blowing off the roof only to diagram the sky its cool songs from tarot sport were played at the 2012 summer olympics opening ceremony too bad this wasnt ready for it —brandon stosuy

preview track brainfreeze edit44 justin timberlake – the 2020 experienceread pitchforks original the 2020 experience review here
just like jon hamms bubbleencased drew baird character on 30 rock we let justin timberlake get away with so much his 2013 started strong well get to that in a moment but his bit part in an excellent coen brothers movie was overshadowed by a leading role in one of the worst major studio films of the year trust me i saw it not to mention an album that managed to offend domestic abuse survivors and hbo viewers in one fell swoop his most fervent admirers trust me im one of them could only hide their eyes with embarrassment im not cut out for it timberlake bitterly complained about the avalanche of lateyear criticism to gq in a piece titled hashtag of the year a confirmation of his ubiquity in the face of all odds a resolute showman who spent the first phase of his nearly twodecade career facing constant scrutiny it can sometimes seem that timberlakes main goal isnt to be good—its to be liked

drink you away be damned though justin timberlake continues to be liked loved by many and the first volume of the 2020 experience provides plenty of reasons why sure just writing down some of the albums most notable conceits—the best nümetal deepcut weeper since limp bizkit covered the who a power ballad about looking at yourself in the mirror the only michael flatleymeetsmiami sound machine mashup you ever need to hear—might suggest that a few pairs of bad idea jeans were worn in the studio and yet along with timbaland and jroc who were more or less left for dead after that embarrassing electronic chris cornell album timberlake ended up with one of the years most enjoyable pop records a document of endless musical largesse that earns its 70minute runtime with lush sonics and a moonyeyed fixation on monogamy so hopelessly corny that it ends up coming across as totally endearing its disappointing that justin timberlake didnt put out two great albums in 2013 but as hindsight har har suggests that one of them ended up being very good is nothing short of a miracle —larry fitzmaurice

preview track mirrors43 the national – trouble will find meread pitchforks original trouble will find you review here

the national couldn’t have been more out of step with 2013’s popworshipping zeitgeist as the hippest of the hip in indierock circles tripped over themselves to pay homage to beyoncé and justin timberlake here was a band steadfastly committed to the thankless task of delivering excellent national albums it’s tempting to take trouble will find me for granted now that the national is a couple of records removed from its “beloved underdog” period on previous records like boxer and high violet the national staked its claim as the preeminent chroniclers of officebound and apartmentconfined urban droneism these guys are springsteen for people named dylan and skylar who worry about their 401k’s going bankrupt like frankie and mary fretted about the factory shutting down on trouble will find me the national faced the challenge of maintaining this creative momentum as it entered the band’s middle age and responded with a record imbued with similar uncertainties about what happens to life once it starts to slow down the fear of loss—whether it’s the loss of love security or a sense of  purpose—haunts this record sometimes literally like on “demons” which invite matt berninger to “stay down” but mostly figuratively like on the amazing “pink rabbits” where a drunk still pines for a woman who has long since forgotten him trouble will find me might not have bowled listeners over when it came out in may but for many of us it continued to linger as national records do revealing new truths and soothing old wounds an outofstep record perfectly suited for outofstep listeners —steven hyden42 rhye – womanread pitchforks original woman review here

anonymity made for a perfect introduction to the elegantly minimal soul confections of rhye the duo of singer mike milosh and producer robin hannibal it sharpened the peculiarly acute intimacy of absence which is the softly beating heart swaddled in the gentle instrumental folds of rhye’s debut woman hannibal’s tracks have a priceless offhanded grace whipping the warmest lightest froth from creamy pianos and synths saucy horns and slinky basses and effervescent drums popping off cushiony strings

the smooth porous strains let milosh’s multitracked voice a thin and chilly slip that moves as lightly as a hummingbird penetrate deeply milosh inhabits his highest range as freely as most of us chitchat and while he’s not a demonstrative singer he’s precise saccharine and sexy bold and timid it’s hipster rb for xx rather than r kelly fans a point of view distinct from jamie woon’s technoleaning existential angst or the weeknd’s dark strident drive

the heartbreakingly lovely “open” blossoms in a lush bouquet of vivaldilike strings glowing brass and scintillating harp before a sax licks out as the spongy bass line drops and milosh flows out of his wordless hum and starts to bounce he sounds so authentically beatific that i long misheard “mmm but stay” as “namaste” and it totally worked beyond a dazzling opening stretch including “the fall” and “last dance” deep cuts like “one of those summer days” extend the quiet storm into stately oceanic depths “don’t call me love unless you mean it” goes an indelible refrain tucked amid the feathery discofunk of “shed some blood” which perfectly sums up the coquettish blend of tenderness sensitivity and insolence that sets rhye apart —brian howe41 mutual benefit – loves crushing diamondjordan lee said that he felt powerless while he watched his loved ones hurting he doesn’t divulge many other details about what he went through but here’s what we know he quit his job in boston and moved in with a friend in st louis there he wrote songs about what he’d been going through which makes love’s crushing diamond lee’s therapy his lyrics are economical beautiful and sometimes crushingly sad they tell stories but the characters are faceless and the details are vague there are bursts of semispecifics like the line on “golden wake” about lee quitting his job “that light that’s blinding” paints the portrait of someone sweating out toxins feeling like dying and yes seeing a blinding light “i couldn’t stop it from washing over you” lee sings to his struggling loved one

he worked for months to envelop his words with warm gorgeous string arrangements and he dotted everything with field recordings wind chimes creaking floors the flicker of a lighter the sound of kids’ toys and the muted twinkle of an old piano lee moved around a lot while working on love’s crushing diamond collecting the small bits of sound that pop up throughout the album his nomadic inclinations also turn up in his lyrics “i’m on the slow train rollin’ through that city” he sings while traveling he looks inward singing “my mind is muddled our hearts are empty my body seems so temporary” it’s a fragile album with delicate sonic dressings on the first and last track lee sings that “the river only knows to carry on” the phrase seems to embody two related ideas trauma is inevitable but letting go and moving forward is paramount —evan minsker40 parquet courts – light up goldlight up gold is recordcollectorrock for recordcollectorrockcollectors 34 gonetooquick minutes of chinstroking bowlcashing ampruining socratesdyinginthefuckinggutter punk parquet courts are staunchly imageconscious about not having an image whatsoever and on gold they perhaps accidentally dial in on that miracle middleground between art school and the cbgb’s bathroom malkmus and new rose

what pushes the trio beyond their peers is a preternatural ability to locate the exact second when teenage kicks give way to a realization of their place in the world—the time when you critically analyze the deeper meaning of the junk in your pockets the first 542 of the record among the best 12 punches of the year outlines the alpha and omega of their response to their life station sarcasm and nostalgia “master of my craft” blasts “exlion tamer” through jonathan richman’s car stereo with cofrontman austin brown’s manifesto sounds made via cutup method from a publicist’s linkedin account then a single drumstick click smashcuts into “borrowed time” on which andrew savage perfectly encapsulates inspiration arising from squalor—thoughts dripping on his head from the ceiling

then there’s the dopey majesty of “stoned and starving” the “hallogallo” of slackjawed bakedom barreling into an unknown future where you’re still high as fuck it’s 2013’s “nothing ever happened” if everything actually did happen right behind you and you were too completely blazed to turn around at the bodega counter “i don’t know too much i just got the keys” brown sings on “yr no stoner” now to find the car —eric harvey

2 kanye west – yeezus1 vampire weekend – modern vampires of the cityya hey is like so much of modern vampires of the city something at once tender and impossibly grand—a breakup song about god oh sweet thing ezra koenig coos babylon dont love you then comes an even more backhanded kissoff but you love everything

you love everything the same could and has been said of vampire weekend with and without the italicized sneer back in 2007 when their selftitled cdr first started making its way beyond columbias campus youd have been hardpressed to read something about them that didnt balk at their cultural omnivorousness—an ivy league indiepop band that namechecks lil jon and peter gabriel in the same sustained breath half a decade later it is equally hard to imagine this same fact surprising anybody as modern vampires showcases a transformation has taken place within vampire weekend—theyve grown into a mature ambitious band whose music is now both airier and weightier than it used to be but a broader cultural shift has occurred too the lines that used to separate different kinds of music are starting to look more and more oldfashioned and the rigid identities by which people used to make musical taste a game of usvsthem are crumbling like old buildings we are moving in the direction of a place where everybody is allowed to love everything

and the albums more lighthearted moments—the crashpop of diane young or the halfrapped harpsichordkissed souls of mischief nod step—feel like an anarchic celebration of this but theres also an unshakable sense of gravitas anchoring these songs multiinstrumentalist rostam batmanglij who coproduced with the ubiquitous ariel rechtshaid is as eloquent with atmosphere as koenig is with words every track on here has its own weather the arrangements on careertodate peaks like obvious bicycle and hannah hunt are meticulous but wellventilated—chatter drifts in as if through an open window providing hazy backdrops for koenigs lyrical searching

im not excited but should i be is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me a disillusioned narrator sings in unbelievers glancing around at a shitty job market mounting student loans and a culture that likes to blame all its ailments on the helpless young on modern vampires vampire weekend reject the narrative that has been used to describe their generation in the clocksmashing slowmotion of hannah hunt somebody takes the paper of record—you imagine its turned to one of those trouble with millennials articles—and tears it into pieces

but this record also tears up the narrative that has up until now defined vampire weekend modern vampires is such an overwhelmingly humane album that it makes all those words that used to stick to them elitist pretentious preppy seem outmoded too maybe what this album is really breaking up with is dogma—anything that limits the scope of your perspective and what or who you can love it believes in nothing so much as this moment speaking in pitchshifted tongues and finding its own heaven in the cloud —lindsay zoladz1embed"
