round and round like a horse on a carousel we go
will i catch up to love i can never tell
i know chasin after you is like a fairy tale
but i feel like im glued on tight to this carousel

verse 1
come come one come all
you must be this tall
to ride this ride
at the carnival
oh come take my hand
and run through playland
so high too high
at the carnival

prechorus
and its all fun and games
til somebody falls in love
but you already bought a ticket
and theres no turning back now

chorus
round and round like a horse on a carousel we go
will i catch up to love i can never tell
i know chasin after you is like a fairy tale
but i feel like im glued on tight to this carousel

prechorus
and its all fun and games
til somebody falls in love
