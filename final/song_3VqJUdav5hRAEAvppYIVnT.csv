youre not in this alone let me break this awkward silence
let me go go on record be the first to say im sorry hear me out
well if you take me down or would you lay me out
and if the world needs something better
lets give them one more reason now now now

prechorus
we walk in single file we light our rails and punch our time
ride escalators colder than a cell cmon

chorus
this broken city sky like butane on my skin
stolen from my eyes hello angel tell me
where are you
tell me where we go from here
this broken city sky like butane on my skin
stolen from my eyes hello angel tell me
where are you
tell me where we go from here tell me we go from

verse 2
and in this moment we cant close the lids on burning eyes
our memories blanket us with friends we know like fallout vapors
steel corpses stretch out towards an ending sun
scorched and black it reaches in and tears your flesh apart
as ice cold hands rip into your heart
see my chemical romance liveget tickets as low as 445you might also likebridge
thats if youve still got one thats left
inside that cave you call a chest
and after seeing what we saw
can we still reclaim our innocence
and if the world needs something better
lets give them one more reason now

chorus
this broken city sky like butane on my skin
stolen from my eyes hello angel tell me
where are you
tell me where we go from here
this broken city sky like butane on my skin
stolen from my eyes hello angel tell me
where are you
tell me where we go from here tell me we go from here25embed"
