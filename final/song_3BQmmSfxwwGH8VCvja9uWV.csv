now i dont know and its hard to explain
but it seems like things are just kind of insane
because the world is crying but nobodys listening
so please leave a message on my cell phone
i see bullets getting better biblical weather
and that guy on tv is like a total asshole
who are you wearing tonight
celebrity fundraiser tight
black ties making wrongs right
hows your social bandaid

prechorus
i dont know much i dont know too much
but i know this shit is fucked up

chorus
i guess its all about the dream
the ends justify the means
im telling you shit is fucked up
you know its all about the dream
the ends justify the means

verse 2
now thank god for the media for saving the day
putting it all into perspective in a responsible way
with more celebrity news typical bullshit views
i think were losing this fight sponsored by bud light
and now were rocking the casbah and taking the flak
the genies out of the bottle and we cant put it back
all this stuff its overwhelming my brain
can you see the storm coming its coming this way
see the offspring liveget tickets as low as 56you might also likeprechorus
i dont know much i dont know too much
but i know this shit is fucked up

chorus
i guess its all about the dream
the ends justify the means
im telling you shit is fucked up
you know its all about the dream
the ends justify the means
justify the means

and vip infamy gratify instantly

prechorus
i dont know much i dont know too much

the ends justify the means
