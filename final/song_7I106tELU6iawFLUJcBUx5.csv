verse 1
before i could ever let you go
gonna beg until i drive you mad
say something you could understand
im a statue baby knock me out

prechorus
oh how these moments fade away
you say you never loved me
we say things we didnt mean to say
i take it back i take it all back now
i take it back i take it all back

chorus
paralyzed by the same old antics
back and forth like some walking spastic
how could a fistfight be romantic
thinking back now will you ever feel the same

verse 2
you mean more to me than youll ever know
youre my girl and i think its a shame
that we get along this way
