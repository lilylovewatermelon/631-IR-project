the only real place to be
the middle of all controversy
west yes of the mississippi
welcome to the midwest

verse 1 tech n9ne
pistol packin and money mackin
rappin about the city where killas keep it crackin
too dark and gritty back in the dizzy
jackin was happenin
gafflin many cacklin
now we packagin crack and the addicts will pop
kansas city missouri
feel the fury of the inner city
poverty stricken novelty spittin
follow me quick into the bottom
we gotta be thizzlin
no frickin apology given
you trippin we lick a shot
get ready to brawl hometown
breakin a jawbone clown
you aint a criminal killa
be ready to get up and fall on down
look at the darkside
fulla the gangbangin
hookers with choppers
and the coppers they keep them thangs rangin
you aint gotta be killa gangsta to know
that you can die tryna hide side thangs for the dough
but after the club get to skippin cause they trippin off in the mo
see tech n9ne liveget tickets as low as 200you might also likechorus krizz kaliko
it doesnt really matter where you go
where youve been
beautiful foreign lands youve been in
gun play reigns
sun rays shine
stay inside you should be fine
ill show you follow me
welcome to the midwest

verse 2 krizz kaliko
its a city where anybody can cause you bodily harm
when you walk in my city hardly armed
and hardly safe to show your face
apes will erase you and let the blades graze you for the paper
nowhere to hide on either side of the water
for gucci and prada
krizz and the millimeter will follow ya
holler and scream it wont get you a thing
so get you a thing load it up wit hollow ones
light em up like a halogen
look at the crime rate
no wonder why i hate
niggas keep it peepin
im seekin it when you leavin em
keep em at bay
and take em away if it aint in the day
hurry get ya people up outta the k
the mid west is more than just a little chaotic
and if we aint got it we plottin em to rob em for they checks
that be the nature of the beast to keep the peace
i keep my piece when you in the midwest
chorus krizz kaliko
it doesnt really matter where you go
where youve been
beautiful foreign lands youve been in
gun play reigns
sun rays shine
stay inside you should be fine
ill show you follow me
welcome to the midwest

bridge tech n9ne

if ya get it midwest we admit it we the scheiße

when you visit big stress hella when you recognize us
hands up if you wit it stand up
if ya get it midwest we admit it we the scheiße
stand tough we can get it manned up
when you visit welcome to the midwest

verse 3 tech n9ne  krizz kaliko
if you trippin we givin you a lobotomy
cannibal you hannibal cant amount to my psychology
and poppin me better be the way you thinkin of stoppin me
get on top of me quick before i make what i got on me click
money the mackin and murder is all that we know
whether sunny or black in the dirt ima gather my dough
if you hustlin maybe the place you can get it for low
get your package and get to packin gotta get it and go”
never walk in my city when alone better draw down
keep them babies out the way
catch a stray in the ktown
boss in my city
never crawl never fall down
me and millimeter spray in your way and you better lay down
gangstas mobstas everybody know
cause in a town ya wanna clown around at the show
pack a milli cause everybody silly
so get ready to hit the flo
chorus krizz kaliko
it doesnt really matter where you go
where youve been
beautiful foreign lands youve been in
gun play reigns
sun rays shine
stay inside you will be fine
where you go
where youve been
beautiful foreign lands youve been in
gun play reigns
sun rays shine
stay inside you will be fine
ill show you follow me
