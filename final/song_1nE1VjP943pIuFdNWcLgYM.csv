its been a long time coming since ive seen your face
ive been everywhere and back trying to replace
everything that i had til my feet went numb
prayin like a fool thats been on the run
hearts still beating but its not working
its like a milliondollar phone that you just cant ring
i reached out trying to love but i feel nothing
yeah my heart is numb

but with you i feel again
yeah with you i can feel again
yeah

im feeling better ever since you know me
i was a lonely soul but thats the old me

verse 2
a long time coming since ive seen your face
ive been everywhere and back trying to replace
everything that i broke til my feet went numb
praying like a fool who just shot off a gun
heart still beating but its not working
its like a hundred thousand voices that just cant sing
i reached out trying to love but i feel nothing
oh my heart is numb
