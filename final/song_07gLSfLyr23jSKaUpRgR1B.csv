verse 1 rihanna
its been a minute since i saw you boy
must admit its good to hear your voice
and i guess that i forgot just how you make me feel when youre around
see you havent lost your sense of style
and you still could melt me with your smile
cant deny that i still got these feelings deep inside

prechorus rihanna
its funny how things could change but still remain the same
isnt love just a crazy game
baby here i go again

chorus rihanna
i look into your eyes and then my heart remembers when
and i realize ive never gotten over you
every time i hear your name
its like the sun shined through the rain
and i realize its happening
baby here i go again
here i go again

still remember how you make me weak
how i fought to find the words to speak
i just cant escape the memories
i tried but i just cant break free
thought i closed the door on what we had
but these feelings just keep coming back
didnt think that you could make me lose control like that

prechorus rihanna
its funny how things could change but still remain the same
isnt love just a crazy game
baby here i go again

chorus rihanna
i look into your eyes and then my heart remembers when
and i realize ive never gotten over you
everytime i hear your name
its like the sun shined through the rain
and i realize its happening
baby here i go again
here i go again

verse 3 jstatus
sweet lovin is my ting
so you know mi got fi swing
thats why yuh request it again
without a doubt yuh want to spend
and to experience it again
because yuh love the way yuh felt back then
so make me light it up again
reignite the flames again
cause i really miss dem days when we used to chill
up on the hill watch the sun set in west negril
girl yuh bajan beauty it a gimme di chill
not to mention the way you are within
prechorus rihanna
its funny how things could change but still remain the same
isnt love just a crazy game
baby here i go again

chorus rihanna
i look into your eyes and then my heart remembers when
and i realize ive never gotten over you
everytime i hear your name
its like the sun shined through the rain
and i realize its happening
baby here i go again
here i go again
baby here i go again
