when i was a child
my nerves ran wild
when i watched my friends
rise to the tops of the trees
with the risk of fall
i never climbed at all
every day i told myself
“i’m not ready”

chorus
my daddy always said
“nothing worth doing comes easy”
time is not your friend
time is not your remedy
no amount of waiting will make you
make you brave
no amount of fear will keep you
no amount of fear will keep you safe

verse 2
the older i get
the more fears i collect
i gather them from
all the people i meet
their stories reveal
regrets their smiles can’t conceal
i carry them
i carry them with me
see the crane wives liveget tickets as low as 64you might also likechorus
my daddy always said
“nothing worth doing comes easy”
time is not your friend
time is not your remedy
no amount of waiting will make you
make you brave
no amount of fear will keep you
no amount of fear will keep you safe

bridge
what if the steps i take turn out to be mistakes
how can somebody like me learn to say
“come what may”
“come what may”
“come what may”
“come what may”
“come what may”
“come what may”

chorus
my daddy always said
“nothing worth doing comes easy”
time is not your friend
time is not your remedy
no amount of waiting will make you
make you brave
no amount of fear will keep you
no amount of fear will keep you safe
no amount of fear will keep you safe
your fears won’t keep you safe1embed"
