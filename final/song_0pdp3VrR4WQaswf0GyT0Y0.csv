im pinned down by the dark

verse 1
been fighting with my sheets and nearly crying in my sleep
yes im battling that welltold gripe the most frustrating type
you should have racing stripes the way you keep me in pursuit
sharpen the heel of your boot and you press it in my chest
and you make me wheeze then to my knees you do promote me

chorus
im pinned down by the dark
animal
makes my head pirouette
more than i would be willing to confess
dangerous

verse 2
the light it fidgets through the thoughtsll soon revert to you
about as bashful as a tribal dance the first and final chance
and course the audience of frighteners and fiends
divided up into two teams
when the acrobat fell off the beam she broke everyones heart

chorus
im pinned down by the dark
animal
makes my head pirouette
more than i would be willing to confess
dangerous
dangerous
the most unsuitable pet
its been long enough now so lets
make a mess lioness

im pinned down by the dark
im pinned down by the dark ohohoh
