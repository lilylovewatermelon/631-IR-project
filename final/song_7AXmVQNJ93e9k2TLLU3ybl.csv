big heart big smile
big voice on the radio dial
like a country music modern day apostle
yeah i leaned in like it was gospel

chorus
wwdoubled
thats the bottom line for me
my goto compass and my golden rule
when life rings my southern bell
i just gotta ask myself
hell what would dolly do

verse 2
in them heels in that dress
wouldn’t put up with no bs
shed kill you with some kindness take the high road
turn a little rain into a rainbow

chorus
wwdoubled
thats the bottom line for me
my goto compass and my golden rule
when life rings my southern bell
i just gotta ask myself
hell what would dolly do
see lainey wilson liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likebridge

chorus
wwdoubled
that’s the bottom line for me
my goto compass and my golden rule
when life rings my southern bell
