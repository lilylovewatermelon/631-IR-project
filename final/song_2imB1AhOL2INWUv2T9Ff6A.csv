i woke up thinking you were still here
my hands shaking with regret
ive held this dream for such a long long time

prechorus 1
and i wanna get up
to the rhythm of a wild to the rhythm of a wild heart
that beats that beats like a rolling drum

verse 2
i saw you standing on the corner
i saw you standing on your own
and i get the feeling that its its all a dream

prechorus 2
and i wanna get up
to the rhythm of a wild to the rhythm of a wild heart
that beats that beats like a drum

chorus 1
when i fall asleep i can see your face
what i lost in you i will not replace
and i could run away i could let them down
but i will remember your light
see bleachers liveget tickets as low as 52you might also likeverse 3
your light it follows me in darkness
im trying hard but i cant win
and ive played the victim for a long long time

prechorus 3
and i wanna grow up
from the rhythm of a young from the rhythm of a younger heart
it leads just like a river runs

verse 4
tonight i sit over the parkway
the summers gone and im alone
and i get the feeling that youre somewhere close

prechorus 4
and i wanna get up
to the rhythm of your wild to the rhythm of your wild heart
it beats been beating since youve gone

chorus 2
when i fall asleep i can see your face
what i lost in you i will not replace
and i could run away i could let them down
but i will remember your light
chorus 3
when i fall asleep i can see your face i dont walk alone
what i lost in you i will not replace no i dont walk alone
and i could run away i could let them down
and i know youre gone but still
i will remember your light

bridge
i will remember
i will remember
i will remember
i will remember

outro
and if you see me in the darkness
i hope you know im not alone
i carry you with every breath i take
and i wont let up i wont let up oh
until the wind is gone10embed"
