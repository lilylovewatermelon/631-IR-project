living with these shadows separating what ive done
and chasing the illusions of who i once was once was
too much time too many places
different lives and different faces
stripping down and bracing for a change

prechorus
a better life im searching for
a better life im searching for

chorus
someday ill begin to live my life
i pray im okay for now
at least im breathing im trying
im reaching through myself
for another way i can win
and live my life again someday

verse 2
looking for a sign as desperation sets within
boredom starts to blend into a night of sin
all this time all this weather
drink my wine im no better
everything around me stays the same

a better life im searching for

chorus
someday ill begin to live my life
i pray im okay for now
at least im breathing im trying
im reaching through myself
for another way i can win
and live my life again someday

bridge
searching for a life i need to know
im searching for a part of me to follow
too many people with their hands on me
none of which i really give a shit about anyway
shedding all my skin to start again
shedding all my skin to start again
shedding all my skin to start again and again
shedding all my skin to start again

chorus
someday ill begin to live my life
i pray im okay for now
at least im breathing im trying
im reaching through myself
for another way i can win
and live my life again someday
