i have this vision in my head
of your little black suitcase lying on the bed
you standing by the window staring into space
looking everywhere but at  the tears rolling down my face
filling up the room with silence so we wouldnt have to say goodbye

chorus
but every other memory
i have of you is good
and if i could only rewind time
i hope you know i would
oh if you wonder
if i ever stop and think of you and me
every other memory

verse 2
ive got this city at my door
and the bright lights are brighter than before
tonight i cant help wondering whats it all about
every now and then i think i see your face out in a crowd
even with the way we ended id love to hear your voice
give me a shout sometime

chorus
cause every other memory
i have of you is good
and if i could only rewind time
i hope you know i would
oh if you wonder
if i ever stop and think of you and me
every other memory

i have this vision in my head
your suitcase lying on the bed
heartbroke smile upon your face
one last long embrace
i feel your tears wet on my cheek
as if it happened just  last week
i know a lot has changed
but nothings changed no nothings changed

chorus
cause every other memory
i have of you is good
and if i could only rewind time
i hope you know i would
oh if you wonder
if i ever stop and think of you and me
every other memory
every other memory
every other memory
every other memoryembed"
