i bet you thought your life would change
but youre sat on a train again
your memories are sceneries for things you said
but never really meant
you build it to a high to say goodbye
because youre not the same as them
but your death it wont happen to you
it happens to your family and your friends
i pretend

chorus
and i always wanna die sometimes
i always wanna die sometimes

verse 2
you win you lose you sing the blues
theres no point in buying concrete shoes
ill refuse

chorus
and i always wanna die sometimes
i always wanna die sometimes
i always wanna die

bridge
am i me through geography
a face collapsed through entropy
i can hardly speak
and when i try its nothing but a squeak
on the video
living room for small
if you cant survive just try
see the 1975 liveget tickets as low as 9you might also likechorus
and i always wanna die sometimes
i always wanna die
always wanna die
always wanna die
always wanna die
and i always wanna die
always wanna die
always wanna die sometimes
sometimes
sometimes
sometimes
i sometimes always wanna die
always wanna die
always wanna die
always wanna die sometimes66embed"
