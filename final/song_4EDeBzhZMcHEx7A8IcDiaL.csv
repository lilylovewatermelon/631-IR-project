i aint the kind you take home to mama
i aint the kind to wear no ring
somehow i always get stronger
when im on my second drink
even though i hate to admit it
sometimes i smoke cigarettes
the christian folks say i should quit it
and i just smile and say god bless

chorus
cause i heard jesus he drank wine
and i bet wed get along just fine
he could calm a storm and heal the blind
and i bet hed understand a heart like mine

verse 2
daddy cried when he saw my tattoo
but said he loved me anyway
my brother got the brains of the family
so i thought id learn to sing

chorus
cause i heard jesus he drank wine
and i bet wed get along just fine
he could calm a storm and heal the blind
and i bet hed understand a heart like mine

ill fly away from it all one day
and ill fly away
these are the days that i will remember
when my names called on a roll
hell meet me with two longstemmed glasses
and make a toast to me coming home

chorus
cause i heard jesus he drank wine
and i bet wed get along just fine
he could calm a storm and heal the blind
and i bet hed understand
understand a heart like mine
ooh yes he would1embed"
