slip back out of whack at your best
its a nightmare
so im joining the army
no house phones but can i still call
will you wait for me now
weve got the right to live fight to use it
got everything but you can just choose it
i wont just be a puppet on a string

prechorus
dont go that way
ill wait for you

chorus 1
and im tired of all your friends
listening at your door
i want whats better for you
so long my friend and adversary
but ill wait for you

verse 2
get dressed jump out of bed into a vest
are you okay
ive been all around this town
everybodys been singing the same song for ten years
see the strokes liveget tickets as low as 122you might also likeprechorus
ill wait for you
will you wait for me too

chorus 2
and they sacrifice their lives
and they lied about those odds
theyll say it a million times and theyll say it again
so long my adversary and friend

prechorus
dont go that way
ill wait for you

chorus 3
im tired of all your friends
banging down your door
get up in the morning yelling no more
so long my friend and adversary
but ill be waiting for you47embed"
