wonderin why i do so much i love her
tryna make sure my whole family stay above water
if you fall i fall im not the type of guy that say i did my part
lookin back on everything i did im like im blessed beyond
i gotta get rich for my kids im on my second son
i done did the bid when ninety percent of niggas aint comin home
until all my hitters get out the system they goin in every song
i done ran up digits real million off a camera phone
now i run the charts im goin hard damn near on every song
try my best to help my people out they try to do me wrong
i dont hold grudges i get money
i wont budge and i wont comment
seen the way you played it that shit raw it made my stomach burn
grandma told me long as i keep livin then one day ill learn
i got in that mode couldnt wait no longer i had to take a turn
my grandad call me preacher man my verses hit people like sermons
i was in the streets but every week i went to sunday service
pay my tithes and pray god watch my back and then im back to servin
ima need for you to be near as possible if nobodys perfect
and ima do whatever i can do to help you if you worth it
but freaks dont get flooded and hoes dont get purses
you get whatever if i get your mercy
ill give you drip long as you dont get thirsty
ill give you cars one account we can merge em
give you a line just to call when its urgent
shit wet go so deep it feel like we surfin
find your location i dont need your service
i stay on my job i got this far from workin
too fresh to search me and she up ten birkins

shit could be worse
dont do all that dawg i had that shit first
atlanta my playground and the whole world is my turf
feelin like i was cursed
came home and i ran it up now they dont know what im worth
i been gettin so high
i cant even lie like i dont know why
if we catch em we gon flip em this a no fly zone
had to play the cross cause i had chrome hearts on yeah yeah

verse 2
scared to give it all to em so i guess that im teasin
i dont sweat im goin hard for it no one said it was easy
on a private jet in wyoming i was chillin with yeezy
in a stolen car in ninth grade we had lost lil breezy
i aint got no credit still long as im gettin money i probably never will
aint no sense in puttin myself in debt when i keep gettin these checks
i had to realize that im the catch i cant be havin sex with anyone
sometimes i get sidetracked and its easy when so many come
they never have nothin to give but always screamin give me some
im tryna be rich for real do whatever to get it up
i done lost it all before i had to make em give it up
glad i got to switch it up my business up
i just hit my shorty on a text like want a bentley truck
and it wasnt even no occasion tellin lies about me on the internet that shit be crazy
you forget that you didnt get the range cause you was actin lazy
but you aint tell em that
all the blogs be actin shady i aint feelin that
never not gon take care of my kids and never be a rat
you know whats the motto you dont like it you can bring it back
we was in the trenches gettin a lot of racks no cap
chorus
shit could be worse
dont do all that dawg i had that shit first
atlanta my playground and the whole world is my turf
feelin like i was cursed
came home and i ran it up now they dont know what im worth
i been gettin so high
i cant even lie like i dont know why
if we catch em we gon flip em this a no fly zone
had to play the cross cause i had chrome hearts on

outro
shit could be worse
dont do all that dawg i had that shit first
atlanta my playground and the whole world is my turf
feelin like i was cursed
came home and i ran it up now they dont know what im worth
i been gettin so high
i cant even lie like i dont know why
if we catch em we gon flip em this a no fly zone
had to play the cross cause i had chrome hearts on yeah yeahembed"
