one two one

verse 1
i’m misaligned misanthropy to pass the time
this crooked jaw i’m always feeling awful
i’m so ashamed
yes that’s it i’m so ashamed
and so is she

verse 2
i’m so awake the reverberating seam of daybreak
the hem where night falls again is splitting into livid mistakes
i’ve been tryin to say
but these awful letters rearrange
my name my namesake

outro
look around
these redundancies resound
take this town
how the architecture meanders
oh my my
i can’t get it off my mind
your fingers curled
a contorted row of antlers
are you reaching out to me oh godyou might also likeembed"
