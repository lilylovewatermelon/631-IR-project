cant nobody do it like she do
anything just to please you
and she doesnt mean to it comes naturally
i cant lie she sees through me
the way that she moves me
her beauty is not everything

i just melt with her touch when i get close to her
i just cant get enough when im alone with her
and i can feel myself burning
cause that girl is fire fire fire

that girl is fire fire fire
thats why i desire sire her
