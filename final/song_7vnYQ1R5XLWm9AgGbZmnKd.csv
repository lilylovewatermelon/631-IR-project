when i was fifteen i had running back dreams
but never did run too far
thought i was gonna be number three one day
til i wrecked my old man’s car
i almost finished college but i aint cut from that cloth
used to wish i was but im glad im not

chorus
im just an old carolina good ole boy
boys i ain’t got no choice
i pick a little guitar in the evenin
wear mossy oak outta deer season
i couldn’t be anybody but me even if i tried
i used to wish i was but im glad i’m not

verse 2
used to have a tennessee bill dance hat
but barely ever got em in the boat
i used to wanna hit em like chipper did
but i swung it just a little too slow
yeah these days i dont wanna be anybody but me
i used to wish i was but im glad i’m not

chorus
im just an old carolina good ole boy
boys i aint got no choice
i pick a little guitar in the evenin
wear mossy oak outta deer season
i couldnt be anybody but me even if i tried
i used to wish i was but i’m glad i’m not
