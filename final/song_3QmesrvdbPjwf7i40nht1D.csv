hello ive waited here for you

verse 2
come down and waste away with me
down with me
slow how you wanted it to be
im over my head out of her head she sang

prechorus
and i wonder
when i sing along with you

chorus
if everything could ever feel this real forever
if anything could ever be this good again
the only thing ill ever ask of you
you got to promise not to stop when i say when
she sang

verse 3
