hey big brother its me leia
remember at the old house i said you was gonna be a big star one day
i’m so proud of you
mmh mmh mmh polo g
live in the flesh

chorus
know my grandma still with me when it get cold i feel your spirit
talkin to my lil sister phone calls through securus
walk in court in them shackles see my mama her eyes tearin’
tryna work towards these blessings but the devil keep interfering
everybody go through something its all about persevering
they was counting me out i put passion in every lyric
fuck a sack up at neimans spend some racks on my appearance
yeah i know that they hate im the man aint tryna hear it

verse 1
phone on dnd im out in cali whippin through the mountains
just cruisin feelin my song windows down speakers pounding yeah
my engine roaring and that gucci tiger growling
expensive taste my clothes foreign i be dripping like a fountain
need new shoes i started hustling ’cause i didn’t get no allowance
speeding down the wrong path found my lane then i rerouted
hottest in my city i had every record label scouting
i got rich and left the hood still dont leave the crib without it
swear it ain’t no better feeling than thumbing through these thousands
so much money cant keep track i think i might need an accountant
i been runnin up that check them blue hundreds just keep piling
came a long way from depression all these riches keep me smiling

they was counting me out i put passion in every lyric

verse 2
couldnt leave my brother in them trenches told him come and stay with me
we gon live like kings for all them nights aint have no place to sleep
niggas watched us starving and never offered us a plate to eat
took off now they mad but i know that they wont wait for me
last year i took a trip to every place that i couldnt wait to see
granny im locked up again sat in that station faithfully
now im the golden child i used to think my mama hated me
aint budging bout no problems what a nigga gon come take from me
i heard you a robber on that concrete you gon lay deceased
this 40 waving like a blowdryer gon hit his face with heat
with this shit for life forever gang until im 83
real niggas dyin it seem like heaven is the place to be

chorus
know my grandma still with me when it get cold i feel your spirit
talkin to my lil sister phone calls through securus
walk in court in them shackles see my mama her eyes tearin
tryna work towards these blessings but the devil keep interfering
everybody go through something its all about persevering
they was counting me out i put passion in every lyric
fuck a sack up at neimans spend some racks on my appearance
