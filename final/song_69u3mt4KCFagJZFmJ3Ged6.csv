midnight stoplight happens every time
pretty girl in a car
no resemblance whatsoever
i wonder how you are
constant question pounding in my brain
is anybody loving you these days
lonesome pillow sun comes yellow
i reach across the bed
should be hurried working worries
i lie there instead
with the thought thats driving me insane
is anybody loving you these days
damn this small town every place that i go
i drive by your house i see his car and i know
hes there with you but when he kisses you
think about the memories we made and tell me
is anybody loving you these days
second chances backward glances
most people just say no
world keeps turning heart keeps yearning
i keep holding the hope
one day you might answer with my name
is anybody loving you these dayssee dierks bentley liveget tickets as low as 25you might also likeembed"
