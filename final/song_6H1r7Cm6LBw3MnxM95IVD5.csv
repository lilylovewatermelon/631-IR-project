when you decided to knock on my door
did you remember what happened before
it just didnt sparkle it just didnt grow
some things look better inside of the store
did you agree we should let it be and did you agree its a must

chorus
lets call the whole thing off we just have had enough of us
lets call the whole thing off we just have had enough of us

verse 2
i know many people who met the same way
relations that lasted for more than one day
but i dont wanna know why we couldnt do more
somethings are better to leave unexplored
did you agree we should let it be and did you agree its a must

chorus
lets call the whole thing off we just have had enough of us
lets call the whole thing off we just have had enough of us
lets call the whole thing off we just have had enough of us
lets call the whole thing off we just have had enough of usyou might also like1embed"
