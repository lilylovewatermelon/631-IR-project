well hail caesar shadow in my backseat
and her friends are standing right in front of me
world wide from the cimarron to turkey
open up said everybody loves me

prechorus
and you dont have to make a sound
cause they got what you need
what you need
oh oh oh oh

verse 2
got love for the people that have warned you
god love all your sentimental virtue
eight balls with the takers thatll make you
late calls with the lovers thatll hate you

prechorus
and you dont have to make a sound
they got what you need
what you need
make you say

chorus

swaying to my own sound
flashes in my face now
