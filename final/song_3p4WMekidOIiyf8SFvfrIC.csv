heres to the ones that we got
cheers to the wish you were here but youre not
cause the drinks bring back all the memories
of everything weve been through
toast to the ones here today
toast to the ones that we lost on the way
cause the drinks bring back all the memories
and the memories bring back memories bring back you

verse 1 yg
tequila drinkin double shot yeah i need you
i know this life it look nicе but it get deeper
i run from reapеrs dodge bullets from glock ninas
i live my life tryna prove myself to nonbelievers gotta stop that
the devil talkin i block that
got some homies in heaven now they watch my back
for all this pain we numb it with champagne
hunnid bottles in the club thats a goddamn shame

i done lost love lost fifties lost dubs
lost fights nigga lost life of loved ones
