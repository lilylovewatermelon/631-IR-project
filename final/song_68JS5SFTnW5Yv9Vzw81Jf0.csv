they say love is more precious than gold
cant be bought and it cant be sold
i got love enough to spare
that makes me a millionaire

verse 1
i got a woman with eyes that shine
down deep as a diamond mine
shes my treasure so very rare
she made me a millionaire

verse 2
when we ride around ride around this old town
in my beatup car with the windows down
people look at her and they look at me
and say that boy is sure livin in luxury
sweet luxury

chorus 2
cause love is more precious than gold
it cant be bought no never could be sold
i got love enough to share
that makes me a millionaire

interlude

when the kisses fall from everywhere
like riches on a millionaire
when my pockets are empty and the cupboard is bare
i still feel like a millionaire

chorus 2
cause love is more precious than gold
it cant be bought no and it cant be sold
i got love enough to spare
that makes me a millionaire1embed"
