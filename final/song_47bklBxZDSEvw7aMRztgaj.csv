every mountain that i climb every river that i cross i think of you
when im on top of the world or on some lonely road i think of you
doesnt matter where i go or what i do

chorus
i think of you
every single time youre always on my mind i think of you
i think of you and it all comes rushin back
all the good times that weve had i think of you
i know youre better off where youre at
and theres nothin i can do to change all that

verse 2
when i wake up in the morning and before i fall asleep i think of you
when i hear that song oh i cant help but smile and think of you
wonder if it makes you think about me too

chorus
i think of you
every single time youre always on my mind i think of you
i think of you and it all comes rushin back
all the good times that weve had i think of you
i know youre better off where youre at
and theres nothin i can do to change all that
but still i think of you
see easton corbin liveget tickets as low as 68you might also likeoutro
and all the what ifs and might have beens
what i wouldnt give if i could do it all again
