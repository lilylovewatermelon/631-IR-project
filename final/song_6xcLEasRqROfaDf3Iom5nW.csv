a heart on the run keeps a hand on a gun
cant trust anyone
i was so sure what i needed was more
tried to shoot out the sun
the days when we raged we flew off the page
such damage was done
but i made it through cause somebody knew
i was meant for someone

chorus
so girl leave your boots by the bed we aint leavin this room
til someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom
its cold in this house and i aint goin out to chop wood
so cover me up and know youre enough to use me for good

verse 2
i put your faith to the test when i tore off your dress
in richmond on high
i sobered up i swore off that stuff
forever this time
and the old lovers sing “i thought itd be me
who helped him get home”
but home was a dream one that id never seen
til you came along

so girl hang your dress out to dry we aint leavin this room
til percy priest breaks open wide and the river runs through
and carries this house on its stones like a piece of driftwood
so cover me up and know youre enough to use me for good

chorus
so girl leave your boots by the bed we aint leavin this room
til someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom
its cold in this house and i aint goin out to chop wood
so cover me up and know youre enough to use me for good
