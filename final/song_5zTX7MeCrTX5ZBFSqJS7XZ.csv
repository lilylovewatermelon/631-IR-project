the air begins to feel a little thin
as i start the car and then i begin
to add the miles piled up behind me
i barely feel a smile deep inside me

verse 2
and i begin to envy the headlights driving south
i wanna crack the door so i can just fall out
but then i remember when you packed my car
you reached in the back and buckled up your heart
for me to drive away with
i began to understand why god died

verse 3
the demon sat there waiting on her porch
it was a little dark so he held a makeshift torch
and when my car was far out of sight
he crept in her room and stayed there for the night

bridge
and then i felt chills in my bones
the breath i saw was not my own
i knew my skin that wrapped my frame
wasnt made to play this game
and then i saw him torch in hand
he laid it out what he had planned
and then i said ill take the grave
please just send them all my way
then i felt chills in my bones
the breath i saw was not my own
i knew my skin that wrapped my frame
wasnt made to play this game
and then i saw him torch in hand
he laid it out what he had planned
and then i said ill take the grave
please just send them all my way

verse 4
the air begins to feel a little thin
as were waiting for the morning to begin
but for now you told me to hold this jar
and when i looked inside i saw it held your heart

for me to walk away with
i began to understand why god died69embed"
