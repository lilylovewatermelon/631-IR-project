along the way to close my eyes
i lost where i was going
the more it will spin the more that i try
to stop my mind flowing away away
to all that i despise
i despise
along the way to close my eyes
to close my eyes

verse 1 nick hexum
you can’t be let down if you don’t expect the world
expect to lay awake there by your sleeping girl
if somebody cares then there is no way you can tell
cursed consciousness it’s your private hell

chorus nick hexum sa martinez both
along the way to close my eyes
i lost where i was going
the more it will spin the more that i try
to stop my mind flowing away away
to all that i despise
i despise
along the way to close my eyes
to close my eyes

tick tick tick the clock bludgeons your mind
endlessly replaying times that were unkind
go away sun i’m not prepared for you today
it seems you are it seems you are

chorus nick hexum sa martinez both
huh
along the way to close my eyes
i lost where i was going
the more it will spin the more that i try
to stop my mind flowing away away
to all that i despise
i despise
along the way to close my eyes
to close my eyes3embed"
