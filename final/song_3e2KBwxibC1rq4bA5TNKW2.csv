verse 1
she lays down on the fresh lawn
she can make everything magical
but she tied one on big time
and it makes me wanna rewind

to back in the days when we were young
when everything was like a loaded gun
ready to go off at any minute
and you know were gonna win again
yeah you know were gonna win again
yeah you know were gonna win again

when everything was like a loaded gun
ready to go off at any minute
yeah you know were gonna win again
