i was lookin lost it was cold outside
the whiskey rocks how you caught my eye
my red lips painted dressed up in black
i needed something to bring me back
you knew the play and we danced all night
but something wasnt right

chorus
so ill see you next tuesday
if i ever get desperate or im so beyond faded
just a see you next tuesday
kinda nice out this morning i wont sit around waiting
and im not just being cold
im just watchin you pretend
like your heart is on your sleeve
when i know you have a girlfriend
oh ill see you next tuesday ohoh ohoh oh

the lies you spin for your power trip
and i just cant take you seriously
when all you send is a text to me
