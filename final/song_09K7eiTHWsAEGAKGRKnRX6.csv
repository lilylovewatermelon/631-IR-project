verse 1
im without eyelashes
i noticed so are you
we used them on wishes
and none of them came true
terrible i know
but fair is fair is fair
im blinking up a storm
but nothings ever ever there

instrumental chorus

break

verse 2
im without a soulmate
i noticed so are you
what is that anyway
copycat i hate you
mirror mirror on
thee emotional wall
im dancing like a fool
but no one seems to care at all

break

verse 3
im without anymore
things to be without
since everything i long for
followed in my foot prints
now i guess would be
the perfect time to die
so takе care of my pets and plants
and now ill say good

part ii bystanding

verse 1
by standers by
standing by cycling by
triumphant trifеcta
try not to cry

quadruple oddpupilled
god of the week
quintessential grin
pencilled in cheek to cheekembed"
