well the tongue inside my mouth is not for sale
any spirit left in me is fading fast
could you throw another stone to ease my pain
could you throw another stone to seal my fate
cause i dont believe in this world anymore anymore
i dont believe in me

chorus
and if i can rise above this ill be saved
can anybody save me
and if i can die for love then im enslaved
can anybody save me

verse 2
second chances are too few and far between
will to change this circumstance eludes me still
should i grow another shell in which to live
should i grow another shell and not forgive
i dont believe in this world anymore anymore
i dont believe in me

chorus
and if i can rise above this ill be saved
can anybody save me
and if i can die for love then im enslaved
can anybody save me

goodbye cruel world
goodbye cruel world
goodbye cruel world
at last you see me drown

chorus
and if i can rise above this ill be saved
can anybody save me
and if i can die for love then im enslaved
can anybody save me
and if i can rise above this ill be saved
can anybody save me
and if i can die for love then im enslaved
can anybody save me

outro
goodbye cruel world
goodbye cruel worldembed"
