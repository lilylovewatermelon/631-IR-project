where have you been
where have you gone
and have i done something wrong
youre the tooth fairy
youre like santa claus
youre like white noise
when i want my favorite song

verse 1
just come on back
and come on home
it aint super smart to leave me alone
light a flare pick up the phone
im like a stoner babe without my bong

chorus
are you hiding in the closet
are you underneath the bed
did you go for a long walk off a short pier
how come youre not here
should i worry youve been bitten
or somebody got you high
quick come back
or i might just die
how come youre not here

ive heard some rumors
about another girl
i heard shes cute
but she stores nuts like a squirrel
and thats all cool
ill wait right here
til you get bored
and she gets carded for beer

verse 3
im the one
im just that slick
you wont find better
im honey dipped
there aint a thing
thats fake on me
i miss you baby
come home to me

chorus
are you hiding in the closet
are you underneath the bed
did you go for a long walk off a short pier
how come youre not here
should i worry youve been bitten
or somebody got you high
quick come back
or i might just die
how come youre not here
bridge
has anyone seen
has anyone seen
has anyone seen why hes hiding from me
can anyone see
can anyone see
can anyone see lets play hide and seek

chorus
are you hiding in the closet
are you underneath the bed
did you go for a long walk off a short pier
how come youre not here
should i worry youve been bitten
or somebody got you high
quick come back
or i might just die
quick come back
or i might just dieembed"
