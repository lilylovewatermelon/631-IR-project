close your eyes
now relax your mind
now i want you to picture yourself far far away
put all your thoughts aside girl were about to take a ride
and i dont want you to have a care in the world right now
let it go let it go let it go
its just you and me in this moment
quietlisten

verse 1
baby take your mind into a zone
imagine that were all alone
two ways off and our friends are gone
now picture you and me getting it on
take my hand and come with me
lets indulge in fantasies
cast your cares and worries
and slowly fall into this ecstasy
im gonna rub your body so baby just relax
youve been pouring out your loving
and now its time to pour it back
imagine that

we dont have to talk
lay your body here and watch my fingers walk
take a second and imagine the opportunity

youve been pouring out your loving
and now its time to pour it back
