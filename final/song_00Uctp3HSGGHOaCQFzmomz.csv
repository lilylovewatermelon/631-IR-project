chorus
this gangsta livin weavin dope dealin oh how its changed
its gettin strange and dangerous but thats the way shit goes

verse 1
this nigga needs no introductions
im on this book and im stuck im really the wrong one to fuck wit
see tdouble known for startin problems but
kcutter be the problem solver if i
sell you a book nigga stick it
cause for every you check you slippin they can call me flipper
i only i missed a few niggas uhhuh
but he lost a couple more visa kidney and his liver
had to tell him mind me a nigga
i was like uhhuh click click cmere dont run nigga
all i wanna know is
where yo connect where the sack where the money where the blow is
i heard papi got them freighters
now either he gon give em to me or a nigga gon take em
the dope games just too overrated
and to tell yall the truth a lot of yall aint gon make it
done went from crack slingers to rb singers
before the mics on you was already singin
its just a song was a big hit
he named me and his bitch on the remix sing
see trick daddy liveget tickets as low as 50you might also likechorus  2x

trick daddy
and to hell with bein a man about it
shit they got fo niggas and one gun fuck bein 21
somebody better tell em
and put him up on  somebody fuck around and kill him
you see cause snitches get stitches
and there aint that much of a difference between tellin and snitchin
and i aint gon keep on talkin to you niggas
im gon walk right up to you niggas and go off on you niggas
and i aint leavin no witnesses
and dont get drunk and confess to none of yall misses
see i know how to control my hennessy
i speak no ingles play crazy like them dominicans
see cause poppa was a rolling stone
he said son get your gun its a war and its on
so yall go on and bob your head to the song
throw up the 4s for the niggas thats dead and gone

chorus  2x

trick daddy
im tired of smokin bamaass weed
niggas out there sellin backyard boogies full o stems and seeds
they whoopin the rocks and we compressin the coke
they makin it hard for them  to smoke
i went to jail tryin to get high nigga told me
to go to hell went and called him told him come get me out
so our father who art in heaven
it must be the devil cause somethin wrong with these niggas
nope  and crazy aint the word
they say the stupid shit like trick why dont you front a nigga a bird
fo what so you can smoke it up
impress hoes buy clothes and make a nigga come fuck you up
the game hard on a player
you coulda started with a block and now workin just for quarter fare
with all the cards i sold the hoes left me all by myself
and the game dont even care
