i know youre homesick
i know youre missing that place
this citys breaking you down
i can see it all over your face
dont get me wrong girl
i love the simple in you
you gotta go where ya gotta go
you gotta do what you gotta do
but when you do

chorus
i hope you hate your hometown
every brick every acre
hope they shut all the bars down
rename all the streets
i hope it looks like a ghost town
and you feel like a stranger
then you turn your car around
get pissed off and leave
i hope you hate your hometown
then come back to me

verse 2
oh i hope that welcome sign says
get the hell outta here
hope all your friends moved off
and memory lane disappeared
i dont mean to sound mean
i mean well at the end of the day
just know i love you when i say
you might also likechorus
i hope you hate your hometown
every brick every acre
hope they shut all the bars down
rename all the streets
i hope it looks like a ghost town
and you feel like a stranger
then you turn your car around
get pissed off and leave
i hope you hate your hometown
then come back to me

bridge
tell me you miss me
say nothings the same
and home is here with me
i aint tryna be that guy
but if you ever went back i think it would kill me
it would kill me

chorus
i hope you hate your hometown
every brick every acre
hope they shut all the bars down
rename all the streets
i hope it looks like a ghost town
and you feel like a stranger
then you turn your car around
get pissed off and leave
i hope you hate your hometown hometown
i hope you hate your hometown
then come back to me
baby just come back to me
just come back to meembed"
