im a lonely man with a lonely life
a fulltime job and parttime wife
and the grindstone just goes on and on
youre a lonely girl thats a lonely wife
gotta three bedroom and an empty life
and youre not quite sure
just where it all went wrong
there are lots of reasons why we should turn and walk away
but theres a whole lot riding on this love so baby whats ya say

chorus
lets give it one good shot
lets really give it all we got
we can take it nice and slow
baby dont you want to go back
where we had a chance
and we danced our dance
in a world where a heart could never shatter
we might go down crying
but at least our love will die
trying to matter trying to matter

verse 2
weve come a long way so dont forget
lets dont throw our hands up yet
weve still got time
to change our mind
honey lets give it our best tonight
if we still aint got it right
we can always always say goodbye
somewhere i guess we let go lost a little ground
one solitary heartbeat can turn this thing around

lets give it one good shot
lets really give it all we got
we can take it nice and slow
baby dont you want to go back
where we had a chance
and we danced our dance
in a world where a heart could never shatter
we might go down crying
but at least our love will die
trying to matter
we might go down crying
at least our love will die
trying to matter trying to matterembed"
