this all that i was looking for
balling outta insecurities we felt we need
to validate our greed
thats why the valet taking keys
made it thru the valley from the east
in california streets
i be back a couple weeks
when the salts off the streets

when the sun coming out
i dont want her number now
since they want me hunt me down

like its bounties on my head
aint no counting up my threads
flow so lava when its red
i know u dont love the stress

why he do that all the time
u been moving to my rhymes
i been tuned into the vibes
getcha roomies we get gon ride
talking zooming down the five
you might also likeall the way down santa monica boulevard slow it down u gon miss the exit



too worried bout the next hit
we roll more on the sand

she know that im the man with the pla
n to get them ms only time we talking grand
when its a adjective for the life that we livin
used to imagine this when shaggy was in the kitchen
singing it wasnt me
all luxury all from a mustard seed
ah they dont fuck with me its all good love my g


i really miss asking mama for supper please
gotta supplement myself with the love they need
looking atcho crew like must suck to be
part of whatever u got going on
pardon  the interruption u talking to the don
dont get the shooters alarmed fore they sprinkle like  u walking on my lawn

i got the cake getting sprinkles for whenever my daughter is born
tell the truth need me a simba then mama could have nala so he could always protect her when she aint round her mustafa
and i be damned to get thrown off by any scars bruh
by any means we got the bars sir
could try to climb it
control my climate
rip big l word up ebonics
we really got it


hook

you could try to say you got no time for we
you could tell im taking back whats mine
you be hating on my shine
you be hating all the time all the damn time
like i dont know whats good with you whats good with you
but i got you i really do i really do

its about time its about time i made you mine



verse 2

still working on myself first



thank god for the health worth
way more than a check earned
thats the hardest lessin learned
when u gotta check in furrr emm

medical bills
getting too real
make u question them pills
maybe it best to just chill
lately he stressing foreal
feel like im racing against that
to live out our dreams sacrifices u bent back
u said wed achieve it i know that u meant that
i needed direction like somebody request maps
forks in the road i drove straight thru the middle and dont regret that


candy on my paint dripping man ya cant miss that
no candy in my drank cant mess wit that
if pimp was still here bet he bring texas back

bumping ugk vevo boost the residuals

i need me mo for residences
he be running with the best its like he coming out jamaica but that trini in me litty we be shouting out the maker cuz this story man u couldnt make up girl u a story lemme write some pages
thats like a fable there with all the make up
take it off i wanna see all of ya natural flavors cause u gods greatest creation say thats talk but u mistaken show im walking at cha pace and u could switch it up im keeping up just like the song girl we meant to bump into each other ima love ya till u get a bump be there 11 months

hook

you could try to say you got no time for we
you could tell im taking back whats mine

you be hating all the time all the damn time
like i dont know whats good with you whats good with you
but i got you i really do i really do

its about time its about time i made you mine
