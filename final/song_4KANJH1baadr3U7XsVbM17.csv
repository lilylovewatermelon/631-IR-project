i had a dream the other night
about how we only get one life
it woke me up right after two
i stayed awake and stared at you
so i wouldn’t lose my mind
and i had the week that came from hell
and yes i know that you could tell
but you’re like the net under the ledge
when i go flying off the edge
you go flying off as well
