chorus
every insecurity they do not mean shit to me
because it is you i adore
and baby girl i hope you come in history cant let these niggas get to me
i’d regret if you i lost
every memory is searchin for a long time
every thing was in my face and i was so blind
i told myself i cannot just be one of those guys
i just need some faith so im talkin’ to the most high

verse
real nigga shit niggas not how they seem like
real nigga shit im goin up and niggas seem tight
nowadays i walk around i feel like i got three eyes
remember seein through the whole scene i was kneehigh
you get what you want and i get what i want
b for the bitches same bitches i put my niggas on
i aint had no plan b me and a had to get along
i was sixteen everyone in the room sippin strong
but you know im a leader my mentality really strong
if you ever diss me then nigga you know you really wrong
remember bitches dubbed me now all these bitches they sing my songs
i done had some feelings i took em all to the studio
i done seen some thotties i took ’em all to my video
if i let you use your phone shawty better not take no videos
i don’t give a fuck if your friends heard me all up on the radio
yeah on the radio thats the way to go
gotta be yourself lil’ nigga thats the way to grow
they gon try put you down but you got stay afloat
and sometimes got to put your foot down and start sayin no
and sometimes got to isolate and just start settin’ goals
