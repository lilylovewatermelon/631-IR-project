there are some girls
some girls they really just want to hurt you
and theres some boys
some boys wholl laugh when they break your heart

is a place that im not going
and we could try cause

if youre feeling small
i will love your shadow
and if youre feeling small
ill love your shadow

those girls that are waiting by the phone on the weekend
oh yeah like those boys those boys that are home with the broken hearts

and i know that they have hurt you
and i know the love you gave feels cheap and used
and i know its getting harder
and i know the lights have all gone dark on you
still i will love your shadow
when the love you gave feels cheap and used
yes i will love your shadow
when the lights have all gone dark on you
how love dies is a place that im not going
and we could try

if youre feeling small
i will love your shadow
and if youre feeling small
ill love your shadow
when the lights go down
i will stand right beside you
if youre feeling small
i´ll love your shadow
i´ll love your shadow12embed"
