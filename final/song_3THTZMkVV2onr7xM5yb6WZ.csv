i met you when i was a teen but then you were one as well
and i could play a guitar just like ringing a bell
sometimes i wonder in any other summer
could you have been my parttime lover to me listening to stevie wonder
under the covers where we used to lay
and re stacks is what the speakers played
id be on tour almost every day
when i was home up in my flat is where we used to stay
just watching a dvd smoking illegal weed
getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe
we used each others air just for the people to see
and stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
we go anywhere our minds would take us
and ill say you are beautiful without your makeup
and you don’t even need to worry bout your weight cause
we can all be loved the way that god made us
and times the only reason that we could break up
cause you would always tell me im away too much
distance is relative to the time that it takes
to get on a plane or make a mistake so say it again

chorus
oh nina
you should go nina
cause i aint never coming home nina
oh wont you leave me now
and ive been living on the road nina
but then again you should know nina
cause that’s you and me both nina
oh wont you leave me now now
see ed sheeran liveget tickets as low as 81you might also likeverse 2
and every weekend in the winter youd be wearing my hoodie
with drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold
taking day trips to the local where wed eat on our own
cause every day when i was away wed only speak on the phone
watching blue planet creating new habits
acting as if we were two rabbits and then youd vanish
back to the burrow with all the celtics
i disappear you call me selfish
i understand but i can’t help it
i put my job over everything cept my family and friends
but youll be in between forever so i guess well have to take a step back
overlook the situation
cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
and im not saying we should be taking a break
just reevaluate quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late
so we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane
but in a day well have to say it again

chorus
oh nina
you should go nina
cause i aint never coming home nina
oh wont you leave me now
and ive been living on the road nina
but then again you should know nina
cause that’s you and me both nina
oh wont you leave me now now
bridge
love will come and love will go
but you cant make it on your own
sing that song go
oh wont you leave me now
people grow and fall apart
but you cant mend your broken heart
take it back go
oh wont you leave me now

chorus
oh nina
you should go nina
love will come and love will go
cause i aint never coming home nina
but you can make it on your own
oh wont you leave me now
sing that song go oh wont you leave me now
and ive been living on the road nina
people grow and fall apart
but then again you should know nina
but you can mend your broken heart
cause that’s you and me both nina
take it back go oh wont you leave me now
oh wont you leave me now now
oh nina
you should go nina
love will come and love will go
cause i aint never coming home nina
but you can make it on your own
oh wont you leave me now
sing that song go oh wont you leave me now
and ive been living on the road nina
people grow and fall apart
but then again you should know nina
but you can mend your broken heart
cause that’s you and me both nina
oh wont you leave me now now
