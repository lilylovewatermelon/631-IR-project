maybe i should take that picture off the dashboard
before her memory hits the brakes and takes the wheel
yeah i bet shes still crying on that front porch
yeah this time its gonna take some time to heal

chorus
cause im on my way to tennessee
singing georgia on my mind
chasing what they says a dream
thinking maybe it aint mine
cause that girls in every song i sing
shes in every song i write
and that six string ridin in her seat
wont keep me warm tonight
god what am i supposed to do
theres more than miles in my rear view

verse 2
well im headed north to what i swore i wanted
and trying not to buy into my doubts
but i just cant seem to keep myself from wondering
why im jealous of all them headlights headed south

chorus
cause im on my way to tennessee
singing georgia on my mind
chasing what they says a dream
thinking maybe it aint mine
cause that girls in every song i sing
shes in every song i write
and that six string ridin in her seat
wont keep me warm tonight
god what am i supposed to do
theres more than miles in my rear view

yeah more than miles
yeah ive been changing lanes without my mirrors
cause every time i look behind me i see her
i think i just realized how much i need her damn

chorus
so i’m turning back for georgia
stopping short of tennessee
i can’t put my dreams before her
man i need her with me
cause that girl’s in every song i sing
she’s in every song i write
and that six string ridin in her seat
can sleep in the back tonight
now i know what i’m supposed to do yeah
there’s still more than miles in my rear view

outro
more than miles yeah
