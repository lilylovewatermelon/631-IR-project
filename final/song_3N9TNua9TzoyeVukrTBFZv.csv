but how can that be
when theres a whole class of people
just as lonesome as me

you asked me to tell you
how i can be so blue
but youd be the same
if the girl of your dreams
broke your heart in two

so play me a hank song
to ease my pain
because it helps to know someone
felt the same damn way

alone and forsaken
brother what can i say
i feel like a hank song
since she went away

ol kgs my buddy
we go way back
to the times back in high school
when i was too poor for jack
see tyler childers liveget tickets as low as 39you might also likebut even he knows that sometimes
you cant help right the wrongs
by gettin stoned blind
you need to sit down and pine
to a hank sr song

so play me a hank song
to ease my pain
because it helps to know someone
felt the same damn way

alone and forsaken
brother what can i say
you know i feel like a hank song
since she went away

well i hope that shes happy
and i hope that shes free
i hope she finds her a man
to treat her like a queen

and then up out of nowhere
when she needs him around
she wakes up to find
shes ran out of time and hes ran out of town
i hope she needs her a hank song
to ease her pain
because itll help to know someone
felt the same damn way

alone and forsaken
honey what can i say
i hope you feel like a hank song
one of these daysembed"
