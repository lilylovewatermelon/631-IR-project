verse 1
so this is it this is what i wished for
just isnt how i envisioned it fame to the point of imprisonment
i just thought the shitd be different
but somethin changed the minute that i got a whiff of it
i started to inhale it smell it started sniffin it
and it became my cocaine i just couldnt quit
i just wanted a little bit then it turned me to a monster
i became a hypocrite concert after concert
i was rakin in the dough rollin in green
had the game hemmed up like a sewin machine
but i was losin my freedom there was nowhere for me
to not go and be seen and just go and be me
and there was no inbetween you either loved it or hate it
every cd critics gave it a three then three
years later they go back and rerate it
and call the slim shady lp the greatest
the marshall mathers was a classic
the eminem show was fantastic
but encore just didnt have the caliber to match it
i guess enough time just aint passed yet
a couple more years that shitll be illmatic
and eight years later im still at it
divorced remarried a felon a father sleepin pill addict
and this is real talk i feel like the incredible hulk
my back has been broke and i can still walk

so be careful what you wish for cause you just might get it
and if you get it then you just might not know what to do with it
cause it might just come back on you tenfold
i said be careful what you wish for cause you just might get it
and if you get it then you just might not know what to do with it
cause it might just come back on you tenfold

verse 2
i got a letter from a fan that said
hes been prayin for me
every day and for some reason its been weighin
on my mind heavy cause i dont read every
letter i get but somethin told me to go ahead and open it but
why would someone pray for you when they dont know you
you didnt pray for me when i was local
and as i lay these vocals i think of all the shit i had to go through
just to get to where im at ive already told you
at least a thousand times in these rhymes
i appreciate the prayer but ive already got god on my side
and its been one hell of a ride hasnt it
just watchin it from a opposite standpoint
man boys got to look
nuts and thats the only word i can think of
right now on how to describe the shit
its just like a vibe you get go ahead and bop to it
just watch what you wish for cause i got the shit
chorus
so be careful what you wish for cause you just might get it
and if you get it then you just might not know what to do with it
cause it might just come back on you tenfold
i said be careful what you wish for cause you just might get it
and if you get it then you just might not know what to do with it
cause it might just come back on you tenfold67embed"
