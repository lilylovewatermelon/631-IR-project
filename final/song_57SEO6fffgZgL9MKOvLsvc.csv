friday the week was long
cant wait to get my twistoff off
one sip and all the bull shish is gone
umhmm hey freddie im already ready
for another down here beer
saturday mown the grass
some people think its a pain in the back
me its just another way to work up a thirst real fast
its why i like to do her with a bungee strapped cooler
to my old john deere beer

chorus
i like it ice cold
i take it with a lime
canadian mexican heineken american
theyre all real good friends of mine
i like it in a mug in a bottle in a cup
i like it with a shot
mmm it hits the spot beer

verse 2
sunday football game
hot dog and a mustard stain
cussing out the ref
but i guess i cant complain
ive got it made in the shade
of a 60 inch sony and my lazy boy chairâ€¦beer
see lee brice liveget tickets as low as 88you might also likechorus
i like it ice cold
i take it with a lime
canadian mexican heineken american
theyre all real good friends of mine
i like it in a mug in a bottle in a cup
i like it with a shot
i like it when im fishin on the lake
i like it when im wishing i was fishing on the lake

outro

i may have a problem ill admit it beer
i aint never going to quit it beer
it tastes good it tastes too good beer
hey freddie im already ready for another down here
