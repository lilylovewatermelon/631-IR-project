i havent seen you in forever
oh you havent changed a bit
you didnt think that i would remember
how could i forget

chorus
we sang bobby mcghee on the hood of my car
made a wish on every star
in that clear september sky
one bottle of wine and two dixie cups
3 am i fell in love
for the first time in my life
oh thats something that just dont happen twice

verse 2
to this day i still taste that first kiss
how i prayed it wouldnt end
in a way seeing you like this
i guess it never really did

chorus
we sang bobby mcghee on the hood of my car
made a wish on every star
in that clear september sky
one bottle of wine and two dixie cups
3 am i fell in love
for the first time in my life
oh thats something that just dont happen twice
