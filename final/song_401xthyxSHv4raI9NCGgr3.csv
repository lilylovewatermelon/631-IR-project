its not you its me
the timing and the setting arent what i thought theyd be
theres probably someone better for you out there anyway
maybe i just need some space
no i should just come out and say

i wanna get this right baby
i wanna thrill you in the way you deserve
i wanna blow your mind darling
im just having trouble getting up the nerve
i wanna give you what you want
i wanna be the man you choose
i wanna sweep you off your feet
without puking on your shoes
maybe ill do better in the candlelight
i gotta get this right

spoken
no no no stay right where you are ill put out the fire my love 

sung
i wanna make you swoon baby
i wanna rock you with my righteous romance
i wanna set a mood darling
but im sweating through the seat of these pants
