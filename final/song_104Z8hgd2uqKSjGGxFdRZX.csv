your hair reminds me
of a time when we once were
your fingernails that marked my back
now rot in earth
the sheets we slept in blew away
and now the storm is over
the taste of you inside my mouth remains
but still im hearing

prechorus
theres no love
everybodys crying
theres no truth
everyones misguided

chorus
and now the end is here
theres no more pills to swallow
the bitter taste i feel
will lead me to tomorrow

verse 2
your scent reminds me
of a place we used to go
the kisses placed upon my neck
show signs of
no return
the bed we fucked in
smells the same
and now the stench is fading
the taste of you inside my mouth remains
but still im hearing
you might also likeprechorus
theres no love
everybodys crying
theres no truth
everyones misguided

chorus
and now the end is here
theres no more pills to swallow
the bitter taste i feel
will lead me to tomorrow
