bursting with empathy
im feeling everything
the weight of the world on my shoulders
hope my tears dont freak you out
theyre just kinda coming out
its the music in me and all of the colors

chorus
wish we didnt live
wish we didnt live so far from each other
im just sitting here
thinking bout the time thats slipping
and missing my mother
mother
and shes probably sitting there
thinking bout the time thats slipping
and missing her mother
