my nigga wheezy know what im sayin

chorus
tryna find paradise i aint tryna see that light
i been prayin through life but some things just aint right
we ball every saturday night takin private long flights
i been covered in ice money stay on my mind
gotta get paid gon get paid
gon get paid gon get paid ooh

verse 1
i got real hundreds in the brief
lately i aint been gettin no sleep
why the pain it make me weak
i got dope in my iv
i cant patiently wait
im securing all my needs
hundred way to go get paid
thats the subject they should teach
went to school checked out my niece i missed her face
workin in these streets hard for my family to reach
steady searchin tryna see make a way
the motto is to get paid stack a dollar every day

chorus
tryna find paradise i aint tryna see that light
i been prayin through life but some things just aint right
we ball every saturday night takin private long flights
i been covered in ice money stay on my mind
gotta get paid gon get paid
gon get paid gon get paid ooh

rockin iced out cuban links
cartiers i still cant see
dodgin money laundry
wash the cash it came back clean
gucci pinstripes not no jeans
gucci collar bumblebees
my lock be doublegs
rockin highwaters up to my knees
talk to god when i get on my knees
thank the lord we paid
mama got a smile on her face
all of my niggas is straight
came off the top of that a my name hold weight
money growin like my age
partner nem seein better days

chorus
tryna find paradise i aint tryna see that light
i been prayin through life but some things just aint right
we ball every saturday night takin private long flights
i been covered in ice money stay on my mind
gotta get paid gon get paid
gon get paid gon get paid ooh1embed"
