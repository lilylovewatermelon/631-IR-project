what the fuck im posed to fall in love with you
bitch i shouldve never even fucked with you
trust issues that shit made me feel uncomfortable
i shouldve never made you feel like i was stuck with you
you ever had somebody say that they was down for you
they made it feel so real like they really down for you
they clown on you every time they turn around on you
they not loyal they happy they lookin down on you

now i feel like you never kept it a buck with me

im hoping that aint my baby that shit gon fuck with me
