i look at you
and before my eyes its true
that the girl of my dreams
is not quite what she seems
open your door
turn on the light
show me some more
tell me its alright

chorus
heaven
is inside you
heaven
when i ride you
heaven
do you want me
is hell just in my mind

verse 2
i look at you
at everything you do
the words in your hand
still remain unsaid
open my eyes
inflatable girl
lose the disguise
release me from your spell

heaven
is inside you
heaven
when i ride you
heaven
do you want me
is hell just in my mind
heaven
is inside you
heaven
when i ride you
heaven
do you want me
is hell just in my mindembed"
