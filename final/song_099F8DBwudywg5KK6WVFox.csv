cold and silent soiled face i will wash it all away
with my love thats all shes ever needed from me
its my time to mother
one of my own in my life
i am so alone left with no one
in my life im so alone

chorus
life submissiveness
hypnotizing the ignorant
a little boys best friends always his mother
at least thats what she said
life of a simple man
taught that everyone else is dirty
and their love is meaningless
im just a soiled dirty boy just a soiled dirty boy

verse 1
sheltered life innocence
insulated memories spark reflections of my head
duality in my consciousness
caught in the war of hemispheres between the love lost in my head

refrain
mommy do you still live inside of me
im so lost in my life without any guiding
protected me my whole life from everything
nailed shut the doors to the shrine
to screen your dead eyes from me and my sickness
mutilate and sew my new clothes for masquerading
aprons of flesh corpse scalped hair with skin upon my face
see mudvayne liveget tickets as low as 110you might also likeverse 2
deliver the remains from her womb of earth
prep the rack and tie up for new loves rebirth
covert understanding of novice surgery
ill focus concentration and only take just what i need

prechorus
for sickness im masticating
dancing and masturbating
celebrate in fields of night
with skin upon my face

chorus
life submissiveness
hypnotizing the ignorant
a little boys best friends always his mother
at least thats what she said
life of a simple man
taught that everyone else is dirty
and their love is meaningless

chorus
life submissiveness
hypnotizing the ignorant
a little boys best friends always his mother
at least thats what she said
life of a simple man
taught that everyone else is dirty
and their love is meaningless
im so soiled
bridge
if i soak my hands in others blood am i sick
if i wash my hands in others blood am i sick
if i drench myself in others blood am i sick
if i bathe myself in others blood
blame mother for the sickness
mutilate and sew my new clothes for masquerading
aprons of flesh corpse scalped hair with skin upon my face
dance and masturbate in night light by myself
nothing is left for me to gain
theyre coming to take me far away
nothing is left for me to gain
theyre coming to take me far away
nothing is left for me to gain
theyre coming to take me far away
nothing is left for me to gain
theyre coming to take me far away

chorus
