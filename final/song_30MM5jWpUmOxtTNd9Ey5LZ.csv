it was the 14th of october had that tshirt off your shoulder
i was drunk said i was sober and you said yeah right
we were talkin for a minute then some guy tried to cut in
you took my hand and we pretended like i was your guy

prechorus
woah and i tried to guess your middle name
for thirty minutes bet we played that game

chorus
that mangorita you were drinkin
and that coldplay song that you were singin
and i bet right now youre probably thinkin
that its crazy i remember every detail but i do
from your blue jeans to your shoes
girl that night was just like you
unforgettable

verse 2
we were dancin we were buzzin takin shots like it was nothin
did the runnin man you loved it yeah you laughed out loud
you brushed away your blonde hair and you kissed me out of nowhere
i can still show you the spot where everything went down
