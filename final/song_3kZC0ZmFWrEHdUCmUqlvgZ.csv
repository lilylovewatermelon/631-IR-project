love of mine someday you will die
but ill be close behind ill follow you into the dark
no blinding light or tunnels to gates of white
just our hands clasped so tight waiting for the hint of a spark

chorus
if heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied
illuminate the nos on their vacancy signs
if theres no one beside you when your soul embarks
then ill follow you into the dark

verse 2
in catholic school as vicious as roman rule
i got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
and i held my tongue as she told me son
fear is the heart of love so i never went back

chorus
if heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied
illuminate the nos on their vacancy signs
if theres no one beside you when your soul embarks
then ill follow you into the dark

verse 3
you and me have seen everything to see
from bangkok to calgary and the soles of your shoes
are all worn down the time for sleep is now
but its nothing to cry about cause well hold each other soon
in the blackest of rooms
see death cab for cutie liveget tickets as low as 147you might also likechorus
and if heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied
and illuminate the nos on their vacancy signs
if theres no one beside you when your soul embarks
then ill follow you into the dark
