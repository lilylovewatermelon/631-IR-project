dont go gotta know please dont run away
im a murderer what can i say
dont go gotta know please dont run away
im a murderer what does that change

verse 1 childish gambino
cant sleep
3 am stare at the ceiling murder the feeling
spider crawl in the corner brown recluse
so appropriate cornucopia so be it say im over it
playing lil durk dis aint what u want
look at my feet i put my sneakers in the trunk
pass a fatburger through atwater village
laugh for a minute couldnt cry for the life of me
park by the bridge sit on the hood
look at the cars stare at my hands look at the moon
i cant find it its gone whats wrong
didnt respond when i texted you last night
you alright—yeah
chorus miguel
dont go gotta know please dont run away
im a murderer what can i say
dont go gotta know please dont run away
im a murderer what does that change

man is a star bound to a body inside of me
twenty million degrees burn a man to his knees
late at night in a hurry bought a mcflurry
and half of an apple pie when im laughing im satisfied
when im dying im still alive strange position
im in a good mood so good ima kill that spider
in spite of the kinda things that they told me
alone dont mean that you lonely
alone means you finally get it admit it
go home lock up the door fold up the clothes
watch some cartoons turn off the lights
look at the recluse look at the recluse
look at the recluse look at the rec—
chorus miguel
dont go gotta know please dont run away
im a murderer what can i say
dont go gotta know please dont run away
im a murderer what does that change
outro miguel
dont go dont go
dont go dont go
dont go dont go
dont go dont goooo
