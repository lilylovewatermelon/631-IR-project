the highs and the lows
the highs the lows

verse 1 chance the rapper
im an emotional rollercoaster ah
with highs so high could put bol bol on a poster mm
but when the bread get low like four loaves in a toaster
oh the shoulders can get cold as ten toes in nova scotia
some days i hold a grudge some days i holy ghost her
some days i just ghost her some days im supposed to
the crib feel like a gunfight but them strollers thats the holster huh
we can make amends over old memes and mimosas
my mama know i aint make my bed but ima lay in it
whеther its sandpaper suedе linen
whether im alone or creole lady marmaladeing it
the same pajamas i was afraid in i boogeyman slayed
my blankets concealed my blade in it emotional seesaw
with two fat motherfuckers with strong knees in free fall huh
its cloudy with a chance of meatballs i checked the weather
i gave all my vices a call lets get together

refrain chance the rapper
to talk about the highs and lows the ups and downs
the friends that i had to hide to come around
they told me that i knew youd always come around
come around come around come around come around
to work out the highs and lows the ups and downs
no need to hide disguises comin down
go and get high i promise youre comin down
comin down comin down comin down comin down

when its hard to keep your eyes on the road eyes on the road
and you feel your backs on the ropes with your backs against the ropes
you gotta take the highs with the lows the highs with the lows
you gotta take the highs with the lows yeah yeah
youre lost and youre runnin out of hope youre runnin out of hope
lookin for the best way to cope for the best ways to cope
just know we all been there before we all been there
you gotta take the highs with the lows badmon

verse 2 joey bada
i was feelin lifeless i had to cut my vices i had to
now the feelin that i feel is priceless
in the spirit want me to be righteous
but i know i might just relapse get sucked in these devices
got so used to feedback i couldnt tell what mines is word
sometimes all the outside noise just really blinds us
beware facts believe none of what you see and half of what you hear right
the best things in life on the opposite side of fear
i swear i see it clear like after the storm
still you cant stop the rain like the loose ends song
my word is bond like james yo i couldnt complain nah
cause even when i did niggas really couldnt feel my pain uh
thats the type of shit to drive a nigga insane
wanna be numb now your thumb back flickin the flame
back to square one tryna overcome what you became
like they was right i guess youre never gon change i guess you never gon
chorus chance the rapper  joey bada
when its hard to keep your eyes on the road your eyes on the road
you start to feel your back on the ropes your back gainst the ropes
you gotta take the highs with the lows the highs with the lows
you gotta take the highs with the lows the highs with the lows
youre lost and youre runnin out of hope and youre runnin out of hope
and you lookin for the best way to cope the best way to cope
just know we all been there before we all been there
you gotta take the highs with the lows the highs with the lows

refrain chance the rapper
to talk about the highs and lows the ups and downs
the friends that i had to hide to come around
they told me that i knew youd always come around
come around come around come around come around
to work out the highs and lows the ups and downs the ups and downs
no need to hide disguises comin down comin down
go and get high i promise youre comin down
comin down comin down comin down comin down
