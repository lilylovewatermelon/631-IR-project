out in the sticks and the squirrels and the ticks
and my 3006 im running out of miller lite
trucks in park the dog wont bark
couple hours till dark
wishing one would walk by
might as well left my gun in the gun rack
been here all day
all i killed’s a twelve pack

chorus
sitting here waiting on a deer drinkin beer and wastin bullets
aiming at the empties missing hitting pine trees
it aren’t my fault them cans keep moving
my babys on the phone saying baby come home
where you been and
what youve been doing
well ive been sitting here waiting on a deer
drinkin beer and wastin bullets

verse 2
the only deer ive seen been john deere green
and that dont mean that i got a raw deal
cause aren’t no boss calling me horse
ticking me off on the edge of this cornfield
on my second box of winchester hundred grains
aren’t seen a big buck but its been a good day

sitting here waiting on a deer drinkin beer and wastin bullets
aiming at the empties missing hitting pine trees
it aren’t my fault them cans keep moving
my babys on the phone saying baby come home
where you been and
what youve been doing
well ive been sitting here waiting on a deer
drinkin beer and wastin bullets
sitting here waiting on a deer drinkin beer and wastin bullets
aiming at the empties missing hitting pine trees
it aren’t my fault them cans keep moving
my babys on the phone saying baby come home
where you been and
what youve been doing
well ive been sitting here waiting on a deer
drinkin beer and wastin bullets
