let your hair down lets unwind
take your problems leave them behind
you got your troubles and i got mine

i get in trouble cause i speak my mind
sometimes i like it when i make you cry

i know tomorrow we may have regrets
but as for right now wheres the party at
well stay up all night waiting for the sun to shine sun to shine
baby thats right baby thats right baby thats right ahh
