verse 1 mac miller
it seems like every day i got a filledup phone
ladies tryna text me sayin that they home for the summer
and they heard that im livin on my own
so they wanna come to the crib maybe cook me some supper
but im busy so im ignorin her
yeah i just touched down in california
now im headed to the beach
go and swim in the water like im tryna sneak in across the border
i do all different types of crazy shit
im the youngin hoes tryna make a baby with
cause itll make em rich
know im headed to the money so these funny little girls wanna take a trip
but no only the most dope with me
other fools homo roy and siegfried
no disrespect though
i got addictive cigarette flow for the green pesto presto

yeah im highly underestimated
so educated and getting paid quick
if you ever hated anticipate that im famous
got a bunch of bitches to sip on the champagne with
celebrate that we seein another day
life good never wanna end this
me and mary jane got a really nice friendship
yeah they give me money but i gotta go and spend it
man i been a bad little jew
but i gotta pay the bills now so i gotta chill out
i aint walkin round like im splurging with a mil now
feel like the kid working at the mill now
used to just chill and smoke joints up at bills house
now i got a schedule things i gotta do
doing interviews see it up on youtube
i say it feels just like a dream
bout to wake up from a nap how fucked up was that like
