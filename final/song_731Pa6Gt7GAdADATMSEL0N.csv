intro big sean
they used to tell me used to tell me

chorus big sean
i hope you learn to make it on your own
and if you love yourself just know youll never be alone
i hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
i hope that its the realest thing that you ever know
hope you get the pretty girls thats pretty at everything
milliondollar cribs havin million dollar dreams
and when you get it all just remember one thing
remember one thing that one man could change the world
that one man could change the world

verse 1 big sean
all i all i wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad chick
imagined this so much some nights it felt like that i had it
back on the mattress starin at the ceilin tryna connect the dots
but its hard makin those attachments
im talkin dreamin so hard some nights it felt like draft day
you know my  my stepbrother used to flip them bags
outside the crib like it was trash day
no kim k but he bagged yay ye
but when youre gettin fast money slow down dont crash
with all the drive in the world swear you still need gas
look think about it close your eyes dream about it
tell your team about it go make milliondollar schemes about it
success is on the way i feel it in the distance
used to look up at the stars
and be like aint too much thats different
i be shinin they be shinin get your one shot dont you miss it
what you know bout wakin up every day like you on a mission
see big sean liveget tickets as low as 120you might also likechorus kanye west
and i hope you learn to make it on your own
and if you love yourself just know youll never be alone
i hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
i hope that its the realest thing that you ever know
hope you get the pretty girls thats pretty and everything
milliondollar cribs havin million dollar dreams
and when you get it all just remember one thing
remember one thing one man could change the world
one man could change the world

verse 2 big sean
my grandma told me if you write your name in stone
youll never get the whiteout
i grinded out that black hole then performed up at the white house
standin next to jim carrey we traded stories then laughed
i said you not the only one i know got rich wearin masks
where im from i swear they broke
they need way more than the cast
we need more than what you have
and then we need more than that
but how am i supposed to say im tired
if that girl from west virginia came up in conditions
that i couldnt survive
went to war came back alive
on top of that became a female black captain
when being black you had to extraextra try
way before james brown made us proud
she bought a crib on the same street as marvin gaye
right there on outer drive and she taught me how to drive
and she raised the kids then the kids kids and she did it right
taught me how to love taught me not to cry
when i die i hope you teach me how to fly
all my life youve been that angel in disguise sayin
chorus john legend
i hope you learn to make it on your own
and if you love yourself just know youll never be alone
i hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
i hope that its the realest thing that you ever know
hope you get the pretty girls thats pretty and everything
milliondollar cribs havin million dollar dreams
and when you get it all just remember one thing
remember one thing that one man can change the world
that one man can change the world
