like a jew in ancient spain
and for christs name did pay with pain
modern day inquisition
what is the link between these crafts
doctors and thieves they both wear masks
overpaid meat magicians

chorus
life is killing me life is killing me
life is killing me life is killing me

verse 2
your doctorate and phd
would wipe my ass etched in feces
will not cure your affliction
doctors jeckyll or mengele
and your face too theyre just a blur
cant improve my condition

chorus
life is killing me life is killing me
life is killing me life is killing me

verse 3
appointment made waited three hours
did not realize you had such power
id rather see a mortician
your parents saved or had the bucks
your education stems from luck
future corpse death by physician
you might also likebridge
i have no choice devoid of rights
so pull the plug its my damned life
keep me alive to increase your bill
a red cross hell the hospital
just let me die with dignity
its not suicide simply mercy
just who do you think you are
medical school dont make you god
now i dont care what youve been taught
just get me off this life support ah
just let me die with dignity
its not suicide simply mercy

chorus
life is killing me life is killing me
life is killing me life is killing me
i said
life is killing me life is killing me
i said
life is killing me life is killing me life is killing me2embed"
