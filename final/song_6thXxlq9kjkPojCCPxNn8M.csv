so this is what were up against
so this is what were up against

chorus
face it
this is what were up up against
youre waiting
and every minute is a minute away
face it
this is what were up up against
youre waiting
and every minute is a minute away

verse 1
regrets always work
excuses are better
a practical exchange
or a trade for the truth
but you know it never held up but you know it never held up
pretend that its still good now

chorus
face it
this is what were up up against
youre waiting
and every minute is a minute away
face it
this is what were up up against
youre waiting
and every minute is a minute away

were turning our clocks back
were just never ourselves
so go with the flow
just relax just relax
you never feel the jet lag
unless youre trying to fit in

chorus
face it
this is what were up up against
youre waiting
and every minute is a minute away
face it
this is what were up up against
youre waiting
and every minute is a minute away
every minute is a minute away

less is more except when it comes to mistakes
how long is long that depends how long it takes
less is more except when it comes to mistakes
how long is long that depends how long it takes
the years not months
not days you blackout memories
the years not months
not days you blackout memories
chorus
face it
this is what were up up against
youre waiting
and every minute is a minute away
face it
this is what were up up against
youre waiting
and every minute is a minute away
every minute is a minute away
every minute is a minute
and a minute and a minute awayembed"
