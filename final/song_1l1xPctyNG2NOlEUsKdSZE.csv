my hands are broken and time is going on and on
it goes forever how long
so i got high and lived all that life
i have taken all for granted

chorus
promise me youll try to leave it all behind
cause ive elected hell
lying to myself
why have i gone blind
live another life
you

verse 2
the only way out is letting your guard down
and never die forgotten i know
and forgive me my love
i stand here all alone and i can see the bottom

chorus
promise me youll try to leave it all behind
cause ive elected hell
lying to myself
why have i gone blind
live another life
you
