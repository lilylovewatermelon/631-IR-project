you want my heart you got to work
and show me that youll ride or die for me

youre tryin to rob steal take my love well fuck you

verse 3 david rush
rusher
she took my love and played me for a sucker
but it dont even matter cause you know i still love her
she took my heart and threw it on the ground
but it dont even matter cause i still want her around
shes such a love taker shes such a love taker
its guaranteed that shes a professional heartbreaker
but a great love maker all in the sheets
she made my heart skip a beat
but for now shes as cold as they come
no match no knife and no gun she took my love

chorus vein
you took my love i thought i was the only one
you took my love it feels like you did it for fun
you took my love but my heart keeps tellin me youre the one
you took my love took my love
