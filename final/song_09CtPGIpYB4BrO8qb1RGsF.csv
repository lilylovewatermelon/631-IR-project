verse 1
you gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
you know i try but i dont do too well with apologies
i hope i dont run out of time could someone call a referee
cause i just need one more shot at forgiveness
i know you know that i made those mistakes maybe once or twice
and by once or twice i mean maybe a couple of hundred times
so let me oh let me redeem oh redeem oh myself tonight
cause i just need one more shot at second chances
