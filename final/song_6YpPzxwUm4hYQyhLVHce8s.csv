twentyfive all of these mixed emotions
tangled up in pure confusion
it’s hard to let go of the past
but it seems easier as time is moving

verse 2
well you said he makes you laugh
and he makes you happy
he sees you smiling back
it is everlasting

chorus
and so he’s tailor made for you
with stunning golden hues
and one sweet tone to soothe
your persistent beating heart it’s just a start
and i ive seen you every day
youve never been like this before
hes tailor made tailor tailor made

verse 3
so let go all of these mixed emotions
forget all your hesitations
together entwined inside this feeling
your feet off the ground head hits ceiling

and then he whispered in your ear
he’s absolutely falling
the words he said are clear
dont insist on stalling

chorus
because hes tailor made for you
with stunning golden hues
and one sweet tone to soothe
your persistent beating heart it’s just a start
and i ive seen you every day
youve never been like this before

whoa sister dont be troubled
whoa sister please be calm
cause this isnt what youre used to at all

chorus
hes tailor made for you
with stunning golden hues
and one sweet tone to soothe
your persistent beating heart its just a start
and i ive seen you every day
youve never been like this before
