hey im sure ive been here before
must be in my living room again
its a mess but im used to this
i guess my mother came home with her friend

bridge
its bad enough
i dont need anything
least of all this

verse 2
you would cry
i would gladly die
i would give my life
to ease the pain

bridge
its bad enough
i dont need anything
least of all this

chorus
you are the one who takes and never gives back
anything at all
i want to blame you
upstairs around the railing you can find me
chained to my respect
i want to blame you now
you might also likeverse 3
i dream of a place where you stayed a child
i wake up believing its real
dear sister i wanted to save your life
youre just as afraid

chorus
you are the one who takes and never gives back
anything at all
i want to blame you
upstairs around the railing you can find me
chained to my respect
i want to save you nowembed"
