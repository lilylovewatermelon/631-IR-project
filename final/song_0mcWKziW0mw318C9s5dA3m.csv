be this sunset soon forgotten
your brothers left here shaved and crazy
weâ€™ve learned to hide our bottles in the well
and whats worth keeping sun still sinking

refrain
down and down
once again
down and down
gone again

verse 2
be this sunset one for keeping
this june bug street sings low and lovely
those bandaid children chased your dog away
she runs returning sun still sinking

refrain
down and down
once again
down and down
gone againsee iron  wine liveget tickets as low as 60you might also like1embed"
