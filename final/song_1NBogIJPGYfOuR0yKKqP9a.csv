well dont give me no comic book sad looks no more
please dont use those same excuses youve used before
mhmm mhmm
you told yourself so many times its okay
so eager to try but you just dont know how to come back down

chorus
and now you beat me up you break me down hopin i dont come around
kick me when im on the ground
beat me up and break me down hopin i dont come around
kick me when im on the ground come around

verse 2
well how about those people i know that you know the ones i mean
not so good not so bad only know what they have
and they have only what theyve seen
ah them mediocre bad guys can really bring you down
they cant be defeated and you know theyre never gonna come around

chorus
they just beat me up and break me down hopin i dont come around
kick me when im on the ground
cause they beat me up and break me down hopin i dont come around
kick me when im on the ground
you beat me up and break me down hopin i dont come around
kick me when im on the ground come around
and beat me up and break me down hopin i dont come around
kick me when im on the ground come around
