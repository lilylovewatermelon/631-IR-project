you wont admit it but its true
im happy without you
i turned away and let your drama pull you in
you always said i was a fool
but something carried through
i never want to see your face again

verse 2
so many problems left behind
im sorting out my mind
this idiot has turned into a better man
i found my soul in someone else
who doesnt feel like hell
who doesnt make me wanna kill myself

prechorus
no no i have every right to hate you
no no i have every right to hate you

chorus
i was leaving stop believing
then i end up right back in your arms
now im bleeding fucking seething
i was through with you a long time ago

some people suffer for no reason
but theyre the ones to blame
so walk away let it go and save yourself
before you tell yourself a lie
just tell that one goodbye
how much more can you take before you fucking die

prechorus
no no i have every right to hate you
no no i have every right to hate you

chorus
i was leaving stop believing
then i end up right back in your arms
now im bleeding fucking seething
i was through with you a long time ago
