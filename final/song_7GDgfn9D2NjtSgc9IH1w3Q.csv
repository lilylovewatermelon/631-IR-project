you come circling through the light
the skyline is bright tonight
what more perfect rendezvous
the sundown paints the shadows through the daylight
amy on what we do

it looks like darkness to me
drifting down into miami

can i say i wish that this weather would never leave
it just gets hard to believe
that god sent this angel to watch over me
cause my angel she dont receive my calls
says im too dumb to fuck
too dumb to fight
too dumb to save
well maybe i dont need no angel at all

it looks like darkness to me oh
drifting down into miami
she could pull the sunlight through me
coming down into miami

make a circle in the sand
make a halo with your hands
ill make a place for you to land
see counting crows liveget tickets as low as 170you might also likethe bus is running
its time to leave
this summerâ€™s gone and so are we
so come on baby
lets go shut it down in new orleansembed"
