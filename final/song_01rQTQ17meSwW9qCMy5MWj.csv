you let me down down down
i gave you trust and salvation
you let me down down down
i gave you everything that i could provide
yeah
i gave you strenght to stand
you shove me

down
down

i know you want me to love you
but all you ever do is bring me down
wont you go away forever

i felt the world of pain
its coming down down down
brought to the water then left me dry
down down down
took the drug from the user
yeah
took all my strength to run then shoved me

down
down

but all you ever do is bring me down
wont you go away forever

its kinda freaky just to see you crawl
and all you can do is stare
i know youre tripping while i kick you to the curb
like you did me

oh you shove me

i know you want me to love you
but all you ever do is bring me down
wont you go away forever
i know you want me to love you
all you ever do is bring me down
wont you go away forever
