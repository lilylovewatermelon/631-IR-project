how dare you say that my behaviors unacceptable
so condescending unnecessarily critical
i have the tendency of getting very physical
so watch your step cause if i do youll need a miracle
you drain me dry and make me wonder why im even here
the double vision i was seeing is finally clear
you want to stay but you know very well i want you gone
not fit to fuckin tread the ground that i am walking on

chorus
but when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
youll understand what i mean when i say
theres no way were gonna give up yeah yeah yeah
and like a little girl cries in the face
of a monster that lives in her dreams
is there anyone out there
cause its getting harder and harder to breathe
is there anyone out there
cause its getting harder and harder to breathe

verse 2
what you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
you should know better you never listened to a word i said
clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
hoping somebody someday will do you like i did
see maroon 5 liveget tickets as low as 100you might also likechorus
but when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
youll understand what i mean when i say
theres no way were gonna give up yeah yeah yeah
and like a little girl cries in the face
of a monster that lives in her dreams
she said is there anyone out there
cause its getting harder and harder to breathe
is there anyone out there
cause its getting harder and harder to breathe

bridge
and does it kill does it burn is it painful to learn
that its me that has all the control
does it thrill does it sting when you feel what i bring
and you wish that you had me to hold

chorus
but when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
youll understand what i mean when i say
theres no way were gonna give up yeah yeah yeah
and like a little girl cries in the face
of a monster that lives in her dreams
is there anyone out there
cause its getting harder and harder to breathe
is there anyone out there
cause its getting harder and harder to breathe
is there anyone out there
cause its getting harder and harder to breathe19embed"
