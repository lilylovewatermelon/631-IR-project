she was gone
long gone this morning
she left a note
said im out of here
adios my dear and that was all she wrote
i tried to hang with the hank wasnt tough enough
could twang the pain
but the flat was scrubbed
had to keep on drinking

prechorus
keep on sinking down down
down down down to the good stuff

chorus
til i hit rock bottom and i cranked it up
i hit that water back with a monster stack
and a kick kick kick drum kicking my butt
got a cali chick checking out this hit
spitting out back in black
i hit rock bottom
started bouncing back
started bouncing back

verse 2
shes flying high tonight
just across town
theres a lone hillbilly playing stardust willy
wasnt even getting off the ground
tried to hang with the hang but i had to stop
got shot with the jay cash needle drop
couldnt walk the line
see kenny chesney liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likeprechorus 2
so i just kept shining down down
down down down to the juke box

chorus
til i hit rock bottom and i cranked it up
i hit that water back with a monster stack
and a kick kick kick drum kicking my butt
got a cali chick checking out this hit
spitting out back in black
i hit rock bottom
started bouncing back

til i hit rock bottom and i cranked it up
i hit that water back with a monster stack
and a kick kick kick drum kicking my butt
got a cali chick checking out this hit
spitting out back in black
i hit rock bottom
started bouncing back
started bouncing backembed"
