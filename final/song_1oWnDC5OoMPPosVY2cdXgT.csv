id never danced
til i danced with you my love
couldnt hear the music
but im sure it was good stuff
id never sang
with a tear falling from my eye
and every time i lose it
oh and im not afraid to cry

verse 2
id never spoke
to one like you before
told you all my secrets
and you wanted more
id never looked
into eyes as clear as yours
and every time i lose it
nothing matters more

chorus
oh dont look now
if the superstitions got you down
thеres no right way
to get back to her hеart oh lord
dont you worry bout how
but i got it all figured out
they can take my name and take my fame
lavender girl take me back to the start
