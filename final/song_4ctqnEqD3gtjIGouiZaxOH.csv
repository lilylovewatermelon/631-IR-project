found myself today singin out loud your name
you said im crazy if i am im crazy for you
sometimes sittin in the dark wishin you were here
turns me crazy but its you who makes me lose my head

prechorus
and every time im meant to be acting sensible
you drift into my head and
turn me into a crumblin fool

chorus
tell me to run and ill race
if you want me to stop ill freeze
and if you want me gone ill leave
just hold me closer baby
and make me crazy for you
crazy for you

verse 2
lately with this state im in i cant help myself but spin
i wish youd come over send me spinning closer to you
my oh my how my blood boils its sweet taste for you
strips me down bare and gets me into my favourite mood

prechorus
i keep on trying fighting these feelings away
but the more i do
the crazier i turn into
see adele liveget tickets as low as 165you might also likechorus
pacing floors and opening doors
hoping youll walk through
and save me boy
because im too crazy for you
crazy for you8embed"
