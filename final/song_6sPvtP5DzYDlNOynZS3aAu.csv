god bless the daylight the sugary smell of springtime
remembering when you were mine in a still suburban town
when every thursday id brave those mountain passes
and youd skip your early classes and wed learn how our bodies worked

verse 2
god damn the black night with all its foul temptations
ive become what i always hated when i was with you then
we looked like giants in the back of my grey subcompact
fumbling to make contact as the others slept inside

chorus
and together there
in a shroud of frost the mountain air
began to pass
from every pane of weathered glass
and i held you closer
than anyone would ever guess

bridge
do you remember the jamc
and reading aloud from magazines
i dont know about you but i swear on my name they could smell it on me
but ive never been too good with secrets no

and together there
in a shroud of frost the mountain air
began to pass
through every pane of weathered glass
and i held you closer5embed"
