i ran the same street as the devil
ive shook his hand
i can tell you i aint ever
feared another man
im far from a saint just shy of disciple
some know what i mean
ive done things thatd make your skin crawl baby
and everything in between
i ran the same street as the devil

prechorus
dont look now but theyre comin
theyre comin after me
i spent my whole life runnin
why wont they let me be
dont look now but theyre comin
theyre comin after me
i spent my whole life runnin
why wont they let me be

chorus
runnin round runnin round
when it comes to lonely
i know that sound
runnin round runnin round
cause ive been lost
more than ive been found
oh ive been lost
more than ive been foundyou might also likeembed"
