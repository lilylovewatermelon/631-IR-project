the voice on the telephone sounds awful angry
and somehow it doesnt fit in
with the face in the picture i keep on my dresser
of the girl i once called my best friend

verse 2
we drank from the fountain of good times and dreamin
but these lawyers have poisoned the well
and as our love is dyin theyre makin a killin
on heartaches and furniture sales

chorus
and the line between evil and good disappears
and now its so hard to tell
am i shakin a demon thats after my soul
or sendin an angel to hell

verse 3
am i right or is she right or are we both wrong
or is it even about that at all
as heaven is fadin were fightin and fussin
and the devils just havin a ball

chorus
and the line between evil and good disappears
and now its so hard to tell
am i shakin a demon thats after my soul
or sendin an angel to hellyou might also likeembed"
