outrunning karma
that boy hes such a charmer
all the bugs and their larva
follow him out to colorado
ten dozen hearts in a bag
their bodies lying
hell drag them down to colorado
a modern desperado

prechorus
and hell race for miles through the night
he runs because he knows he cannot hide

chorus
hes never gonna make it
all the poor people hes forsaken
karma is always gonna chase him for his lies
its just a game of waiting
from the church steeple down to satan
karma theres really no escape until he dies

verse 2
outrunning karma
that boy cant run no farther
its the last days of sparta
follow him down to meet apollo

and hell brace for battle in the night
hell fight because he knows he cannot hide

chorus

all the poor people hes forsaken
karma is always gonna chase him for his lies
its just a game of waiting
from the church steeple down to satan
karma theres really no escape until he dies
