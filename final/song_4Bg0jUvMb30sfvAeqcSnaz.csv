you need to drink water remember to pray
eat so youre stronger and live for the day
speak to your brother check hes ok
need to get out more dont smoke all day

chorus
i know youre sad cause someone died
but im not gonna sit inside and do nothing

verse 2
guess when im older ill be able to see
that when it gets colder i care less about me
i should sleep like i promised and brush my hair
always be honest and that would be fair

chorus
i know it’s hard to comprehend
theres so much things we have to mend
i know youre sad cause someone died
but im not gonna sit inside and do nothing

outro
guess thats what you meant
we can still be friends
im not with you but
well make it till the endyou might also like1embed"
