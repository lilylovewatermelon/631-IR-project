hold them down our bleeding suspects
just because just cause just who are you
like candle light burn burn burn baby
burn burn whose turn who gets a taste today

chorus
weve done nothing wrong
but weve done nothing
we cant look away
but were just looking
its second nature to say
hey hey hey weve done nothing wrong

verse 2
turn them off our blacklist singers
dont ask why dont cry dont make a scene
a fortyfive spin spin spin give in
spin spin who wins whos not afraid to play

chorus
weve done nothing wrong
but weve done nothing
we cant look away
but were just looking
its second nature to say
hey hey hey weve done nothing but
see jimmy eat world liveget tickets as low as 249you might also likebridge
nothing but take whats handed down
said nothing but words approved to shout
we want to know that we own the cake were eating
spit it out
out out

verse 3
hold them down burn burn
hold them down our bleeding suspects
turn them off turn turn
turn them off our blacklist singers

chorus
weve done nothing wrong
but weve done nothing
we cant look away
but were just looking
its second nature to say
hey hey hey weve done nothing wrong
