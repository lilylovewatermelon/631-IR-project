weve been sweating a whole life long just to get this right
its a work hard hit hard struggle its a sacrifice

verse 1
its time to blow it up
time to lock and load
time to take the field
time to start the show

chorus
this is our moment
this is our time
and we are not holding back
were laying it all on the line
this is our destiny
its our night to shine
this is our moment
this is our time

interlude
weve been playing guitars and banging drums since we ere boys
trying to impress pretty girls with a lot of noise

verse 2
its time to turn it up
time to rock and roll
time to take the stage
time to start the show

verse 3
its time to turn it up
time to rock and roll
time to take the field
time to start the show
