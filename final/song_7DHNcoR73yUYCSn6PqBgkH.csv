appeal from the united states district court for the middle district of tennesseemr justice brennan delivered the opinion of the courtthis civil action was brought under 42 u s c  1983 and 1988 to redress the alleged deprivation of federal constitutional rights the complaint alleging that by means of a 1901 statute of tennessee apportioning the members of the general assembly among the states 95 counties1 these plaintiffs and others similarly situated 188 are denied the equal protection of the laws accorded them by the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the united states by virtue of the debasement of their votes was dismissed by a threejudge court convened under 28 u s c  2281 in the middle district of tennessee2 the court held that it lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter and also that no claim was stated upon which relief could be granted 179 f supp 824 we noted probable jurisdiction of the appeal 364 u s 8983 we hold that the dismissal was error and remand the cause to the district court for trial and further proceedings consistent with this opinion

the general assembly of tennessee consists of the senate with 33 members and the house of representatives with 99 members the tennessee constitution provides in art ii as followssec 3 legislative authorityterm of office the legislative authority of this state shall be vested in a general assembly which shall consist of a senate and house of representatives both dependent on the people who shall hold their offices for two years from the day of the general electionsec 4 censusan enumeration of the qualified voters and an apportionment of the representatives in the general assembly shall be made in the year one thousand eight hundred and seventyone and within every subsequent term of ten yearssec 5 apportionment of representativesthe number of representatives shall at the several 189 periods of making the enumeration be apportioned among the several counties or districts according to the number of qualified voters in each and shall not exceed seventyfive until the population of the state shall be one million and a half and shall never exceed ninetynine provided that any county having twothirds of the ratio shall be entitled to one membersec 6 apportionment of senatorsthe number of senators shall at the several periods of making the enumeration be apportioned among the several counties or districts according to the number of qualified electors in each and shall not exceed onethird the number of representatives in apportioning the senators among the different counties the fraction that may be lost by any county or counties in the apportionment of members to the house of representatives shall be made up to such county or counties in the senate as near as may be practicable when a district is composed of two or more counties they shall be adjoining and no county shall be divided in forming a districtthus tennessees standard for allocating legislative representation among her counties is the total number of qualified voters resident in the respective counties subject only to minor qualifications4 decennial reapportionment 190 in compliance with the constitutional scheme was effected by the general assembly each decade from 1871 to 1901 the 1871 apportionment5 was preceded by an 1870 statute requiring an enumeration6 the 1881 apportionment involved three statutes the first authorizing an enumeration the second enlarging the senate from 25 to 191 33 members and the house from 75 to 99 members and the third apportioning the membership of both houses7 in 1891 there were both an enumeration and an apportionment8 in 1901 the general assembly abandoned separate enumeration in favor of reliance upon the federal census and passed the apportionment act here in controversy9 in the more than 60 years since that action all proposals in both houses of the general assembly for reapportionment have failed to pass10
192 between 1901 and 1961 tennessee has experienced substantial growth and redistribution of her population in 1901 the population was 2020616 of whom 487380 were eligible to vote11 the 1960 federal census reports the states population at 3567089 of whom 2092891 are eligible to vote12 the relative standings of the counties in terms of qualified voters have changed significantly it is primarily the continued application of the 1901 apportionment act to this shifted and enlarged voting population which gives rise to the present controversy

indeed the complaint alleges that the 1901 statute even as of the time of its passage made no apportionment of representatives and senators in accordance with the constitutional formula     but instead arbitrarily and capriciously apportioned representatives in the senate and house without reference    to any logical or reasonable formula whatever13 it is further alleged 193 that because of the population changes since 1900 and the failure of the legislature to reapportion itself since 1901 the 1901 statute became unconstitutional and obsolete appellants also argue that because of the composition of the legislature effected by the 1901 apportionment act redress in the form of a state constitutional amendment to change the entire mechanism for reapportioning or any other change short of that is difficult or impossible14 the complaint concludes that these plaintiffs 194 and others similarly situated are denied the equal protection of the laws accorded them by the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the united states by virtue of the debasement of their votes15 they seek a 195 declaration that the 1901 statute is unconstitutional and an injunction restraining the appellees from acting to conduct any further elections under it they also pray that unless and until the general assembly enacts a valid reapportionment the district court should either decree a reapportionment by mathematical application of the tennessee constitutional formulae to the most recent federal census figures or direct the appellees to conduct legislative elections primary and general at large they also pray for such other and further relief as may be appropriateithe district courts opinion and order of dismissalbecause we deal with this case on appeal from an order of dismissal granted on appellees motions precise identification 196 of the issues presently confronting us demands clear exposition of the grounds upon which the district court rested in dismissing the case the dismissal order recited that the court sustained the appellees grounds 1 that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter and 2 that the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted    

in the setting of a case such as this the recited grounds embrace two possible reasons for dismissal

first that the facts and injury alleged the legal bases invoked as creating the rights and duties relied upon and the relief sought fail to come within that language of article iii of the constitution and of the jurisdictional statutes which define those matters concerning which united states district courts are empowered to act

second that although the matter is cognizable and facts are alleged which establish infringement of appellants rights as a result of state legislative action departing from a federal constitutional standard the court will not proceed because the matter is considered unsuited to judicial inquiry or adjustment

we treat the first ground of dismissal as lack of jurisdiction of the subject matter the second we consider to result in a failure to state a justiciable cause of action

the district courts dismissal order recited that it was issued in conformity with the courts per curiam opinion the opinion reveals that the court rested its dismissal upon lack of subjectmatter jurisdiction and lack of a justiciable cause of action without attempting to distinguish between these grounds after noting that the plaintiffs challenged the existing legislative apportionment in tennessee under the due process and equal protection clauses and summarizing the supporting allegations and the relief requested the court stated thatthe action is presently before the court upon the defendants motion to dismiss predicated upon three 197 grounds first that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter second that the complaints fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and third that indispensable party defendants are not before the court 179 f supp at 826the court proceeded to explain its action as turning on the cases presenting a question of the distribution of political strength for legislative purposes forfrom a review of numerous supreme court    decisions there can be no doubt that the federal rule as enunciated and applied by the supreme court is that the federal courts whether from a lack of jurisdiction or from the inappropriateness of the subject matter for judicial consideration will not intervene in cases of this type to compel legislative reapportionment 179 f supp at 826the court went on to express doubts as to the feasibility of the various possible remedies sought by the plaintiffs 179 f supp at 827828 then it made clear that its dismissal reflected a view not of doubt that violation of constitutional rights was alleged but of a courts impotence to correct that violationwith the plaintiffs argument that the legislature of tennessee is guilty of a clear violation of the state constitution and of the rights of the plaintiffs the court entirely agrees it also agrees that the evil is a serious one which should be corrected without further delay but even so the remedy in this situation clearly does not lie with the courts it has long been recognized and is accepted doctrine that there are indeed some rights guaranteed by the constitution for the violation of which the courts cannot give redress 179 f supp at 828in light of the district courts treatment of the case we hold today only a that the court possessed jurisdiction of the subject matter b that a justiciable cause of 198 action is stated upon which appellants would be entitled to appropriate relief and c because appellees raise the issue before this court that the appellants have standing to challenge the tennessee apportionment statutes16 beyond noting that we have no cause at this stage to doubt the district court will be able to fashion relief if violations of constitutional rights are found it is improper now to consider what remedy would be most appropriate if appellants prevail at the trialiijurisdiction of the subject matterthe district court was uncertain whether our cases withholding federal judicial relief rested upon a lack of federal jurisdiction or upon the inappropriateness of the subject matter for judicial considerationwhat we have designated nonjusticiability the distinction between the two grounds is significant in the instance of nonjusticiability consideration of the cause is not wholly and immediately foreclosed rather the courts inquiry necessarily proceeds to the point of deciding whether the duty asserted can be judicially identified and its breach judicially determined and whether protection for the right asserted can be judicially molded in the instance of lack of jurisdiction the cause either does not arise under the federal constitution laws or treaties or fall within one of the other enumerated categories of art iii  2 or is not a case or controversy within the meaning of that section or the cause is not one described by any jurisdictional statute our conclusion see pp 208237 infra that this cause presents no nonjusticiable political question settles the only possible doubt that it is a case or controversy under the present heading of jurisdiction 199 of the subject matter we hold only that the matter set forth in the complaint does arise under the constitution and is within 28 u s c  1343
article iii  2 of the federal constitution provides that the judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and equity arising under this constitution the laws of the united states and treaties made or which shall be made under their authority     it is clear that the cause of action is one which arises under the federal constitution the complaint alleges that the 1901 statute effects an apportionment that deprives the appellants of the equal protection of the laws in violation of the fourteenth amendment dismissal of the complaint upon the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the subject matter would therefore be justified only if that claim were so attenuated and unsubstantial as to be absolutely devoid of merit newburyport water co v newburyport 193 u s 561 579 or frivolous bell v hood 327 u s 678 68317 that the claim is unsubstantial must be very plain hart v keith vaudeville exchange 262 u s 271 274 since the district court obviously and correctly did not deem the asserted federal constitutional claim unsubstantial and frivolous it should not have dismissed the complaint for want of jurisdiction of the subject matter and of course no further consideration of the merits of the claim is relevant to a determination of the courts jurisdiction of the subject matter we said in an earlier voting case from tennessee it is obvious    that the court in dismissing for want of jurisdiction was controlled by what it deemed to be the want of merit in the averments which were made in the complaint as to the violation of the federal right but as the very nature of the controversy was federal and therefore 200 jurisdiction existed whilst the opinion of the court as to the want of merit in the cause of action might have furnished ground for dismissing for that reason it afforded no sufficient ground for deciding that the action was not one arising under the constitution and laws of the united states swafford v templeton 185 u s 487 493 for it is well settled that the failure to state a proper cause of action calls for a judgment on the merits and not for a dismissal for want of jurisdiction bell v hood 327 u s 678 682 see also binderup v pathe exchange 263 u s 291 305308

since the complaint plainly sets forth a case arising under the constitution the subject matter is within the federal judicial power defined in art iii  2 and so within the power of congress to assign to the jurisdiction of the district courts congress has exercised that power in 28 u s c  1343 3the district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action authorized by law18 to be commenced by any person    to redress the deprivation under color of any state law statute ordinance regulation custom or usage of any right privilege or immunity secured by the constitution of the united states    19201 an unbroken line of our precedents sustains the federal courts jurisdiction of the subject matter of federal constitutional claims of this nature the first cases involved the redistricting of states for the purpose of electing representatives to the federal congress when the ohio supreme court sustained ohio legislation against an attack for repugnancy to art i  4 of the federal constitution we affirmed on the merits and expressly refused to dismiss for want of jurisdiction in view    of the subjectmatter of the controversy and the federal characteristics which inhere in it     ohio ex rel davis v hildebrant 241 u s 565 570 when the minnesota supreme court affirmed the dismissal of a suit to enjoin the secretary of state of minnesota from acting under minnesota redistricting legislation we reviewed the constitutional merits of the legislation and reversed the state supreme court smiley v holm 285 u s 355 and see companion cases from the new york court of appeals and the missouri supreme court koenig v flynn 285 u s 375 carroll v becker 285 u s 380 when a threejudge district court exercising jurisdiction under the predecessor of 28 u s c  1343 3 permanently enjoined officers of the state of mississippi from conducting an election of representatives under a mississippi redistricting act we reviewed the federal questions on the merits and reversed the district court wood v broom 287 u s 1 reversing 1 f supp 134 a similar decree of a district court exercising jurisdiction under the same statute concerning a kentucky redistricting act was 202 reviewed and the decree reversed mahan v hume 287 u s 575 reversing 1 f supp 14220

the appellees refer to colegrove v green 328 u s 549 as authority that the district court lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter appellees misconceive the holding of that case the holding was precisely contrary to their reading of it seven members of the court participated in the decision unlike many other cases in this field which have assumed without discussion that there was jurisdiction all three opinions filed in colegrove discussed the question two of the opinions expressing the views of four of the justices a majority flatly held that there was jurisdiction of the subject matter mr justice black joined by mr justice douglas and mr justice murphy stated it is my judgment that the district court had jurisdiction     citing the predecessor of 28 u s c  1343 3 and bell v hood supra 328 u s at 568 mr justice rutledge writing separately expressed agreement with this conclusion 328 u s at 564 565 n 2 indeed it is even questionable that the opinion of mr justice frankfurter joined by justices reed and burton doubted jurisdiction of the subject matter such doubt would have been inconsistent with the professed willingness to turn the decision on either the majority or concurring views in wood v broom supra 328 u s at 551

several subsequent cases similar to colegrove have been decided by the court in summary per curiam statements none was dismissed for want of jurisdiction of the subject matter cook v fortson 329 u s 675 turman v 203 duckworth ibid colegrove v barrett 330 u s 80421tedesco v board of supervisors 339 u s 940 remmey v smith 342 u s 916 cox v peters 342 u s 936 anderson v jordan 343 u s 912 kidd v mccanless 352 u s 920 radford v gary 352 u s 991 hartsfield v sloan 357 u s 916 matthews v handley 361 u s 12722

two cases decided with opinions after colegrove likewise plainly imply that the subject matter of this suit is within district court jurisdiction in macdougall v green 335 u s 281 the district court dismissed for want of jurisdiction which had been invoked under 28 u s c  1343 3 a suit to enjoin enforcement of the requirement that nominees for statewide elections be supported by a petition signed by a minimum number of persons from at least 50 of the states 102 counties this courts disagreement with that action is clear since the court affirmed the judgment after a review of the merits and concluded that the particular claim there was without merit in south v peters 339 u s 276 we affirmed the dismissal of an attack on the georgia county unit system but founded our action on a ground that plainly would not have been reached if the lower court lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter which allegedy existed under 28 u s c  1343 3 the express words of our holding were that federal courts consistently refuse to exercise their equity powers in cases posing 204 political issues arising from a states geographical distribution of electoral strength among its political subdivisions 339 u s at 277

we hold that the district court has jurisdiction of the subject matter of the federal constitutional claim asserted in the complaintiiistandinga federal court cannot pronounce any statute either of a state or of the united states void because irreconcilable with the constitution except as it is called upon to adjudge the legal rights of litigants in actual controversies liverpool steamship co v commissioners of emigration 113 u s 33 39 have the appellants alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions this is the gist of the question of standing it is of course a question of federal law

the complaint was filed by residents of davidson hamilton knox montgomery and shelby counties each is a person allegedly qualified to vote for members of the general assembly representing his county23 these appellants sued on their own behalf and on behalf of all qualified voters of their respective counties and further on behalf of all voters of the state of tennessee who 205 are similarly situated    24 the appellees are the tennessee secretary of state attorney general coordinator of elections and members of the state board of elections the members of the state board are sued in their own right and also as representatives of the county election commissioners whom they appoint25
206 we hold that the appellants do have standing to maintain this suit our decisions plainly support this conclusion many of the cases have assumed rather than articulated the premise in deciding the merits of similar claims26 and colegrove v green supra squarely held that voters who allege facts showing disadvantage to themselves as individuals have standing to sue27 a number 207 of cases decided after colegrove recognized the standing of the voters there involved to bring those actions28

these appellants seek relief in order to protect or vindicate an interest of their own and of those similarly situated their constitutional claim is in substance that the 1901 statute constitutes arbitrary and capricious state action offensive to the fourteenth amendment in its irrational disregard of the standard of apportionment prescribed by the states constitution or of any standard effecting a gross disproportion of representation to voting population the injury which appellants assert is that this classification disfavors the voters in the counties in which they reside placing them in a position of constitutionally unjustifiable inequality visavis voters 208 in irrationally favored counties a citizens right to a vote free of arbitrary impairment by state action has been judicially recognized as a right secured by the constitution when such impairment resulted from dilution by a false tally cf united states v classic 313 u s 299 or by a refusal to count votes from arbitrarily selected precincts cf united states v mosley 238 u s 383 or by a stuffing of the ballot box cf ex parte siebold 100 u s 371 united states v saylor 322 u s 385

it would not be necessary to decide whether appellants allegations of impairment of their votes by the 1901 apportionment will ultimately entitle them to any relief in order to hold that they have standing to seek it if such impairment does produce a legally cognizable injury they are among those who have sustained it they are asserting a plain direct and adequate interest in maintaining the effectiveness of their votes coleman v miller 307 u s at 438 not merely a claim of the right possessed by every citizen to require that the government be administered according to law     fairchild v hughes 258 u s 126 129 compare leser v garnett 258 u s 130 they are entitled to a hearing and to the district courts decision on their claims the very essence of civil liberty certainly consists in the right of every individual to claim the protection of the laws whenever he receives an injury marbury v madison 1 cranch 137 163ivjusticiabilityin holding that the subject matter of this suit was not justiciable the district court relied on colegrove v green supra and subsequent per curiam cases29 the 209 court stated from a review of these decisions there can be no doubt that the federal rule    is that the federal courts    will not intervene in cases of this type to compel legislative reapportionment 179 f supp at 826 we understand the district court to have read the cited cases as compelling the conclusion that since the appellants sought to have a legislative apportionment held unconstitutional their suit presented a political question and was therefore nonjusticiable we hold that this challenge to an apportionment presents no nonjusticiable political question the cited cases do not hold the contrary

of course the mere fact that the suit seeks protection of a political right does not mean it presents a political question such an objection is little more than a play upon words nixon v herndon 273 u s 536 540 rather it is argued that apportionment cases whatever the actual wording of the complaint can involve no federal constitutional right except one resting on the guaranty of a republican form of government30 and that complaints based on that clause have been held to present political questions which are nonjusticiable

we hold that the claim pleaded here neither rests upon nor implicates the guaranty clause and that its justiciability is therefore not foreclosed by our decisions of cases involving that clause the district court misinterpreted colegrove v green and other decisions of this court on which it relied appellants claim that they are being denied equal protection is justiciable and if 210 discrimination is sufficiently shown the right to relief under the equal protection clause is not diminished by the fact that the discrimination relates to political rights snowden v hughes 321 u s 1 11 to show why we reject the argument based on the guaranty clause we must examine the authorities under it but because there appears to be some uncertainty as to why those cases did present political questions and specifically as to whether this apportionment case is like those cases we deem it necessary first to consider the contours of the political question doctrine

our discussion even at the price of extending this opinion requires review of a number of political question cases in order to expose the attributes of the doctrine attributes which in various settings diverge combine appear and disappear in seeming disorderliness since that review is undertaken solely to demonstrate that neither singly nor collectively do these cases support a conclusion that this apportionment case is nonjusticiable we of course do not explore their implications in other contexts that review reveals that in the guaranty clause cases and in the other political question cases it is the relationship between the judiciary and the coordinate branches of the federal government and not the federal judiciarys relationship to the states which gives rise to the political question
we have said that in determining whether a question falls within the political question category the approriateness under our system of government of attributing finality to the action of the political departments and also the lack of satisfactory criteria for a judicial determination are dominant considerations coleman v miller 307 u s 433 454455 the nonjusticiability of a political question is primarily a function of the separation of powers much confusion results from the capacity of the political question label to obscure the need for 211 casebycase inquiry deciding whether a matter has in any measure been committed by the constitution to another branch of government or whether the action of that branch exceeds whatever authority has been committed is itself a delicate exercise in constitutional interpretation and is a responsibility of this court as ultimate interpreter of the constitution to demonstrate this requires no less than to analyze representative cases and to infer from them the analytical threads that make up the political question doctrine we shall then show that none of those threads catches this case

foreign relations there are sweeping statements to the effect that all questions touching foreign relations are political questions31 not only does resolution of such issues frequently turn on standards that defy judicial application or involve the exercise of a discretion demonstrably committed to the executive or legislature32 but many such questions uniquely demand singlevoiced statement of the governments views33 yet it is error to suppose that every case or controversy which touches foreign relations lies beyond judicial cognizance our cases in this field seem invariably to show a discriminating analysis of the particular question posed in terms of the history of its management by the political branches of its susceptibility to judicial handling in the light of its nature and posture in the specific case and of the possible consequences 212 of judicial action for example though a court will not ordinarily inquire whether a treaty has been terminated since on that question governmental action    must be regarded as of controlling importance if there has been no conclusive governmental action then a court can construe a treaty and may find it provides the answer compare terlinden v ames 184 u s 270 285 with society for the propagation of the gospel in foreign parts v new haven 8 wheat 464 49249534 though a court will not undertake to construe a treaty in a manner inconsistent with a subsequent federal statute no similar hesitancy obtains if the asserted clash is with state law compare whitney v robertson 124 u s 190 with kolovrat v oregon 366 u s 187

while recognition of foreign governments so strongly defies judicial treatment that without executive recognition a foreign state has been called a republic of whose existence we know nothing35 and the judiciary ordinarily follows the executive as to which nation has sovereignty over disputed territory36 once sovereignty over an area is politically determined and declared courts may examine the resulting status and decide independently whether a statute applies to that area37 similarly recognition of belligerency abroad is an executive responsibility but if the executive proclamations fall short of an explicit answer a court may construe them seeking for example to determine whether the situation is such that statutes designed to assure american neutrality have 213 become operative the three friends 166 u s 1 63 66 still again though it is the executive that determines a persons status as representative of a foreign government ex parte hitz 111 u s 766 the executives statements will be construed where necessary to determine the courts jurisdiction in re baiz 135 u s 403 similar judicial action in the absence of a recognizedly authoritative executive declaration occurs in cases involving the immunity from seizure of vessels owned by friendly foreign governments compare ex parte peru 318 u s 578 with mexico v hoffman 324 u s 30 3435

dates of duration of hostilities though it has been stated broadly that the power which declared the necessity is the power to declare its cessation and what the cessation requires commercial trust co v miller 262 u s 51 57 here too analysis reveals isolable reasons for the presence of political questions underlying this courts refusal to review the political departments determination of when or whether a war has ended dominant is the need for finality in the political determination for emergencys nature demands a prompt and unhesitating obedience martin v mott 12 wheat 19 30 calling up of militia moreover the cessation of hostilities does not necessarily end the war power it was stated in hamilton v kentucky distilleries  w co 251 u s 146 161 that the war power includes the power to remedy the evils which have arisen from its rise and progress and continues during that emergency stewart v kahn 11 wall 493 507 fleming v mohawk wrecking co 331 u s 111 116 but deference rests on reason not habit38 the question in a particular case may not seriously implicate considerations of finalitye g a public program of importance 214 rent control yet not central to the emergency effort39 further clearly definable criteria for decision may be available in such case the political question barrier falls away a court is not at liberty to shut its eyes to an obvious mistake when the validity of the law depends upon the truth of what is declared    it can inquire whether the exigency still existed upon which the continued operation of the law depended chastleton corp v sinclair 264 u s 543 54754840 compare woods v miller co 333 u s 138 on the other hand even in private litigation which directly implicates no feature of separation of powers lack of judicially discoverable standards and the drive for evenhanded application may impel reference to the political departments determination of dates of hostilities beginning and ending the protector 12 wall 700

validity of enactments in coleman v miller supra this court held that the questions of how long a proposed amendment to the federal constitution remained open to ratification and what effect a prior rejection had on a subsequent ratification were committed to congressional resolution and involved criteria of decision that necessarily escaped the judicial grasp41 similar considerations apply to the enacting process the respect due to coequal and independent departments and the need for finality and certainty about the status of a statute contribute to judicial reluctance to inquire whether as passed it complied with all requisite formalities field v clark 143 u s 649 672 676677 see leser v garnett 258 u s 130 137 but it is not true that courts will never delve 215 into a legislatures records upon such a quest if the enrolled statute lacks an effective date a court will not hesitate to seek it in the legislative journals in order to preserve the enactment gardner v the collector 6 wall 499 the political question doctrine a tool for maintenance of governmental order will not be so applied as to promote only disorder

the status of indian tribes this courts deference to the political departments in determining whether indians are recognized as a tribe while it reflects familiar attributes of political questions42united states v holliday 3 wall 407 419 also has a unique element in that the relation of the indians to the united states is marked by peculiar and cardinal distinctions which exist no where else    the indians are domestic dependent nations    in a state of pupilage their relation to the united states resembles that of a ward to his guardian the cherokee nation v georgia 5 pet 1 16 1743 yet here too there is no blanket rule while 216  it is for congress     and not for the courts to determine when the true interests of the indian require his release from the condition of tutelage     it is not meant by this that congress may bring a community or body of people within the range of this power by arbitrarily calling them an indian tribe     united states v sandoval 231 u s 28 46 able to discern what is distinctly indian ibid the courts will strike down 217 any heedless extension of that label they will not stand impotent before an obvious instance of a manifestly unauthorized exercise of power

it is apparent that several formulations which vary slightly according to the settings in which the questions arise may describe a political question although each has one or more elements which identify it as essentially a function of the separation of powers prominent on the surface of any case held to involve a political question is found a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it or the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion or the impossibility of a courts undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government or an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question

unless one of these formulations is inextricable from the case at bar there should be no dismissal for nonjusticiability on the ground of a political questions presence the doctrine of which we treat is one of political questions not one of political cases the courts cannot reject as no law suit a bona fide controversy as to whether some action denominated political exceeds constitutional authority the cases we have reviewed show the necessity for discriminating inquiry into the precise facts and posture of the particular case and the impossibility of resolution by any semantic cataloguing

but it is argued that this case shares the characteristics of decisions that constitute a category not yet considered cases concerning the constitutions guaranty in art iv 218  4 of a republican form of government a conclusion as to whether the case at bar does present a political question cannot be confidently reached until we have considered those cases with special care we shall discover that guaranty clause claims involve those elements which define a political question and for that reason and no other they are nonjusticiable in particular we shall discover that the nonjusticiability of such claims has nothing to do with their touching upon matters of state governmental organization

republican form of government luther v borden 7 how 1 though in form simply an action for damages for trespass was as daniel webster said in opening the argument for the defense an unusual case44 the defendants admitting an otherwise tortious breaking and entering sought to justify their action on the ground that they were agents of the established lawful government of rhode island which state was then under martial law to defend itself from active insurrection that the plaintiff was engaged in that insurrection and that they entered under orders to arrest the plaintiff the case arose out of the unfortunate political differences which agitated the people of rhode island in 1841 and 1842 7 how at 34 and which had resulted in a situation wherein two groups laid competing claims to recognition as the lawful government45 the plaintiffs right to 219 recover depended upon which of the two groups was entitled to such recognition but the lower courts refusal to receive evidence or hear argument on that issue its charge to the jury that the earlier established or charter government was lawful and the verdict for the defendants were affirmed upon appeal to this court

chief justice taneys opinion for the court reasoned as follows 1 if a court were to hold the defendants acts unjustified because the charter government had no legal existence during the period in question it would follow that all of that governments actionslaws enacted taxes collected salaries paid accounts settled sentences passedwere of no effect and that the officers who carried their decisions into operation were answerable as trespassers if not in some cases as criminals46 there was of course no room for application of any doctrine of de facto status to uphold prior acts of an officer not authorized de jure for such would have defeated the plaintiffs very action a decision for the plaintiff would inevitably have produced some significant measure of chaos a consequence to be avoided if it could be done without abnegation of the judicial duty to uphold the constitution

2 no state court had recognized as a judicial responsibility settlement of the issue of the locus of state governmental authority indeed the courts of rhode island had in several cases held that it rested with the political power to decide whether the charter government had been displaced or not and that that department had acknowledged no change

220 3 since the question relates altogether to the constitution and laws of the    state the courts of the united states had to follow the state courts decisions unless there was a federal constitutional ground for overturning them47
4 no provision of the constitution could be or had been invoked for this purpose except art iv  4 the guaranty clause having already noted the absence of standards whereby the choice between governments could be made by a court acting independently chief justice taney now found further textual and practical reasons for concluding that if any department of the united states was empowered by the guaranty clause to resolve the issue it was not the judiciaryunder this article of the constitution it rests with congress to decide what government is the established one in a state for as the united states guarantee to each state a republican government congress must necessarily decide what government is established in the state before it can determine whether it is republican or not and when the senators and representatives of a state are admitted into the councils of the union the authority of the government under which they are appointed as well as its republican character is recognized by the proper constitutional authority and its decision is binding on every other department of the government and could not be questioned in a judicial tribunal it is true that the contest in this case did not last long enough to bring the matter to this issue and    congress was not called upon to decide the controversy yet the right to decide is placed there and not in the courts221 so too as relates to the clause in the abovementioned article of the constitution providing for cases of domestic violence it rested with congress too to determine upon the means proper to be adopted to fulfill this guarantee    by the act of february 28 1795 congress provided that in case of an insurrection in any state against the government thereof it shall be lawful for the president of the united states on application of the legislature of such state or of the executive when the legislature cannot be convened to call forth such number of the militia of any other state or states as may be applied for as he may judge sufficient to suppress such insurrectionby this act the power of deciding whether the exigency had arisen upon which the government of the united states is bound to interfere is given to the president   after the president has acted and called out the militia is a circuit court of the united states authorized to inquire whether his decision was right    if the judicial power extends so far the guarantee contained in the constitution of the united states is a guarantee of anarchy and not of order   it is true that in this case the militia were not called out by the president but upon the application of the governor under the charter government the president recognized him as the executive power of the state and took measures to call out the militia to support his authority if it should be found necessary for the general government to interfere     certainly no court of the united states with a knowledge of this decision would have been justified in recognizing the opposing party as the lawful government 222    in the case of foreign nations the government acknowledged by the president is always recognized in the courts of justice    7 how at 4244clearly several factors were thought by the court in luther to make the question there political the commitment to the other branches of the decision as to which is the lawful state government the unambiguous action by the president in recognizing the charter government as the lawful authority the need for finality in the executives decision and the lack of criteria by which a court could determine which form of government was republican48
223 but the only significance that luther could have for our immediate purposes is in its holding that the guaranty clause is not a repository of judicially manageable standards which a court could utilize independently in order to identify a states lawful government the court has since refused to resort to the guaranty clausewhich alone had been invoked for the purposeas the source of a constitutional standard for invalidating state action see taylor  marshall v beckham no 1 178 u s 548 claim that kentuckys resolution of contested gubernatorial election deprived voters of republican government held nonjusticiable pacific states tel co v oregon 223 u s 118 claim that initiative and referendum negated republican government held nonjusticiable kiernan v portland 223 u s 151 claim that municipal charter amendment per municipal initiative and referendum negated republican government held nonjusticiable 224 marshall v dye 231 u s 250 claim that indianas constitutional amendment procedure negated republican government held nonjusticiable oneill v leamer 239 u s 244 claim that delegation to court of power to form drainage districts negated republican government held futile ohio ex rel davis v hildebrant 241 u s 565 claim that invalidation of state reapportionment statute per referendum negates republican government held nonjusticiable49mountain timber co v washington 243 u s 219 claim that workmens compensation violates republican government held nonjusticiable ohio ex rel bryant v akron metropolitan park district 281 u s 74 claim that rule requiring invalidation of statute by all but one justice of state court negated republican government held nonjusticiable highland farms dairy v agnew 300 u s 608 claim that delegation to agency of power to control milk prices violated republican government rejected

just as the court has consistently held that a challenge to state action based on the guaranty clause presents no justiciable question so has it held and for the same reasons that challenges to congressional action on the ground of inconsistency with that clause present no justiciable question in georgia v stanton 6 wall 50 the state sought by an original bill to enjoin execution of the reconstruction acts claiming that it already possessed a republican state in every political legal constitutional and juridical sense and that enforcement of the new acts instead of keeping the guaranty against a forcible overthrow of its government by foreign invaders or domestic insurgents    is destroying that very government by force50 congress had clearly refused to 225 recognize the republican character of the government of the suing state51 it seemed to the court that the only constitutional claim that could be presented was under the guaranty clause and congress having determined that the effects of the recent hostilities required extraordinary measures to restore governments of a republican form this court refused to interfere with congress action at the behest of a claimant relying on that very guaranty52

in only a few other cases has the court considered art iv  4 in relation to congressional action it has refused to pass on a claim relying on the guaranty clause to establish that congress lacked power to allow the states to employ the referendum in passing on legislation redistricting for congressional seats ohio ex rel davis v hildebrant supra and it has pointed out that congress is not required to establish republican government in the territories before they become states and before they have attained a sufficient population to warrant a 226 popularly elected legislature downes v bidwell 182 u s 244 278279 dictum53

we come finally to the ultimate inquiry whether our precedents as to what constitutes a nonjusticiable political question bring the case before us under the umbrella of that doctrine a natural beginning is to note whether any of the common characteristics which we have been able to identify and label descriptively are present we find none the question here is the consistency of state action with the federal constitution we have no question decided or to be decided by a political branch of government coequal with this court nor do we risk embarrassment of our government abroad or grave disturbance at home54 if we take issue with tennessee as to the constitutionality of her action here challenged nor need the appellants in order to succeed in this action ask the court to enter upon policy determinations for which judicially manageable standards are lacking judicial standards under the equal protection clause are well developed and familiar and it has been open to courts since the enactment of the fourteenth amendment to determine if on the particular facts they must that a discrimination reflects no policy but simply arbitrary and capricious action

this case does in one sense involve the allocation of political power within a state and the appellants 227 might conceivably have added a claim under the guaranty clause of course as we have seen any reliance on that clause would be futile but because any reliance on the guaranty clause could not have succeeded it does not follow that appellants may not be heard on the equal protection claim which in fact they tender true it must be clear that the fourteenth amendment claim is not so enmeshed with those political question elements which render guaranty clause claims nonjusticiable as actually to present a political question itself but we have found that not to be the case here

in this connection special attention is due pacific states tel co v oregon 223 u s 118 in that case a corporation tax statute enacted by the initiative was attacked ostensibly on three grounds 1 due process 2 equal protection and 3 the guaranty clause but it was clear that the first two grounds were invoked solely in aid of the contention that the tax was invalid by reason of its passagethe defendant company does not contend here that it could not have been required to pay a license tax it does not assert that it was denied an opportunity to be heard as to the amount for which it was taxed or that there was anything inhering in the tax or involved intrinsically in the law which violated any of its constitutional rights if such questions had been raised they would have been justiciable and therefore would have required the calling into operation of judicial power instead however of doing any of these things the attack on the statute here made is of a wholly different character its essentially political nature is at once made manifest by understanding that the assault which the contention here advanced makes it sic not on the tax as a tax but on the state as a state it is addressed to the 228 framework and political character of the government by which the statute levying the tax was passed it is the government the political entity which reducing the case to its essence is called to the bar of this court not for the purpose of testing judicially some exercise of power assailed on the ground that its exertion has injuriously affected the rights of an individual because of repugnancy to some constitutional limitation but to demand of the state that it establish its right to exist as a state republican in form 223 u s at 150151the due process and equal protection claims were held nonjusticiable in pacific states not because they happened to be joined with a guaranty clause claim or because they sought to place before the court a subject matter which might conceivably have been dealt with through the guaranty clause but because the court believed that they were invoked merely in verbal aid of the resolution of issues which in its view entailed political questions pacific states may be compared with cases such as mountain timber co v washington 243 u s 219 wherein the court refused to consider whether a workmens compensation act violated the guaranty clause but considered at length and rejected due process and equal protection arguments advanced against it and oneill v leamer 239 u s 244 wherein the court refused to consider whether nebraskas delegation of power to form drainage districts violated the guaranty clause but went on to consider and reject the contention that the action against which an injunction was sought was not a taking for a public purpose

we conclude then that the nonjusticiability of claims resting on the guaranty clause which arises from their embodiment of questions that were thought political can have no bearing upon the justiciability of the equal protection claim presented in this case finally we 229 emphasize that it is the involvement in guaranty clause claims of the elements thought to define political questions and no other feature which could render them nonjusticiable specifically we have said that such claims are not held nonjusticiable because they touch matters of state governmental organization brief examination of a few cases demonstrates this

when challenges to state action respecting matters of the administration of the affairs of the state and the officers through whom they are conducted55 have rested on claims of constitutional deprivation which are amenable to judicial correction this court has acted upon its view of the merits of the claim for example in boyd v nebraska ex rel thayer 143 u s 135 we reversed the nebraska supreme courts decision that nebraskas governor was not a citizen of the united states or of the state and therefore could not continue in office in kennard v louisiana ex rel morgan 92 u s 480 and foster v kansas ex rel johnston 112 u s 201 we considered whether persons had been removed from public office by procedures consistent with the fourteenth amendments due process guaranty and held on the merits that they had and only last term in gomillion v lightfoot 364 u s 339 we applied the fifteenth amendment to strike down a redrafting of municipal boundaries which effected a discriminatory impairment of voting rights in the face of what a majority of the court of appeals thought to be a sweeping commitment to state legislatures of the power to draw and redraw such boundaries56
gomillion was brought by a negro who had been a resident of the city of tuskegee alabama until the municipal boundaries were so recast by the state legislature 230 as to exclude practically all negroes the plaintiff claimed deprivation of the right to vote in municipal elections the district courts dismissal for want of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted was affirmed by the court of appeals this court unanimously reversed this courts answer to the argument that states enjoyed unrestricted control over municipal boundaries waslegislative control of municipalities no less than other state power lies within the scope of relevant limitations imposed by the united states constitution   the opposite conclusion urged upon us by respondents would sanction the achievement by a state of any impairment of voting rights whatever so long as it was cloaked in the garb of the realignment of political subdivisions it is inconceivable that guaranties embedded in the constitution of the united states may thus be manipulated out of existence  364 u s at 344345to a second argument that colegrove v green supra was a barrier to hearing the merits of the case the court responded that gomillion was lifted out of the socalled political arena and into the conventional sphere of constitutional litigation because here was discriminatory treatment of a racial minority violating the fifteenth amendmenta statute which is alleged to have worked unconstitutional deprivations of petitioners rights is not immune to attack simply because the mechanism employed by the legislature is a redefinition of municipal boundaries    while in form this is merely an act redefining metes and bounds if the allegations are established the inescapable human effect of this essay in geometry and geography is to despoil colored citizens and only colored citizens of 231 their theretofore enjoyed voting rights that was not colegrove v greenwhen a state exercises power wholly within the domain of state interest it is insulated from federal judicial review but such insulation is not carried over when state power is used as an instrument for circumventing a federally protected right 364 u s at 34757we have not overlooked such cases as in re sawyer 124 u s 200 and walton v house of representatives 265 u s 487 which held that federal equity power could not be exercised to enjoin a state proceeding to remove a public officer but these decisions explicitly reflect only a traditional limit upon equity jurisdiction and not upon federal courts power to inquire into matters of state governmental organization this is clear not only from the opinions in those cases but also from white v berry 171 u s 366 which relying on sawyer withheld federal equity from staying removal of a federal officer wilson v north carolina 169 u s 586 simply dismissed an appeal from an unsuccessful suit to upset a states removal procedure on the ground that the constitutional claim presentedthat a jury trial was necessary if the removal procedure was to comport with due process requirementswas frivolous finally in taylor and marshall v beckham no 1 178 u s 548 where losing candidates attacked the constitutionality of kentuckys resolution of a contested gubernatorial election the court refused to consider the merits of a claim posited upon 232 the guaranty clause holding it presented a political question but also held on the merits that the ousted candidates had suffered no deprivation of property without due process of law58

since as has been established the equal protection claim tendered in this case does not require decision of any political question and since the presence of a matter affecting state government does not render the case nonjusticiable it seems appropriate to examine again the reasoning by which the district court reached its conclusion that the case was nonjusticiable

we have already noted that the district courts holding that the subject matter of this complaint was nonjusticiable relied upon colegrove v green supra and later cases some of those concerned the choice of members of a state legislature as in this case others like colegrove itself and earlier precedents smiley v holm 285 u s 355 koenig v flynn 285 u s 375 and carroll v becker 285 u s 380 concerned the choice of representatives in the federal congress smiley koenig and carroll settled the issue in favor of justiciability of questions of congressional redistricting the court followed these precedents in colegrove although over the dissent of three of the seven justices who participated in that decision on the issue of justiciability all four justices comprising a majority relied upon smiley v holm but in two opinions one for three justices 328 u s at 566 568 and a separate one by mr justice rutledge 328 u s at 564 the argument that congressional redistricting problems presented a political question the resolution of which was confided to congress might have been rested upon art i  4 art i  5 art i  2 and amendment 233 xiv  2 mr justice rutledge said but for the ruling in smiley v holm 285 u s 355 i should have supposed that the provisions of the constitution art i  4 that the times places and manner of holding elections for    representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof but the congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations    art i  2 but see amendment xiv  2 vesting in congress the duty of apportionment of representatives among the several states according to their respective numbers and art i  5 making each house the sole judge of the qualifications of its own members would remove the issues in this case from justiciable cognizance but in my judgment the smiley case rules squarely to the contrary save only in the matter of degree    assuming that that decision is to stand i think    that its effect is to rule that this court has power to afford relief in a case of this type as against the objection that the issues are not justiciable 328 u s at 564565 accordingly mr justice rutledge joined in the conclusion that the case was justiciable although he held that the dismissal of the complaint should be affirmed his view was that the shortness of the time remaining before forthcoming elections makes it doubtful whether action could or would be taken in time to secure for petitioners the effective relief they seek    i think therefore the case is one in which the court may properly and should decline to exercise its jurisdiction accordingly the judgment should be affirmed and i join in that disposition of the cause 328 u s at 56556659
234 article i  2 4 and 5 and amendment xiv  2 relate only to congressional elections and obviously do not govern apportionment of state legislatures however our decisions in favor of justiciability even in light of those provisions plainly afford no support for the district courts conclusion that the subject matter of this controversy presents a political question indeed the refusal to award relief in colegrove resulted only from the controlling view of a want of equity nor is anything contrary to be found in those per curiams that came after colegrove this court dismissed the appeals in cook v fortson and turman v duckworth 329 u s 675 as moot macdougall v green 335 u s 281 held only that in that case equity would not act to void the states requirement that there be at least a minimum of support for nominees 235 for statewide office over at least a minimal area of the state problems of timing were critical in remmey v smith 342 u s 916 dismissing for want of a substantial federal question a threejudge courts dismissal of the suit as prematurely brought 102 f supp 708 and in hartsfield v sloan 357 u s 916 denying mandamus sought to compel the convening of a threejudge court movants urged the court to advance consideration of their case inasmuch as the mere lapse of time before this case can be reached in the normal course of    business may defeat the cause and inasmuch as the time problem is due to the inherent nature of the case     south v peters 339 u s 276 like colegrove appears to be a refusal to exercise equitys powers see the statement of the holding quoted supra p 203 and cox v peters 342 u s 936 dismissed for want of a substantial federal question the appeal from the state courts holding that their primary elections implicated no state action see 208 ga 498 67 s e 2d 579 but compare terry v adams 345 u s 461

tedesco v board of supervisors 339 u s 940 indicates solely that no substantial federal question was raised by a state courts refusal to upset the districting of city council seats especially as it was urged that there was a rational justification for the challenged districting see 43 so 2d 514 similarly in anderson v jordan 343 u s 912 it was certain only that the state court had refused to issue a discretionary writ original mandamus in the supreme court that had been denied without opinion and of course it was urged here that an adequate state ground barred this courts review and in kidd v mccanless 200 tenn 273 292 s w 2d 40 the supreme court of tennessee held that it could not invalidate the very statute at issue in the case at bar but its holding rested on its state law of remedies i e the state view of 236 de facto officers60 and not on any view that the norm for legislative apportionment in tennessee is not numbers of qualified voters resident in the several counties of course this court was there precluded by the adequate state ground and in dismissing the appeal 352 u s 920 we cited anderson supra as well as colegrove nor does the tennessee courts decision in that case bear upon this for just as in smith v holm 220 minn 486 19 n w 2d 914 and magraw v donovan 163 f supp 184 177 f supp 803 a state courts inability to grant relief does not bar a federal courts assuming jurisdiction to inquire into alleged deprivation of federal constitutional rights problems of relief also controlled in radford v gary 352 u s 991 affirming the district courts refusal to mandamus the governor to call a session of the legislature to mandamus the legislature then to apportion and if they did not comply to mandamus the state supreme court to do so and matthews v handley 361 u s 127 affirmed a refusal to strike down the states gross income tax statuteurged on the ground that the legislature was malapportionedthat had rested on the adequacy of available state legal remedies for suits involving that tax including challenges to its constitutionality lastly colegrove v barrett 330 u s 804 in which mr justice rutledge concurred in this courts refusal to note the appeal from a dismissal for want of equity is sufficiently explained by his statement in cook v fortson supra the discretionary exercise or nonexercise of equitable or declaratory judgment jurisdiction   in one case is not precedent in another case 237 where the facts differ 329 u s at 678 n 8 citations omitted

we conclude that the complaints allegations of a denial of equal protection present a justiciable constitutional cause of action upon which appellants are entitled to a trial and a decision the right asserted is within the reach of judicial protection under the fourteenth amendment

the judgment of the district court is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion

reversed and remanded

mr justice whittaker did not participate in the decision of this casemr justice douglas concurringwhile i join the opinion of the court and like the court do not reach the merits a word of explanation is necessary1 i put to one side the problems of political 242 questions involving the distribution of power between this court the congress and the chief executive we have here a phase of the recurring problem of the relation of the federal courts to state agencies more particularly the question is the extent to which a state may weight one persons vote more heavily than it does anothers

so far as voting rights are concerned there are large gaps in the constitution yet the right to vote is inherent in the republican form of government envisaged by article iv section 4 of the constitution the house and now the senateare chosen by the people the time manner and place of elections of senators and representatives are left to the states article i section 4 clause 1 amendment xvii subject to the regulatory power of congress a republican form of government is guaranteed each state by article iv section 4 and each is likewise promised protection against invasion2ibid 243 that the states may specify the qualifications for voters is implicit in article i section 2 clause 1 which provides that the house of representatives shall be chosen by the 244 people and that the electors voters in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors voters of the most numerous branch of the state legislature the same provision contained in the seventeenth amendment governs the election of senators within limits those qualifications may be fixed by state law see lassiter v northampton election board 360 u s 45 5051 yet as stated in ex parte yarbrough 110 u s 651 663664 those who vote for members of congress do not owe their right to vote to the state law in any sense which makes the exercise of the right to depend exclusively on the law of the state the power of congress to prescribe the qualifications for voters and thus override state law is not in issue here it is however clear that by reason of the commands of the constitution there are several qualifications that a state may not require

race color or previous condition of servitude is an impermissible standard by reason of the fifteenth amendment and that alone is sufficient to explain gomillion v lightfoot 364 u s 339 see taper gomillion versus lightfoot 1962 pp 1217

sex is another impermissible standard by reason of the nineteenth amendment

there is a third barrier to a states freedom in prescribing qualifications of voters and that is the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment the provision invoked here and so the question is may a state weight the vote of one county or one district more heavily than it weights the vote in another

the traditional test under the equal protection clause has been whether a state has made an invidious discrimination as it does when it selects a particular race or nationality for oppressive treatment see skinner v oklahoma 316 u s 535 541 universal equality is not 245 the test there is room for weighting as we stated in williamson v lee optical co 348 u s 483 489 the prohibition of the equal protection clause goes no further than the invidious discrimination

i agree with my brother clark that if the allegations in the complaint can be sustained a case for relief is established we are told that a single vote in moore county tennessee is worth 19 votes in hamilton county that one vote in stewart or in chester county is worth nearly eight times a single vote in shelby or knox county the opportunity to prove that an invidious discrimination exists should therefore be given the appellants

it is said that any decision in cases of this kind is beyond the competence of courts some make the same point as regards the problem of equal protection in cases involving racial segregation yet the legality of claims and conduct is a traditional subject for judicial determination adjudication is often perplexing and complicated an example of the extreme complexity of the task can be seen in a decree apportioning water among the several states nebraska v wyoming 325 u s 589 665 the constitutional guide is often vague as the decisions under the due process and commerce clauses show the problem under the equal protection clause is no more intricate see lewis legislative apportionment and the federal courts 71 harv l rev 1057 10831084

there are of course some questions beyond judicial competence where the performance of a duty is left to the discretion and good judgment of an executive officer the judiciary will not compel the exercise of his discretion one way or the other kentucky v dennison 24 how 66 109 for to do so would be to take over the office cf federal communications commn v broadcasting co 309 u s 134 145

247 there is no doubt that the federal courts have jurisdiction of controversies concerning voting rights the civil rights act gives them authority to redress the deprivation under color of any state law of any right privilege or immunity secured by the constitution of the united states or by any act of congress providing for equal rights of citizens     28 u s c  1343 3 and 28 u s c  1343 4 gives the federal courts authority to award damages or issue an injunction to redress the violation of any act of congress providing for the protection of civil rights including the right to vote italics added the element of state action covers a wide range for as stated in united states v classic 313 u s 299 326misuse of power possessed by virtue of state law and made possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of state law is action taken under color of state law and see monroe v pape 365 u s 167the right to vote in both federal and state elections was protected by the judiciary long before that right received the explicit protection it is now accorded by  1343 4 discrimination against a voter on account of race has been penalized ex parte yarbrough 110 u s 651 or struck down nixon v herndon 273 u s 536 smith v allwright 321 u s 649 terry v adams 345 u s 461 fraudulent acts that dilute the votes of some 248 have long been held to be within judicial cognizance ex parte siebold 100 u s 371 the right to have ones vote counted whatever his race or nationality or creed was held in united states v mosley 238 u s 383 386 to be as open to protection by congress as the right to put a ballot in a box see also united states v classic supra 324325 united states v saylor 322 u s 385

the justiciability of the present claims being established any relief accorded can be fashioned in the light of wellknown principles of equity5
251mr justice clark concurringone emerging from the rash of opinions with their accompanying clashing of views may well find himself suffering a mental blindness the court holds that the appellants have alleged a cause of action however it refuses to award relief herealthough the facts are undisputed and fails to give the district court any guidance whatever one dissenting opinion bursting with words that go through so much and conclude with so little contemns the majority action as a massive repudiation of the experience of our whole past another describes the complaint as merely asserting conclusory allegations that tennessees apportionment is incorrect arbitrary obsolete and unconstitutional i believe it can be shown that this case is distinguishable from earlier cases dealing with the distribution of political power by a state that a patent violation of the equal protection clause of the united states constitution has been shown and that an appropriate remedy may be formulatedii take the law of the case from macdougall v green 335 u s 281 1948 which involved an attack under the equal protection clause upon an illinois election statute the court decided that case on its merits without hindrance from the political question doctrine although the statute under attack was upheld it is clear 252 that the court based its decision upon the determination that the statute represented a rational state policy it statedit would be strange indeed and doctrinaire for this court applying such broad constitutional concepts as due process and equal protection of the laws to deny a state the power to assure a proper diffusion of political initiative as between its thinly populated counties and those having concentrated masses in view of the fact that the latter have practical opportunities for exerting their political weight at the polls not available to the former id at 284 emphasis suppliedthe other cases upon which my brethren dwell are all distinguishable or inapposite the widely heralded case of colegrove v green 328 u s 549 1946 was one not only in which the court was bobtailed but in which there was no majority opinion indeed even the political question point in mr justice frankfurters opinion was no more than an alternative ground1 moreover the appellants did not present an equal protection argument2 while it has served as a mother hubbard to most of the subsequent cases i feel it was in that respect illcast and for all of these reasons put it to one side3 likewise 253 i do not consider the guaranty clause cases based on art i  4 of the constitution because it is not invoked here and it involves different criteria as the courts opinion indicates cases resting on various other considerations not present here such as radford v gary 352 u s 991 1957 lack of equity kidd v mccanless 352 u s 920 1956 adequate state grounds supporting the state judgment anderson v jordan 343 u s 912 1952 adequate state grounds remmey v smith 342 u s 916 1952 failure to exhaust state procedures are of course not controlling finally the georgia countyunitsystem cases such as south v peters 339 u s 276 1950 reflect the viewpoint of macdougall i e to refrain from intervening where there is some rational policy behind the states system4iithe controlling facts cannot be disputed it appears from the record that 37 of the voters of tennessee elect 20 of the 33 senators while 40 of the voters elect 63 of the 99 members of the house but this might not on its face be an invidious discrimination williamson v lee optical of oklahoma 348 u s 483 489 1955 for a statutory discrimination will not be set aside if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify it mcgowan v maryland 366 u s 420 426 1961

it is true that the apportionment policy incorporated in tennessees constitution i e statewide numerical equality of representation with certain minor qualifications5 is a rational one on a countybycounty comparison 254 a districting plan based thereon naturally will have disparities in representation due to the qualifications but this to my mind does not raise constitutional problems for the overall policy is reasonable however the root of the trouble is not in tennessees constitution for admittedly its policy has not been followed the discrimination lies in the action of tennessees assembly in allocating legislative seats to counties or districts created by it try as one may tennessees apportionment just cannot be made to fit the pattern cut by its constitution this was the finding of the district court the policy of the constitution referred to by the dissenters therefore is of no relevance here we must examine what the assembly has done6 the frequency and magnitude of the inequalities in the present districting admit of no policy whatever an examination of table i accompanying this opinion post p 262 conclusively reveals that the apportionment picture in tennessee is a topsyturvical of gigantic proportions this is not to say that some of the disparity cannot be explained but when the entire table is examinedcomparing the voting strength of counties of like population as well as contrasting that of the smaller with the larger countiesit leaves but one conclusion namely that tennessees apportionment is a crazy quilt without rational basis at the risk of being accused of picking out a few of the horribles i shall allude to a series of examples that are taken from table i

as is admitted there is a wide disparity of voting strength between the large and small counties some 255 samples are moore county has a total representation of two7 with a population 2340 of only oneeleventh of rutherford county 25316 with the same representation decatur county 5563 has the same representation as carter 23303 though the latter has four times the population likewise loudon county 13264 houston 3084 and anderson county 33990 have the same representation i e 125 each but it is said that in this illustration all of the underrepresented counties contain municipalities of over 10000 population and they therefore should be included under the urban classification rationalizing this disparity as an attempt to effect a ruralurban political balance but in so doing one is caught up in the backlash of his own bull whip for many counties have municipalities with a population exceeding 10000 yet the same invidious discrimination is present for examplecountypopulationrepresentationcarter23303110maury24556225washington36967193madison37245350256

likewise counties with no municipality of over 10000 suffer a similar discriminationcountypopulationrepresentationgrundy6540095chester6391200cumberland9593063crockett9676200loudon13264125fayette13577250this could not be an effort to attain political balance between rural and urban populations since discrimination is present among counties of like population the plan is neither consistent nor rational it discriminates horizontally creating gross disparities between rural areas themselves as well as between urban areas themselves8 still maintaining the wide vertical disparity already pointed out between rural and urban

it is also insisted that the representation formula used above see n 7 is patently deficient because it eliminates from consideration the relative voting power of the counties that are joined together in a single election district this is a strange claim coming from those who rely on the proposition that the voice of every voter need not have approximate equality indeed representative government as they say is not necessarily one of bare numbers the use of floterial districts in our political system is not ordinarily based on the theory that the floterial representative is splintered among the counties of his district per relative population his function is to represent the whole district however i shall meet the charge on its own ground and by use of its adjusted 257 total representation  formula show that the present apportionment is loco for example compare some urban areas of like population using the harlan formulacountypopulationrepresentationwashington36967265madison37245487carter23303148greene23649205maury24556381coffee13406232hamblen14090107and now using the same formula compare some socalled rural areas of like populationcountypopulationrepresentationmoore2340123pickett2565022stewart5238160cheatham5263074chester6391136grundy6540069smith8731204unicoi8787040and for counties with similar representation but with gross differences in population takecountypopulationrepresentationsullivan55712407maury24556381blount30353212coffee13406232these cannot be distorted effects for here the same formula proposed by the dissenters is used and the result is even a crazier quilt

258 the truth is thatalthough this case has been here for two years and has had over six hours argument three times the ordinary case and has been most carefully considered over and over again by us in conference and individuallyno one not even the state nor the dissenters has come up with any rational basis for tennessees apportionment statute

no oneexcept the dissenters advocating the harlan adjusted total representation  formulacontends that mathematical equality among voters is required by the equal protection clause but certainly there must be some rational design to a states districting the discrimination here does not fit any patternas i have said it is but a crazy quilt my brother harlan contends that other proposed apportionment plans contain disparities instead of chasing those rabbits he should first pause long enough to meet appellants proof of discrimination by showing that in fact the present plan follows a rational policy not being able to do this he merely counters with such generalities as classic legislative judgment no significant discrepancy and de minimis departures i submit that even a casual glance at the present apportionment picture shows these conclusions to be entirely fanciful if present representation has a policy at all it is to maintain the status quo of invidious discrimination at any cost like the district court i conclude that appellants have met the burden of showing tennessee is guilty of a clear violation of the state constitution and of the federal rights of the plaintiffs   iiialthough i find the tennessee apportionment statute offends the equal protection clause i would not consider intervention by this court into so delicate a field if there were any other relief available to the people of tennessee but the majority of the people of tennessee have no 259 practical opportunities for exerting their political weight at the polls to correct the existing invidious discrimination tennessee has no initiative and referendum i have searched diligently for other practical opportunities present under the law i find none other than through the federal courts the majority of the voters have been caught up in a legislative strait jacket tennessee has an informed civically militant electorate and an aroused popular conscience but it does not sear the conscience of the peoples representatives this is because the legislative policy has riveted the present seats in the assembly to their respective constituencies and by the votes of their incumbents a reapportionment of any kind is prevented the people have been rebuffed at the hands of the assembly they have tried the constitutional convention route but since the call must originate in the assembly it too has been fruitless they have tried tennessee courts with the same result9 and governors have fought the tide only to flounder it is said that there is recourse in congress and perhaps that may be but from a practical standpoint this is without substance to date congress has never undertaken such a task in any state we therefore must conclude that the people of tennessee are stymied and without judicial intervention will be saddled with the present discrimination in the affairs of their state governmentivfinally we must consider if there are any appropriate modes of effective judicial relief the federal courts are of course not forums for political debate nor should they 260 resolve themselves into state constitutional convention or legislative assemblies nor should their jurisdiction be exercised in the hope that such a declaration as is made today may have the direct effect of bringing on legislative action and relieving the courts of the problem of fashioning relief to my mind this would be nothing less than blackjacking the assembly into reapportioning the state if judicial competence were lacking to fashion an effective decree i would dismiss this appeal however like the solicitor general of the united states i see no such difficulty in the position of this case one plan might be to start with the existing assembly districts consolidate some of them and award the seats thus released to those counties suffering the most egregious discrimination other possibilities are present and might be more effective but the plan here suggested would at least release the strangle hold now on the assembly and permit it to redistrict itself

in this regard the appellants have proposed a plan based on the rationale of statewide equal representation not believing that numerical equality of representation throughout a state is constitutionally required i would not apply such a standard albeit a permissive one nevertheless the dissenters attack it by the application of the harlan adjusted total representation  formula the result is that some isolated inequalities are shown but this in itself does not make the proposed plan irrational or place it in the crazy quilt category such inequalities as the dissenters point out in attempting to support the present apportionment as rational are explainable moreover there is no requirement that any plan have mathematical exactness in its application only where as here the total picture reveals incommensurables of both magnitude and frequency can it be said that there is present an invidious discrimination

261 in view of the detailed study that the court has given this problem it is unfortunate that a decision is not reached on the merits the majority appears to hold at least sub silentio that an invidious discrimination is present but it remands to the threejudge court for it to make what is certain to be that formal determination it is true that tennessee has not filed a formal answer however it has filed voluminous papers and made extended arguments supporting its position at no time has it been able to contradict the appellants factual claims it has offered no rational explanation for the present apportionment indeed it has indicated that there are none known to it as i have emphasized the case proceeded to the point before the threejudge court that it was able to find an invidious discrimination factually present and the state has not contested that holding here in view of all this background i doubt if anything more can be offered or will be gained by the state on remand other than time nevertheless not being able to muster a court to dispose of the case on the merits i concur in the opinion of the majority and acquiesce in the decision to remand however in fairness i do think that tennessee is entitled to have my idea of what it faces on the record before us and the trial court some light as to how it might proceed

as john rutledge later chief justice said 175 years ago in the course of the constitutional convention a chief function of the court is to secure the national rights10 its decision today supports the proposition for which our forebears fought and many died namely that to be fully conformable to the principle of right the form of government must be representative11 that is the keystone upon which our government was founded 262 and lacking which no republic can survive it is well for this court to practice selfrestraint and discipline in constitutional adjudication but never in its history have those principles received sanction where the national rights of so many have been so clearly infringed for so long a time national respect for the courts is more enhanced through the forthright enforcement of those rights rather than by rendering them nugatory through the interposition of subterfuges in my view the ultimate decision today is in the greatest tradition of this court

the court today decides three things and no more a that the court possessed jurisdiction of the subject matter b that a justiciable cause of action is stated upon which appellants would be entitled to appropriate relief and c    that the appellants have standing to challenge the tennessee apportionment statutes ante pp 197198

the complaint in this case asserts that tennessees system of apportionment is utterly arbitrarywithout any possible justification in rationality the district court did not reach the merits of that claim and this court quite properly expresses no view on the subject contrary to the suggestion of my brother harlan the court does not say or imply that state legislatures must be so structured as to reflect with approximate equality the voice of every voter post p 332 the court does not say or imply that there is anything in the federal constitution to prevent a state acting not irrationally from choosing any electoral legislative structure it thinks best suited to the interests temper and customs of its people post p 334 and contrary to the suggestion of my brother douglas the court most assuredly does not decide the question may a state weight the vote of one county or one district more heavily than it weights the vote in another ante p 244

in macdougall v green 335 u s 281 the court held that the equal protection clause does not deny a state the power to assure a proper diffusion of political initiative 266 as between its thinly populated counties and those having concentrated masses in view of the fact that the latter have practical opportunities for exerting their political weight at the polls not available to the former 335 u s at 284 in case after case arising under the equal protection clause the court has said what it said again only last termthat the fourteenth amendment permits the states a wide scope of discretion in enacting laws which affect some groups of citizens differently than others mcgowan v maryland 366 u s 420 425 in case after case arising under that clause we have also said that the burden of establishing the unconstitutionality of a statute rests on him who assails it metropolitan casualty ins co v brownell 294 u s 580 584

todays decision does not turn its back on these settled precedents i repeat the court today decides only 1 that the district court possessed jurisdiction of the subject matter 2 that the complaint presents a justiciable controversy 3 that the appellants have standing my brother clark has made a convincing prima facie showing that tennessees system of apportionment is in fact utterly arbitrarywithout any possible justification in rationality my brother harlan has with imagination and ingenuity hypothesized possibly rational bases for tennessees system but the merits of this case are not before us now the defendants have not yet had an opportunity to be heard in defense of the states system of apportionment indeed they have not yet even filed an answer to the complaint as in other cases the proper place for the trial is in the trial court not heremr justice frankfurter whom mr justice harlan joins dissentingthe court today reverses a uniform course of decision established by a dozen cases including one by which the very claim now sustained was unanimously rejected 267 only five years ago the impressive body of rulings thus cast aside reflected the equally uniform course of our political history regarding the relationship between population and legislative representationa wholly different matter from denial of the franchise to individuals because of race color religion or sex such a massive repudiation of the experience of our whole past in asserting destructively novel judicial power demands a detailed analysis of the role of this court in our constitutional scheme disregard of inherent limits in the effective exercise of the courts judicial power not only presages the futility of judicial intervention in the essentially political conflict of forces by which the relation between population and representation has time out of mind been and now is determined it may well impair the courts position as the ultimate organ of the supreme law of the land in that vast range of legal problems often strongly entangled in popular feeling on which this court must pronounce the courts authoritypossessed of neither the purse nor the swordultimately rests on sustained public confidence in its moral sanction such feeling must be nourished by the courts complete detachment in fact and in appearance from political entanglements and by abstention from injecting itself into the clash of political forces in political settlements

a hypothetical claim resting on abstract assumptions is now for the first time made the basis for affording illusory relief for a particular evil even though it foreshadows deeper and more pervasive difficulties in consequence the claim is hypothetical and the assumptions are abstract because the court does not vouchsafe the lower courtsstate and federalguidelines for formulating specific definite wholly unprecedented remedies for the inevitable litigations that todays umbrageous disposition is bound to stimulate in connection with politically motivated reapportionments in so many states in 268 such a setting to promulgate jurisdiction in the abstract is meaningless it is as devoid of reality as a brooding omnipresence in the sky for it conveys no intimation what relief if any a district court is capable of affording that would not invite legislatures to play ducks and drakes with the judiciary for this court to direct the district court to enforce a claim to which the court has over the years consistently found itself required to deny legal enforcement and at the same time to find it necessary to withhold any guidance to the lower court how to enforce this turnabout new legal claim manifests an odd indeed an esotericconception of judicial propriety one of the courts supporting opinions as elucidated by commentary unwittingly affords a disheartening preview of the mathematical quagmire apart from divers judicially inappropriate and elusive determinants into which this court today catapults the lower courts of the country without so much as adumbrating the basis for a legal calculus as a means of extrication even assuming the indispensable intellectual disinterestedness on the part of judges in such matters they do not have accepted legal standards or criteria or even reliable analogies to draw upon for making judicial judgments to charge courts with the task of accommodating the incommensurable factors of policy that underlie these mathematical puzzles is to attribute however flatteringly omnicompetence to judges the framers of the constitution persistently rejected a proposal that embodied this assumption and thomas jefferson never entertained it

recent legislation creating a district appropriately described as an atrocity of ingenuity is not unique considering the gross inequality among legislative electoral units within almost every state the court naturally shrinks from asserting that in districting at least substantial equality is a constitutional requirement enforceable 269 by courts room continues to be allowed for weighting this of course implies that geography economics urbanrural conflict and all the other nonlegal factors which have throughout our history entered into political districting are to some extent not to be ruled out in the undefined vista now opened up by review in the federal courts of state reapportionments to some extentaye theres the rub in effect todays decision empowers the courts of the country to devise what should constitute the proper composition of the legislatures of the fifty states if state courts should for one reason or another find themselves unable to discharge this task the duty of doing so is put on the federal courts or on this court if state views do not satisfy this courts notion of what is proper districting

we were soothingly told at the bar of this court that we need not worry about the kind of remedy a court could effectively fashion once the abstract constitutional right to have courts pass on a statewide system of electoral districting is recognized as a matter of judicial rhetoric because legislatures would heed the courts admonition this is not only a euphoric hope it implies a sorry 270 confession of judicial impotence in place of a frank acknowledgement that there is not under our constitution a judicial remedy for every political mischief for every undesirable exercise of legislative power the framers carefully and with deliberate forethought refused so to enthrone the judiciary in this situation as in others of like nature appeal for relief does not belong here appeal must be to an informed civically militant electorate in a democratic society like ours relief must come through an aroused popular conscience that sears the conscience of the peoples representatives in any event there is nothing judicially more unseemly nor more selfdefeating than for this court to make in terrorem pronouncements to indulge in merely empty rhetoric sounding a word of promise to the ear sure to be disappointing to the hope

this is the latest in the series of cases in which the equal protection and due process clauses of the fourteenth amendment have been invoked in federal courts as restrictions upon the power of the states to allocate electoral weight among the voting populations of their various geographical subdivisions1 the present action which 271 comes here on appeal from an order of a statutory threejudge district court dismissing amended complaints seeking declaratory and injunctive relief challenges the provisions of tenn code ann 1955  3101 to 3109 which apportion state representative and senatorial seats among tennessees ninetyfive counties

the original plaintiffs citizens and qualified voters entitled to vote for members of the tennessee legislature in the several counties in which they respectively reside bring this action in their own behalf and on behalf of all other voters in the state of tennessee or as they alternatively assert on behalf of all qualified voters of their respective counties and further on behalf of all voters of the state of tennessee who are similarly situated the cities of knoxville and chattanooga and the mayor of nashvilleon his own behalf as a qualified voter and pursuant to an authorizing resolution by the nashville city council as a representative of all the citys residentswere permitted to intervene as parties plaintiff2 the defendants are executive officials charged with statutory duties in connection with state elections3
272 the original plaintiffs amended complaint avers in substance the following4 the constitution of the state of tennessee declares that elections shall be free and equal provides that no qualifications other than age citizenship and specified residence requirements shall be attached to the right of suffrage and prohibits denying to any person the suffrage to which he is entitled except upon conviction of an infamous crime art i  5 art iv  1 it requires an enumeration of qualified voters within every term of ten years after 1871 and an apportionment of representatives and senators among the several counties or districts according to the number of qualified voters in each5 at the time of each decennial 273 enumeration art ii  4 5 6 notwithstanding these provisions the state legislature has not reapportioned itself since 1901 the reapportionment act of that year tenn acts 1901 c 122 now tenn code ann 1955  3101 to 31096 was unconstitutional when enacted because not preceded by the required enumeration of qualified voters and because it allocated legislative seats arbitrarily unequally and discriminatorily as measured by the 1900 federal census moreover irrespective of the question of its validity in 1901 it is asserted that the act became unconstitutional and obsolete in 1911 by virtue of the decennial reapportionment requirement of the tennessee constitution continuing a purposeful and systematic plan to discriminate against a geographical class of persons recent tennessee legislatures have failed as did their predecessors to enact reapportionment legislation although a number of bills providing for reapportionment have been introduced because of population shifts since 1901 the apportionment fixed by the act of that year and still in effect is not proportionate to population denies to the counties in which the plaintiffs 274 live an additional number of representatives to which they are entitled and renders plaintiffs votes not as effective as the votes of the voters residing in other senatorial and representative districts     plaintiffs suffer a debasement of their votes by virtue of the incorrect arbitrary obsolete and unconstitutional apportionment of the general assembly     and the totality of the malapportionments effectwhich permits a minority of about thirtyseven percent of the voting population of the state to control twenty of the thirtythree members of tennessees senate and a minority of forty percent of the voting population to control sixtythree of the ninetynine members of the houseresults in a distortion of the constitutional system established by the federal and state constitutions prevents the general assembly from being a body representative of the people of the state of tennessee    and is contrary to the basic principle of representative government     and contrary to the philosophy of government in the united states and all anglosaxon jurisprudence    

exhibits appended to the complaint purport to demonstrate the extent of the inequalities of which plaintiffs complain based upon approximate voting population7 these set forth figures showing that the state 275 senator from tennessees most populous senatorial district represents five and twotenths times the number of voters represented by the senator from the least populous district while the corresponding ratio for most and least populous house districts is more than eighteen to one the general assembly thus apportioned has discriminated against the underrepresented counties and in favor of the overrepresented counties in the collection and distribution of various taxes and tax revenues notably in the distribution of school and highwayimprovement funds8 this discrimination being made possible and effective by the legislatures failure to reapportion itself plaintiffs conclude that election of the state legislature pursuant to the apportionment fixed by the 1901 act violates the tennessee constitution and deprives them of due process of law and of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment their prayer below was for a declaratory judgment striking down the act an injunction restraining defendants from any acts necessary to the holding of elections in the districts prescribed by tenn code ann 1955  3101 to 3109 until such time as the legislature is reapportioned according to the 276 constitution of the state of tennessee and an order directing defendants to declare the next primary and general elections for members of the tennessee legislature on an atlarge basisthe thirtythree senatorial candidates and the ninetynine representative candidates receiving the highest number of votes to be declared elected9

motions to dismiss for want of jurisdiction of the subject matter and for failure to state a claim were made and granted 179 f supp 824 the district court relying upon this courts series of decisions beginning with colegrove v green 328 u s 549 rehearing denied 329 u s 825 motion for reargument before the full bench denied 329 u s 828 the original and intervening plaintiffs bring the case here on appeal 364 u s 898 in this court they have altered their request for relief suggesting a stepbystep approach the first step is a remand to the district court with directions to vacate the order dismissing the complaint and to enter an order retaining jurisdiction providing the necessary spur to legislative action     if this proves insufficient appellants will ask the additional spur of an injunction prohibiting elections under the 1901 act or a declaration of the acts unconstitutionality or both finally all other means failing the district court is invited by the plaintiffs greatly daring to order an election at large or redistrict the state itself or through a master the solicitor general of the united states who has filed a brief amicus and argued in favor of reversal asks the court on this appeal to hold only that the district court has jurisdiction and may properly exercise it to entertain the plaintiffs claims on the merits this would leave to that court after remand the questions of the challenged statutes 277 constitutionality and of some undefined unadumbrated relief in the event a constitutional violation is found after an argument at the last term the case was set down for reargument 366 u s 907 and heard this termiin sustaining appellants claim based on the fourteenth amendment that the district court may entertain this suit this courts uniform course of decision over the years is overruled or disregarded explicitly it begins with colegrove v green supra decided in 1946 but its roots run deep in the courts historic adjudicatory process

colegrove held that a federal court should not entertain an action for declaratory and injunctive relief to adjudicate the constitutionality under the equal protection clause and other federal constitutional and statutory provisions of a state statute establishing the respective districts for the states election of representatives to the congress two opinions were written by the four justices who composed the majority of the seven sitting members of the court both opinions joining in the result in colegrove v green agreed that considerations were controlling which dictated denial of jurisdiction though not in the strict sense of want of power while the two opinions show a divergence of view regarding some of these considerations there are important points of concurrence both opinions demonstrate a predominant concern first with avoiding federal judicial involvement in matters traditionally left to legislative policy making second with respect to the difficultyin view of the nature of the problems of apportionment and its history in this countryof drawing on or devising judicial standards for judgment as opposed to legislative determinations of the part which mere numerical equality among voters should play as a criterion for the allocation of 278 political power and third with problems of finding appropriate modes of reliefparticularly the problem of resolving the essentially political issue of the relative merits of atlarge elections and elections held in districts of unequal population

the broad applicability of these considerationssummarized in the loose shorthand phrase political question in cases involving a states apportionment of voting power among its numerous localities has led the court since 1946 to recognize their controlling effect in a variety of situations in all these cases decision was by a full court the political question principle as applied in colegrove has found wide application commensurate with its function as one of the rules basic to the federal system and this courts appropriate place within that structure rescue army v municipal court 331 u s 549 570 in colegrove v barrett 330 u s 804 litigants brought suit in a federal district court challenging as offensive to the equal protection clause illinois state legislativeapportionment laws they pointed to state constitutional provisions requiring decennial reapportionment and allocation of seats in proportion to population alleged a failure to reapportion for more than fortyfive yearsduring which time extensive population shifts had rendered the legislative districts grossly unequaland sought declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to all elections to be held thereafter after the complaint was dismissed by the district court this court dismissed an appeal for want of a substantial federal question a similar district court decision was affirmed here in radford v gary 352 u s 991 and cf remmey v smith 342 u s 916 in tedesco v board of supervisors 339 u s 940 the court declined to hear for want of a substantial federal question the claim that the division of a municipality into voting districts of unequal population for the selection for councilmen fell 279 afoul of the fourteenth amendment and in cox v peters 342 u s 936 rehearing denied 343 u s 921 it found no substantial federal question raised by a state courts dismissal of a claim for damages for devaluation of plaintiffs vote by application of georgias countyunit system in a primary election for the democratic gubernatorial candidate the same georgia system was subsequently attacked in a complaint for declaratory judgment and an injunction the federal district judge declined to take the requisite steps for the convening of a statutory threejudge court and this court in hartsfield v sloan 357 u s 916 denied a motion for leave to file a petition for a writ of mandamus to compel the district judge to act in macdougall v green 335 u s 281 283 the court noted that to assume that political power is a function exclusively of numbers is to disregard the practicalities of government and citing the colegrove cases declined to find in such broad constitutional concepts as due process and equal protection of the laws id at 284 a warrant for federal judicial invalidation of an illinois statute requiring as a condition for the formation of a new political party the securing of at least two hundred signatures from each of fifty counties and in south v peters 339 u s 276 another suit attacking georgias countyunit law it affirmed a district court dismissal sayingfederal courts consistently refuse to exercise their equity powers in cases posing political issues arising from a states geographical distribution of electoral strength among its political subdivisions id at 277of course it is important to recognize particular relevant diversities among comprehensively similar situations appellants seek to distinguish several of this courts prior decisions on one or another groundcolegrove v 280 green on the ground that federal not state legislative apportionment was involved remmey v smith on the ground that state judicial remedies had not been tried radford v gary on the ground that oklahoma has the initiative whereas tennessee does not it would only darken counsel to discuss the relevance and significance of each of these assertedly distinguishing factors here and in the context of this entire line of cases suffice it that they do not serve to distinguish colegrove v barrett supra which is on all fours with the present case or to distinguish kidd v mccanless 352 u s 920 in which the full court without dissent only five years ago dismissed on authority of colegrove v green and anderson v jordan 343 u s 912 an appeal from the supreme court of tennessee in which a precisely similar attack was made upon the very statute now challenged if the weight and momentum of an unvarying course of carefully considered decisions are to be respected appellants claims are foreclosed not only by precedents governing the exact facts of the present case but are themselves supported by authority the more persuasive in that it gives effect to the colegrove principle in distinctly varying circumstances in which state arrangements allocating relative degrees of political influence among geographic groups of voters were challenged under the fourteenth amendmentiithe colegrove doctrine in the form in which repeated decisions have settled it was not an innovation it represents long judicial thought and experience from its earliest opinions this court has consistently recognized a class of controversies which do not lend themselves to judicial standards and judicial remedies to classify the various instances as political questions is rather a form 281 of stating this conclusion than revealing of analysis10 some of the cases so labelled have no relevance here but from others emerge unifying considerations that are compelling

1 the cases concerning war or foreign affairs for example are usually explained by the necessity of the countrys speaking with one voice in such matters while this concern alone undoubtedly accounts for many of the decisions11 others do not fit the pattern it would hardly embarrass the conduct of war were this court to determine in connection with private transactions between litigants the date upon which war is to be deemed terminated but the court has refused to do so see e g the protector 12 wall 700 brown v hiatts 15 wall 177 adger v alston 15 wall 555 williams v bruffy 96 u s 176 192193 it does not suffice to explain such cases as ludecke v watkins 335 u s 160deferring to political determination the question of the duration of war for purposes of the presidential power to deport alien enemiesthat judicial intrusion would seriously 282 impede the presidents power effectively to protect the countrys interests in time of war of course this is true but the precise issue presented is the duration of the time of war which demands the power cf martin v mott 12 wheat 19 lamar v browne 92 u s 187 193 hamilton v kentucky distilleries  warehouse co 251 u s 146 kahn v anderson 255 u s 1 and even for the purpose of determining the extent of congressional regulatory power over the tribes and dependent communities of indians it is ordinarily for congress not the court to determine whether or not a particular indian group retains the characteristics constitutionally requisite to confer the power12e g united states v holliday 3 wall 407 tiger v western investment co 221 u s 286 united states v sandoval 231 u s 28 a controlling factor in such cases is that decision respecting these kinds of complex matters of policy being traditionally committed not to courts but to the political agencies of government for determination by criteria of political expediency there exists no standard ascertainable by settled judicial experience or process by reference to which a political decision affecting the question at issue between the parties can be judged where the question arises in the course of a litigation involving primarily the adjudication of other issues between the litigants the court accepts as a basis for adjudication the political departments decision of it but where its determination is the sole function to be served by the exercise of the judicial power the court will not entertain the action see chicago  southern air lines inc v waterman s s corp 283 333 u s 103 the dominant consideration is the lack of satisfactory criteria for a judicial determination     mr chief jusice hughes for the court in coleman v miller 307 u s 433 454455 compare united states v rogers 4 how 567 572 with worcester v georgia 6 pet 51513

this may be like so many questions of law a matter of degree questions have arisen under the constitution to which adjudication gives answer although the criteria for decision are less than unwavering bright lines often in these cases illumination was found in the federal structures established by or the underlying presuppositions of the constitution with respect to such questions the court has recognized that concerning a particular power of congress put in issue    effective restraints on its exercise must proceed from political rather than from judicial processes wickard v filburn 317 u s 111 120 it is also true that even regarding the duration of war and the status of indian tribes referred to above as subjects ordinarily committed exclusively to the nonjudicial branches the court has suggested that some limitations exist upon the range within which the decisions of those branches will be permitted to go unreviewed see united states v sandoval supra at 46 cf chastleton corp v sinclair 264 u s 543 but this is merely to acknowledge that particular circumstances may differ so greatly in degree as to differ thereby in kind and that although within a certain range of cases on a continuum no standard of distinction can be found to tell between them other cases will fall above or below the range the doctrine of political questions like any other is not to 284 be applied beyond the limits of its own logic with all the quiddities and abstract disharmonies it may manifest see the disposition of contentions based on logically distorting views of colegrove v green and hunter v pittsburgh 207 u s 161 in gomillion v lightfoot 364 u s 339

2 the court has been particularly unwilling to intervene in matters concerning the structure and organization of the political institutions of the states the abstention from judicial entry into such areas has been greater even than that which marks the courts ordinary approach to issues of state power challenged under broad federal guarantees we should be very reluctant to decide that we had jurisdiction in such a case and thus in an action of this nature to supervise and review the political administration of a state government by its own officials and through its own courts the jurisdiction of this court would only exist in case there had been    such a plain and substantial departure from the fundamental principles upon which our government is based that it could with truth and propriety be said that if the judgment were suffered to remain the party aggrieved would be deprived of his life liberty or property in violation of the provisions of the federal constitution wilson v north carolina 169 u s 586 596 see taylor and marshall v beckham no 1 178 u s 548 walton v house of representatives 265 u s 487 snowden v hughes 321 u s 1 cf in re sawyer 124 u s 200 220221

where however state law has made particular federal questions determinative of relations within the structure of state government not in challenge of it the court has resolved such narrow legally defined questions in proper proceedings see boyd v nebraska ex rel thayer 143 u s 135 in such instances there is no conflict between state policy and the exercise of federal judicial 285 power this distinction explains the decisions in smiley v holm 285 u s 355 koenig v flynn 285 u s 375 and carroll v becker 285 u s 380 in which the court released state constitutional provisions prescribing local lawmaking procedures from misconceived restriction of superior federal requirements adjudication of the federal claim involved in those cases was not one demanding the accommodation of conflicting interests for which no readily accessible judicial standards could be found see mcpherson v blacker 146 u s 1 in which in a case coming here on writ of error from the judgment of a state court which had entertained it on the merits the court treated as justiciable the claim that a state could not constitutionally select its presidential electors by districts but held that art ii  1 cl 2 of the constitution left the mode of choosing electors in the absolute discretion of the states cf pope v williams 193 u s 621 breedlove v suttles 302 u s 277 to read with literalness the abstracted jurisdictional discussion in the mcpherson opinion reveals the danger of conceptions of justiciability derived from talk and not from the effective decision in a case in probing beneath the surface of cases in which the court has declined to interfere with the actions of political organs of government of decisive significance is whether in each situation the ultimate decision has been to intervene or not to intervene compare the reliance in south v peters 339 u s 276 on macdougall v green 335 u s 281 and the jurisdictional form of the opinion in wilson v north carolina 169 u s 586 596 supra

3 the cases involving negro disfranchisement are no exception to the principle of avoiding federal judicial intervention into matters of state government in the absence of an explicit and clear constitutional imperative for here the controlling command of supreme law is plain and unequivocal an end of discrimination against 286 the negro was the compelling motive of the civil war amendments the fifteenth expresses this in terms and it is no less true of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth slaughterhouse cases 16 wall 36 6772 strauder v west virginia 100 u s 303 306307 nixon v herndon 273 u s 536 541 thus the court in cases involving discrimination against the negros right to vote has recognized not only the action at law for damages14 but in appropriate circumstances the extraordinary remedy of declaratory or injunctive relief15schnell v davis 336 u s 933 terry v adams 345 u s 46116 injunctions in these cases it should be noted would not have restrained statewide general elections compare giles v harris 189 u s 475

4 the court has refused to exercise its jurisdiction to pass on abstract questions of political power of sovereignty of government massachusetts v mellon 262 u s 447 485 see texas v interstate commerce commission 258 u s 158 162 new jersey v sargent 269 u s 328 337 the political question doctrine in this aspect reflects the policies underlying the requirement of standing that the litigant who would challenge official 287 action must claim infringement of an interest particular and personal to himself as distinguished from a cause of dissatisfaction with the general frame and functioning of governmenta complaint that the political institutions are awry see stearns v wood 236 u s 75 fairchild v hughes 258 u s 126 united public workers v mitchell 330 u s 75 8991 what renders cases of this kind nonjusticiable is not necessarily the nature of the parties to them for the court has resolved other issues between similar parties17 nor is it the nature of the legal question involved for the same type of question has been adjudicated when presented in other forms of controversy18 the crux of the matter is that courts are not fit instruments of decision where what is essentially at stake is the composition of those large contests of policy traditionally fought out in nonjudicial forums by which governments and the actions of governments are made and unmade see texas v white 7 wall 700 white v hart 13 wall 646 phillips v payne 92 u s 130 marsh v burroughs 1 woods 463 471472 bradley circuit justice cf wilson v shaw 204 u s 24 but see coyle v smith 221 u s 559 thus where the cherokee nation sought by an original motion to restrain the state of georgia from the enforcement of laws which assimilated cherokee territory to the states counties abrogated cherokee law and abolished cherokee government the court held that such a claim was not judicially cognizable cherokee nation v georgia 5 pet 119 and in georgia 288 v stanton 6 wall 50 the court dismissed for want of jurisdiction a bill by the state of georgia seeking to enjoin enforcement of the reconstruction acts on the ground that the command by military districts which they established extinguished existing state government and replaced it with a form of government unauthorized by the constitution20that these matters both as stated in the body of the bill and in the prayers for relief call for the judgment of the court upon political questions and upon rights not of persons or property but of a political character will hardly be denied for the rights for the protection of which our authority is invoked are the rights of sovereignty of political jurisdiction of government of corporate existence as a state with all its constitutional powers and privileges no case of private rights or private property infringed or in danger of actual or threatened infringement is presented by the bill in a judicial form for the judgment of the court id at 7721289 5 the influence of these converging considerations the caution not to undertake decision where standards meet for judicial judgment are lacking the reluctance to interfere with matters of state government in the absence of an unquestionable and effectively enforceable mandate the unwillingness to make courts arbiters of the broad issues of political organization historically committed to other institutions and for whose adjustment the judicial process is illadaptedhas been decisive of the settled line of cases reaching back more than a century which holds that art iv  4 of the constitution guaranteeing to the states a republican form of government22 is not enforceable through the courts e g oneill v leamer 239 u s 244 mountain timber co v washington 243 u s 219 cochran v board of education 281 u s 370 highland farms dairy inc v agnew 300 u s 60823 claims resting on this specific 290 guarantee of the constitution have been held nonjusticiable which challenged state distribution of powers between the legislative and judicial branches ohio ex rel bryant v akron metropolitan park district 281 u s 74 state delegation of power to municipalities kiernan v portland oregon 223 u s 151 state adoption of the referendum as a legislative institution ohio ex rel davis v hildebrant 241 u s 565 569 and state restriction upon the power of state constitutional amendment marshall v dye 231 u s 250 256257 the subject was fully considered in pacific states telephone  telegraph co v oregon 223 u s 118 in which the court dismissed for want of jurisdiction a writ of error attacking a state licensetax statute enacted by the initiative on the claim that this mode of legislation was inconsistent with a republican form of government and violated the equal protection clause and other federal guarantees after nothing    the ruinous destruction of legislative authority in matters purely political which would necessarily be occasioned by giving sanction 291 to the doctrine which underlies and would be necessarily involved in sustaining the propositions contended for24 the court said   the essentially political nature of this claim is at once made manifest by understanding that the assault which the contention here advanced makes it sic not on the tax as a tax but on the state as a state it is addressed to the framework and political character of the government by which the statute levying the tax was passed it is the government the political entity which reducing the case to its essence is called to the bar of this court not for the purpose of testing judicially some exercise of power assailed on the ground that its exertion 292 has injuriously affected the rights of an individual because of repugnancy to some constitutional limitation but to demand of the state that it establish its right to exist as a state republican in form id at 150151the starting point of the doctrine applied in these cases is of course luther v borden 7 how 1 the case arose out of the dorr rebellion in rhode island in 18411842 rhode island at the time of the separation from england had not adopted a new constitution but had continued in its existence as an independent state under its original royal charter with certain statutory alterations this frame of government provided no means for amendment of the fundamental law the right of suffrage was to be prescribed by legislation which limited it to freeholders in the 1830s largely because of the growth of towns in which there developed a propertied class whose means were not represented by freehold estates dissatisfaction arose with the suffrage qualifications of the charter government in addition population shifts had caused a dated apportionment of seats in the lower house to yield substantial numerical inequality of political influence even among qualified voters the towns felt themselves underrepresented and agitation began for electoral reform when the charter government failed to respond popular meetings of those who favored the broader suffrage were held and delegates elected to a convention which met and drafted a state constitution this constitution provided for universal manhood suffrage with certain qualifications and it was to be adopted by vote of the people at elections at which a similarly expansive franchise obtained this new scheme of government was ratified at the polls and declared effective by the convention but the government elected and organized under it with dorr at its head never came to power the 293 charter government denied the validity of the convention the constitution and its government and after an insignificant skirmish routed dorr and his followers it meanwhile provided for the calling of its own convention which drafted a constitution that went peacefully into effect in 184325
luther v borden was a trespass action brought by one of dorrs supporters in a united states circuit court to recover damages for the breaking and entering of his house the defendants justified under military orders pursuant to martial law declared by the charter government and plaintiff by his reply joined issue on the legality of the charter government subsequent to the adoption of the dorr constitution evidence offered by the plaintiff tending to establish that the dorr government was the rightful government of rhode island was rejected by the circuit court the court charged the jury that the charter government was lawful and on a verdict for defendants plaintiff brought a writ of error to this court

the court through mr chief justice taney affirmed after noting that the issue of the charter governments legality had been resolved in that governments favor by the state courts of rhode islandthat the state courts deeming the matter a political one unfit for judicial determination had declined to entertain attacks upon the existence and authority of the charter governmentthe chief justice held that the courts of the united states must follow those of the state in this regard id at 3940 it was recognized that the compulsion to follow 294 state law would not apply in a federal court in the face of a superior command found in the federal constitution ibid but no such command was found the constitution the court saidreferring to the guarantee clause of the fourth article   as far as it has provided for an emergency of this kind and authorized the general government to interfere in the domestic concerns of a state has treated the subject as political in its nature and placed the power in the hands of that department id at 42under this article of the constitution it rests with congress to decide what government is the established one in a state for as the united states guarantee to each state a republican government congress must necessarily decide what government is established in the state before it can determine whether it is republican or not and when the senators and representatives of a state are admitted into the councils of the union the authority of the government under which they are appointed as well as its republican character is recognized by the proper constitutional authority and its decision is binding on every other department of the government and could not be questioned in a judicial tribunal it is true that the contest in this case did not last long enough to bring the matter to this issue and as no senators or representatives were elected under the authority of the government of which mr dorr was the head congress was not called upon to decide the controversy yet the right to decide is placed there and not in the courts ibid26295 in determining this issue nonjusticiable the court was sensitive to the same considerations to which its later decisions have given the varied applications already discussed it adverted to the delicacy of judicial intervention into the very structure of government27 it acknowledged that tradition had long entrusted questions of this nature to nonjudicial processes28 and that judicial processes were unsuited to their decision29 the absence of guiding standards for judgment was critical for the question whether the dorr constitution had been rightfully adopted depended in part upon the extent of the franchise to be recognizedthe very point of contention over which rebellion had been fought   if the circuit court had entered upon this inquiry by what rule could it have determined the qualification of voters upon the adoption or rejection of the proposed constitution unless there was some previous law of the state to guide it it is the province of a court to expound the law not to make it and certainly it is no part of the judicial functions of any court of the united states to prescribe the qualification of voters in a state giving the right to those to whom it is denied by the written and established constitution and laws of the state or taking it away from those to whom it is given nor has it the right to determine what political privileges 296 the citizens of a state are entitled to unless there is an established constitution or law to govern its decision id at 41mr justice woodbury who dissented with respect to the effect of martial law agreed with the court regarding the inappropriateness of judicial inquiry into the issuesbut fortunately for our freedom from political excitements in judicial duties this court can never with propriety be called on officially to be the umpire in questions merely political the adjustment of these questions belongs to the people and their political representatives either in the state or general government these questions relate to matters not to be settled on strict legal principles they are adjusted rather by inclinationor prejudice or compromise often some of them succeed or are defeated even by public policy alone or mere naked power rather than intrinsic right   another evil alarming and little foreseen involved in regarding these as questions for the final arbitrament of judges would be that in such an event all political privileges and rights would in a dispute among the people depend on our decision finally    disputed points in making constitutions depending often as before shown on policy inclination popular resolves and popular will    if the people in the distribution of powers under the constitution should ever think of making judges supreme arbiters in political controversies when not selected by nor frequently amenable to them nor at liberty to follow such various considerations in their judgments as belong to mere political questions they will dethrone themselves and lose one of their own invaluable birthrights building up in this way slowly but surelya new sovereign power in the 297 republic in most respects irresponsible and unchangeable for life and one more dangerous in theory at least than the worst elective oligarchy in the worst of times    id at 515330iiithe present case involves all of the elements that have made the guarantee clause cases nonjusticiable it is in effect a guarantee clause claim masquerading under a different label but it cannot make the case more fit for judicial action that appellants invoke the fourteenth amendment rather than art iv  4 where in fact the gist of their complaint is the sameunless it can be found that the fourteenth amendment speaks with greater particularity to their situation we have been admonished to avoid the tyranny of labels snyder v massachusetts 291 u s 97 114 art iv  4 is not committed by express constitutional terms to congress it is the nature of the controversies arising under it nothing else which has made it judicially unenforceable of course if a controversy falls within judicial power it depends on how he the plaintiff casts his action pan american petroleum corp v superior court 366 u s 656 662 whether he brings himself within a jurisdictional statute but where judicial competence is wanting it cannot be created by invoking one clause of the constitution rather than another when what was essentially a guarantee clause claim was sought to be laid as well under the equal protection clause in pacific states telephone  telegraph co v oregon supra the court had no difficulty in dispelling 298 any mere confusion resulting from forms of expression and considering the substance of things     223 u s at 140

here appellants attack the state as a state precisely as it was perceived to be attacked in the pacific states case id at 150 their complaint is that the basis of representation of the tennessee legislature hurts them they assert that a minority now rules in tennessee that the apportionment statute results in a distortion of the constitutional system that the general assembly is no longer a body representative of the people of the state of tennessee all contrary to the basic principle of representative government     accepting appellants own formulation of the issue one can know this handsaw from a hawk such a claim would be nonjusticiable not merely under art iv  4 but under any clause of the constitution by virtue of the very fact that a federal court is not a forum for political debate massachusetts v mellon supra

but appellants of course do not rest on this claim simpliciter in invoking the equal protection clause they assert that the distortion of representative government complained of is produced by systematic discrimination against them by way of a debasement of their votes     does this characterization with due regard for the facts from which it is derived add anything to appellants case31

at first blush this charge of discrimination based on legislative underrepresentation is given the appearance of 299 a more private less impersonal claim than the assertion that the frame of government is askew appellants appear as representatives of a class that is prejudiced as a class in contradistinction to the polity in its entirety however the discrimination relied on is the deprivation of what appellants conceive to be their proportionate share of political influence this of course is the practical effect of any allocation of power within the institutions of government hardly any distribution of political authority that could be assailed as rendering government nonrepublican would fail similarly to operate to the prejudice of some groups and to the advantage of others within the body politic it would be ingenuous not to see or consciously blind to deny that the real battle over the initiative and referendum or over a delegation of power to local rather than statewide authority is the battle between forces whose influence is disparate among the various organs of government to whom power may be given no shift of power but works a corresponding shift in political influence among the groups composing a society

what then is this question of legislative apportionment appellants invoke the right to vote and to have their votes counted32 but they are permitted to vote and their votes are counted they go to the polls they cast their ballots they send their representatives to the state 300 councils their complaint is simply that the representatives are not sufficiently numerous or powerfulin short that tennessee has adopted a basis of representation with which they are dissatisfied talk of debasement or dilution is circular talk one cannot speak of debasement or dilution of the value of a vote until there is first defined a standard of reference as to what a vote should be worth what is actually asked of the court in this case is to choose among competing bases of representationultimately really among competing theories of political philosophyin order to establish an appropriate frame of government for the state of tennessee and thereby for all the states of the union

in such a matter abstract analogies which ignore the facts of history deal in unrealities they betray reason this is not a case in which a state has through a device however oblique and sophisticated denied negroes or jews or redheaded persons a vote or given them only a third or a sixth of a vote that was gomillion v lightfoot 364 u s 339 what tennessee illustrates is an old and still widespread method of representationrepresentation by local geographical division only in part respective of populationin preference to others others forsooth more appealing appellants contest this choice and seek to make this court the arbiter of the disagreement they would make the equal protection clause the charter of adjudication asserting that the equality which it guarantees comports if not the assurance of equal weight to every voters vote at least the basic conception that representation ought to be proportionate to population a standard by reference to which the reasonableness of apportionment plans may be judged

to find such a political conception legally enforceable in the broad and unspecific guarantee of equal protection is to rewrite the constitution see luther v borden supra certainly equal protection is no more secure 301 a foundation for judicial judgment of the permissibility of varying forms of representative government than is republican form indeed since equal protection of the laws can only mean an equality of persons standing in the same relation to whatever governmental action is challenged the determination whether treatment is equal presupposes a determination concerning the nature of the relationship this with respect to apportionment means an inquiry into the theoretic base of representation in an acceptably republican state for a court could not determine the equalprotection issue without in fact first determining the republicanform issue simply because what is reasonable for equalprotection purposes will depend upon what frame of government basically is allowed to divorce equal protection from republican form is to talk about half a question

the notion that representation proportioned to the geographic spread of population is so universally accepted as a necessary element of equality between man and man that it must be taken to be the standard of a political equality preserved by the fourteenth amendmentthat it is in appellants words the basic principle of representative governmentis to put it bluntly not true however desirable and however desired by some among the great political thinkers and framers of our government it has never been generally practiced today or in the past it was not the english system it was not the colonial system it was not the system chosen for the national government by the constitution it was not the system exclusively or even predominantly practiced by the states at the time of adoption of the fourteenth amendment it is not predominantly practiced by the states today unless judges the judges of this court are to make their private views of political wisdom the measure of the constitutionviews which in all honesty cannot but give the appearance if not reflect the reality of 302 involvement with the business of partisan politics so inescapably a part of apportionment controversiesthe fourteenth amendment itself a historical product jackman v rosenbaum co 260 u s 22 31 provides no guide for judicial oversight of the representation problem1 great britainwriting in 1958 professor w j m mackenzie aptly summarized the british history of the principle of representation proportioned to population  equal electoral districts formed part of the programme of radical reform in england in the 1830s the only part of that programme which has not been realised33 until the late nineteenth century the sole base of representation with certain exceptions not now relevant was the local geographical unit each county or borough returned its fixed number of members usually two for the english units regardless of population34 prior to the reform act of 1832 this system was marked by the almost total disfranchisement of the populous northern industrial centers which had grown to significant size at the advent of the industrial revolution and had not been granted borough representation and by the existence of the rotten borough playing its substantial part in the crowns struggle for continued control of the commons35 in 1831 ten southernmost english counties numbering three and a quarter million people had two hundred and thirtyfive parliamentary representatives while the six northernmost counties with more than three and a half million people had sixtyeight36 it was said that one hundred and eighty persons appointed three hundred and 303 fifty members in the commons37 less than a half century earlier madison in the federalist had remarked that half the house was returned by less than six thousand of the eight million people of england and scotland38

the act of 1832 the product of a fierce partisan political struggle and the occasion of charges of gerrymandering not without foundation39 effected eradication of only the most extreme numerical inequalities of the unreformed system it did not adopt the principle of representation based on population but merely disfranchised certain among the rotten borough and enfranchised most of the urban centersstill quite without regard to their relative numbers40 in the wake of the act there remained substantial electoral inequality the boroughs of cornwall were represented sixteen times as weightily judged by population as the countys eastern division the average ratio of seats to population in ten agricultural counties was four and a half times that in ten manufacturing divisions honiton with about three thousand inhabitants was equally represented with liverpool which had four hundred thousand41 in 1866 apportionment by population began to be advocated generally in the house but was not made the basis of the redistribution of 1867 although the act of that year did apportion representation more evenly gauged by the population standard42 population shifts increased the surviving inequalities by 1884 the representation ratio 304 in many small boroughs was more than twentytwo times that of birmingham or manchester fortytoone disparities could be found elsewhere and in sum in the 1870s and 1880s a fourth of the electorate returned twothirds of the members of the house43

the first systematic english attempt to distribute seats by population was the redistribution act of 188544 the statute still left ratios of inequality of as much as seven to one45 which had increased to fifteen to one by 191246 in 1918 parliament again responded to shockingly bad conditions of inequality47 and to partisan political inspiration48 by redistribution49 in 1944 redistribution was put on a periodic footing by the house of commons redistribution of seats act of that year50 which committed a continuing primary responsibility for reapportioning the commons to administrative agencies boundary commissions for england scotland wales and northern ireland respectively51 the commissions having regard to certain rules prescribed for their guidance are to prepare at designated intervals reports for the home secretarys submission to parliament along with the draft of an order in council to give effect to the 305 commissions recommendations the districting rules adopt the basic principle of representation by population although the principle is significantly modified by directions to respect local geographic boundaries as far as practicable and by discretion to take account of special geographical conditions including the size shape and accessibility of constituencies under the original 1944 act the rules provided that subject to the exercise of the discretion respecting special geographical conditions and to regard for the total size of the house of commons as prescribed by the act so far as practicable the singlemember districts should not deviate more than twentyfive percent from the electoral quota population divided by number of constituencies however apparently at the recommendation of the boundary commission for england the twentyfive percent standard was eliminated as too restrictive in 1947 and replaced by the flexible provision that constituencies are to be as near the electoral quota as practicable a rule which is expressly subordinated both to the consideration of special geographic conditions and to that of preserving local boundaries52 free of the twentyfive percent rule the commissions drew up plans of distribution in which inequalities among the districts run in ordinary cases as high as two to one and in the case of a few extraordinary constituencies three to one53 the action of the boundary commission for england was twice challenged in the courts in 1954the claim being that the commission had violated statutory rules 306 prescribing the standards for its judgmentand in both cases the judges declined to intervene in hammersmith borough council v boundary commission for england54 harman j was of opinion that the nature of the controversy and the scheme of the acts made the matter inappropriate for judicial interference and in harper v home secretary55 the court of appeal per evershed m r quoting harman j with approval adverting to the wide range of discretion entrusted to the commission under the acts and remarking the delicate character of the parliamentary issues in which it was sought to engage the court reached the same conclusion56

the house of commons redistribution of seats act 195857 made two further amendments to the law responsive to the recommendation of the boundary commission for england58 the interval permitted between commission reports was more than doubled to a new maximum of fifteen years59 and at the suggestion of the same commission that it would ease the future labours of the commission and remove much local irritation if rule 5 requiring that the electorate of each constituency be as near the electoral quota as practicable were to be so amended as to allow us to make recommendations preserving the status quo in any area where such a course appeared to be desirable and not inconsistent 307 with the broad intention of the rules60 the commissions were directed to consider the inconvenience attendant upon the alteration of constituencies and the local ties which such alteration might break the home secretarys view of this amendment was that it worked to erect a presumption against making changes unless there is a very strong case for them612 the colonies and the unionfor the guiding political theorists of the revolutionary generation the english system of representation in its most salient aspects of numerical inequality was a model to be avoided not followed62 nevertheless the basic english principle of apportioning representatives among the local governmental entities towns or counties rather than among units of approximately equal population had early taken root in the colonies63 in some as in massachusetts and rhode island numbers of electors were taken into account in a rough fashion by allotting increasing fixed quotas of representatives to several towns or classes of towns graduated by population but in most of the colonies delegates were allowed to the local units without respect to numbers64 this resulted in grossly unequal electoral units65 the representation ratio in one north carolina county was more than eight times that in another66 moreover american rotten boroughs had appeared67 and apportionment was made an instrument first in the political 308 struggles between the king or the royal governors and the colonial legislatures68 and later between the older tidewater regions in the colonies and the growing interior69 madison in the philadelphia convention adverted to the inequality of the representation in the legislatures of particular states   70 arguing that it was necessary to confer on congress the power ultimately to regulate the times places and manner of selecting representatives71 in order to forestall the overrepresented counties securing themselves a similar overrepresentation in the national councils the example of south carolina where charlestons overrepresentation was a continuing bone of contention between the tidewater and the back country was cited by madison in the virginia convention and by king in the massachusetts convention in support of the same power and king also spoke of the extreme numerical inequality arising from connecticuts townrepresentation system72

such inequalities survived the constitutional period the united states constitution itself did not largely adopt the principle of numbers apportionment of the national legislature among the states was one of the most difficult problems for the convention73 its solution involving state representation in the senate74 and the threefifths compromise in the house75left neither chamber apportioned proportionately to population 309 within the states electoral power continued to be allotted to favor the tidewater76 jefferson in his notes on virginia recorded the very unequal representation there individual counties differing in population by a ratio of more than seventeen to one elected the same number of representatives and those nineteen thousand of virginias fifty thousand men who lived between the falls of the rivers and the seacoast returned half the states senators and almost half its delegates77 in south carolina in 1790 the three lower districts with a white population of less than twentynine thousand elected twenty senators and seventy assembly members while in the uplands more than one hundred and eleven thousand white persons elected seventeen senators and fiftyfour assemblymen78

in the early nineteenth century the demands of the interior became more insistent the apportionment quarrel in virginia was a major factor in precipitating the calling of a constitutional convention in 1829 bitter animosities racked the convention threatening the state with disunion at last a compromise which gave the three hundred and twenty thousand people of the west thirteen senators as against the nineteen senators returned by the three hundred sixtythree thousand people of the east commanded agreement it was adopted at the polls but left the western counties so dissatisfied that there were threats of revolt and realignment with the state of maryland79

maryland however had her own numerical disproportions in 1820 one representative vote in calvert county 310 was worth five in frederick county and almost two hundred thousand people were represented by eighteen members while fifty thousand others elected twenty80 this was the result of the countyrepresentation system of allotment and except for massachusetts which after a long struggle did adopt representation by population at the midcentury a similar townrepresentation principle continued to prevail in various forms throughout new england with all its attendant often gross inequalities813 the states at the time of ratification of the fourteenth amendment and those later admitted the several state conventions throughout the first half of the nineteenth century were the scenes of fierce sectional and party strifes respecting the geographic allocation of representation82 their product was a wide variety of apportionment methods which recognized the element of population in differing ways and degrees particularly pertinent to appraisal of the contention that the fourteenth amendment embodied a standard limiting the freedom of the states with regard to the principles and bases of local legislative apportionment is an examination of the apportionment provisions of the thirtythree states which ratified the amendment between 1866 and 1870 at their respective times of ratification these may be considered in two groups a the ratifying states other than the ten southern states whose constitutions at the time of ratification or shortly thereafter were the work of the reconstruction act conventions83 and 311 b the ten reconstructionact states all thirtythree are significant because they demonstrate how unfounded is the assumption that the ratifying states could have agreed on a standard apportionment theory or practice and how baseless the suggestion that by voting for the equal protection clause they sought to establish a test mold for apportionment whichif appellants argument is soundstruck down sub silentio not a few of their own state constitutional provisions but the constitutions of the ten reconstructionact states have an added importance for it is scarcely to be thought that the congress which was so solicitous for the adoption of the fourteenth amendment as to make the readmission of the late rebel states to congress turn on their respective ratifications of it would have approved constitutions whichagain under appellants theorycontemporaneously offended the amendmenta of the twentythree ratifying states of the first group seven or eight had constitutions which demanded or allowed apportionment of both houses on the basis of population84 unqualifiedly or with only qualifications respecting the preservation of local boundaries85 three 312 more apportioned on what was essentially a population base but provided that in one house counties having a specified fraction of a ratioa moiety or twothirds should have a representative86 since each of these three states limited the size of their chambers the fractional rule could operateand at least in michigan has in fact operated87to produce substantial numerical inequalities 313 in favor of the sparsely populated counties88 iowa favored her small counties by the rule that no more than four counties might be combined in a representative district89 and new york and kansas compromised population and countyrepresentation principles by assuring every county regardless of the number of its inhabitants at least one seat in their respective houses90

ohio and maine recognized the factor of numbers by a different device the former gave a house representative to each county having half a ratio two representatives for a ratio and threequarters three representatives for three ratios and a single additional representative for each additional ratio91 the latter after apportioning among counties on a population base gave each town of fifteen hundred inhabitants one representative each town of three thousand seven hundred and fifty inhabitants two representatives and so on in increasing intervals to twentysix thousand two hundred and fifty inhabitants towns of that size or larger receiving the maximum permitted number of representatives seven92 the departure from numerical equality under these systems is apparent in maine assuming the incidence of towns in 314 all categories representative ratios would differ by factors of two and a half to one at a minimum similarly missouri gave each of its counties however small one representative two representatives for three ratios three representatives for six ratios and one additional representative for each three ratios above six93 new hampshire allotted a representative to each town of one hundred and fifty ratable male polls of voting age and one more representative for each increment of three hundred above that figure94 its senate was not apportioned by population but among districts based on the proportion of direct taxes paid95 in pennsylvania the basis of apportionment in both houses was taxable inhabitants and in the house every county of at least thirtyfive hundred taxables had a representative nor could more than three counties be joined in forming a representative district while in the senate no city or county could have more than four of the states twentyfive to thirtythree senators96

finally four states apportioned at least one house with no regard whatever to population in connecticut97 and vermont98 representation in the house was on a town basis rhode island gave one senator to each of its towns or cities99 and new jersey one to each of its counties100315 nor in any of these states was the other house apportioned on a strict principle of equal numbers connecticut gave each of its counties a minimum of two senators101 and vermont one102 new jersey assured each county a representative103 and in rhode island which gave at least one representative to each town or city no town or city could have more than onesixth of the total number in the house104b among the ten late confederate states affected by the reconstruction acts in only four did it appear that apportionment of both state legislative houses would or might be based strictly on population105 in north carolina106 south carolina107 louisiana108 and alabama109 each county in the case of louisiana each parish was assured at least one seat in the lower house irrespective of numbersa distribution which exhausted respectively 316 on the basis of the number of thenexisting counties threequarters onequarter twofifths and threefifths of the maximum possible number of representatives before a single seat was available for assignment on a population basis and in south carolina moreover the senate was composed of one member elected from each county except that charleston sent two110 in floridas house each county had one seat guaranteed and an additional seat for every thousand registered voters up to a maximum of four representatives111 while georgia whose senate seats were distributed among fortyfour singlemember districts each composed of three contiguous counties112 assigned representation in its house as follows three seats to each of the six most populous counties two to each of the thirtyone next most populous one to each of the remaining ninetyfive113 as might be expected the onerepresentativepercounty minimum pattern has proved incompatible with numerical equality114 and georgias 317 countyclustering system has produced representativeratio disparities between the largest and smallest counties of more than sixty to one115c
the constitutions116 of the thirteen states which congress admitted to the union after the ratification of the fourteenth amendment showed a similar pattern six of them required or permitted apportionment of both houses by population subject only to qualifications concerning local boundaries117 wyoming apportioning by population guaranteed to each of its counties at least one seat in each house118 and idaho which prescribed after the first legislative session that apportionment should be as may be provided by law gave each county at least one representative119 in oklahoma house members were apportioned among counties so as to give one 318 seat for half a ratio two for a ratio and threequarters and one for each additional ratio up to a maximum of seven representatives per county120 montana required reapportionment of its house on the basis of periodic enumerations according to ratios to be fixed by law121 but its counties were represented as counties in the senate each county having one senator122 alaska123 and hawaii124 each apportioned a number of senators among constitutionally fixed districts their respective houses were to be periodically reapportioned by population subject to a moiety rule in alaska125 and to hawaiis guarantee of one representative to each of four constitutionally designated areas126 the arizona constitution assigned representation to each county in each house giving one or two senators and from one to seven representatives to each and making no provision for reapportionment127
319 4 contemporary apportionment detailed recent studies are available to describe the presentday constitutional and statutory status of apportionment in the fifty states128 they demonstrate a decided twentiethcentury trend away from population as the exclusive base of representation today only a dozen state constitutions provide for periodic legislative reapportionment of both houses by a substantially unqualified application of the population standard129 and only about a dozen more prescribe such reapportionment for even a single chamber specific provision for county representation in at least one house of the state legislature has been increasingly adopted since the end of the 19th century   130 more than twenty states now guarantee each county at least one seat in one of their houses regardless of population and in nine others county or town units are given equal representation in one legislative branch whatever the number of each units inhabitants of course numerically considered these provisions invariably result in overrepresentation of the least populated areas   131 and in an effort to curb the political dominance of metropolitan regions at least ten states now limit the maximum entitlement of any single county or in some cases city 320 in one legislative houseanother source of substantial numerical disproportion132

moreover it is common knowledge that the legislatures have not kept reapportionment up to date even where state constitutions in terms require it133 in particular the pattern of according greater per capita representation to rural relatively sparsely populated areasthe same pattern which finds expression in various state constitutional provisions134 and which has been given effect in england and elsewhere135has in some of the states been made the law by legislative inaction in the face of 321 population shifts136 throughout the country urban and suburban areas tend to be given higher representation ratios than do rural areas137

the stark fact is that if among the numerous widely varying principles and practices that control state legislative apportionment today there is any generally prevailing feature that feature is geographic inequality in relation to the population standard138 examples could be endlessly multiplied in new jersey counties of 322 thirtyfive thousand and of more than nine hundred and five thousand inhabitants respectively each have a single senator139 representative districts in minnesota range from 7290 inhabitants to 107246 inhabitants140 ratios of senatorial representation in california vary as much as two hundred and ninetyseven to one141 in oklahoma the range is ten to one for house constituencies and roughly sixteen to one for senate constituencies142 colebrook connecticutpopulation 592elects two house representatives hartfordpopulation 177397also elects two143 the first third and fifth of these examples are the products of constitutional provisions which subordinate population to regional considerations in apportionment the second is the result of legislative inaction the fourth derives from both constitutional and legislative sources a survey made in 1955 in sum reveals that less than thirty percent of the population inhabit districts sufficient to elect a house majority in thirteen states and a senate majority in nineteen states144 these figures show more than individual variations from a generally accepted standard of electoral equality they show that there is notas there has never beena standard by 323 which the place of equality as a factor in apportionment can be measured

manifestly the equal protection clause supplies no clearer guide for judicial examination of apportionment methods than would the guarantee clause itself apportionment by its character is a subject of extraordinary complexity involvingeven after the fundamental theoretical issues concerning what is to be represented in a representative legislature have been fought out or compromised considerations of geography demography electoral convenience economic and social cohesions or divergencies among particular local groups communications the practical effects of political institutions like the lobby and the city machine ancient traditions and ties of settled usage respect for proven incumbents of long experience and senior status mathematical mechanics censuses compiling relevant data and a host of others145324 legislative responses throughout the country to the reapportionment demands of the 1960 census have glaringly confirmed that these are not factors that lend themselves to evaluations of a nature that are the staple of judicial determinations or for which judges are equipped to adjudicate by legal training or experience or native wit and this is the more so true because in every strand of this complicated intricate web of values meet the contending forces of partisan politics146 the practical significance of apportionment is that the next election results may differ because of it apportionment battles are overwhelmingly party or intraparty contests147 it will add a virulent source of friction and tension in federalstate relations to embroil the federal judiciary in them148
325ivappellants however contend that the federal courts may provide the standard which the fourteenth amendment lacks by reference to the provisions of the constitution of tennessee the argument is that although the same or greater disparities of electoral strength may be suffered to exist immune from federal judicial review in states where they result from apportionment legislation consistent with state constitutions the tennessee legislature may not abridge the rights which on its face its own constitution appears to give without by that act denying equal protection of the laws it is said that the law of tennessee as expressed by the words of its written constitution has made the basic choice among policies in favor of representation proportioned to population and that it is no longer open to the state to allot its voting power on other principles

this reasoning does not bear analysis like claims invoking state constitutional requirement have been rejected here and for good reason it is settled that whatever federal consequences may derive from a discrimination worked by a state statute must be the same as if the same discrimination were written into the 326 states fundamental law nashville c  st l r co v browning 310 u s 362 and see castillo v mcconnico 168 u s 674 coulter v louisville  n r co 196 u s 599 608609 owensboro waterworks co v owensboro 200 u s 38 hebert v louisiana 272 u s 312 316317 snowden v hughes 321 u s 1 11 appellants complain of a practice which by their own allegations has been the law of tennessee for sixty years they allege that the apportionment act of 1901 created unequal districts when passed and still maintains unequal districts they allege that the legislature has since 1901 purposefully retained unequal districts and the supreme court of tennessee has refused to invalidate the law establishing these unequal districts kidd v mccanless 200 tenn 273 292 s w 2d 40 appeal dismissed here in 352 u s 920 in these circumstances what was said in the browning case supra at 369 clearly governs this case   here according to petitioners own claim all the organs of the state are conforming to a practice systematic unbroken for more than forty years and now questioned for the first time it would be a narrow conception of jurisprudence to confine the notion of laws to what is found written on the statute books and to disregard the gloss which life has written upon it settled state practice cannot supplant constitutional guarantees but it can establish what is state law the equal protection clause did not write an empty formalism into the constitution deeply embedded traditional ways of carrying out state policy such as those of which petitioner complains are often tougher and truer law than the dead words of the written text    the equal protection clause is not a command of candor   327 tennessees law and its policy respecting apportionment are what 60 years of practice show them to be not what appellants cull from the unenforced and according to its own judiciary unenforceable words of its constitution the statute comes here on the same footing therefore as would the apportionment laws of new jersey california or connecticut149 and is unaffected by its supposed repugnance to the state constitutional language on which appellants rely150

in another aspect however the kidd v mccanless case supra introduces a factor peculiar to this litigation which only emphasizes the duty of declining the exercise of federal judicial jurisdiction in all of the apportionment cases which have come before the court a consideration which has been weighty in determining their nonjusticiability has been the difficulty or impossibility of devising effective judicial remedies in this class of case an injunction restraining a general election unless the legislature reapportions would paralyze the critical centers of a states political system and threaten political dislocation whose consequences are not foreseeable a declaration devoid 328 of implied compulsion of injunctive or other relief would be an idle threat151 surely a federal district court could not itself remap the state the same complexities which impede effective judicial review of apportionment a fortiori make impossible a courts consideration of these imponderables as an original matter and the choice of elections at large as opposed to elections by district however unequal the districts is a matter of sweeping political judgment having enormous political implications the nature and reach of which are certainly beyond the informed understanding of and capacity for appraisal by courts

in tennessee moreover the mccanless case has closed off several among even these unsatisfactory and dangerous modes of relief that case was a suit in the state courts attacking the 1901 reapportionment act and seeking a declaration and an injunction of the acts enforcement or alternatively a writ of mandamus compelling state election officials to hold the elections at large or again alternatively a decree of the court reapportioning the state the chancellor denied all coercive relief but entertained the suit for the purpose of rendering a declaratory judgment it was his view that despite an invalidation of the statute under which the present legislature was elected that body would continue to possess de facto authority to reapportion and that therefore the maintaining of the suit did not threaten the disruption of the government the tennessee supreme court agreed that no coercive relief could be granted in particular it said there is no provision of law for election of our general assembly by an election at large over the state 200 tenn at 277 292 s w 2d at 42 thus a legislature elected at 329 large would not be the legally constituted legislative authority of the state the court reversed however the chancellors determination to give declaratory relief holding that the ground of demurrer which asserted that a striking down of the statute would disrupt the orderly process of government should have been sustained4 it seems obvious and we therefore hold that if the act of 1901 is to be declared unconstitutional then the de facto doctrine cannot be applied to maintain the present members of the general assembly in office if the chancellor is correct in holding that this statute has expired by the passage of the decade following its enactment then for the same reason all prior apportionment acts have expired by a like lapse of time and are nonexistent therefore we would not only not have any existing members of the general assembly but we would have no apportionment act whatever under which a new election could be held for the election of members to the general assemblythe ultimate result of holding this act unconstitutional by reason of the lapse of time would be to deprive us of the present legislature and the means of electing a new one and ultimately bring about the destruction of the state itself 200 tenn at 281282 292 s w 2d at 44a federal court enforcing the federal constitution is not to be sure bound by the remedial doctrines of the state courts but it must consider as pertinent to the propriety or impropriety of exercising its jurisdiction those statelaw effects of its decree which it cannot itself control a federal court cannot provide the authority requisite to make a legislature the proper governing body of the state of tennessee and it cannot be doubted that the striking 330 down of the statute here challenged on equal protection grounds no less than on grounds of failure to reapportion decennially would deprive the state of all valid apportionment legislation andunder the ruling in mccanlessdeprive the state of an effective lawbased legislative branch just such considerations among others here present were determinative in luther v borden and the oregon initiative cases152

although the district court had jurisdiction in the very restricted sense of power to determine whether it could adjudicate the claim the case is of that class of political controversy which by the nature of its subject is unfit for federal judicial action the judgment of the district court in dismissing the complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted should therefore be affirmeddissenting opinion of mr justice harlan whom mr justice frankfurter joinsthe dissenting opinion of mr justice frankfurter in which i join demonstrates the abrupt departure the majority makes from judicial history by putting the federal courts into this area of state concernsan area which in this instance the tennessee state courts themselves have refused to enter

it does not detract from his opinion to say that the panorama of judicial history it unfolds though evincing a steadfast underlying principle of keeping the federal courts out of these domains has a tendency because of variants in expression to becloud analysis in a given case with due respect to the majority i think that has happened here

once one cuts through the thicket of discussion devoted to jurisdiction standing justiciability and political 331 question there emerges a straightforward issue which in my view is determinative of this case does the complaint disclose a violation of a federal constitutional right in other words a claim over which a united states district court would have jurisdiction under 28 u s c  1343 3 and 42 u s c  1983 the majority opinion does not actually discuss this basic question but as one concurring justice observes seems to decide it sub silentio ante p 261 however in my opinion appellants allegations accepting all of them as true do not parsed down or as a whole show an infringement by tennessee of any rights assured by the fourteenth amendment accordingly i believe the complaint should have been dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted fed rules civ proc rule 12 b 6

it is at once essential to recognize this case for what it is the issue here relates not to a method of state electoral apportionment by which seats in the federal house of representatives are allocated but solely to the right of a state to fix the basis of representation in its own legislature until it is first decided to what extent that right is limited by the federal constitution and whether what tennessee has done or failed to do in this instance runs afoul of any such limitation we need not reach the issues of justiciability or political question or any of the other considerations which in such cases as colegrove v green 328 u s 549 led the court to decline to adjudicate a challenge to a state apportionment affecting seats in the federal house of representatives in the absence of a controlling act of congress see also wood v broom 287 u s 1

the appellants claim in this case ultimately rests entirely on the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment it is asserted that tennessee has violated the equal protection clause by maintaining in effect a 332 system of apportionment that grossly favors in legislative representation the rural sections of the state as against its urban communities stripped to its essentials the complaint purports to set forth three constitutional claims of varying breadth1 the equal protection clause requires that each vote cast in state legislative elections be given approximately equal weight2 short of this the existing apportionment of state legislators is so unreasonable as to amount to an arbitrary and capricious act of classification on the part of the tennessee legislature which is offensive to the equal protection clause3 in any event the existing apportionment is rendered invalid under the fourteenth amendment because it flies in the face of the tennessee constitutionfor reasons given in mr justice frankfurters opinion ante pp 325327 the last of these propositions is manifestly untenable and need not be dealt with further i turn to the other twoii can find nothing in the equal protection clause or elsewhere in the federal constitution which expressly or impliedly supports the view that state legislatures must be so structured as to reflect with approximate equality the voice of every voter not only is that proposition refuted by history as shown by my brother frankfurter but it strikes deep into the heart of our federal system its acceptance would require us to turn our backs on the regard which this court has always shown for the judgment of state legislatures and courts on matters of basically local concern

333 in the last analysis what lies at the core of this controversy is a difference of opinion as to the function of representative government it is surely beyond argument that those who have the responsibility for devising a system of representation may permissibly consider that factors other than bare numbers should be taken into account the existence of the united states senate is proof enough of that to consider that we may ignore the tennessee legislatures judgment in this instance because that body was the product of an asymmetrical electoral apportionment would in effect be to assume the very conclusion here disputed hence we must accept the present form of the tennessee legislature as the embodiment of the states choice or more realistically its compromise between competing political philosophies the federal courts have not been empowered by the equal protection clause to judge whether this resolution of the states internal political conflict is desirable or undesirable wise or unwise

with respect to state tax statutes and regulatory measures for example it has been said that the day is gone when this court uses the    fourteenth amendment to strike down state laws    because they may be unwise improvident or out of harmony with a particular school of thought williamson v lee optical co 348 u s 483 488 i would think it all the more compelling for us to follow this principle of selfrestraint when what is involved is the freedom of a state to deal with so intimate a concern as the structure of its own legislative branch the federal constitution imposes no limitation on the form which a state government may take other than generally committing to the united states the duty to guarantee to every state a republican form of government and as my brother frankfurter so conclusively proves ante pp 308317 no intention to fix immutably the 334 means of selecting representatives for state governments could have been in the minds of either the founders or the draftsmen of the fourteenth amendment

in short there is nothing in the federal constitution to prevent a state acting not irrationally from choosing any electoral legislative structure it thinks best suited to the interests temper and customs of its people i would have thought this proposition settled by macdougall v green 335 u s 281 in which the court observed at p 283 that to assume that political power is a function exclusively of numbers is to disregard the practicalities of government and reaffirmed by south v peters 339 u s 276 a states choice to distribute electoral strength among geographical units rather than according to a census of population is certainly no less a rational decision of policy than would be its choice to levy a tax on property rather than a tax on income both are legislative judgments entitled to equal respect from this courtiithe claim that tennessees system of apportionment is so unreasonable as to amount to a capricious classification of voting strength stands up no better under dispassionate analysis

the court has said time and again that the equal protection clause does not demand of state enactments either mathematical identity or rigid equality e g allied stores of ohio v bowers 358 u s 522 527528 and authorities there cited mcgowan v maryland 366 u s 420 425426 all that is prohibited is invidious discrimination bearing no rational relation to any permissible policy of the state williamson v lee optical co supra at 489 and in deciding whether such discrimination has been practiced by a state it must be borne in mind that a statutory discrimination will not be set aside if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived 335 to justify it mcgowan v maryland supra it is not inequality alone that calls for a holding of unconstitutionality only if the inequality is based on an impermissible standard may this court condemn it

what then is the basis for the claim made in this case that the distribution of state senators and representatives is the product of capriciousness or of some constitutionally prohibited policy it is not that tennessee has arranged its electoral districts with a deliberate purpose to dilute the voting strength of one race cf gomillion v lightfoot 364 u s 339 or that some religious group is intentionally underrepresented nor is it a charge that the legislature has indulged in sheer caprice by allotting representatives to each county on the basis of a throw of the dice or of some other determinant bearing no rational relation to the question of apportionment rather the claim is that the state legislature has unreasonably retained substantially the same allocation of senators and representatives as was established by statute in 1901 refusing to recognize the great shift in the population balance between urban and rural communities that has occurred in the meantime

it is further alleged that even as of 1901 the apportionment was invalid in that it did not allocate state legislators among the counties in accordance with the formula set out in art ii  5 of the tennessee constitution in support of this the appellants have furnished a table which indicates that as of 1901 six counties were overrepresented and 11 were underrepresented but that table in fact shows nothing in the way of significant discrepancy in the instance of each county it is only one representative who is either lacking or added and it is further perfectly evident that the variations are attributable to nothing more than the circumstance that the then enumeration of voters resulted in fractional remainders with respect to which the precise formula of the tennessee constitution was in some 336 instances slightly disregarded unless such de minimis departures are to be deemed of significance these statistics certainly provide no substantiation for the charge that the 1901 apportionment was arbitrary and capricious indeed they show the contrary

thus reduced to its essentials the charge of arbitrariness and capriciousness rests entirely on the consistent refusal of the tennessee legislature over the past 60 years to alter a pattern of apportionment that was reasonable when conceived

a federal district court is asked to say that the passage of time has rendered the 1901 apportionment obsolete to the point where its continuance becomes vulnerable under the fourteenth amendment but is not this matter one that involves a classic legislative judgment surely it lies within the province of a state legislature to conclude that an existing allocation of senators and representatives constitutes a desirable balance of geographical and demographical representation or that in the interest of stability of government it would be best to defer for some further time the redistribution of seats in the state legislature

indeed i would hardly think it unconstitutional if a state legislatures expressed reason for establishing or maintaining an electoral imbalance between its rural and urban population were to protect the states agricultural interests from the sheer weight of numbers of those residing in its cities a state may after all take account of the interests of its rural population in the distribution of tax burdens e g american sugar rfg co v louisiana 179 u s 89 and recognition of the special problems of agricultural interests has repeatedly been reflected in federal legislation e g cappervolstead act 42 stat 388 agricultural adjustment act of 1938 52 stat 31 even the exemption of agricultural activities from state criminal statutes of otherwise general application has not been deemed offensive to the equal protection clause 337 tigner v texas 310 u s 141 does the fourteenth amendment impose a stricter limitation upon a states apportionment of political representatives to its central government i think not these are matters of local policy on the wisdom of which the federal judiciary is neither permitted nor qualified to sit in judgment

the suggestion of my brother frankfurter that courts lack standards by which to decide such cases as this is relevant not only to the question of justiciability but also and perhaps more fundamentally to the determination whether any cognizable constitutional claim has been asserted in this case courts are unable to decide when it is that an apportionment originally valid becomes void because the factors entering into such a decision are basically matters appropriate only for legislative judgment and so long as there exists a possible rational legislative policy for retaining an existing apportionment such a legislative decision cannot be said to breach the bulwark against arbitrariness and caprice that the fourteenth amendment affords certainly with all due respect the facile arithmetical argument contained in part ii of my brother clarks separate opinion ante pp 253258 provides no tenable basis for considering that there has been such a breach in this instance see the appendix to this opinion

these conclusions can hardly be escaped by suggesting that capricious state action might be found were it to appear that a majority of the tennessee legislators in refusing to consider reapportionment had been actuated by selfinterest in perpetuating their own political offices or by other unworthy or improper motives since fletcher v peck 6 cranch 87 was decided many years ago it has repeatedly been pointed out that it is not the business of the federal courts to inquire into the personal motives of legislators e g arizona v california 283 u s 423 455  n 7 the function of the federal judiciary ends in 338 matters of this kind once it appears as i think it does here on the undisputed facts that the state action complained of could have rested on some rational basis see the appendix to this opinion

it is my view that the majority opinion has failed to point to any recognizable constitutional claim alleged in this complaint indeed it is interesting to note that my brother stewart is at pains to disclaim for himself and to point out that the majority opinion does not suggest that the federal constitution requires of the states any particular kind of electoral apportionment still less that they must accord to each voter approximately equal voting strength concurring opinion ante p 265 but that being so what may it be asked is left of this complaint surely the bare allegations that the existing tennessee apportionment is incorrect arbitrary obsolete and unconstitutionalamounting to nothing more than legal conclusionsdo not themselves save the complaint from dismissal see snowden v hughes 321 u s 1 collins v hardyman 341 u s 651 nor do those allegations shift to the appellees the burden of proving the constitutionality of this state statute as is so correctly emphasized by my brother stewart ante p 266 this court has consistently held in cases arising under the equal protection clause that  the burden of establishing the unconstitutionality of a statute rests on him who assails it metropolitan casualty ins co v brownell 294 u s 580 584 emphasis added moreover the appellants do not suggest that they could show at a trial anything beyond the matters previously discussed in this opinion which add up to nothing in the way of a supportable constitutional challenge against this statute and finally the majoritys failure to come to grips with the question whether the complaint states a claim cognizable under the federal constitutionan issue necessarily presented by appellees motion to dismiss 339 does not of course furnish any ground for permitting this action to go to trial

from a reading of the majority and concurring opinions one will not find it difficult to catch the premises that underlie this decision the fact that the appellants have been unable to obtain political redress of their asserted grievances appears to be regarded as a matter which should lead the court to stretch to find some basis for judicial intervention while the equal protection clause is invoked the opinion for the court notably eschews explaining how consonant with past decisions the undisputed facts in this case can be considered to show a violation of that constitutional provision the majority seems to have accepted the argument pressed at the bar that if this court merely asserts authority in this field tennessee and other malapportioning states will quickly respond with appropriate political action so that this court need not be greatly concerned about the federal courts becoming further involved in these matters at the same time the majority has wholly failed to reckon with what the future may hold in store if this optimistic prediction is not fulfilled thus what the court is doing reflects more an adventure in judicial experimentation than a solid piece of constitutional adjudication whether dismissal of this case should have been for want of jurisdiction or as is suggested in bell v hood 327 u s 678 682683 for failure of the complaint to state a claim upon which relief could be granted the judgment of the district court was correct

in conclusion it is appropriate to say that one need not agree as a citizen with what tennessee has done or failed to do in order to deprecate as a judge what the majority is doing today those observers of the court who see it primarily as the last refuge for the correction of all inequality or injustice no matter what its nature or source will no doubt applaud this decision and its break 340 with the past those who consider that continuing national respect for the courts authority depends in large measure upon its wise exercise of selfrestraint and discipline in constitutional adjudication will view the decision with deep concern

i would affirmappendix to opinion of mr justice harlanthe inadequacy of arithmetical formulas as measures of the rationality of tennessees apportionmenttwo of the three separate concurring opinions appear to concede that the equal protection clause does not guarantee to each state voter a vote of approximately equal weight for the state legislature whether the existing tennessee apportionment is constitutional is recognized to depend only on whether it can find any possible justification in rationality ante p 265 it is to be struck down only if the discrimination here does not fit any pattern ante p 258

one of the concurring opinions that of my brother stewart suggests no reasons which would justify a finding that the present distribution of state legislators is unconstitutionally arbitrary the same is true of the majority opinion my brother clark on the other hand concludes that the apportionment picture in tennessee is a topsyturvical of gigantic proportions ante p 254 solely on the basis of certain statistics presented in the text of his separate opinion and included in a more extensive table appended thereto in my view that analysis is defective not only because the total representation formula set out in footnote 7 of the opinion ante p 255 rests on faulty mathematical foundations but more basically because the approach taken wholly 341 ignores all other factors justifying a legislative determination of the sort involved in devising a proper apportionment for a state legislature

in failing to take any of such other matters into account and in focusing on a particular mathematical formula which as will be shown is patently unsound my brother clarks opinion has i submit unwittingly served to bring into basrelief the very reasons that support the view that this complaint does not state a claim on which relief could be granted for in order to warrant holding a state electoral apportionment invalid under the equal protection clause a court in line with wellestablished constitutional doctrine must find that none of the permissible policies and none of the possible formulas on which it might have been based could rationally justify particular inequalitiesiat the outset it cannot be denied that the apportionment rules explicitly set out in the tennessee constitution are rational these rules are based on the following obviously permissible policy determinations 1 to utilize counties as electoral units 2 to prohibit the division of any county in the composition of electoral districts 3 to allot to each county that has a substantial voting populationat least twothirds of the average voting population per countya separate direct representative 4 to create floterial districts multicounty representative districts made up of more than one county and 5 to require that such districts be composed of adjoining counties1 such a framework unavoidably 342 leads to unreliable arithmetic inequalities under any mathematical formula whereby the counties total representation is sought to be measured it particularly results in egregiously deceptive disparities if the formula proposed in my brother clarks opinion is applied

that formula computes a countys total representation by adding 1 the number of direct representatives the county is entitled to elect 2 a fraction of any other seats in the tennessee house which are allocated to that county jointly with one or more others in a floterial district 3 triple the number of senators the county is entitled to elect alone and 4 triple a fraction of any seats in the tennessee senate which are allocated to that county jointly with one or more others in a multicounty senatorial district the fractions used for items 2 and 4 are computed by allotting to each county in a combined district an equal share of the house or senate seat regardless of the voting population of each of the counties that make up the election district2
343 this formula is patently deficient in that it eliminates from consideration the relative voting power of the counties that are joined together in a single election district as a result the formula unrealistically assigns to moore county onethird of a senator in addition to its direct representative ante p 255 although it must be obvious that moores voting strength in the eighteenth senatorial district is almost negligible since moore county could cast only 2340 votes of a total eligible vote of 30478 in the senatorial district it should in truth be considered as represented by onefifteenth of a senator assuming arguendo that any total representation figure is of significance moores total representation should be 123 not 23

the formula suggested by my brother clark must be adjusted regardless whether one thinks as i assuredly do not that the federal constitution requires that each vote be given equal weight the correction is necessary simply to reflect the real facts of political life it may of course be true that the floterial representatives function 344 is to represent the whole district ante p 256 but can it be gainsaid that so long as elections within the district are decided not by a countyunit system in which each county casts one vote but by adding the total number of individual votes cast for each candidate the concern of the elected representatives will primarily be with the most populous counties in the districtiii do not mean to suggest that any mathematical formula albeit an adjusted one would be a proper touchstone to measure the rationality of the present or of appellants proposed apportionment plan for as the table appended to my brother clarks opinion so conclusively shows whether one applies the formula he suggests or one that is adjusted to reflect proportional voting strength within an election district no plan of apportionment consistent with the principal policies of the tennessee constitution could provide proportionately equal total representation for each of tennessees 95 counties

the pattern suggested by the appellants in exhibits a and b attached to their complaint is said to be a fair distribution which accords with the tennessee constitution and under which each of the election districts represents approximately equal voting population but even when tested by the adjusted formula the plan reveals gross total representation disparities that would make it appear to be a crazy quilt for example loudon county with twice the voting population of humphreys county would have less representation than humphreys and about onethird the representation of warren county which has only 73 more voters among the more populous counties similar discrepancies would appear although anderson county has only somewhat over 10 more voters than blount county it would have 345 approximately 75 more representation and blount would have approximately twothirds the representation of montgomery county which has about 13 less voters4iiithe fault with a purely statistical approach to the case at hand lies not with the particular mathematical formula used but in the failure to take account of the fact that a multitude of legitimate legislative policies along with circumstances of geography and demography could account for the seeming electoral disparities among counties the principles set out in the tennessee constitution are just some of those that were deemed significant others may have been considered and accepted by those entrusted with the responsibility for tennessees apportionment and for the purposes of judging constitutionality under the equal protection clause it must be remembered that what is controlling on the issue of rationality is not what the state legislature may actually have considered but what it may be deemed to have considered

for example in the list of horribles cited by my brother clark ante p 255 all the underrepresented counties are semiurban all contain municipalities of over 10000 population5 this is not to say however that the 346 presence of any such municipality within a county necessarily demands that its proportional representation be reduced in order to render it consistent with an urban versus rural plan of apportionment other considerations may intervene and outweigh the legislatures desire to distribute seats so as to achieve a proper balance between urban and rural interests the size of a county in terms of its total area may be a factor6 or the location within a county of some major industry may be thought to call for dilution of voting strength7 again the combination of certain smaller counties with their more heavily populated neighbors in senatorial or floterial districts may result in apparent arithmetic inequalities8

more broadly the disparities in electoral strength among the various counties in tennessee both those relied upon by my brother clark and others may be 347 accounted for by various economic9 political10 and geographic11 considerations no allegation is made by the appellants that the existing apportionment is the result of any other forces than are always at work in any legislative process and the record briefs and arguments in this court themselves attest to the fact that the appellants could put forward nothing further at a trial

by disregarding the wide variety of permissible legislative considerations that may enter into a state electoral apportionment my brother clark has turned a highly complex process into an elementary arithmetical puzzle 348 it is only by blinking reality that such an analysis can stand and that the essentially legislative determination can be made the subject of judicial inquiryivapart from such policies as those suggested which would suffice to justify particular inequalities there is a further consideration which could rationally have led the tennessee legislature in the exercise of a deliberate choice to maintain the status quo rigidity of an apportionment pattern may be as much a legislative policy decision as is a provision for periodic reapportionment in the interest of stability a state may write into its fundamental law a permanent distribution of legislators among its various election districts thus forever ignoring shifts in population indeed several states have achieved this result by providing for minimum and maximum representation from various political subdivisions such as counties districts cities or towns see harvey reapportionments of state legislatures legal requirements 17 law  contemp probs 1952 364 368372

it is said that one cannot find any rational standard in what the tennessee legislature has failed to do over the past 60 years but surely one need not search far to find rationality in the legislatures continued refusal to recognize the growth of the urban population that has accompanied the development of industry over the past half decade the existence of slight disparities between rural areas does not overcome the fact that the foremost apparent legislative motivation has been to preserve the electoral strength of the rural interests notwithstanding shifts in population and i understand it to be conceded by at least some of the majority that this policy is not 349 rendered unconstitutional merely because it favors rural voters

once the electoral apportionment process is recognized for what it isthe product of legislative giveandtake and of compromise among policies that often conflict the relevant constitutional principles at once put these appellants out of the federal courtsnotes1  public acts of tennessee c 122 1901 now tenn code ann  3101 to 3107 the full text of the 1901 act as amended appears in an appendix to this opinion post p 237

while the tennessee constitution speaks of the number of qualified voters the exhibits attached to the complaint use figures based on the number of persons 21 years of age and over this basis seems to have been employed by the general assembly in apportioning legislative seats from the outset the 1870 statute providing for the first enumeration acts of 1870 1st sess c 107 directed the courts of the several counties to select a commissioner to enumerate all the male inhabitants of their respective counties who are twentyone years of age and upward who shall be resident citizens of their counties on the first day of january 1871     reports compiled in the several counties on this basis were submitted to the general assembly by the secretary of state and were used in the first apportionment appendix to tenn s j 1871 4143 yet such figures would not reflect the numbers of persons qualified to exercise the franchise under the thengoverning qualifications a citizenship b residence in the state 12 months and in the county 6 months c payment of poll taxes for the preceding year unless entitled to exemption acts of 1870 2d sess c 10 these qualifications continued at least until after 1901 see shan tenn code ann  1167 1220 1896 supp 1904 still when the general assembly directed the secretary of state to do all he could to obtain complete reports from the counties the resolution spoke broadly of the impossibility of    redistricting without the census returns of the voting population from each county     tenn s j 1871 4647 96 the figures also showed a correlation with federal census figures for 1870 the census reported 259016 male citizens 21 and upward in tennessee ninth census of the united states 1870 statistics of the population 635 1872 the tennessee secretary of states report with 15 counties not reported gave a figure of 237431 using the numbers of actual votes in the last gubernatorial election for those 15 counties the secretary arrived at a total of 250025 appendix to tenn s j 1871 4143 this and subsequent history indicate continued reference to census figures and finally in 1901 abandonment of a state enumeration in favor of the use of census figures see notes 7 8 9 infra see also williams legislative apportionment in tennessee 20 tenn l rev 235 236 n 6 it would therefore appear that unless there is a contrary showing at the trial appellants current figures taken from the united states census reports are apposite

14  the appellants claim that no general assembly constituted according to the 1901 act will submit reapportionment proposals either to the people or to a constitutional convention there is no provision for popular initiative in tennessee amendments proposed in the senate or house must first be approved by a majority of all members of each house and again by twothirds of the members in the general assembly next chosen the proposals are then submitted to the people at the next general election in which a governor is to be chosen alternatively the legislature may submit to the people at any general election the question of calling a convention to consider specified proposals such as are adopted at a convention do not however become effective unless approved by a majority of the qualified voters voting separately on each proposed change or amendment at an election fixed by the convention conventions shall not be held oftener than once in six years tenn const art xi  3 acts of 1951 c 130  3 and acts of 1957 c 340  3 provided that delegates to the 1953 and 1959 conventions were to be chosen from the counties and floterial districts just as are members of the state house of representatives the general assemblys call for a 1953 constitutional convention originally contained a provision relating to the appointment sic of representatives and senators but this was excised tenn h j 1951 784 a resolution introduced at the 1959 constitutional convention and reported unfavorably by the rules committee of the convention was as follows

by mr chambliss of hamilton county resolution no 12 relative to convention considering reapportionment which is as follows

whereas there is a rumor that this limited convention has been called for the purpose of postponing for six years a convention that would make a decision as to reapportionment and

whereas there is pending in the united states courts in tennessee a suit under which parties are seeking through decree to compel reapportionment and

whereas it is said that this limited convention which was called for limited consideration is yet a constitutional convention within the language of the constitution as to constitutional conventions forbidding frequent conventions in the last sentence of article eleven section 3 second paragraph more often than each six years towit

no such convention shall be held oftener than once in six years

now therefore be it resolved that it is the consensus of opinion of the members of this convention that since this is a limited convention as hereinbefore set forth another convention could be had if it did not deal with the matters submitted to this limited convention

be it further resolved that it is the consensus of opinion of this convention that a convention should be called by the general assembly for the purpose of considering reapportionment in order that a possibility of court enforcement being forced on the sovereign state of tennessee by the courts of the national government may be avoided

be it further resolved that this convention be adjourned for two years to meet again at the same time set forth in the statute providing for this convention and that it is the consensus of opinion of this body that it is within the power of the next general assembly of tennessee to broaden the powers of this convention and to authorize and empower this convention to consider a proper amendment to the constitution that will provide when submitted to the electorate a method of reapportionment tenn constitutional convention of 1959 the journal and debates 35 278

15  it is clear that appellants federal constitutional claims rest exclusively on alleged violation of the fourteenth amendment their primary claim is that the 1901 statute violates the equal protection clause of that amendment there are allegations invoking the due process clause but from the argument and the exhibits it appears that the due process clause argument is directed at certain tax statutes insofar as the claim involves the validity of those statutes under the due process clause we find it unnecessary to decide its merits and if the allegations regarding the tax statutes are designed as the framework for proofs as to the effects of the allegedly discriminatory apportionment we need not rely upon them to support our holding that the complaint states a federal constitutional claim of violation of the equal protection clause whether when the issue to be decided is one of the constitutional adequacy of this particular apportionment taxation arguments and exhibits as now presented add anything or whether they could add anything however presented is for the district court in the first instance to decide

the complaint in addition to the claims under the federal constitution also alleges rights and the general assemblys duties under the tennessee constitution since we hold that appellants haveif it develops at trial that the facts support the allegationsa cognizable federal constitutional cause of action resting in no degree on rights guaranteed or putatively guaranteed by the tennessee constitution we do not consider let alone enforce rights under a state constitution which go further than the protections of the fourteenth amendment lastly we need not assess the legal significance in reaching our conclusion of the statements of the complaint that the apportionment effected today under the 1901 act is contrary to the philosophy of government in the united states and all anglosaxon jurisprudence    

16  we need not reach the question of indispensable parties because the district court has not yet decided it

17  the accuracy of calling even such dismissals jurisdictional was questioned in bell v hood see 327 u s at 683

18  42 u s c  1983 provides every person who under color of any statute ordinance regulation custom or usage of any state or territory subjects or causes to be subjected any citizen of the united states or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights privileges or immunities secured by the constitution and laws shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law suit in equity or other proper proceeding for redress

19  this court has frequently sustained district court jurisdiction under 28 u s c  1343 3 or its predecessors to entertain suits to redress deprivations of rights secured against state infringement by the equal protection and due process clauses of the fourteenth amendment douglas v jeannette 319 u s 157 stefanelli v minard 342 u s 117 cf nixon v herndon 273 u s 536 nixon v condon 286 u s 73 snowden v hughes 321 u s 1 smith v allwright 321 u s 649 monroe v pape 365 u s 167 egan v aurora 365 u s 514

20  since that case was not brought to the court until after the election had been held the court cited not only wood v broom but also directed dismissal for mootness citing brownlow v schwartz 261 u s 216

21  compare boeing aircraft co v king county 330 u s 803 the appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction see coleman v miller 307 u s 433 440

22  matthews did affirm a judgment that may be read as a dismissal for want of jurisdiction 179 f supp 470 however the motion to affirm also rested on the ground of failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted cf text following on macdougall v green and see text infra p 236

24  the complaint also contains an averment that the appellants sue on their own behalf and on behalf of all other voters in the state of tennessee emphasis added this may be read to assert a claim that voters in counties allegedly overrepresented in the general assembly also have standing to complain but it is not necessary to decide that question in this case

25  the duties of the respective appellees are alleged to be as follows

defendant joe c carr is the duly elected qualified and acting secretary of state of the state of tennessee with his office in nashville in said state and as such he is charged with the duty of furnishing blanks envelopes and information slips to the county election commissioners certifying the results of elections and maintaining the records thereof and he is further ex officio charged together with the governor and the attorney general with the duty of examining the election returns received from the county election commissioners and declaring the election results by the applicable provisions of the tennessee code annotated and by chapter 164 of the acts of 1949 inter alia

defendant george f mccanless is the duly appointed and acting attorney general of the state of tennessee with his office in nashville in said state and is charged with the duty of advising the officers of the state upon the law and is made by section 231107 of the tennessee code annotated a necessary party defendant in any declaratory judgment action where the constitutionality of statutes of the state of tennessee is attacked and he is exofficio charged together with the governor and the secretary of state with the duty of declaring the election results under section 2140 of the tennessee code annotated

defendant jerry mcdonald is the duly appointed coordinator of elections in the state of tennessee with his office in nashville tennessee and as such official is charged with the duties set forth in the public law enacted by the 1959 general assembly of tennessee creating said office

defendant dr sam coward james alexander and hubert brooks are the duly appointed and qualified members constituting the state board of elections and as such they are charged with the duty of appointing the election commissioners for all the counties of the state of tennessee the organization and supervision of the biennial elections as provided by the statutes of tennessee chapter 9 of title 2 of the tennessee code annotated sections 2901 et seq

that this action is brought against the aforenamed defendants in their representative capacities and that said election commissioners are sued also as representatives of all of the county election commissioners in the state of tennessee such persons being so numerous as to make it impracticable to bring them all before the court that there is a common question of law involved namely the constitutionality of tennessee laws set forth in the tennessee code annotated section 3101 through section 3109 inclusive that common relief is sought against all members of said election commissions in their official capacities it being the duties of the aforesaid county election commissioners within their respective jurisdictions to appoint the judges of elections to maintain the registry of qualified voters of said county certify the results of elections held in said county to the defendants state board of elections and secretary of state and of preparing ballots and taking other steps to prepare for and hold elections in said counties by virtue of sections 21201 et seq of tennessee code annotated and section 2301 et seq of tennessee code annotated and chapter 164 of the acts of 1949 inter alia

the question whether the named defendants are sufficient parties remains open for consideration on remand

27  mr justice rutledge was of the view that any question of standing was settled in smiley v holm supra mr justice black stated that appellants had standing to sue since the facts alleged show that they have been injured as individuals he relied on coleman v miller 307 u s 433 438 467 see 328 u s 564 568

commentators have suggested that the following statement in mr justice frankfurters opinion might imply a view that appellants there had no standing this is not an action to recover for damage because of the discriminatory exclusion of a plaintiff from rights enjoyed by other citizens the basis for the suit is not a private wrong but a wrong suffered by illinois as a polity 328 u s at 552 see jaffe standing to secure judicial review public actions 74 harv l rev 1265 1298 1961 lewis legislative apportionment and the federal courts 71 harv l rev 1057 10811083 1958 but since the opinion goes on to consider the merits it seems that this statement was not intended to intimate any view that the plaintiffs in that action lacked standing nor do the cases cited immediately after the above quotation deal with standing see especially lane v wilson 307 u s 268 272273

43  this case so frequently cited for the broad proposition that the status of an indian tribe is a matter for the political departments is in fact a noteworthy example of the limited and precise impact of a political question the cherokees brought an original suit in this court to enjoin georgias assertion of jurisdiction over cherokee territory and abolition of cherokee government and laws unquestionably the case lay at the vortex of most fiery political embroilment see 1 warren the supreme court in united states history rev ed 729779 but in spite of some broader language in separate opinions all that the court held was that it possessed no original jurisdiction over the suit for the cherokees could in no view be considered either a state of this union or a foreign state chief justice marshall treated the question as one of de novo interpretation of words in the constitution the chief justice did say that the acts of our government plainly recognize the cherokee nation as a state and the courts are bound by those acts but here he referred to their existence as a state as a distinct political society separated from others     from there he went to a question of much more difficulty     do the cherokees constitute a foreign state in the sense of the constitution id at 16 thus while the court referred to the political for the decision whether the tribe was an entity a separate polity it held that whether being an entity the tribe had such status as to be entitled to sue originally was a judicially soluble issue criteria were discoverable in relevant phrases of the constitution and in the common understanding of the times as to this issue the court was not hampered by problems of the management of unusual evidence or of possible interference with a congressional program moreover chief justice marshalls dictum that it savours too much of the exercise of political power to be within the proper province of the judicial department id at 20 was not addressed to the issue of the cherokees status to sue but rather to the breadth of the claim asserted and the impropriety of the relief sought compare georgia v stanton 6 wall 50 77 the chief justice made clear that if the issue of the cherokees rights arose in a customary legal context a proper case with proper parties it would be justiciable thus when the same dispute produced a case properly brought in which the right asserted was one of protection under federal treaties and laws from conflicting state law and the relief sought was the voiding of a conviction under that state law the court did void the conviction worcester v georgia 6 pet 515 there the fact that the tribe was a separate polity served as a datum contributing to the result and despite the consequences in a heated federalstate controversy and the opposition of the other branches of the national government the judicial power acted to reverse the state supreme court an example of similar isolation of a political question in the decision of a case is luther v borden 7 how 1 see infra

48  even though the court wrote of unrestrained legislative and executive authority under this guaranty thus making its enforcement a political question the court plainly implied that the political question barrier was no absolute unquestionably a military government established as the permanent government of the state would not be a republican government and it would be the duty of congress to overthrow it 7 how at 45 of course it does not necessarily follow that if congress did not act the court would for while the judiciary might be able to decide the limits of the meaning of republican form and thus the factor of lack of criteria might fall away there would remain other possible barriers to decision because of primary commitment to another branch which would have to be considered in the particular fact setting presented

that was not the only occasion on which this court indicated that lack of criteria does not obliterate the guarantys extreme limits the guaranty is of a republican form of government no particular government is designated as republican neither is the exact form to be guaranteed in any manner especially designated here as in other parts of the instrument we are compelled to resort elsewhere to ascertain what was intended

the guaranty necessarily implies a duty on the part of the states themselves to provide such a government all the states had governments when the constitution was adopted in all the people participated to some extent through their representatives elected in the manner specially provided these governments the constitution did not change they were accepted precisely as they were and it is therefore to be presumed that they were such as it was the duty of the states to provide thus we have unmistakable evidence of what was republican in form within the meaning of that term as employed in the constitution minor v happersett 21 wall 162 175176 there the question was whether a government republican in form could deny the vote to women

in re duncan 139 u s 449 upheld a murder conviction against a claim that the relevant codes had been invalidly enacted the court there said

by the constitution a republican form of government is guaranteed to every state in the union and the distinguishing feature of that form is the right of the people to choose their own officers for governmental administration and pass their own laws in virtue of the legislative power reposed in representative bodies whose legitimate acts may be said to be those of the people themselves but while the people are thus the source of political power their governments national and state have been limited by written constitutions and they have themselves thereby set bounds to their own power as against the sudden impulses of mere majorities 139 u s at 461 but the court did not find any of these fundamental principles violated

52  in mississippi v johnson 4 wall 475 the state sought to enjoin the president from executing the acts alleging that his role was purely ministerial the court held that the duties were in no sense ministerial and that although the state sought to compel inaction rather than action the absolute lack of precedent for any such distinction left the case one in which general principles    forbid judicial interference with the exercise of executive discretion 4 wall at 499 see also mississippi v stanton 154 u s 554 and see 2 warren the supreme court in united states history rev ed 463

57  the courts opinion was joined by mr justice douglas noting his adherence to the dissents in colegrove and south v peters supra and the judgment was concurred in by mr justice whittaker who wrote that the decision should rest on the equal protection clause rather than on the fifteenth amendment since there had been not solely a denial of the vote if there had been that at all but also a fencing out of a racial group

no constitutional questions including the question whether voters have a judicially enforceable constitutional right to vote at elections of congressmen from districts of equal population were decided in colegrove six of the participating justices reached the questions but divided three to three on their merits mr justice rutledge believed that it was not necessary to decide them he said there is an alternative to constitutional decision in this case and i think the gravity of the constitutional questions raised so great together with the possibilities for collision with the political departments of the government that the admonition against avoidable constitutional decision is appropriate to be followed here other reasons support this view including the fact that in my opinion the basic ruling and less important ones in smiley v holm supra would otherwise be brought into question 328 u s at 564565 he also joined with his brethren who shared his view that the issues were justiciable in considering that wood v broom 287 u s 1 decided no constitutional questions but the court disposed of the cause on the ground that the 1929 reapportionment act 46 stat 21 did not carry forward the requirements of the 1911 act 37 stat 13 and declined to decide whether there was equity in the bill 328 u s at 565 see also id at 573 we agree with this view of wood v broom

in joining the opinion i do not approve those decisions but only construe the courts opinion in this case as stating an accurate historical account of what the prior cases have held

2  the statements in luther v borden 7 how 1 42 that this guaranty is enforceable only by congress or the chief executive is not maintainable of course the chief executive not the court determines how a state will be protected against invasion of course each house of congress not the court is the judge of the elections returns and qualifications of its own members article i section 5 clause 1 but the abdication of all judicial functions respecting voting rights 7 how at 41 however justified by the peculiarities of the charter form of government in rhode island at the time of dorrs rebellion states no general principle it indeed is contrary to the cases discussed in the body of this opinionthe modern decisions of the court that give the full panoply of judicial protection to voting rights today we would not say with chief justice taney that it is no part of the judicial function to protect the right to vote of those to whom it is denied by the written and established constitution and laws of the state ibid

moreover the courts refusal to examine the legality of the regime of martial law which had been laid upon rhode island id at 4546 is indefensible as mr justice woodbury maintained in his dissent id at 59 et seq today we would ask with him    who could hold for a moment when the writ of habeas corpus cannot be suspended by the legislature itself either in the general government or most of the states without an express constitutional permission that all other writs and laws could be suspended and martial law substituted for them over the whole state or country without any express constitutional license to that effect in any emergency id at 67

justice woodbury went on to say

it would be alarming enough to sanction here an unlimited power exercised either by legislatures or the executive or courts when all our governments are themselves governments of limitations and checks and of fixed and known laws and the people a race above all others jealous of encroachments by those in power and it is far better that those persons should be without the protection of the ordinary laws of the land who disregard them in an emergency and should look to a grateful country for indemnity and pardon than to allow beforehand the whole frame of jurisprudence to be overturned and every thing placed at the mercy of the bayonet

no tribunal or department in our system of governments ever can be lawfully authorized to dispense with the laws like some of the tyrannical stuarts or to repeal or abolish or suspend the whole body of them or in other words appoint an unrestrained military dictator at the head of armed men

whatever stretches of such power may be ventured on in great crises they cannot be upheld by the laws as they prostrate the laws and ride triumphant over and beyond them however the assembly of rhode island under the exigency may have hastily supposed that such a measure in this instance was constitutional it is but a branch of the omnipotence claimed by parliament to pass bills of attainder belonging to the same dangerous and arbitrary family with martial law id at 6970

what he wrote was later to become the tradition as expressed by chief justice hughes in sterling v constantin 287 u s 378 401 what are the allowable limits of military discretion and whether or not they have been overstepped in a particular case are judicial questions

3  the category of the political question is in my view narrower than the decided cases indicate even the english courts have held that a resolution of one house of parliament does not change the law stockdale v hansard 1839 9 a  e 1 and bowles v bank of england no 2 1913 1 ch 57 and these decisions imply that the house of commons acting alone does not constitute the parliament recognized by the english courts 103 sol jour 995 996 the court in bowles v bank of england 1913 1 ch 57 8485 stated by the statute 1 w  m usually known as the bill of rights it was finally settled that there could be no taxation in this country except under authority of an act of parliament the bill of rights still remains unrepealed and no practice or custom however prolonged or however acquiesced in on the part of the subject can be relied on by the crown as justifying any infringement of its provisions it follows that with regard to the powers of the crown to levy taxation no resolution either of the committee for ways and means or of the house itself has any legal effect whatever such resolutions are necessitated by a parliamentary procedure adopted with a view to the protection of the subject against the hasty imposition of taxes and it would be strange to find them relied on as justifying the crown in levying a tax before such tax is actually imposed by act of parliament

in the pocket veto case 279 u s 655 the court undertook a review of the veto provisions of the constitution and concluded that the measure in litigation had not become a law cf coleman v miller 307 u s 433

georgia v stanton 6 wall 50 involved the application of the reconstruction acts to georgialaws which destroyed by force the internal regime of that state yet the court refused to take jurisdiction that question was no more political than a host of others we have entertained see e g pennsylvania v west virginia 262 u s 553 youngstown sheet  tube co v sawyer 343 u s 579 alabama v texas 347 u s 272

today would this court hold nonjusticiable or political a suit to enjoin a governor who like fidel castro takes everything into his own hands and suspends all election laws

georgia v stanton supra expresses a philosophy at war with ex parte milligan 4 wall 2 and duncan v kahanamoku 327 u s 304 the dominance of the civilian authority has been expressed from the beginning see wise v withers 3 cranch 331 337 sterling v constantin supra note 2

4  we are told by the national institute of municipal law officers in an amicus brief

regardless of the fact that in the last two decades the united states has become a predominantly urban country where well over twothirds of the population now lives in cities or suburbs political representation in the majority of state legislatures is 50 or more years behind the times apportionments made when the greater part of the population was located in rural communities are still determining and undermining our elections

as a consequence the municipality of 1960 is forced to function in a horse and buggy environment where there is little political recognition of the heavy demands of an urban population these demands will become even greater by 1970 when some 150 million people will be living in urban areas

the national institute of municipal law officers has for many years recognized the widespread complaint that by far the greatest preponderance of state representatives and senators are from rural areas which in the main fail to become vitally interested in the increasing difficulties now facing urban administrators

since world war ii the explosion in city and suburban population has created intense local problems in education transportation and housing adequate handling of these problems has not been possible to a large extent due chiefly to the political weakness of municipalities this situation is directly attributable to considerable underrepresentation of cities in the legislatures of most states amicus brief pp 23

5  the recent ruling by the iowa supreme court that a legislature though elected under an unfair apportionment scheme is nonetheless a legislature empowered to act cedar rapids v cox 252 iowa 948 964 108 n w 2d 253 262263 cf kidd v mccanless 200 tenn 273 292 s w 2d 40 is plainly correct

there need be no fear of a more disastrous collision between federal and state agencies here than where a federal court enjoins gerrymandering based on racial lines see gomillion v lightfoot supra

the district court need not undertake a complete reapportionment it might possibly achieve the goal of substantial equality merely by directing respondent to eliminate the egregious injustices or its conclusion that reapportionment should be made may in itself stimulate legislative action that was the result in asbury park press v woolley 33 n j 1 161 a 2d 705 where the state court ruled it had jurisdiction

if by reason of passage of time and changing conditions the reapportionment statute no longer serves its original purpose of securing to the voter the full constitutional value of his franchise and the legislative branch fails to take appropriate restorative action the doors of the courts must be open to him the lawmaking body cannot by inaction alter the constitutional system under which it has its own existence 33 n j at 14 161 a 2d at 711 the court withheld its decision on the merits in order that the legislature might have an opportunity to consider adoption of a reapportionment act for the sequel see application of lamb 67 n j super 39 4647 169 a 2d 822 825826

reapportionment was also the result in magraw v donovan 159 f supp 901 where a federal threejudge district court took jurisdiction saying 163 f supp 184 187

here it is the unmistakable duty of the state legislature to reapportion itself periodically in accordance with recent population changes    early in january 1959 the 61st session of the minnesota legislature will convene all of the members of which will be newly elected on november 4th of this year the facts which have been presented to us will be available to them it is not to be presumed that the legislature will refuse to take such action as is necessary to comply with its duty under the state constitution we defer decision on all the issues presented including that of the power of this court to grant relief in order to afford the legislature full opportunity to heed the constitutional mandate to redistrict 

see 177 f supp 803 where the case was dismissed as moot the state legislature having actedclark concurrence footnotes1  the opinion stated at 551 that the court could also dispose of this case on the authority of wood v broom 287 u s 1 1932 wood v broom involved only the interpretation of a congressional reapportionment act

2  similarly the equal protection clause was not invoked in tedesco v board of supervisors 339 u s 940 1950

3  i do not read the later case of colegrove v barrett 330 u s 804 1947 as having rejected the equal protection argument adopted here that was merely a dismissal of an appeal where the equal protection point was mentioned along with attacks under three other constitutional provisions two congressional acts and three state constitutional provisions

4  georgia based its election system on a consistent combination of political units and population giving six unit votes to the eight most populous counties four unit votes to the 30 counties next in population and two unit votes to each of the remaining counties

5  see part i of the appendix to mr justice harlans dissent post p 341

6  it is suggested that the districting is not unconstitutional since it was established by a statute that was constitutional when passed some 60 years ago but many assembly sessions since that time have deliberately refused to change the original act and in any event a statute constitutionally valid when enacted may become invalid by change in the conditions to which it is applied nashville c  st l r co v walters 294 u s 405 415 1935

7  total representation indicates the combined representation in the state senate 33 members and the state house of representatives 99 members in the assembly of tennessee assuming a county has one representative it is credited in this calculation with 199 likewise if the same county has onethird of a senate seat it is credited with another 199 and thus such a county in our calculation would have a total representation of two if a county has one representative and onesixth of a senate seat it is credited with 1599 or 150 it is this last figure that i use here in an effort to make the comparisons clear the 1950 rather than the 1960 census of voting population is used to avoid the charge that use of 1960 tabulations might not have allowed sufficient time for the state to act however the 1960 picture is even more irrational than the 1950 one

8  of course this was not the case in the georgia county unit system south v peters supra or the illinois initiative plan macdougall v green supra where recognized political units having independent significance were given minimum political weight

9  it is interesting to note that state judges often rest their decisions on the ground that this court has precluded adjudication of the federal claim see e g scholle v secretary of state 360 mich 1 104 n w 2d 63 1960

  it is worth reminding that the problem of legislative apportionment is not one dividing north and south indeed in the present house of representatives for example michigans congressional districts are far less representative of the numbers of inhabitants according to the 1960 census than are louisianas michigans sixteenth district which is 931 urban contains 802994 persons and its twelfth which is 476 urban contains 177431onefifth as many persons louisianas most populous district the sixth is 536 urban and contains 536029 persons and its least populous the eighth 367 urban contains 263850nearly half gross disregard of any assumption that our political system implies even approximation to the notion that individual votes in the various districts within a state should have equal weight is as true e g of california illinois and ohio as it is of georgia see united states department of commerce census release february 24 1962 cb6223frankfurter dissent footnotes1  see wood v broom 287 u s 1 colegrove v green 328 u s 549 rehearing denied 329 u s 825 motion for reargument before the full bench denied 329 u s 828 cook v fortson 329 u s 675 rehearing denied 329 u s 829 turman v duckworth 329 u s 675 rehearing denied 329 u s 829 colegrove v barrett 330 u s 804 macdougall v green 335 u s 281 south v peters 339 u s 276 tedesco v board of supervisors 339 u s 940 remmey v smith 342 u s 916 cox v peters 342 u s 936 rehearing denied 343 u s 921 anderson v jordan 343 u s 912 kidd v mccanless 352 u s 920 radford v gary 352 u s 991 hartsfield v sloan 357 u s 916 matthews v handley 361 u s 127 perry v folsom 144 f supp 874 d c n d ala magraw v donovan 163 f supp 184 d c d minn cf dyer v kazuhisa abe 138 f supp 220 d c d hawaii and see keogh v neely 50 f 2d 685 c a 7th cir

sec 6 apportionment of senatorsthe number of senators shall at the several periods of making the enumeration be apportioned among the several counties or districts according to the number of qualified electors in each and shall not exceed onethird the number of representatives in apportioning the senators among the different counties the fraction that may be lost by any county or counties in the apportionment of members to the house of representatives shall be made up to such county or counties in the senate as near as may be practicable when a district is composed of two or more counties they shall be adjoining and no county shall be divided in forming a district

   for if this court is authorized to enter upon this inquiry as proposed by the plaintiff and it should be decided that the charter government had no legal existence during the period of time above mentionedif it had been annulled by the adoption of the opposing governmentthen the laws passed by its legislature during that time were nullities its taxes wrongfully collected its salaries and compensation to its officers illegally paid its public accounts improperly settled and the judgments and sentences of its courts in civil and criminal cases null and void and the officers who carried their decisions into operation answerable as trespassers if not in some cases as criminals

when the decision of this court might lead to such results it becomes its duty to examine very carefully its own powers before it undertakes to exercise jurisdiction

   the reapportionment process is by its very nature political   there will be politics in reapportionment as long as a representative form of government exists    

it is impossible to draw a district boundary line without that lines having some political significance

   a mere reading of the debates from the constitutional convention down to contemporary congresses on this question of apportionment reveals the conflicting interests of the large and small states and the extent to which partisan politics permeates the entire problem

mr kasem you do not think that that a provision embodying the language in as compact form as practicable might result in a decision depending upon the political inclinations of the judge

150  decisions of state courts which have entertained apportionment cases under their respective state constitutions do not of course involve the very different considerations relevant to federal judicial intervention statecourt adjudication does not involve the delicate problems of federalstate relations which would inhere in the exercise of federal judicial power to impose restrictions upon the states shaping of their own governmental institutions moreover state constitutions generally speak with a specificity totally lacking in attempted utilization of the generalities of the fourteenth amendment to apportionment matters some expressly commit apportionment to state judicial review see e g n y const 1938 art iii  5 and even where they do not they do precisely fix the criteria for judicial judgment respecting the allocation of representative strength within the electorate see e g asbury park press inc v woolley 33 n j 1 161 a 2d 705

151  appellants suggestion that although no relief may need be given jurisdiction ought to be retained as a spur to legislative action does not merit discussion

152  see note 24 supraharlan appendix footnotes1  the relevant provisions of the tennessee constitution are art ii  5 and 6

sec 5 apportionment of representativesthe number of representatives shall at the several periods of making the enumeration be apportioned among the several counties or districts according to the number of qualified voters in each and shall not exceed seventyfive until the population of the state shall be one million and a half and shall never exceed ninetynine provided that any county having twothirds of the ratio shall be entitled to one member

sec 6 apportionment of senatorsthe number of senators shall at the several periods of making the enumeration be apportioned among the several counties or districts according to the number of qualified electors in each and shall not exceed onethird the number of representatives in apportioning the senators among the different counties the fraction that may be lost by any county or counties in the apportionment of members to the house of representatives shall be made up to such county or counties in the senate as near as may be practicable when a district is composed of two or more counties they shall be adjoining and no counties shall be divided in forming a district

2  this formula is not clearly spelled out in the opinion but it is necessarily inferred from the figures that are presented knox county for example is said to have a total representation of 725 it elects 1 three direct representatives value 300 2 one representative from a twocounty district value 50 3 one direct senator value 300 and 4 one senator in a fourcounty district value 75 see appendix to opinion of mr justice clark ante pp 262264

3  if this adjusted formula for measuring total representation is applied to the other horribles cited in the concurring opinion ante p 255 it reveals that these countieswhich purportedly have equal total representation but distinctly unequal voting population do not have the same total representation at all rather than having the same representation as rutherford county moore county has only about 40 of what rutherford has decatur county has only 55 of the representation of carter county while loudon and anderson counties are substantially underrepresented this is because of their proximity to knox county which outweighs their votes in the sixth senatorial district and in the eighth floterial district

4  these disparities are as serious if not more so when my brother clarks formula is applied to the appellants proposal for example if the seven counties chosen by him as illustrative are examined as they would be represented under the appellants distribution moore county with a voting population of 2340 is given more electoral strength than decatur county with a voting population of 5563 carter county voting population 23302 has 20 more total representation than anderson county voting population 33990 and 33 more than rutherford county voting population 25316

5  murfreesboro rutherford county pop 16017 elizabethton carter county pop 10754 oak ridge anderson county pop 27387 tennessee blue book 1960 pp 143149

6  for example carter and washington counties are each approximately 60 as large as maury and madison counties in terms of square miles and this may explain the disparity between their total representation figures

7  for example in addition to being semiurban blount county is the location of the city of alcoa where the aluminum company of america has located a large aluminum smelting and rolling plant this may explain the difference between its total representation and that of gibson county which has no such large industry and contains no municipality as large as maryville

8  for example chester county voting population 6391 is one of those that is presently said to be overrepresented but under the appellants proposal chester would be combined with populous madison county in a floterial district and with four others including shelby county in a senatorial district consequently its total representation according to the appendix to my brother clarks opinion would be 19 ante p 262 this would have the effect of disenfranchising all the countys voters similarly rhea countys almost 9000 voters would find their voting strength so diluted as to be practically nonexistent

9  for example it is primarily the eastern portion of the state that is complaining of malapportionment along with the cities of memphis and nashville but the eastern section is where industry is principally located and where population density even outside the large urban areas is highest consequently if tennessee is apportioning in favor of its agricultural interests as constitutionally it was entitled to do it would necessarily reduce representation from the east

10  for example sound political reasons surely justify limiting the legislative chambers to workable numbers in tennessee the house is set at 99 and the senate at 33 it might have been deemed desirable therefore to set a ceiling on representation from any single county so as not to deprive others of individual representation the proportional discrepancies among the four counties with large urban centers may be attributable to a conscious policy of limiting representation in this manner

11  for example moore county is surrounded by four counties each of which has sufficient voting population to exceed twothirds of the average voting population per county which is the standard prescribed by the tennessee constitution for the assignment of a direct representative thus qualifying for direct representatives consequently moore county must be assigned a representative of its own despite its small voting population because it cannot be joined with any of its neighbors in a multicounty district and the tennessee constitution prohibits combining it with nonadjacent counties see note 1 supraembed"
