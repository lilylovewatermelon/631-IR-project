okay okay let me chill on some grownup shit
hit tape you the one i wanna show up with
lookin at me through the phone baby blow a kiss
like soulja boy told you soon ima hold you
but its gon be a minute though i wont hold you
you can fuck around while you wait i wont scold you
five hour difference but you picked up when i called you
i think im booked for wireless
and some other festival in ireland
life gettin fast i can feel my head spiralin
if im not back soon i might have to fly you in
baby is your passport valid
tell me are you down for a challenge
it dont matter to me if you vaxed or not
either you come to me or i come back to your block
i dont wanna get too excited
but if i called the jet would you ride it
lay with me overseas dont pack a bag we can shop
go italy lets have sex on a yachtembed"
