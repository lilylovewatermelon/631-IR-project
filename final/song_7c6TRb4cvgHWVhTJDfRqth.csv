im standing in brooklyn just waiting for something to happen
i cant help but love thinking that everyone doesnt get it
to my left theres a window where did i go
my reflection just blends in to rows of clothes
and bad ideas but ideas nonetheless and so

chorus
i put one foot in front of the other one
i dont need a new love or a new life just a better place to die
i put one foot in front of the other one
i dont need a new love or a new life just a better place to die

verse 2
i happen to stumble upon a chapel last night
and i cant help but back up when i think of what happens inside
i got friends locked in boxes thats no way to live
but what youre calling a sin isnt up to them
after all after all i thought we were all your children
but i will die for my own sins thanks a lot
we will rise up ourselves thanks for nothing at all
so up off the ground our forefathers are nothing but dust now

chorus
i put one foot in front of the other one
i dont need a new love or a new life just a better place to die
i put one foot in front of the other one
i dont need a new love or a new life just a better place to die
i put one foot in front of the other one
i dont need a new love or a new life just a better place to die

maybe i should learn to shut my mouth
i am over 25 and i canâ€™t make a name for myself
some nights i break down and cry
lucky that my fathers still alive
hes been fighting all his life and if this is all ive ever known
then may his soul live on forever in my song

chorus
i put one foot in front of the other one
i dont need a new love or a new life just a better place to die
i put one foot in front of the other one
i dont need a new love or a new life just a better place to die
i put one foot in front of the other one
i dont need a new love or a new life just a better place to die

outro
in front of the other one
in front of the other one
just a better place to die7embed"
