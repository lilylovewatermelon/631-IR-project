everybodys happy snow is falling down
prayers are being answered miracles all around
from afar ive loved you but never let it show
and every year another december comes and goes

prechorus
always watching
never reaching

chorus
but this christmas im gonna risk it all
this christmas im not afraid to fall
so im at your door with nothing more than words ive never said
in all this white youll see me like youve never seen me yet
wrapped in red ooh

verse 2
blue is where ive been green cant buy me you
silver bells remind me that mistletoes for two
so i found a color that only tells the truth
that paints a picture of how i feel for you

chorus
oh oh this christmas im gonna risk it all
this christmas im not afraid to fall
so im at your door with nothing more than words ive never said
in all this white youll see me like youve never seen me yet
wrapped in red ooh

ill never feel you
if i dont tell you

chorus
this christmas im gonna risk it all
this christmas im not afraid to fall
so im at your door with nothing more than words ive never said
in all this white youll see me like youve never seen me yet
wrapped in red ooh
