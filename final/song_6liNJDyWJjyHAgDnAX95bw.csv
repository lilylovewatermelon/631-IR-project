i was only walking through your neighbourhood
saw your light on honey in the cold i stood
anywhere i go there you are
anywhere i go there you are
ive been getting used to waking up with you
ive been getting used to waking up here
anywhere i go there you are
anywhere i go there you are
there you are there you are mm

chorus
youre the fire and the flood
and i always feel you in my blood
everything is fine
when your heads resting next to mine next to mine
youre the fire and the flood
ahooh ooh ooh
ahooh ooh ooh

verse 2
since we met i feel a lightness in my step
youre miles away but i still feel you
anywhere i go there you are anywhere
anywhere i go there you are
late at night when you cant fall asleep
ill be lying right beside you counting sheep
anywhere i go there you are anywhere
anywhere i go there you are
there you are there you are mm
