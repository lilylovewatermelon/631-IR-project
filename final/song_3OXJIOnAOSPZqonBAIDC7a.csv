in the days
when we were swinging from the trees
i was a monkey
stealing honey from a swarm of bees
i could taste
i could taste you even then
and i would chase you down the wind

chorus
you could go there if you please
wild honey
and if you go there go with me
wild honey

verse 2
did i know you
did i know you even then
before the clocks kept time
before the world was made
from the cruel sun
you were shelter
you were my shelter and my shade

chorus
if you go there with me
wild honey
you can do just what you please
wild honey
yeah just blowing in the breeze
wild honey
wild wild wild

im still standing
im still standing where you left me
are you still growing wild
with everything tame around you
i send you flowers
cut flowers for your hall
i know your garden is full
but is there sweetness at all

bridge
what is soul
love me
give me soul

chorus
if you go there go with me
wild honey
wont you take me take me please
wild honey
yeah swinging through the trees
wild honey
wild wild wild2embed"
