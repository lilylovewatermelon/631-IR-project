verse 3
before he knew he had a crew that wasnt no punk
in they spitfire shirts and sb dunks
they would push til they couldnt skate no more
office building lobbies wasnt safe no more
and it wasnt like they wasnt getting chased no more
just the freedom was better than breathing they said they said
an escape route they used to escape out
when things got crazy they needed to break out
theyd head to any place with stairs
any good grinds the world was theirs ugh
and their four wheels would take them there
until the cops came and said theres no skating here
hook
and so they kick push kick push
kick push kick push coast
and away they rolled
just rebels without a cause with no place to go
and so they kick push kick push

just a rebel looking for a place to be
