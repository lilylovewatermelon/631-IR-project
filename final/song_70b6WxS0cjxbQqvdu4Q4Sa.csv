i try to breathe
memories overtaking me
i try to face them but
the thought is too much to conceive

prechorus
i only know that i can change
everything else just stays the same
so now i step out of the darkness
that my life became cause

chorus
i just needed someone to talk to
you were just too busy with yourself
you were never there for me to
express how i felt i just stuffed it down
now im older and i feel like
i could let some of this anger fade
but it seems the surface i am scratching
is the bed that i have made

verse 2
so where were you
when all this i was going through
you never took the time
to ask me just what you could do

chorus
i just needed someone to talk to
you were just too busy with yourself
you were never there for me to
express how i felt i just stuffed it down
now im older and i feel like
i could let some of this anger fade
but it seems the surface i am scratching
is the bed that i have made

oh i never meant to fade
away
i never meant to fade

chorus
i just needed someone to talk to
you were just too busy with yourself
you were never there for me to

now im older and i feel like
i could let some of this anger fade
