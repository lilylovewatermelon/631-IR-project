ive seen the world done it all
had my cake now
diamonds brilliant and bel air now
hot summer nights midjuly
when you and i were forever wild
the crazy days city lights
the way youd play with me like a child

chorus
will you still love me when im no longer young and beautiful
will you still love me when i got nothing but my aching soul
i know you will i know you will i know that you will
will you still love me when im no longer beautiful

verse 2
ive seen the world lit it up as my stage now
channeling angels in the new age now
hot summer days rock and roll
the way youd play for me at your show
and all the ways i got to know
your pretty face and electric soul

chorus
will you still love me when im no longer young and beautiful
will you still love me when i got nothing but my aching soul
i know you will i know you will i know that you will
will you still love me when im no longer beautiful
