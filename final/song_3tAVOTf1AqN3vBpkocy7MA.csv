oh my love please dont cry
ill wash my bloody hands and well start a new life

verse 1
i ripped out his throat
and called you on the telephone
to take off my disguise
just in time to hear you cry when you

prechorus
you mourn the death of your bloody valentine
the night he died
you mourn the death of your bloody valentine
one last time singing

chorus
oh my love please dont cry
ill wash my bloody hands and well start a new life
i dont know much at all i dont know wrong from right
all i know is that i love you tonight

verse 2
there was police and flashing lights
the rain came down so hard that night
and the headlines read a lover died
no telltale heart was left to find when you

you mourn the death of your bloody valentine
one last time singing

oh my love please dont cry
ill wash my bloody hands and well start a new life

all i know is that i love you tonight

bridge
he dropped you off i followed him home
then i stood outside his bedroom window
standing over him he begged me not to do
what i knew i had to do because im so in love with you

chorus
oh my love please dont cry
ill wash my bloody hands and well start a new life
i dont know much at all i dont know wrong from right
all i know is that i love you tonight
postchorus
