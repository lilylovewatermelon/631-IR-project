we nearly drowned for such a silly thing
someone who loves me now better than you
and that pretty friend is finally yours
and ill be around on sunday

if youll meet me at blue diner
ill take coffee and talk about nothing
baby at blue diner
ill take anything you wanna give me

postchorus

verse 2
i havent told anyone
just like we promised have you
every time i drive through the city where youre from
i squeeze a little

chorus

ill take coffee and talk about nothing
