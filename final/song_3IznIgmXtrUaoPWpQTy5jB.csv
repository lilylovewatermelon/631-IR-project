now you suck
we wanna talk about sex but were not allowed
well you may not like it but you better learn how cause its your turn now
youre wasting your tongue with lame excuses and lies
now whats on your nasty old mind

verse 1 tv girl
so how should i begin this
i guess it started when you were with him
and how he never even took you out to dance
but did he fuck with any rhythm
but now hes playing with your head
but did he ever make you cum
did he ever make you cry
do the wires in your mind get sewn together
rubbed and severed by the heat
you dont know how long i could stare into your picture
and wish that it was me
i guess its different cause you love him
but ive got an interactive
sick and twisted imagination
and thats gotta count for something

chorus yeastie girlz
we wanna talk about sex but were not allowed
well you may not like it but youd better learn how cause its your turn now
youre wasting your tongue with lame excuses and lies
get your face between my thighs

i dreamt i was standing in your doorstep
licking sweat off of your forehead
with your finger in my mouth
and the sound when leather jackets hit the ground
you should hear when youre not around
when its just us horny poets
who cant wait to write it down
and swear we were only being honest
do you like these little sonnets
cause i wrote them just for you
but how quickly they turn sour
so be careful who you screw
and never call
and im starting to suspect
you dont intend to do anything you say at all

chorus yeastie girlz
we wanna talk about sex but were not allowed
well you may not like it but youd better learn how cause its your turn now
youre wasting your tongue with lame excuses and lies
now whats on your nasty old mind
