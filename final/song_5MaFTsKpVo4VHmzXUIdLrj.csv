going through something music not only is something that kind of helps the situation pass i also make music talking about certain subjects because i know that im not the only one thats going through you know whats happening
me talking about certain things could help somebody else through what they going through as well as me tryna figure it out myself
uh you were telling me a little bit about you know just how youve struggled with anxiety over the years do you feel like you touch on that a little bit on this album
yeah i do touch on it
