this is wrong but i cant help but feel like
there ain’t nothing more right babe
misty morning comes again and i cant
help but wish i could see your face
and i knew from the first note played
id be breaking all my rules to see you
you smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
scream your name

chorus
so dim that spotlight tell me things like
i cant take my eyes off of you
im no one special just another wideeyed girl
whos desperately in love with you
give me a photograph to hang on my wall superstar

verse 2
morning loneliness
comes around when im not dreaming about you
when my world wakes up today
youll be in another town
and i knew when i saw your face
id be counting down the ways to see you
you smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row scream your name

so dim that spotlight tell me things like
i cant take my eyes off of you
im no one special just another wideeyed girl
whos desperately in love with you
give me a photograph to hang on my wall superstar

bridge
you played in bars you play guitar
and im invisible and everyone knows who you are
and youll never see you sing me to sleep
every night from the radio

chorus
so dim that spotlight tell me things like
i cant take my eyes off of you
im no one special just another wideeyed girl
whos desperately in love with you
give me a photograph to hang on my wall superstar

outro
sweet sweet superstar
