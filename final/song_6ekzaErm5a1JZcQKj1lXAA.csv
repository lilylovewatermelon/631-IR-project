ive said a thousand things before
ive fallen in and out of love
i couldnt walk but tried to run
at night the weight of expectation seems to keep me up
a thousand times i said too much
always secondguess before i jump
i gave my all but not enough
and with the weight of expectation ill be sleeping rough

prechorus
how come im the only one who ever seems to get in my way
lately ive been fucking up a good thing any chance i can get

chorus
somebody to lean on somebody to hold
its just another to lead though before i let go
and i aint trying to be lonely solely
but everything i touch turns to stone
maybe im better off on my own

verse 2
a thousand times ive heard the same
ive heard some other voices in my head
let me assure you that my minds in check
i just cant put my faith in something we might live to regret
