why am i awake
nails on the floor and soot on my tongue
i dont know his name but i still taste the rum rum rum rum rum
nothin’ there but skin
skeletons crawl on the ceiling they know
that him and his aftershave hit like a drug drug drug hmm

chorus lizzy mcalpine lizzy mcalpine  jacob collier
dont answer me im callin’ just to hear you scream
and youre fadin but he feels like you in between
ive said too much in and out of wantin us
now youre fadin and i wonder who will erase me
who will erase me mmmmmm mmm

verse 2 lizzy mcalpine
race you to the end ohwoah
my innocence waits like it desperately knows
that ill crash if i don’t lеt you go go

chorus lizzy mcalpine lizzy mcalpine  jacob collier
don’t answer me im callin’ just to hear you scrеam
and youre fadin but he feels like you in between
ive said too much in and out of wantin’ us in and out of wantin us
now youre fadin fadin and i wonder who will erase me
