too far away to feel you
but i cant forget your skin
wonder what youre up to
what state of mind youre in
are you thinking bout the last time
your lips all over me
cause i play it and i rewind
where you are i wanna be

verse 2
wanna fly to you like birds do
straight across the world
my body your hands ooh
and im missing every word
you are mine yeah you say so
when you call me late nights
but i wonder how should i know
youre in love enough to fight

prechorus
fadin away when youre drunk and alone
cant see my face in your heart anymore
tellin yourself you dont feel like before

chorus
and thats when i run run
all of these thousand miles
thats when i run run
all of these thousand miles to get you back
comin for you babe im comin now
thats when i run run
all of these thousand miles to get you back
