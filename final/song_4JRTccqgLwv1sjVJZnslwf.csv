you you are so beautiful

verse 1 kylie minogue  enrique iglesias
it used to be
you and me
love like no other
the world around
could fall apart
but we had each other

verse 2 kylie minogue  enrique iglesias
saw you walking you were smiling
and it hit me like the first time
feels like yesterday has come and gone
but nothings changed when i look at you

chorus 1 kylie minogue  enrique iglesias
you you are so beautiful
you you are so beautiful

chorus 2 kylie minogue  enrique iglesias
and now i
i just want you to know
that after all this time
youre still the one

still hurts sometimes
love on the line
but we said forever
sailing on
through the storms
but we held together

chorus 2 kylie minogue  enrique iglesias
and now i
i just want you to know
that after all this time
youre still the one

chorus 1 kylie minogue  enrique iglesias
you you are so beautiful
you you are so beautiful

chorus 2 kylie minogue  enrique iglesias
and now i
i just want you to know
that after all this time
youre still the one

chorus 1 kylie minogue  enrique iglesias
you you are so beautiful
you you are so beautiful1embed"
