yo yo check our situation

verse 1 kanye west
you need somethin unexpected some form of weapon
you ask him to feel protected and still feel protected
just one time for the record just one time for the record
dont agree with the message dont agree with the methods

chorus kanye west
dont let dont let the lifestyle drag you down
who knows when was the last time you felt the love
one last sparkle to follow in my light
one last sparkle to follow

verse 2 kanye west
man its too early
what the hell you doin wakin me up at 530
why the hell are you worried
play somethin that is very very vibeworthy
i dont know want my mind alerting
people sayin tweetin gonna make you die early
how bout have my heart hurtin
hold it all inside that could make you die early
go on and get your best attorney
somethings there feel it when i heard it
just release the spirit let it flow though
how these  leaving now with one leg like flojo
nail me to the cross with long nails like coko
free throat coat for the throat goats
even if i gotta do it solo even if i gotta do it with no promo
i aint got my point across
til we finally get across and pass the point
so theres a couple things that i gotta quote
dont involve yourself in things you dont have to know
i aint never question what you was askin for
i gave you every single thing you was askin for
i dont understand how anybody could ask for more
got a list of even more i just laugh it off
i be goin through things i had to wrote
celebrity drama that only bradll know
too many family secrets somebody passin notes
things i cried about i found laughable
lil baby jesus aint laughing no
dont involve yourself in things they aint have to know
the big man upstairs aint laughin no
dont involve yourself in things they aint have to know

now here we are
you know im not about it
showed you my all
i let you into my thoughts

chorus kanye west
dont let dont let the lifestyle drag you down
who knows when was the last time you felt the love
one last sparkle to follow in my light
one last sparkle to follow in love
one last sparkle to follow in my light
one last sparkle to follow

interlude buju banton
okay i didnt throw a fit when you said you wanted to leave
i told you i loved you but you didnt believe
you were too easily fooled so easily deceived
by some dude whos more rather into greed
played by your emotions you were swamped by your needs
told me i didnt believe you said i was out to deceive ahaha
you said that i lie how did i i told you everything didnt i
but you just could not believe man im so peeved
your friends all up in your head even when were in bed
your minds elsewhere and you say you care haha
im laughin at you all you think you got me no no
my back aint against the wall the wall the wall the wall the wall the wall
chorus kanye west
dont let dont let the lifestyle drag you down
who knows when was the last time you felt the love
one last sparkle to follow in my light right on
one last sparkle to follow61embed"
