memories sinkin deep in leakin in my mine
all of the time tried to forget you

verse 1
pretending i have the patience
pretending there is enough time for waiting
remembering when we kept it all basic
i wanna go back so bad i can taste it
what do i care for
you are not there anymore
i was not careful
that is all your fault
you let me fall

chorus
memories sinkin deep in leakin in my mine
all of the time tried to forget you
thought i could get you to be mine
memories sinkin deep in leakin in my mine
all of the time i cant forget to
try to forget you in my mine

buried alive here inside a nightmare
living a life where youre gone
there is no light here
it will be lightyears until my minds clear
i did it all for love
i did it all
id trade it all for you
id trade it all
but what do i care for
what are you here for
if youre not there when i call
i was not careful
and thats all your fault
you let me fall

chorus
memories sinkin deep in leakin in my mine

thought i could get you to be mine
memories sinkin deep in leakin in my mine

try to forget you in my mine
