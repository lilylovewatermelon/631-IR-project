im just waitin on the sun
to close his eyes and call it a night
so we can put all our differences aside

im just waitin on the moon
with all the stars and all its gloom
we can watch it fall right back in to place

so i wont keep myself around
just to keep you warm

woooooooo
woooooooo
oohoooo

woooooooo
woooooo oohoooo

momma dont put no gun in my hand
i dont wanna end up like these men
momma dont put no gun in my hand
i dont wanna end up like these men

im not walkin away
im just hearin what youre sayin
for the first time
sounds like hallelujah for the first time
for the first time
singing like hallelujah for the first time
see the head and the heart liveget tickets as low as 58you might also likeand ill miss you someday

im not walkin away
im just hearin what youre sayin
for the first time
sounds like hallelujah for the first time
for the first time
singin hallelujah for the first timeembed"
