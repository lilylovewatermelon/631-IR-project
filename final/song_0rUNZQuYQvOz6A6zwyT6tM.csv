go

verse 1
to unexplain the unforgivable
drain all the blood and give the kids a show
by streetlight this dark night a séance down below
theres things that i have done
you never should ever know

chorus
and without you is how i disappear
and live my life alone forever now
and without you is how i disappear
and live my life alone forever now

verse 2
who walks among the famous living dead
drowns all the boys and girls inside your bed
and if you could talk to me tell me if its so
that all the good girls go to heaven
well heaven knows

chorus
that without you is how i disappear
and live my life alone forever now
and without you is how i disappear
and live my life alone forever now

im just a ghost so i cant hurt you anymore
so i cant hurt you anymore

im so far away from you
well now so you can

chorus
and without you is how i disappear
and without you is how i disappear
whoa whoa whoa and without you is how i disappear
whoa whoa whoa and without you forever forever now37embed"
