been in the saddle since the sun came up
rounding up strays in this ole west texas dust
shes been packing her things since i put coffee on
by sundown shell be gone

verse 2
damn this ole girth worn right in two
but a spare length of leather and ill make it do
just when i think ive got life by the reins
home aint sweet home on the range

chorus
if heartaches were horses and hard times were cattle
id ride home at sunset sitting tall in the saddle
if heartaches were horses and hard time were cattle

bridge
and shed say she loved me and this cowboy way of life
shed be right beside me when we rode home tonight

chorus
if heartaches were horses and hard times were cattle
id ride home at sunset sitting tall in the saddle
if heartaches were horses and hard time were cattlesee george strait liveget tickets as low as 105you might also likeembed"
