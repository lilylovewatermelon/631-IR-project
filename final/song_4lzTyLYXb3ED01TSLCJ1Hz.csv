if you disrespect anybody
that you run in to
how in the world do you think
anybodys supposed to respect you
if you dont give a heck bout the man
with the bible in his hand
just get out the way
and let the gentleman do his thing

youre the kind of gentleman
that want everything your way
take the sheet off your face boy
its a brand new day

chorus
respect yourself respect yourself
if you dont respect yourself
aint nobody gonna give a good cahoot na na na na
respect yourself respect yourself

verse 2
if youre walking round
thinkin that the world
owes you something
cause youre here
you might also likeyoure goin out
the world backwards
like you did
when you first come here

keep talkin bout the president
wont stop air pollution
put your hand on your mouth
when you cough thatll help the solution

oh you cuss around women folk
and you dont even know their names
and youre dumb enough to think
thatll make you a big ol man

chorus
respect yourself respect yourself
if you dont respect yourself
aint nobody gonna give a good cahoot na na na na
respect yourself respect yourself
respect yourself respect yourself2embed"
