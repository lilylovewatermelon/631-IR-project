oh saturday sun
i met someone
out on the west coast
i gotta get back i cant let this go
oh saturday sun
i met someone
dont care what it costs
no ray of sunlights ever lost

verse 1
so tired of sleepin alone
so tired of eatin alone
i need to ask her whats goin on
are we goin strong
she felt like resting her head
my shoulder was the perfect height
we fit so right so whats goin on
cause ive been undone

prechorus
the long drive the coastline
lookin out at first light
am i still on her mind
ive been undone
