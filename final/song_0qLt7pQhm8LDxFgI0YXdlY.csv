yeah
now everybody tellin me a lie
lordy give me somethin for my soul
see i dont wanna think of suicide
so please dont take the lockey off my door
see i been tired of fuckin all these girls
and ive been tired of spendin all my dough
and if i give my story to the world
i wonder if theyd book me for a show
see you cant handle pressure on your own
so why you carry boulder by yourself
the story’s storyteller tell it wrong
and glorify the horror and the wealth
my mama call me tell me comey home
and i just need some guidance in my steps
i know im not the only one alone
i know im not the only one that felt

now im prayin that i make it twentyfive

and no is kinda hard to say to drugs
cause i been havin problems with myself
and i been askin questions where the love
and they dont give me answers just a check
and they dont know my issues as a child
cause i was busy cuttin on myself
and hangin from the playground wasnt wrong
until you got a ropey on your neck
and i been losin more than just my mind
gatherin whats left of selfrespect
and daddy why you call me while you drunk
and why you never love me when i need it
and i dont wanna be like you no more
and i been tryna cope im gettin weeded

verse 3 isaiah rashad
yeah look ayy
i smoke too much the problems of a twentysomethin
i drink too often theres liquor pourin from the faucet
you would assume from followin the tunes yeah
that im doomed to die young addicted to dry plum
these bitches aint shit and pussy is my greatest vice
i love smokin weed i hate advice
i know some niggas that talk good the wise men
from a long line of bitchmade and bridesmen ooh ooh
you never had nuttin but fuckin dreams
you just caught up in the hype the fashion and so it seems
the limelight i know that i rhyme tight
no need for your two cents and burnin your blueprints
these people think i really give a fuck about the shit they give a fuck about
just need a moment of silence just close your fuckin mouth
infatuated with violence gun in my fuckin mouth
so you dont know that im serious know what im talkin bout
