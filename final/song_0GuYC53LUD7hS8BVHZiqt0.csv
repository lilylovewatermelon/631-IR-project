at what i took
a leaf out of everybody’s book
we see what you can’t see
i’m caught in a trap of my own
like everybody i know

this won’t be played on your radio tonight
this won’t be played on your radio tonight
this won’t be played on your radio tonight

do you all know
of the emperor’s clothes
walking down an empty road
we see what you can’t see
that’s not how i wanna be
anyhow everytime the same dream

this won’t be played on your radio tonight
this won’t be played on your radio tonight
this won’t be played on your radio tonight
this won’t be played on your radio show
this won’t be played on your radio tonight oh no
