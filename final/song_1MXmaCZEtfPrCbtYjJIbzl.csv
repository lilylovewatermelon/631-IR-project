said youre gonna be here in a minute
sitting in the mirror getting pretty
gotta look my best if were gonna break up
gotta look my best if were gonna break up
i can hear you knocking at the front door
and i know exactly what you came for
try to say goodbye but its hot and heavy
try to say goodbye but its hot and heavy

prechorus
you touch me and its breaking me down
and me down and me down and me down
im telling you lets just give it up and get down
and get down and get down
so cmon

chorus
wont you give me something to remember
baby shut your mouth and turn me inside out
even though we couldnt last forever baby
you know what i want right now
hit me one more time its so amazing
how you shook my world and flipped it upside down
youre the only one who ever drove me crazy
cause you know me inside out inside out

i know that we probably shouldnt do this
wake up in the morning feeling stupid
said that we were done but youre all up on me
said that we were done but youre all up on me
tell me how we got in this position
guess i gotta get you out my system
try to let you go but its not that easy
try to let you go but its not that easy

prechorus
you touch me and its breaking me down
and me down and me down and me down
im telling you lets just give it up and get down
and get down and get down
so cmon

chorus
wont you give me something to remember
baby shut your mouth and turn me inside out
even though we couldnt last forever baby
you know what i want right now
hit me one more time its so amazing
how you shook my world and flipped it upside down
youre the only one who ever drove me crazy
cause you know me inside out
breakdown
out out out out out
inside out out out out out out
inside out
so cmon

chorus
wont you give me something to remember
baby shut your mouth and turn me inside out
even though we couldnt last forever baby
you know what i want right now
hit me one more time its so amazing
how you shook my world and flipped it upside down
youre the only one who ever drove me crazy
cause you know me inside out
