yours is the only version of my desertion
that i could ever subscribe to
that is all that i can do
you are a past dinner the last winner
im raping all around me
until the last drop is behind you oh

prechorus 1 paul banks
and youre so cute when youre frustrated dear
yeah youre so cute when youre sedated dear
oh yes dear

chorus paul banks and daniel kessler
sleep tight grim rite
we have two hundred couches where you can
sleep tight grim rite
we have two hundred couches where you can
sleep tight grim rite
we have two hundred couches where you can
sleep tonight simpleton
sleep tonight yeah simpleton
sleep tonight you cannot follow
sleep tonight through the words alone

verse 2 paul banks
you are the only person whos completely certain
theres nothing here to be into
that is all that you can do
you are a past sinner the last winner
and everything weve come to
it makes you you you
see interpol liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likeprechorus 2 paul banks
but you cannot safely say that while i will be away
that you will not consider sadly
how you helped me to stray
and you will not reach me i am
resenting a position thats past resentment
and now i cant consider
and now there is this distance so

chorus paul banks and daniel kessler
sleep tight grim rite
we have two hundred couches where you can
sleep tight grim rite
we have two hundred couches where you can
sleep tight grim rite
we have two hundred couches where you can
sleep tonight simpleton
sleep tonight yeah simpleton
sleep tonight you cannot follow
sleep tonight through the words alone

outro daniel kessler
something to say
something to do
nothing to say
when theres nothing to do oh
