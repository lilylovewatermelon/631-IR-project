sometimes you look the same
just like you did before the accident
when youre starin into space
its hard to believe you dont remember it
woke up in the ambulance
you pieced it all together on the drive

chorus
i know you dont remember calling me
but i told you even then you looked so pretty
in a hospital bed i remember you said
you were scared
and so was i

verse 2
in a standstill on the 5
thought it was unusually early traffic
usually i dont panic
i just wanted to be on time
when i saw the ambulances on the shoulder
i didnt even think of pullin over
i pieced it all together late that night

chorus
and i know you dont remember calling me
but i told you even then you looked so pretty
in a hospital bed i remember you said
you were scared
and so was i

what if it happened to you on a different day
on a bridge where there wasnt a rail in the way
or a neighborhood street where the little kids play
or the angeles crest in the snow or the rain
what if you werent alone there were kids in the car
what if you were remote no one knows where you are
if you changed anything would you not have survived
youre alive youre alive youre alive

chorus
and i know you dont remember calling me
but i told you even then you looked so pretty
in your hospital bed i remember you said
you were scared
and so am i45embed"
