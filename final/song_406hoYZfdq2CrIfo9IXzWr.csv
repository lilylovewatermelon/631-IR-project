breaking the lines and bury whats coming
this commonsense youre ignoring
cause youre next up to fall out with not dealing
with all the doubt still on our faces
forget the worlds reaction to this chemical attraction
that ive always known but never could savor
push play repeat then start the cycle thats been feeding on me
every day i keep digging a deeper grave

prechorus
in god we mistrusted
the truth left all of us disgusted

chorus
a toast to the ghosts in our homes
still alive
gave all they had for a flag
but the dream has died
but the dream has died

verse 2
i take it youve said enough
no thank you for warning us
so obvious my mistake
you think that i wont give up
ive gone and ive had enough
so what ive left miles away
you might also likeprechorus
in god we mistrusted
the truth left all of us disgusted

chorus
a toast to the ghosts in our homes
still alive
gave all they had for a flag
but the dream has died
but the dream has died
but the dream has died

outro
in god we mistrusted
in god we mistrustedembed"
