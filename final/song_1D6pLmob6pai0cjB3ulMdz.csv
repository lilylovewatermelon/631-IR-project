one of the great achievements of contemporary ideological warfare has been to debase the terms of political discourse so thoroughly that such statements as these are not entirely false if we keep to what has become conventional usage as orwell predicted this achievement has undermined the possibility even of talking sensibly about what is happening in the world still independent minds  including any authentic conservatives who might be located in the outer reaches of the political arena or intellectual world  can refuse to be swept up in the fashionable currents and use terms with their actual meanings to describe what is happening and why

1 the triumph of conservatism

most of this we also heard just ten years ago when reagan was elected by a 21 vote the second conservative landslide in four years in his 1980 triumph presidential historian william leuchtenberg observed reagan far from having won in a landslide got little more than a bare majority of the popular vote and only 28 of the potential electorate and exit polls showed that the vote was not for reagan but against carter who had in fact initiated the policies that the reaganites took up and implemented with the general support of congressional democrats accelerating military spending meaning in particular the state sector of the economy while cutting back programs that aid the vast majority polls in 1980 revealed that 11 of reagan voters chose him because hes a real conservative  whatever that term is supposed to mean

in 1984 despite vast attempts to get out the vote the totals increased by 1 the percentage who chose reagan because he was a real conservative dropped to 4 while 70 of all voters with an opinion on the matter opposed reaganite legislative programs and public opinion studies showed a continuation of the steady drift towards a kind of new dealstyle welfare state liberalism on the part of the general population their concerns and desires were not articulated in the political system however one reason surely why voting was so sharply skewed towards privileged sectors

the reasons why voting is so dramatically an elite affair in the united states are revealed by comparative studies analysis of thirty democracies showed a significant correlation between high voter turnout and the presence of political parties representing clearly defined strata of society  that is parties strongly tied to specific income classes religious groupings or language groups political commentator thomas edsall 1984 in economic policy edsall added the us political system fails to represent the interests of the bottom threefifths of society to use a phrase that is unspeakable in polite society without shock quotes when the class interests of the privileged and powerful are the guiding commitment of all political parties people who do not share these interests tend to stay home the class pattern of abstention seems inseparably linked to another crucial comparative peculiarity of the american political system political scientist william dean burnham observed the total absence of a socialist or laborite party as an organized competitor in the electoral market that absence relates to and is fortified by the effective dismantling of civil society unions political organizations and so on1

in the 1980s the us and britain took the lead in the triumph of conservatism accelerating processes already underway they therefore lead the developed world in impoverishment and degradation inequality homelessness destruction of family values hunger and other values of contemporary conservatism a study by the british charitable organization action for children founded in 1869 with the queen as patron concludes that the gap between rich and poor is as wide today as it was in victorian times and in some ways worse a million and a half families cannot afford to provide their children with the diet fed to a similar child living in a bethnal green workhouse in 1876 a sad reflection on british society britain has proportionately more children living in poverty than any european country apart from portugal and ireland and the proportion is rising faster than any country in europe though the us still holds the lead

britain has also not yet matched the achievements of the doctrinal system crafted by our highly class conscious business community with the assistance of those whom the lively 19th century working class press called the bought priesthood of respectable intellectuals the fact that there is class conflict and that the rich and powerful mobilize state power to serve their interests a truism to adam smith remains within popular consciousness the 1994 gallup political and economic index gives interesting information about popular attitudes on these matters i put aside small numbers 310 expressing no opinion the study reports that over fourfifths of the population think there is a class struggle in this country and that too little is being done to level up the classes twothirds disagree strongly with the statement britain is a classless society nine out of ten feel that the government does too little for the working class fourfifths that it does too much for the welltodo and over 90 that it does too little for people living on small pensionsincome half also think it does too little for the middle classes threefourths think of britain as divided into haves and havenots and a third describe themselves as among the haves2

lets return to 1994 the next in the series of conservative landslides this time under the leadership of newt gingrich republicans claimed about 52 percent of all votes cast for candidates in contested house seats slightly better than a twopoint improvement from 1992 richard morin director of polling for the washington post one out of six voters described the outcome as an affirmation of the republican agenda 60 said it was a repudiation of the democrats a more conservative congress was considered to be an issue by a rousing 12 of the voters an overwhelming majority had never heard of the gingrich contract with america articulating the republican agenda though a majority opposed one of its central components defense increases a codeword for public subsidies to advanced industry the chief pollster of the los angeles times pointed out that just before the election 61 of those polled said that spending for domestic programs should be increased

all of this echoes the situation of a decade ago

the opposition to democrats is more nuanced clintonstyle new democrats  in effect moderate republicans  lost their seats at twice the rate of their more liberal colleagues ken silverstein and alexander cockburn report the more liberal democrats are those who tried to activate the old democratic coalition of working people women the poor the majority of the population who see themselves correctly as effectively disenfranchised

to put these figures in further perspective it must be recalled that voting was even more heavily skewed towards the wealthy and privileged than before as compared with 1992 7 more voters were wealthy 7 fewer were working class political scientist peter levine comments noting also that democrats were overwhelmingly preferred by voters who earn less than 30000 a year and ran even with republicans in the 3000049000 range there was also a very large gender and color gap white males voting mostly republican while women blacks and hispanics voted for democrats overwhelmingly in the blackhispanic category where participation was low those with no more than high school education along with those with postgraduate education favored democrats those who sensed a decline in their standard of living voted for republicans by close to two to one  mostly white males with just high school degrees whose economic futures are highly uncertain thomas edsall observes just those who would have been part of a leftpopulist coalition committed to equitable economic growth and political democracy were such an option to intrude into our businessrun political system

the message however was just the opposite clinton must abandon the leftwing agenda that the voters had just overwhelmingly rejected and return to what he had promised to be in 1992 a new democrat and he was quick to pick up the cues in a satellite address to the national league of cities clinton used some variation of the words work jobs or working families more than 40 times as he raised new democrat themes such as welfare reform national service lifelong job training and the need to attack problems that feed dependency the boston globe reported under the headline clinton seen returning to new democrat stance the report didnt say when he had left that stance for some different one on any issue of importance to rich and powerful if he had business week hadnt noticed corporate america did fine riding in tandem with clinton the journal reports though it did equally well when they diverged
despite all his efforts to please still business basically hates the clinton administration business week continues and gives him little credit for advancing the corporate agenda why the reasons they give and cite from polls of executives are hard to take seriously but there is one very good reason leading sectors of wealth and privilege taste blood they think with some reason that they have the worlds population by the throat and are in a position to roll back the hated welfare state for the general population and everything that goes with it health and safety standards labor rights and human rights generally indeed any infringement on their right to pursue the vile maxim as adam smith described the goal of the masters all for ourselves and nothing for other people given that awareness it makes sense to hate anyone who may have a somewhat flawed commitment to the sole human value gain wealth forgetting all but self the new spirit of the age denounced by the lively and vigorous working class press 150 years ago as working people fought to save human values from the rising tide of private tyranny3

yet another factor scarcely noted here has to be taken into account in evaluating the electoral results under the headline big money still garners the big vote george graham observed in the london financial times that money spoke as loud as ever in the most expensive campaign on record with a few notable exceptions electoral victory tracked campaign financing closely  again no departure from the norm and natural in a political system in which the less affluent majority does not participate and is scarcely represented4

voters selected welfare reform as their top priority with health care reform second and crime also ranking high these choices which in part reflect a grasp of reality also have to be understood against the background of recent propaganda offensives

to begin with reality for most of the population conditions of life and work are grim and declining something new in the history of industrial society median income declined even during the clinton recovery falling to 7 below the 1989 level by late 1993 the census bureau reported the decline was accompanied by  and in no small measure caused by  muchlauded improvements in flexibility of labor markets the latter is a technical term referring to elimination of job security and other such market rigidities that interfere with economic health another ideological construct as designed for the purposes of population control economic health is unrelated to the welfare of the population but crafted to measure what is valued by the rich speculators bond holders investors professionals who serve the statecorporate sector continuing the decline during the reagan years after a decade of stagnation pay for private sector employees fell 4 from 1988 to 1994 with blue collar wages suffering most and white collar wages still below 1990 and well below 1988 despite much misleading hype the bureau of labor statistics reports a continuing shift to lowerwage industries and higher wageoccupations executive and professional while noting that the overwhelming majority of these are in lowerpaid service industries motel manager and the like that means sharply increased inequality with the majority suffering reductions in absolute terms along with much worse work conditions5

but some folks are doing just fine the percentage of corporate income devoted to payrolls is hovering near a record low fortune magazine reported in november having dropped sharply during the conservative landslide of the early 1980s and again since 1992 with the new democrats at the helm 1993 was a bracingly upbeat year for the fortune 500 the journal exulted in its april 1994 annual review of the state of the important people who posted dazzling profits despite virtually stagnant sales growth the ecstatic story was headed hats off it was a heck of a year  at least for those who matter6

while in part realistic the expressed concerns of voters reflect the great victories of the ideological warfare that has been conducted with relentless intensity since the early 1970s in the effort to overcome the perceived crisis of democracy across the political spectrum privileged sectors were naturally appalled by the attempts of the great majority of the population to escape from the apathy and marginalization that is their proper place and to enter the political arena forgetting that in a democracy the role of the ignorant and meddlesome outsiders is to be mere spectators not participants as walter lippmann put it in his progressive essays on democracy 70 years ago expressing the doctrines of wilsonian idealism it therefore became necessary to renew with much greater intensity the constant campaign to tame and cage that great beast as alexander hamilton termed the people with horror and indignation as he was laying the foundations for stateguided industrial democracy the beast may not yet be tamed but it is being caged sometimes quite literally sometimes in chains of dogma and deceit an important victory

we may recall in passing that fear of democracy and freedom has always been one of the factors motivating the terror and sometimes outright aggression undertaken to eliminate rotten apples that might spoil the barrel and viruses that might infect others in the terminology favored by leading planners  the main concern of course being independence whatever cast it takes that helps explain the passion of washingtons terrorist wars in central america in recent years or to take a current example washingtons notsotacit support for its trainees and associates in the haitian military as they did their necessary work and the restoration of the rule of their backers among the haitian elite under the guise of democracy now that the work is done and the generals can be sent off to the life of luxury which they understood correctly would be their reward for services rendered behind the supercilious racist rhetoric about civilizing aristide and teaching him lessons in democracy lies a real fear that the democratic virus in haiti might even infect these shores people here might realize that we have a great deal to learn about democracy from the peasants and slumdwellers of haiti who constructed a vibrant civil society that offered the great beast a chance to take some control over their lives their crime brings to mind the call for freedom for all people that was sounded for the first time in haiti two centuries ago outraging the civilized opinion of that day

one consequence of the huge propaganda campaigns of the past several decades is the mood of antipolitics reported in feature stories concealed from public view is the fact that politics is the shadow cast on society by big business as john dewey stated the truism familiar at least since adam smith adding that as long as this is so the attenuation of the shadow will not change the substance reforms are of limited utility democracy requires that the source of the shadow be removed not only because of its domination of the political arena but because the very institutions of private power undermine democracy and freedom again an observation familar back to the founding fathers

but the source of the shadow has to be driven from the mind naturally this is a leading theme of the literature of the ultraright foundations that are seeking to drive the educational system and media towards an even narrower fringe of the permissible spectrum at the other extreme clinton campaign literature spoke movingly about workers and their firms and how government must help them missing from the picture were bosses profits investors and the like there are entrepreneurs nice folk who appear now and then to help the workers and their firms they then sink into the background along with the unmentionables who are laboring for the common good selflessly seeking to provide jobs and decent lives for ordinary people in the civil society in which all participate7

the fanaticism of the effort to conceal the obvious has reached comic proportions after the latest apec summit in jakarta in november frontpage headlines announced that clinton is stern with indonesia on rights but gleeful on trade new york times the sternness on rights consisted of a few whimpers denounced by indonesian human rights activists and labor leaders those still out of jail but the glee on trade was real enough it reflects the successes of the administrations campaign of commercial diplomacy that will mean jobs for americans times political correspondent elaine sciolino reported with admiration clinton firmed up 40 billion in joint projects in his campaign for jobs for americans at least 35 billion possibly more was an arrangement between exxon and the indonesian state oil company pertamina to develop an offshore natural gas field which could mean new jobs for us businesses that help set up wells and offshore platforms the boston globe reported exxons indonesia affiliate and pertamina are expected to sell the liquified gas almost exclusively in asia ge hughes fluor daniel and other major corporations won contracts as well for projects in indonesia another exxonpertamina project is a new plant to supply indonesias stateowned electricity company the london financial times added noting also that us taxpayers are generously helping to fund the projects by credits from the us exportimport bank part of new us tiedaid credit offers

all of this is sure to provide a huge flow of jobs for americans  at least lawyers bankers executives and managers maybe a handful of skilled workers for a short period but profits for us investors perish the thought the good news for us workers caused a sharp increase in exxons stock8

another victory for efficient propaganda is that people wildly overestimate the percentage of the federal budget that goes to foreign aid and welfare in fact over half of discretionary federal spending is devoted to the military one reason why the united states faces social and structural economic problems of a magnitude unknown to other economically advanced states benjamin schwarz of the rand corporation notes including higher rates of infant mortality illiteracy malnutrition and poverty than any other advanced industrialized country all getting worse predictably as the class war of the past decades intensifies in vigor and savagery a study of the bread for the world institute reported a considerable decline in people suffering from hunger throughout the world in the 1980s with only two exceptions africa which registered an increase from 36 to 37 and the united states where the numbers increased 50 from 1985 to 1990 as conservative reforms took hold increasing since

the problem is most severe among children with effects that are permanent it is wellknown that development of the brain is strongly influenced by the quality of the nourishment and nurturance given to infants and children among other effects of adverse environments early in life that can lead to permanent defects in memory and learning medical researchers john frank and fraser mustard but hunger among the elderly is also surging the wall street journal reports several million older americans are going hungry  and their numbers are growing steadily despite a federal law in force for 20 years aimed at providing free meals to anyone over 60 many are literally starving to death while some 5 million about 16 of the population over 60 are either hungry or malnourished to some degree  again phenomena unknown in other developed societies which lag behind us in the crusade for freedom and justice the level of malnutrition and real hunger is only increasing the assistant secretary for aging at the us department of health reports
to fully comprehend the meaning of such facts one must bear in mind the unparalleled advantages of the united states to select merely one indication health and life expectancy levels of mid18th century americans were not achieved by the upper classes in britain until the early 20th century  not to speak of less privileged parts of the world the social and economic catastrophe of american capitalism is quite an extraordinary phenomenon  for the great beast that is9

only 30 of the population are aware that military spending is the largest item on the federal budget and few of those know its scale or its purpose over a quarter think foreign aid is the biggest item in fact it is barely detectable the us has the most miserly record among the developed countries the record is even worse if we exclude the parts intended to enhance us control over middle east energy reserves aid to israel egypt and turkey by far the largest per capita component goes to a rich country israel  artificially rich because of the completely unparalleled flow of foreign capital including not just aid but also taxdeductible contributions that are used to maintain the sharp divisions between first and secondclass citizens and despite disclaimers for the joint usisrael project of incorporating the bulk of the occupied territories within the eventual state of israel eliminate that and us aid virtually vanishes  putting aside its character and effects

onefifth of the population believe welfare to be the largest federal expense it is not too surprising then that the top priority for voters in 1994 was welfare reform 46 the welfare system is just out of control voters felt though it pays to look more closely at actual attitudes 44 of respondents feel that we are spending too much on welfare and 23 too little economist nancy folbre notes but when the phrase assistance to the poor is substituted for welfare in the same question 13 say we are spending too much and 64 too little a reasonable speculation is that many people have absorbed reaganite lies about welfare queens by insinuation black driving cadillacs and believe that working people are supporting rich welfare recipients  as they are but not in the sense they imagine we return to that10

as already noted the secondranking priority for voters was health care reform 37 though the impressive ideological warfare of the past year has left people utterly confused about what the realistic options might be public debate was framed within narrow bounds the clinton plan being the liberal option with a few gestures to the radical extremists who thought the us might consider joining the rest of the industrial world the incomprehensible clinton plan  basically a giveaway to huge insurance companies  was rejected as just another big government proposal that would place peoples fate in the hands of pointyheaded bureaucrats who steal our money by imposing a crushing tax burden a publicly funded insurance program to the extent it could even be considered is still more odious in that respect

the option preferred by the privileged is for the fate of everyone else to be in the hands of insurance company executives whose goal as milton friedman can explain is to ensure maximum profit and market share meaning the worst possible health care elimination of personal choice except for the rich huge bureaucracies to micromanage physicians public subsidy for advertising profits and multiple layers of highpaid managers and executives and other massive inefficiencies that drive the us off the spectrum in costs for heath care the real meaning of the conservative option was illustrated right after the november election at the annual scientific convention of the american heart association where leading specialists reported that insurers are increasingly unwilling to pay for preventive care that would reduce hospitalization rates by 75 dr lynne stevenson of bostons brigham and womens hospital in contrast they are quite willing to pay for heart transplants  high tech operations that enrich the right people and institutions

one radical extremist thought that rarely reached threshold is that in a civilized society the costs of health care should be borne by progressive taxation on the basis of the principle that the poor should be exempted from taxation which should tax the higher portions of property in geometrical progression as they rise  as observed by the noted marxist thomas jefferson in a letter to his fellowsubversive james madison the united states is again off the spectrum on this aspect of human rights and needs as measured by public share of healthcare spending which is as progressive as the tax system the us is far below any country that has achieved any form of development even greece and portugal it is barely above turkey11

2 really existing conservatism

the propaganda victories come into sharper focus when we compare popular perceptions with social and economic realities take welfare it has sharply declined in real terms since 1970 nancy folbre observes a downward spiral that is continuing with more reductions in aid to families with dependent children afdc in 1991 than in any year since 1981 from 1970 maximum afdc benefits for a family of three with no other income fell over 40 and the national average of afdc benefits and food stamps combined is now at the level of afdc alone in 1960 before the foodstamp program was initiated

a still more severe distortion is the unspoken premise that child care is not work it comes free like womens domestic labor generally  the main reason why freeenterprise economies have worked relatively well over the decades economist sylvia ann hewlett comments child care therefore contrasts with real work speculating in currency markets devising tax shelters for the rich arranging mergers and acquisitions that significantly reduce rd and hence economic growth and other contributions that rank high on the scale of social utility and merit according to standard dogma which measures it by economic reward to the worker in particular single women taking care of children are plainly not working and therefore must be driven to the official workforce on grounds of economic efficiency not to speak of justice bipartisan doctrine holds the assumptions are somewhere between nonsensical and insane though reasonable enough within the general intellectual culture with its tacit dedication to class warfare

even on the narrowest grounds folbre observes in the american economic association proceedings public policy literally transfers resources from parents to nonparents by providing social insurance based on participation in paid employment without explicitly valuing time effort or money devoted to children who are in the longer term the crucial factor determining economic health even in the highly distorted ideological sense of the technical notion when real incomes in the middle quintile about 30000 in 1992 dollars are adjusted for child care costs they decline slightly through the 1970s quite sharply from 1980 to the present as conservatism triumphed12

responding to the public mood that has been shaped by a propaganda offensive of unusual intensity and fervor the highest priority for the new gingrich conservatives is to dismantle the welfare system they announced at once that they would repeal the food stamp act of 1977 the child nutrition act of 1966 the national school lunch act of 1946 the emergency food assistance act of 1983 and other federals laws intended to prevent hunger particularly among children which has not increased rapidly enough to satisfy the advocates of family values and free market verities furthermore what programs remain are to be transferred to states so as to bar any response to the typical sharp increase in need for food assistance when there is a recession as in 19912 when food stamp rolls sometimes grew by 300000 people a month the plans will lead to a dramatic increase in hunger senator patrick leahy observed realistically but thats nothing that has ever troubled the more loyal servants of the rich also on the legislative agenda  with the support of the new democrats  are work obligations for mothers who do not work by ideological fiat and reduction of afdc the main federal welfare program which reaches 143 million people over 9 million of them young children who must learn responsibility and internalize our values that there are no human rights apart from what can be won in the labor market

it would be unfair however to regard the leader newt gingrich as a heartless wretch he proposes that the money saved from afdc programs be used to build orphanages or group homes for children of families rendered destitute  the state being the proper provider for children not their mothers under the doctrine of family values perhaps the proposal is intended as a special contribution to the 1994 international year of the family or perhaps it is simply another useful federal subsidy providing benefits to the construction industry lawyers and other people of the right sort13

the real meaning of free market conservatism is illustrated by a closer look at the most passionate enthusiasts for getting the government off our backs and letting the market reign undisturbed take newt gingrich the leader of the victorious congressional army who are taking over under a master plan that relied on huge contributions for gingrichs gopac committee from corporate donors and others whose identity is a carefullyguarded secret the measures are of dubious legality gopac is now being sued by the federal elections commission on grounds that it failed to register and report as a political committee but legal questions aside the power play was a calculated political operation unique on the contemporary american political scene ellen miller director of the nonpartisan center for responsive politics yet another blow at the despised principles of democracy and the pretensions of the great beast to meddle where it doesnt belong14
gingrich represents cobb county georgia which the new york times  reasonably enough  selected in a recent frontpage story to illustrate the rising tide of conservatism aimed at ridding us of the nanny state the headline reads conservatism flowering among the malls in this wealthy suburb of atlanta one of several that offer  particularly to whites  a sense of prosperity and safety conservative southern values and a relaxed friendly way of life its a norman rockwell world with fiber optic computers and jet airplanes gingrich comments with pride with its history of inhospitality toward blacks cobb county is scrupulously insulated from any urban infection so that the inhabitants can enjoy the fruits of their enterpreneurial values and market enthusiasms in the conservative heart of a conservative region defended in congress by the leader of the conservative triumph

a small footnote cobb county receives more federal subsidies than any suburban county in the country with two exceptions arlington virginia effectively part of the federal government and brevard county florida the home of the kennedy space center when we move out of the state system itself cobb county is the leading beneficiary of the nanny state its largest employer is lockheed aeronautical systems company which is designing the f22 advanced tactical fighter and other military aircraft 72 of the workforce are in whitecollar jobs in expanding areas of the economy like insurance electronics and computers and trade  all carefully tended by the nanny state its remarkably easy for conservative entrepreneurial values to flourish while one is feeding happily at the public trough meanwhile praises to market miracles reach the heavens notably where conservatism is flowering among the malls15

an interesting sidelight is the silence over this matter during the electoral campaign when gingrich propaganda was smashing the new democrats notably absent is a simple rejoinder that would have stopped the juggernaut in its tracks gingrich is the countrys leading advocate of the welfare state  for the rich the reasons for the silence are not hard to discern class interests prevail over narrow electoral ones its agreed across the board that the rich must be protected from market discipline by a powerful and interventionist welfare state

gingrich is the author of the contract with america which calls for extending the doubleedged free market state protection and public subsidy for the rich market discipline for the poor the contract calls for cuts in social spending denying aid to children of minor mothers and those on welfare republican leaders add that they will support reductions proposed in the plan submitted by john kasich top republican on the budget committee its biggest cut is to be 50 billion from medicare and medicaid the health programs for the elderly and the poor but the contract calls for an increase in welfare for the rich by the classic means regressive fiscal measures and outright subsidy these include increased tax exemptions for gifts and estates capital gains cuts reduced regulation for protection of health and safety standards investment subsidies more favorable rules for depreciation and most important strengthening our national defense so that we can better maintain our credibility around the world  so that anyone who gets funny ideas like priests and nuns in latin america will understand that what we say goes as george bush defined the new world order while bombs and missiles were raining on iraq16

national defense is of course a sick joke which would elicit ridicule outside of a commissar culture the us faces no threats and already spends almost as much on defense as the rest of the world combined as in the past military spending is arguably increasing security threats for example by arms exports which now provide 25 of revenue for defense contractors and dominate the international arms market increasing sharply since the end of the cold war clinton has just added an important innovation for the first time policy will factor the health of us weapons makers and the shape of the domestic economy into decisions on whether to approve foreign arms sales the press reports a natural step now that the soviet pretext has collapsed and it becomes necessary to face the facts more honestly17

unlike defense and security military expenditures are no joke they ensure that we will be able to behave with others multilaterally when we can and unilaterally as we must the clinton version of the traditional doctrine delivered to the un security council by ambassador madeleine albright as it wavered over a resolution condemning iraq albright instructed the council that if need be the us would act alone because we recognize this area as vital to us national interests  and we recognize no limits or constraints surely nothing as ridiculous as international law human rights or the united nations as we pursue our role as selfappointed global enforcer18

apart from maintaining a particular form of stability in the interests of the world rulers the pentagon must continue to provide lavishly for newt gingrich and his rich constituents by means of a taxpayer subsidy to advanced industry nothing has changed in this regard since the early postwar period when the business world recognized that the aircraft industry established by public funds and wartime profiteering cannot satisfactorily exist in a pure uncompetitive unsubsidized free enterprise economy fortune and that the government is their only possible savior business week for wellknown reasons the pentagon system was revitalized as the savior sustaining and expanding the industry now the leading civilian exporter along with steel and metals generally electronics chemicals machine tools and other central components of the industrial economy as long as the fable could be sustained the cold war provided the pretext the fraud was conscious at least among those minimally astute the first secretary of the air force stuart symington put the matter plainly in january 1948 the word to talk was not subsidy the word to talk was security as industry representative in washington symington regularly demanded enough procurement funds in the military budget to meet the requirements of the aircraft industry in his words the story continues without essential change until today in just about every functioning sector of the economy and surely in cobb county

furthermore the story goes back to the origins of the republic economic historian paul bairoch describes the united states as the mother country and bastion of modern protectionism which was born in the united states  which may be unfair to our british predecessors no laggards in the art protectionism is only one form of state intervention and not the major one as in the british case there are intermittent deviations from the commitment to protect the rich from market discipline related to the expectation of temporary gain under conditions of dominance when need arises conservatives are quick to call for increased state intervention as in the reagan years had market forces been allowed to function there would be no us steel or automobile industry today not to speak of computer chips and electronics generally the reaganites simply closed the market to japanese competition while pouring in public funds

thensecretary of the treasury james baker proudly proclaimed to a business audience that reagan had granted more import relief to us industry than any of his predecessors in more than half a century he was far too modest it was actually more all his predecessors combined doubling import restrictions to 23 one of the few authentic free trade advocates international economist fred bergsten added that the reagan administration specialized in the kind of managed trade that most restricts trade and closes markets voluntary export restraint agreements  which are voluntary in the sense that protection payments to the mafia enforcer are voluntary this is the most insidious form of protectionism bergsten pointed out which raises prices reduces competition and reinforces cartel behavior the 1994 economic report to congress estimates that reaganite protectionist measures reduced us manufacturing imports by about onefifth such measures have been expanded under clinton one recent example being the proposal to spend 1 billion to subsidize development and production of flatpanel computer display screens subsidies barred by the gatt accords signed a few weeks earlier19

this is just the tip of the iceberg the bought priesthood may spin tales about market discipline and its virtues but business executives and the government that is their shadow will tolerate no such nonsense  for the rich that is

gingrichs contract is remarkably brazen thus the proposals for welfare for the rich appear under the heading the job creation and wage enhancement act the section does include a provision for measures to create jobs and raise worker wages  with the word unfunded quietly added but no matter in contemporary newspeak the word jobs means profits so it is indeed a job creation proposal which will continue to enhance wages downwards

the pattern is virtually exceptionless former senate democratic leader george mitchell was replaced in november by olympia snowe a prominent conservative whose campaign focused on protecting the portsmouth naval shipyard and loring air force base  that is making sure that federal largesse continues to flow the benefits heavily skewed towards the wealthy though the official mantra is jobs even looking just at the narrow matter of welfare we find much the same thing the center for popular economics amherst estimates that when we consider direct benefits and tax breaks  masked welfare payments  an average household with income under 10000 receives about 60 of the welfare provided to households with income over 100000 looking at details total payments for food stamps in 1993 amounted to 25 billion welfare and family support 16 billion and supplemental security income poor elderly disabled 21 billion these figures may be compared with the 49 billion in deductions for interest payments mostly mortgage payments 80 to familes with incomes over 50000 skewed more radically toward the higher reaches for obvious reasons farm price supports again skewed toward the wealthy amounted to 16 billion total payments to the poor add up to less than the three largest tax breaks that benefit the middle class and wealthy deductions for retirement plans the deduction for home mortgage interest and the exemption of healthinsurance premiums that companies pay for their employees michael wines reports in the times in a rare window opened to the real world noting further that most tax breaks and payments to the wellsituated are practically exempt from the debate over controlling expenditures20

this of course is the merest fragment not counting such matters as business expenses dinners at elegant restaurants prize seats at the opera and sporting events club memberships etc all small in comparison with the massive subsidies through the system of protection and subsidy by the nanny state simply to indicate scale in canada less extreme than the us in its dedication to a nanny state for the rich the national council of welfare estimates that day care facilities for the 750000 children who need them would cost 15 billion not a great deal more than the tax money lost by the business entertainment deduction21

reacting to the contract labor secretary robert reich suggested that congress end corporate welfare as we know it removing tax breaks for particular industries and agriculture that amount to tens of billions a year he also noted that over a quarter of taxes go to pay interest on the national debt most of it accumulated by the statist reactionaries of the 1980s who played their spendandborrow games under the conservative disguise reichs speech on economic and social policy was prominently reported  in the london financial times though for accuracy it did receive a few lines under worldwide notes in the wall street journal the same day22

the principles are clear and explicit free markets are fine for the third world and its growing counterpart at home mothers with dependent children can be sternly lectured on the need for selfreliance but not dependent executives and investors please for them the welfare state must flourish

focusing on rich countries like ours is highly misleading to put it mildly the doubleedged free market ideology has by far its most lethal effects in the traditional colonial domains which apart from the japanbased area are mostly an utter disaster improving here and there only by ideologicallybased economic measures that dispense with effects on people while almost all industrial societies have become more protectionist in past years the reaganites generally led the pack the effects on the south have been devastating compounding the consequences of the imfworld bank structural adjustment programs which have had a brutal impact on the poor majority while benefiting foreign investors and elite sectors linked to them

market distortions by the rich have been a major factor in doubling the already huge gap between the poorest and richest countries in the past generation the 1992 un development report estimates that various protectionist and financial measures taken by the rich countries have deprived the south of 12 trillion a year about 12 times total aid  most of it publiclysubsidized export promotion this behavior is virtually criminal the distinguished irish diplomat and author erskine childers observed recently he also notes that the west under us lead blocked a 1991 resolution tabled at the general assembly by the south against economic measures as a means of political and economic coercion against developing countries the favored technique apart from terror by which the us has sought to destroy such independent upstarts as cuba and nicaragua  while never ceasing to sing odes to the free market the fact is very little known childers writes because of course such things do not get reported by the dominant northern media he hopes that some day this wholesale moral abdication by northern countries will lead to their utter shame before their own citizens shame that will start on the day when northern academicians and ngos institute a blackmail watch to stand alongside the human rights watches23

not tomorrow we can be sure of that

with hopelessly inadequate apologies to the victims ill put aside that terrible story of major crimes against humanity for which we bear continuing responsibility

next month ill turn to two topics the specific measures that are being used to control the surplus population and the general background against which these crimes against humanity proceed the former include the growing crime industry unrelated to crime but closely related to the need to cage those growing categories of the population who have no role to play in enriching the wealthy and privileged and therefore lack rights by conservative values another striking component is the war against families and children that was led by reaganthatcher conservatives and is now to be sharply enhanced yet another is the effort to restore something like the satanic mills of the early period of industrialization for those who retain some rights under reigning values all of this is entirely reasonable as major tendencies in the global economy of the past quarter century have at least raised the possibility that the world might be driven to an extreme form of totalitarian domination by wealthy and powerful sectors with the gains for human rights freedom and democracy won in bitter struggle over centuries now reversed  a shift from containment to rollback to borrow some of the largely deceitful terminology of foreign policy discussion



rollback part ii

february 1995

the new year opened auspiciously with the announcement of the revolutionary agenda of the conservatives responding to the popular mandate conferred by their landslide victory  in which they gained 505 percent of the votes of the minority who took part and were overwhelmingly opposed by nonvoters while onesixth of those who did vote regarded the outcome as an affirmation of the republican agenda and one out of nine saw a more conservative congress as an issue meanwhile large majorities as usual favored more government spending for domestic programs and more help for the poor reduced military spending and other traditional parts of the liberal agenda that the population had overwhelmingly repudiated according to standard doctrine1

1 the conservative agenda

the conservatives  ill adopt the term reluctantly  cannot be faulted for concealing what they have in mind their agenda hews closely to the traditional doubleedged conception of markets personal responsibility freedom from government interference and so on the slogans are to be interpreted literally and harshly for everyone  apart from the rich minority who are exempt from such strictures quite the contrary the interests of the privileged are to be enhanced by a powerful and interventionist nanny state which transfers vast public subsidies to them and otherwise caters to their whims newt gingrichs conservative constituents in their wealthy atlanta suburb cannot be expected to face market discipline they must maintain their lead among recipients of public subsidies so that they can bask in selfpraise for their independence and entrepreneurial values and indulge in their visceral distaste for the federal government that fills their pockets with public funds  without which they would soon join the laggards and spongers they despise2

clintons first response to the conservative landslide was to increase pentagon spending already high even by cold war levels he announced an increase of 25 billion over the next six years directly contravening the public will the gingrich contract with america calls for 60 billion as well understood within the business community the pentagon is a central component of the nanny state  for the rich gingrichs constituents in particular

the new republican leadership opened their campaign with plans for welfare reform the proposals are finetuned to the principles of class warfare by far the largest entitlements among those that are mentionable that is are social security and medicare but benefits under these programs are not classbased not only the poor reach retirement age furthermore funding of social security is sufficiently regressive to make it more tolerable these huge and rapidly growing programs are therefore not on the conservative agenda  for now as policy marches on from containment of human rights and democracy to rollback they too are unlikely to survive since the wealthy can prosper without them the programs that face radical cuts are food stamps afdc and medicaid afdc reaches 14 million people who are destitute 97 million of them children it has declined sharply since 1970 particularly since the reagan years medicaid provides health care for 33 million people who cannot afford it though a small fragment of officiallyrecognized welfare these programs are designed to help people who are weak and defenseless therefore subject to market discipline and the demands of personal responsibility

the reforms are still more finely honed the food stamp program is likely to survive the new york times reports because it has a middleclass constituency that includes farmers grocers and the food industry generally agribusiness great marketing chains and the transnationals that dominate the food industry are a middle class constituency with human rights but afdc lacks these merits over five million children are to be deprived of its meager support though they would not be harmed by losing their subsistence republican house leaders assure us because adults on welfare will protect their children by working or getting married  taking jobs that do not provide a living wage if they even exist and marrying men who can join the surging prison population when they fail to find work3

the planned tax cuts reveal the same refined sensibility they are designed to benefit the truly wealthy the times editors accurately comment including capital gains tax cuts and depreciation writeoffs for business that will run the deficit up even higher and that should properly be called transfer payments from the poor to the rich other tax cuts are supposedly intended to benefit the middle class the category includes people who earn up to 100000 a year more than 96 percent of taxpayers as the president defines the term and up to 200000 a year more than 99 percent of taxpayers under the republican definition that means there is almost no one left to pick up the tab so the burden is placed overwhelmingly on the shoulders of those least able to bear it the major middle class tax cut a credit for dependent children a regressive measure that offers little or nothing to people too poor to take advantage of it that aside it benefits primarily the rich generally the more income that taxpayers have the more likely they are to have dependent children the times reports for instance 55 percent of taxpayers with incomes from 100000 to 200000 in 1991 claimed at least one exemption for a dependent as compared with 42 percent in the 3000035000 range close to the actual middle class

the tax cuts too are hailed by their bipartisan advocates as a response to the popular will which was revealed by a harris poll after the elections twothirds felt the state of the nation was not good their reasons varied including high taxes  selected by three percent4

the hidden welfare state for the rich with its huge entitlements concealed by tax deductions and other devious means scarcely enters the debate over welfare reform but it is by no means unaffected buried in the house republicans contract with america is a very sweet deal for the nations big capitalintensive companies the wall street journal reported in december reviewing an array of tax breaks and other devices that will provide a sizable subsidy to corporations possibly eliminating taxable income entirely for large firms and increasing the deficit in accord with the reaganite version of fiscal conservatism the program is carefully crafted so that its impact will not be felt until 1997  coincidentally after the presidential election something we are not supposed to notice irs officials predict a cost to the taxpayer of over 14 billion a year by the end of the decade

reacting to the gingrich contract labor secretary robert reich gave a speech last november in which he suggested ending corporate welfare as we know it it was reported in the business press abroad and received a few words in the wall street journal as well the journal returned to the topic a few weeks later in an article by alan murray on the tax breaks that shower billions in benefits on the oil and gas timber cattlebreeding and realestate industries and others one minor component of the nanny state for the rich murray referred to mr reichs broadside against corporate welfare noting that it was quickly shot down by friendly fire from the white house and cabinet the administration had discussed cutting back the 114 billion of spending over the next five years that benefits specific industries as well as 110 billion in tax subsidies some for single industries some aimed at public funding of advertising and purchase of mansions through tax subsidies all such ideas are going nowhere however and already have been taken off the table

the mood was symbolized at the first triumphal session of the new congress with the gingrich army in charge in a halfhearted gesture house democrats sought to embarrass republicans for declining to include a ban on lobbyists gifts in the new rules the wall street journal mentioned on p 16 there was also brief notice in the times quoting the reaction of the commanderinchief himself gingrich said hed heard rumors that imply that theyre just into sort of a fairly stupid strategy of cheap and nasty which makes one wonder just how dumb they think the american people are imagine how the public would react to the idea of making it harder for corporations to purchase votes in our model democracy5

state governments are responding to the popular mandate the same way in new york a draft proposal of governorelect george patakis administration calls for a cut of over 1 billion in medicaid while mayor rudolph giuliani proposed a 25 percent reduction in medicaid and other help for the poor to better comprehend these measures one may bear in mind that in manhattan the income gap between rich and poor is greater than in guatemala and within the us is surpassed only by a group of 70 households in a former leper colony in hawaii the gap widened in the 1980s more than in any other county with over 50000 people6

the justification for such budgetary proposals is dual the popular mandate that overwhelmingly opposes them and the lack of funds the mandate is beyond challenge americans like gop agenda a lead story is headlined in the new york times citing data showing that 65 percent of the public believe the government has a responsibility to take care of the poor while 9 percent think programs for poor children should be decreased support for a balanced budget amendment is equally impressive 22 percent if it would require cuts in spending on education and comparable figures if other cuts in social spending are contemplated

equally beyond challenge is the fact that there just isnt enough money available in this lean and mean age times are tough all over particularly for the great corporations that are enjoying dazzling profits fortune magazine exults meanwhile business week worries over the problem now what to do with all that cash headline as surging profits are overflowing the coffers of corporate america and dividends are booming thanks in large measure to profits from overseas operations in the interest of jobs for americans meanwhile the census bureau reports that 95 percent of the population has lost income since 1989 with a 7 percent decline in median family income continuing through the clinton recovery real hourly pay including benefits has fallen 1 percent a year for the median male since 1979 including the 199193 recovery years labor economists jared bernstein and lawrence mishel report7

less delighted are city governments which will face the problems created as federal government and the states shift benefits towards the wealthy even more than under the prevailing norms meeting in december the us conference of mayors reported that requests by needy people increased by 12 percent in 1994 requests for emergency shelter even more 15 percent of requests for emergency food aid had to be denied along with almost 14 of requests by homeless families who remained homeless an average of 9 months the mayors conference called for an increase in federal assistance programs responding to a different popular mandate than the one that is perceived by the political class and media elite the popular mandate reflected consistently in polls but irrelevant to policy which is insulated from politics to borrow a useful phrase from the london economist8

another target is foreign aid already by far the lowest of any major industrialised country as a proportion of gross domestic product the financial times observes and virtually nonexistent if we eliminate the grants to the primary recipient israel a rich first world country thanks to unprecedented subsidy from abroad and the secondary beneficiaries to make sure they play their role in guaranteeing us control over middle east energy reserves senator mitch mcconnell who will chair the subcommittee on foreign operations announced that aid should be restricted to advancing americas security and economic interests that is overwhelmingly true already but the principle must be implemented more harshly still the pennies that go to africa for example serve almost no useful purpose merely helping human beings while aid to most countries should be cut mcconnell announced aid to the middle east should be increased primarily to israel then to other middle east gendarmes9

also facing the axe are regulatory measures mostly unenforced by the criminal state during the reagan years a primary reason for the collapse of unions and the sharp rise in industrial accidents business week reported in an important cover story new proposals aim to reduce or eliminate such market distortions which merely save lives at the cost of profits these december 1994 announcements were exquisitely timed coinciding with new disclosures about the effects of the failure to control predatory profitseeking on december 19 the boston globe reviewed the destruction of the georges bank fishing grounds off the new england coast formerly one of the worlds richest parts had to be closed completely in middecember with more drastic actions anticipated in the hope that the fish population virtually depleted might recover  a vain hope many scientists fear after the area was closed to foreign boats by a 200mile fishing limit declared in 1976 us fishing operations nearly doubled spurred by government tax credits the predictable result of state subsidy and lack of regulation was to decimate populations of cod haddock and other major stocks cod may become virtually extinct the northeast fisheries science center predicted new england the traditional home of codfish is now importing its cod from norway the government of norway took strong measures to stop overfishing years ago following a different philosophical tradition from north america one that allows the government in the public interest to place some controls on economic actors kare bryn director of the resources department in norways fisheries ministry the philosophical tradition here is quite different allowing the government only to offer massive protection and public subsidy to business interests in accord with our deepseated libertarian commitments

in the 1980s the vicechair of the government fishery management council concedes there was not enough conservation and too much concern about the impacts it would have on shortterm profit to be precise i think everybody regrets that now but thats like crying over spilled milk the regrets are revealed by the passionate dedication to dismantle what is left of the regulatory apparatus so as to maximize the scale of future tragedies10

the day after this report was published president clinton announced his plans to implement the conservative program with cuts in government spending apart from the pentagon subsidy to the rich which is to increase the major cuts are to be in the energy department slowing down cleanup of nuclear waste cutting research and turning management of the petroleum reserve to private enterprise  the term is even more of a joke than usual in reference to the energy industry the same day the new york times reported new scientific evidence on the depletion of the ozone layer and global warming satellite data revealed that industrial gases are the primary factor in depletion of the ozone layer which scientists fear might spread over northern areas and satellites also provided the most precise data yet available on rise of the sea level showing it to be within the range predicted by global warming models the potential threat to human life is not trivial

also on the same day the staff of the house health and environment subcommittee released a report reviewing tobacco industry data purporting to show that secondhand smoke is not a significant hazard in workplaces the data had been a significant element in industry campaigns to bar regulation the report observed the data were faked according to workers who took the measurements the conclusion was supported by the house committees research staff and an independent review by a chemist at the naval research laboratory when the fakery is corrected the hazard proves to be considerably higher is that a surprise when an industry regulates itself perhaps to really dedicated commissars incoming chair thomas bliley of virginia an industry champion business week refused to comment

other efforts to save lives from depredations by the rulers are also to decline under the conservative regimen among other consequences the environmental protection agency and occupational safety  health administration are likely to lose much of their limited effect and pharmaceutical prescriptions may not have to provide information about safe drug use the basic plan is to impose conditions on any regulatory statute that will be almost impossible to meet for example largely meaningless costbenefit analyses that can be extended without limit by corporate lawyers of even limited intelligence

the human consequences are not hard to predict but shortterm profit will increase for the publiclysubsidized private sector of the economy civilization marches on

other proposed measures lead in the same direction one component of the current crusade is to shift such government funding as remains to the states outside of the expanding nanny state for the wealthy it is anticipated that state governments will be much more susceptible to the influence of private tyranny which overwhelms local populations in resources and can play one against another in the timehonored fashion an illustration reported just as the crusade was launched is the effect of the decision by congress in 1991 to transfer control over transportation funds to the states of the 35 billion that has gone to them so far 96 percent was used for highway projects in violation of the intent of the legislation to support mass transit according to the chair of the house committee on public works and transporation norman mineta one of its authors some attribute this massive institutional civil disobedience to pressures from entrenched highway construction interests but a look back to the huge federal social engineering projects that destroyed public transportation and suburbanized america in the interests of dominant components of the corporate sector suggests broader goals president clintons first proposed reductions should accelerate the process one such cut would reduce federal spending for highway bridge airport and rail infrastructure for 5 billion and give the states more discretion on spending the rest nyt the end result could be more potholes and higher fares for many taxpayers one can guess perhaps that mass transport will end up being the primary target as plans reach practice

the basic principles have long been familiar and are sometimes articulated plainly enough after a recent series of ferry disasters in the baltic with hundreds of lives lost the former president of britains royal institution of naval architects pointed out that measures to overcome the problems are well understood but owners wont follow them unless they are forced you choose whether you have regulation or let thousands more people die the stakes here are far greater but the principle is the same shortterm gain for the privileged few might be impaired if the welfare of the general population and future generations is taken into consideration and under the civilized values that newt gingrich and other rollback advocates seek to instill the relative weights are clear11

2 the surplus population

when the doctrines of contemporary neoliberalism were crafted in early 19th century england the message to the population was clear and simple under capitalism you have no rights apart from what your labor will bring in the market a person without independent wealth has no claim of right to the smallest portion of food and in fact has no business to be where he is malthus proclaimed in highly influential work it is a great evil and violation of natural liberty to mislead the poor into believing that they have further rights david ricardo held outraged at this assault against the principles of economic science which are as immutable as the principles of gravitation he held and against the moral principles on which the science rests no less exalted the message is simple you have a free choice the labor market the workhouse prison death or go somewhere else  as was possible when vast spaces were opening thanks to the extermination and expulsion of indigenous populations12

the doctrines are being revived but under radically different conditions ricardos science was founded on the principle that capital is more or less immobile and labor highly mobile we are enjoined today to worship the consequences of ricardos science despite the fact that the assumptions on which they are based have been reversed capital is highly mobile and labor virtually immobile  libertarian conservatives lead the way in rejecting adam smiths principle that free circulation of labor is a cornerstone of free trade in keeping with their contempt for markets except for the weak other assumptions of the science are so radically false that the whole topic is hard to take seriously among them the abstraction from severe market distortions resulting from the centrallymanaged transactions of the huge corporate structures that dominate the international economy and the reliance on the nanny state that has been such a decisive factor in economic growth and the specific forms it has taken throughout history and remains so

the science originated as a weapon of class warfare has been adapted for similar ends over the years it is returning to its origins today as the prospects for rollback improve narrowing substantially the choices for the growing population who lack rights by doctrinal decision  termed science or natural law

the surplus population has to be kept in ignorance but also controlled the problem is faced directly in the third world domains that have long been dominated by the west and therefore reflect the guiding values of the masters most clearly here favored devices include death squads social cleansing torture and other techniques of proven effectiveness at home more civilized methods are still required the superfluous population is to be cooped up within urban slums that increasingly resemble concentration camps or if that fails sent to prisons the counterpart in a richer society to the death squads we train and support in our domains under reaganite enthusiasts for state power the number of prisoners in the us almost tripled leaving our main competitors south africa and russia well behind  though russia has just caught up now that they are mastering the values of their american tutors13

the bipartisan crime bill should facilitate the process of controlling the unwanted population with its vast new expenditures for prisons sharp increase in the death penalty and much harsher sentencing procedures again this is an acceptable form of state action serving the social function of population control and providing yet another keynesian stimulus to the economy to the construction industry lawyers security personnel and so on the public subsidy of the crime industry is coming to approach the scale of the pentagon though it is less favored its benefits are not so sharply skewed towards the wealthy nonetheless its reasonable that gingrichs contract should call for expanding this aspect of the war against the general public

the crime rate has not changed significantly for twenty years and recently has declined if official figures can be taken seriously the fbi reported in early december that crime rates in 1994 decreased to the lowest level since 1986 for overall crime since 1990 for violent crime and since 1985 for property crime though white collar crime is only sporadically reported but punishment has gone up fast as the rate of incarceration shows and in highly restricted ways targeting the most vulnerable sectors mainly blacks and latinos the close raceclass correlation in the us makes the procedure only more natural these sectors are regarded as a criminal population one leading criminologist william chambliss concludes from recent studies including direct observation by students and faculty in a project with the washington police thats not exactly correct criminals are supposed to have constitutional rights but as his onthescene studies show these communities do not they are effectively under military occupation young black and latino men living in americas ghettos and barrios are under siege from and at war with the police chambliss writes

the 1994 crime bill is designed to increase the prison population and the costs of maintaining it with little if any effect on crime the three strikes provision ensures that people will remain in prison long past the age when criminal actions are likely as has much research has shown and the aging population will either require minimal and costly care or be left to die in keeping with expansion of the right to kill granted to state authority under contemporary libertarian doctrine the crime bill also ends funding for vocational and other training pell grants slight expenditures that markedly decrease recidivism and prison violence such measures make no sense as part of a war against crime they make a lot of sense however as part of a war against the population with two aspects removal of people superfluous for profitmaking and control of the large majority targeted for reduction of quality of life and opportunity who must be somehow frightened into submission to authority14

the largely fraudulent drug war has served as an effective device for this population control program criminalization of drugs has increased crime  including crime by government agencies from local police to the cia  though studies show no effect on drug availability or use and decriminalization where it has been tried seems to have increased neither in 1992 nearly 30 percent of state and over 55 percent of federal prisoners were convicted on drug charges a third for marijuana twothirds of these arrests were for possession not sale or manufacture one finds few executives of banks or chemical corporations in prison though banks are surely involved in money laundering  a banking subsidiary of american express just paid 32 million in a settlement in a moneylaundering case with no criminal charges15  and the government estimates that more than 90 percent of the chemicals used to produce cocaine come from the united states a reaganera cia study concluded that us exports of such chemicals to latin america far exceed amounts used for any legal commercial purpose concluding that they are diverted to heroin and cocaine production

it has been welldocumented that the drug business has trailed us subversive and counterinsurgency activities quite closely since the cia helped reestablish the mafiarun heroin racket in france after world war ii as part of the program to undermine the labor movement and the antifascist resistance the reasons are also too well known to recount the latest phase unsurprisingly involves afghanistan where the us spent billions of dollars through the 1980s in support of the islamic fundamentalist extremist gulbuddin hekmatyar who has taken the lead in tearing to shreds what remained of the shattered country after the russian invaders withdrew the far eastern economic review reports that 1994 opium production in afghanistan is the biggest crop the world has ever seen enabling afghanistan and pakistan the base for the cia operations to win first place in world heroinproduction overtaking the golden triangle that gained that status as a byproduct of us subversion and aggression a generation ago

it is now widely accepted the review reports that the us deliberately played down heroin production by the mujahideen during these years 198089 causing at least one dea agent to resign in disgust because of the cias protection of known druglords one consequence is that pakistan with no significant drug problem in 1980 now has perhaps as many as 2 million heroin addicts while heroinexport earnings amount to about 20 percent of its formal exports a un report estimates most of the heroin produced ends up in the united states

the leading drugproducing center in the western hemisphere colombia gives more insight into the nature of the drug war the leading human rights violator in the hemisphere colombia also receives the most us military aid now more than half of what goes to the entire hemisphere increasing under clinton the jesuitbased justice and peace bulletin just published a study of human rights abuses during the last year of the administration of cesar gaviria washingtons favorite recently imposed as secretarygeneral of the oas in a washington powerplay that was much resented the general picture is horrendous as before but the antidrug strategy is particularly relevant here colombia had two major cartels medellin and cali the medellin cartel the bulletin reports evolved out of popular low class origins with a marked tendency to show off its wealth ostentatiously and act in a robin hoodlike manner implementing social projects in poor areas of the city and with a military apparatus separate from and threatening and aggressive towards the government which is regarded as an enemy by much of the population the cali cartel with aristocratic upper class roots discreet and careful to camouflage and blend its wealth in with that of the countrys welltodo industrialists and businessmen infiltrated into all of the governments spheres of influence and power with a military apparatus allied and coordinated with government armed forces

the two cartels were accorded very different treatment the gaviria administration destroyed the medellin cartel in military operations that involved massacres largescale torture disappearances and illegal arrests the cali cartel has had a more pleasant fate including leaders who were involved in horrible massacres carried out in alliance with members of the armed forces it now enjoys absolute territorial domination and control in major drugproducing regions where paramilitary groups allied with the military have established veritable strongholds

nevertheless the cali cartel is harshly treated in comparison to the leading narcotrafficking mobsters it is conventional and convenient to externalize the issue focusing attention on evil creatures in foreign lands who poison our children and destroy our cities a useful corrective is offered in a study by the oecd the organization of the wealthy industrial societies reviewed in mexicos main journal excelsior by apolinar biazcallejas of the andean commission of jurists and the latin american association for human rights the oecd study found that the money produced by drug trafficking throughout the world reached 460 billion in 1993 of which the us received 260 billion which is circulated through its financial system in contraband and through other ways colombia as a producerexporter gets only 5 to 7 billion or 2 to 3 percent of what remains in the us the big business is therefore in that country veiled in anonymity and beyond reach of law16

at home both criminal law and police practice are blatantly racist chambliss concludes blacks constitute twothirds of prisoners in state prisons convicted of drug offenses and 40 percent of all drug arrests though more whites than blacks use illegal drugs and more than 80 percent of the population is white possession of a small amount of crack cocaine the drug of choice in the ghetto carries a mandatory fiveyear prison sentence without the possibility of parole but possession of a hundred times that amount of cocaine powder the drug of choice of the white middle class has no mandatory sentence

while crime has not changed much in scale or character in the last twenty years perceptions have the perceptions did not precede and motivate government crime laws as has been claimed by james q wilson and other conservative scholars rather as polls show concerns were stimulated by rightwing political elements primarily from the 1960s in that period chambliss points out crime could serve as a smokescreen to conceal other issues as well as legitimation for legislation designed primarily to suppress political dissent and overturn supreme court decisions

blacks are particularly targeted because they are defenseless and have little influence and engendering fear is of course a standard method of population control whether the chosen targets are blacks jews immigrants homosexuals or whatever these are the basic reasons it seems for the growth of the crime control industry not that crime isnt a real threat to safety and survival it certainly is particularly for the poor but the problem is not being addressed rather used as a method of population control in various ways

children are also vulnerable and defenseless hence another fit target for conservativesonthemarch the matter has recently been addressed in several important books one a 1993 unicef study by us economist sylvia ann hewlett that deals with child care in rich societies another by the canadian writer linda mcquaig the 1 bestseller in canada for 23 weeks17 studying the past 15 years hewlett finds a sharp split between angloamerican societies and those of continental europe and japan mcquaig finds the same effect and focuses on the consequences for canada as it shifts towards the reaganthatcher model this model hewlett writes has been a disaster for children and families the europeanjapanese model in contrast has improved their situation considerably both authors attribute the angloamerican disaster to the ideological preference for free markets thats only half true whatever one chooses to call the reigning ideology it is unfair to tarnish the good name of conservatism by applying it to this form of violent lawless reactionary statism which despises markets almost as much as it does democracy and freedom

causes aside there isnt much doubt about the effects of the free market for the weak what hewlett calls the antichild spirit that is loose in these lands subjected to the neglectfilled angloamerican model which has largely privatized childrearing while making it effectively impossible for most of the population the result is a predictable disaster for children and families while in the much more supportive european model social policy has strengthened support systems for families and children

its no great secret a blueribbon commission of the national association of state boards of education and the american medical association concluded in 1990 that never before has one generation of children been less healthy less cared for or less prepared for life than their parents were at the same age  though only in the angloamerican societies where an antichild antifamily spirit has reigned for 15 years under the guise of conservatism and family values this is yet another triumph of the bought priesthood as the independent working class press referred to the intellectual servants of power a century ago before free expression was overcome by state repression and market forces

conservatives are not devoted only to children and families but also to the middle classes which have declined under their rule to levels well below those of comparable countries japan germany sweden the netherlands etc as society is split more sharply into rich and poor the gap has so widened that the director of the respected luxembourg income study us economist timothy smeeding shocked congress with data showing that the us tolerates a level of disadvantage unknown to any other major country on earth18

new york city mentioned earlier happens to be an extreme case but the pattern is quite general and even extends to us domains latin america is the region of traditional us influence it also has the most extreme inequality in the world thanks in large measure to specific policies designed to prevent a form of economic nationalism which it was feared would lead to more egalitarian and independent development the current favorites are typical in that regard from mexico to argentina

mexicos neoliberal achievements were lauded effusively until the bubble burst in recent weeks the achievements included slow economic growth despite a huge flow of foreign assistance to make the miracle work falling real wages and growing inequality the mexican government concedes that the number of citizens living below the poverty line has increased from 13 million in 1990 to 24 million in 1994 closely tracking this impressive record the number of billionaires rose from 13 in 1993 to 24 in 1994 as compared with one in 1987 so forbes magazine reported in its annual review of the swelling roster of global billionaires in the global economy so short of capital that the great mass of the population must be crushed the mexican billionaires achieved their exalted status mostly in league with the state authorities the biggest gift horse has been privatization the giveaway of public resources under very generous terms for investors political economist john summa observes with cautious understatement economist david barkin adds that the privatization of mexicos government holdings was systematically channeled to president salinas cronies to use business weeks expression in a cynical abuse of the process in which it is rumored that the president himself is a major participant enjoying enormous wealth as a result of his private holdings there is also a great inflow of foreign capital most of it going into shortterm speculative holdings rather than into directly productive investments

in argentina also highly praised for its progress under world bank tutelage real wages dropped 30 percent since 1980 income inequality increased radically and the social expenditures by the public sector benefit more the upper levels of the social pyramid than the lower levels a confidential world bank study reported as in mexico the laws of neoliberal science still as immutable as the principles of gravitation are functioning as they have throughout history

among the developed societies the topranking us client and by far the leading recipient of us aid is israel which also has extreme economic inequality by first world standards it is increasing under the neoliberal policies of the labor government in 1992 the number of families below the poverty line increased by over 14 percent almost 6 percent more in 1993 now reaching about 650000 people 280000 of them children the figures include only 45 percent of palestinian citizens of whom over a third were below the poverty line uncounted also are the poor in agricultural settlements and those considered to be selfemployed19

the consistency is difficult to miss though not to explain

within the ideological system it is claimed that equality and economic growth are in conflict we choose one or the other and our commitment to growth along the lines pioneered by our hero adam smith has the unfortunate consequence of engendering inequality though all ultimately gain as wealth increases there are a few problems with the theory one is that equality is a significant factor contributing to growth as is conceded even by the world bank despite its dedication to antiegalitarian policies another is that the model that us leaders have imposed abroad and seek to duplicate as far as possible here has led to extreme misery and impoverishment even after long experiments  a rather consistent effect of the experiments conducted by the masters over centuries a third problem is that the hero at whose shrine we worship would have been appalled by the argument a precapitalist thinker with roots in the enlightenment smith based his argument for markets on the belief that under perfect liberty there would be a natural tendency towards equality a condition for efficient market function one can hardly say that his argument has been empirically refuted given the extreme remoteness of really existing capitalism from liberty as understood by classical liberalism20

a symbolic expression of the disaster for families is the fate of the international convention on rights of the child adopted by the united nations in november 1989 and ratified by 162 countries but not the united states  though for fairness we should add that contemporary conservatism is catholic in its antichild spirit a decade ago the world health organization voted 118 to 1 to condemn the nestle corporations aggressive marketing of its infant formula in the third world well aware of the likely toll in infant disease and death the reagan white house cast the sole negative vote leading the way in the noble cause of free market capitalism and family values21

another symbolic expression is a new line of hallmark greeting cards one to be placed under a cereal box in the morning reads have a super day at school another placed on the pillow at night says i wish i were there to tuck you in parents arent home one effect of the antichild antifamily spirit engendered by doubleedged conservatism

in part the disaster for families and children is a direct consequence of falling wages for much of the population both parents have to work 5060 hours a week merely to provide necessities and the elimination of market rigidities means that you work extra hours at lower wages  or you may watch your children starve all strictly voluntary of course in our free society it doesnt take a genius to predict the consequences and the statistics show them stanford university economist victor fuchs estimates that us children have lost 1012 hours of parental time per week between 1960 and 1986 total contact time dropped 40 percent in the past generation leading to deterioration of parentchild relations and family identity and values increased reliance on tv for child supervision latchkey children with rising child alcoholism drug use and criminality violence by and against children and other obvious effects on health education and ability to participate in a democratic society  even survival

the conservative war against children and families is taking on a still more bitter cast with the reduction of government support for lowincome housing which declined 80 percent in real terms from 1979 to 1988 becoming the main cause of an acute housing shortage that now stretches across the nation hewlett observes the us is also unusual among developed societies in not providing health care for mothers about half of the 40000 deaths of infants before their first birthday is attributed to lack of adequate prenatal care more difficult to obtain today than in 1975 the us is unique in its lack of provision for childbirth hewlett continues one reason why infant mortality rates are so much lower elsewhere rights and benefits for working parents when a child is born are also sharply restricted as compared with other rich nations approximately 30 percent of babies in the us and 20 percent in britain are deprived of that precious time that most specialists assume to be the minimally adequate period of time for a parent to bond with a new child lack of job protection after childbirth is a large part of the reason why working mothers in the united states lose from 13 to 20 per cent of their earning power after giving birth to a first child a catastrophe for many parents in an era of falling wages benefits and security and ever more onerous work demands day care and preschool arrangements are also minimal by comparative standards

but things are sure to improve now that mr family values is in charge gingrich has not yet announced legislation to authorize state kidnapping of children of the undeserving poor for placement in orphanages but he will reaffirm the importance he places on family life he said by forming a committee that will include children and spouses of some house members to figure out a legislative schedule more compatible with family life22

some of the consequences of the war against children and families do receive a huge amount of attention in a most enlightening way as the 1994 election approached major journals were lavishing attention on several new books expressing deep concern over alleged declines of iq and scholastic achievement the new york times devoted an unusually long lead article in the weekly book review to several books on the topic primarily the the bell curve by richard herrnstein and charles murray a book that is being seriously compared to darwins origin of species a reviewer in forbes magazine breathlessly proclaimed the times reviewer was its science writer malcolm browne who opens by warning that a government or society that persists in sweeping their subject matter under the rug will do so at its peril there is no mention of the unicef study nor have i seen one elsewhere or of any of the numerous studies that deal with the war against children and families waged under the banner of conservatism and family values

what then is the question that we ignore at our peril it turns out to be quite narrow iq is claimed to be genetically determined in significant measure which will lead to a hereditary meritocracy and still more ominous linked to race with the less intelligent breeding like rabbits and fouling the gene pool perhaps black mothers dont nurture their children because they evolved in the warm but highly unpredictable environment of africa the author of one of the books reviewed suggests this is real hard science which we ignore at our peril but we may  indeed must  ignore the social policies based on free markets for the poor and state protection for the rich  the fact for example that in the city where such articles appear the richest in the world 40 percent of children now live below the poverty line with little hope of escape from misery and destitution could that have something to do with measures of iq and achievement or the other consequences of the war against children and families discussed in many unmentionable studies such questions we may readily ignore a natural decision by the rich and powerful addressing one another and seeking justifications for the class war they are conducting and its human effects23

the intensity of the effort to lend credibility to the preferred conclusions particularly on the part of those who profess to be appalled by them is an intriguing phenomenon the editors of the times book review mostly committed liberals no doubt selected three books on science in their annual list of best books for 1994 all devoted to a single science the choices were so obvious that there was little dispute they report the science is broadly evolutionary biology or specifically sociobiology which once it gets into your brain can really spook you about genetics what spooks you is human sociobiology not the study of complex molecules and ants about which science actually has something to say24

one choice is a memoir by edward wilson one of the founders of sociobiology with his seminal 1975 book sociobiology  which has interesting material on simpler organisms and ends with a few pages of speculations on human sociobiology the field was actually founded 85 years earlier by the leading anarchist thinker peter kropotkin also a natural scientist in seminal work that led to his classic mutual aid a factor of evolution published in 1902 his studies criticized the conclusions on struggle for existence drawn by the noted darwinian th huxley who never responded publicly though in private he wrote that kropotkins prominentlypublished work was very interesting and important kropotkins darwinian speculations about the possible role of cooperation in evolution with their implications for anarchist social organization remain about as solid a contribution to human sociobiology as exists today but somehow this work has not entered the canon one can hardly imagine why25

the editors second choice is robert wrights moral animal which relies on the science of evolutionary psychology in an effort to show that the source of human morality is genetic the general thesis is sure to shock anyone who thought that humans are indistinguishable from rocks and birds specific versions of the thesis could be interesting and important though what evolutionary psychology has to say of any substance would hardly spook any rational reader

the most illuminating of the choices of the editors is the one they list first steven pinkers language instinct which seems to doom the liberal notion that human behavior can be made better by improvements in culture and environment a frightening conclusion indeed what exactly is it that dooms the liberal notion that culture and environment influence behavior the book reviews evidence supporting the thesis that the capacity for human language appears to be a speciesproperty in essentials surprisingly independent of other cognitive abilities and a common human possession over a very broad range as for the use of these apparently common human abilities nothing is known beyond environmental factors you speak english or japanese etc it is hardly in doubt that such factors also lead to striking differences in ability to make use of the abilities with which we are genetically endowed though again it would surprise no sane person if some genetic factor were discovered that has a detectable effect in distinguishing me from a poet  or violinist or quantum physicist or auto mechanic or anyone with skills i lack how the editors draw their conclusions from work that offers them no particle of support indeed undermines them to the extent that anything is understood they unfortunately do not tell us

also intriguing is the way the editors seek to buttress their imaginative constructions the book they say gathers data from many fields  including cognitive neuroscience developmental psychology and speech therapy  to demonstrate that the roots of language are in our genes which again will come as a great shock to everyone who thought that humans were indistinguishable from rocks and birds the author places this conclusion firmlyin the framework of darwinian natural selection which has nothing to say about the topic simply try to draw some conclusion about language from the theory the other subjects mentioned particularly developmental psychology do make a contribution but the evidence comes overwhelmingly from linguistics as the book makes clear that however lacks the proper panache for the ideological purposes at hand

its hardly necessary to review once again the misrepresentation and elementary fallacies in the work on iq that we ignore at our peril exposed years ago when the game became popular and now repackaged for todays purposes  always eliciting much praise for the courage of the authors in lining up with the powerful and breaking the censorship imposed by the radical extremists who run the universities and the press even if we grant every factual conclusion for which some shred of evidence is claimed nothing of interest follows except on assumptions that reflect ideological fanaticism not science specifically the topic of meritocracy is not even addressed unless we grant the tacit assumption that there is something meritorious about the particular array of traits perhaps partially inherited though nothing relevant is known that confer power and prestige under particular social arrangements in some societies a penchant for torture and murder in ours some combination of greed cynicism obsequiousness and subordination lack of curiosity and independence of mind selfserving disregard for others and who knows what else as reflected quite vividly by income distributions and the contributions to society at the high end

these trivialities aside one striking finding of the studies reviewed is how poorly iq correlates with socioeconomic status possibly a consequence of the fact that it is designed to measure academic success which is probably correlated only weakly with whatever it is that leads to wealth and privilege under the particular conditions of state capitalist society if the real factors were studied possibly better measures could be designed

one conclusion drawn is that iq is heritable according to bell curve author charles murray 60 heritable which means that 60 percent of the iq in any given person is heritable murrays statement is meaningless but presumably he is intending to convey the idea that 60 percent of the iq of a particular individual is determined by the genes many others have drawn the same conclusion based on an elementary error that has been repeatedly pointed out among others by robert wright he correctly observes that a trait can be highly heritable whatever its genetic component say 100 heritable with no genetic component whatever that means exactly it is not a clear notion of biology to borrow an example from ned block some years ago when only women wore earrings the heritability of having an earring was high because differences in whether a person had an earring was due to a chromosomal difference xx vs xy no one has yet suggested that wearing earrings or ties is in our genes an inescapable fate that environment cannot influence dooming the liberal notion

the case for group differences is no stronger not that it would matter in a nonracist society were it true take the famous 15 percent deficiency in black iq which results from some interaction of genetic endowment and environment about genetic factors that might conceivably be involved science knows nothing about environments a good bit is known in particular about the effects of adverse and supportive environments from the prenatal stage on in the absence of any relevant information about unknown genetic factors or any serious way to measure how such factors were they to exist and become known might interact with environmental conditions the evidence presented in the bell curve is entirely compatible with the conclusion that iqs of blacks are 15 points higher than those of whites or any other number one prefers on ideological grounds furthermore still accepting all the factual claims nothing follows about longterm social tendencies unless we assume that the natural state of a person is to vegetate unless driven by transmittable material reward26

as for malcolm brownes great fears they are readily alleviated suppose again we grant the most ominous facts he conjures up about decline of iq and achievement and its causes theres an easy solution to the problem simply bring here millions of peasants driven from the countryside in china under the reforms and radically reduce brownes income and that of his friends and associates making sure to deprive their daughters of opportunities and education while black mothers are placed in manhattan high rises and granted every advantage then the asian influx will raise the iq level and as serious inquiry demonstrates the fertility rate of blacks is very likely to drop while that of the children of the journalistic elite harvard psychology professors and associates of the american enterprise institute will rapidly rise the problem is solved there is nothing to fear

in part i of this series last month i quoted two medical researchers on the wellknown fact that development of the brain is strongly influenced by the quality of the nourishment and nurturance given to infants and children among other effects of adverse environments early in life that can lead to permanent defects in memory and learning the scale and character of such effects is scarcely understood but there are all too many illustrations the un food and agriculture organization fa0 predicts that nicaraguas next generation will be smaller weaker and less intelligent than todays population oxfam reports is that a sudden genetic malady or the effects of policies designed by people at the peak of the income distribution exercising the high intellectual and moral standards of the meritocracy those too are questions that we may readily ignore27

the only interesting question about the fascination with these topics is what function it serves a question that is  again  not to hard to answer

these are some of the uglier forms of population control in the more benign variant the rabble are to be diverted into harmless pursuits by the huge propaganda institutions halfamerican which spend hundreds of billions of dollars a year to convert people into atoms of consumption and obedient tools of production when they are lucky enough to find work  isolated from one another lacking even a conception of what a decent human life might be thats important normal human sentiments have to be crushed they are inconsistent with an ideology geared to the needs of privilege and power which celebrates private profit as the supreme human value demands that all submit to economic laws except for the wealthy who merit special protection and care from the powerful state that they control  a truism to adam smith a marxist obscenity in the intellectual world concocted by the selfstyled cognitive elite today

ill return in the next installment to more general commentary on background for the rollback crusade its prospects and the internal problems it faces

rollback part iii

april 1995

1 the virtual collapse of civil society

in sections i and ii jan feb i reviewed the latest phase of the assault on democracy and human rights that has been been gaining force for some 20 years entering a new phase with the congressional elections of november 1994 this landslide victory for conservatism is supposed to have afforded newt gingrichs army an overwhelming popular mandate for the programs of their contract with america the mandate reached 17 of eligible voters in the decisive house vote 13 of the electorate took part a bare majority voting for republicans 513 of actual voters the opinion profiles of the 23 who stayed away are virtually indistinguishable from those of democratic voters on major issues only a quarter of the population had heard of the contract a month after the election rising to 45 after four months of intensive postelection coverage by then 55 had an opinion about the commanderinchief of the victorious army of those 22 had a favorable opinion less than half the approval for the muchdisliked president though his ratings increased through february as the highly unpopular contract was being implemented1

nonetheless fabricated landslides and mandates aside there is no doubt that the assault against democracy and rights has accelerated in ways that are significant and ominous and one cannot take too much comfort from the radical opposition between attitudes and policies the facts are known only to those who read the small print and an impression of overwhelming support is being conveyed the effects will be to change individual attitudes that receive no social support few want to stand alone against the popular will with the virtual collapse of civil socity and the lack of a significant organized counterforce the mandate that is fabrication today is likely to be reality tomorrow

in announcing the clinton doctrine in late 1993 national security adviser anthony lake borrowed some standard cold war terminology announcing a transition from containment of the global threat to market democracies to enlargement of their reach the cold war term for enlargement was rollback official policy from 1950 the new doctrine then continues the old throughout the cold war the domestic populations of the industrial societies including the united states were a prime target for containment the doctrinal framework does correspond to historical reality but only under familiar translations democracy is to contained restricted to topdown forms that keep traditional structures of power intact at home and abroad as the more candid acknowledge politics must remain the shadow cast on society by big business to borrow john deweys formulation of adam smiths truisms about the principal architects of policy as for markets what will be enlarged is the traditional doubleedged doctrine market discipline for the poor and weak state protection and intervention in the economy and the world for the benefit of those who cast the shadow  the masters of mankind in smiths phrase

restating the doctrine without equivocation the masters have long sought to contain popular struggles to expand the range of meaningful democracy and human rights but now perceive that they can do better they feel perhaps rightly that they can dismantle the social contract that has been in some measure achieved rolling back the threat posed by the great beast that keeps trying to plunder the rich alexander hamilton and john foster dulles speaking for a host of others the architects of policy can move on to establish a utopia of the masters based on the values of greed and power in which privilege is enhanced by state power and the general population lack rights apart from what they can salvage on a highly flexible labor market they are also free to starve or to enter the rapidly expanding workhouse prisons

tough love

the wall street journals review of economic performance for the last quarter of 1995 is headlined companies profits surged 61 on higher prices cost cuts aftertax profits rose 62 from 1993 up from 34 for the third quarter in a fullpage ad a leading lender the cit group announced proudly that corporate america posted record profits in 1994 the headline in business week read it doesnt get a lot better than this its survey estimated profits to be up an enormous 41 over 1993 despite a bare 9 increase in sales a colossal success resulting in large part from a sharp drop in the share going to labor though economists say labor will benefit  eventually the masters arent fooled

1993 had been a banner year for business with dazzling profits for the fortune 500 despite stagnant sales growth 1994 was a great improvement yielding surging profits that were overflowing the coffers of corporate america business week exulted even before the grand news about the final quarter was in meanwhile median wages and work conditions continued their steady decline the number of children under 6 living in poverty reached a record high of 6 million 26 percent of that age group an increase of 1 million from 1987 to 1992 and almost double the figures for 1972 when the rollback crusade was in its early stages2

it therefore follows as night follows day that social policies must be modified to enrich the suffering masses of corporate america still further while the rest are taught stern lessons about the rigors of this lean and mean age and so we see daybyday as the story unfolds

the presidents first response was to increase the pentagon budget the leading form of welfare for the rich unaware of the mandate it has conferred the public is strongly opposed military spending is near the bottom of the publics wish list washington post polling director richard morin observes with only 16 favoring an increase in contrast about 23 favored more spending on education drug addiction programs the environment and other social spending which is to be sharply cut in real dollars the pentagon budget is 30 billion a year higher than under nixon at about 85 of the cold war average the cold war enemy is of course now an ally even in military production thus its advanced research programs enabled the us to regain the world lead in pulsed power and microwave weaponry the prestigious military journal janes defence weekly reported in january the figures give some indication of how large the threat to market democracy posed by the great satan loomed in the eyes of planners who sought to contain it and roll it back3

the republican majority in congress was not satisfied with this radical opposition to the public will particularly the speaker of the house who represents the lockheed corporation and other high tech industries and has had unparalleled success in using the federal government to transfer public funds to his wealthy constituents under his leadership the house approved a 32 billion emergency supplement for the starving pentagon the funds are to be drawn from programs for the vast majority in a vain and pallid gesture that highlights what is at issue house democrats proposed in committee to replace a planned 57 billion of cuts in child nutrition housing and job training by a fiveyear delay in deployment of lockheed f22 advanced fighters a welfare program now estimated at 72 billion the suggestion was summarily rejected and scarcely reported

the word to use remains security not subsidy as air force secretary stuart symington advised in the early days of the cold war when government was being mobilized as the savior of private power which could not survive in a competitive economy as the business press frankly acknowledged and once again current plans for defense are designed so as to foster security threats a minor one is the soviet union though now an ally it remains a potential threat to us preponderance the currently fashionable term for global rule but the primary threat is third world weapons proliferation air force director of science and technology general richard paul informed janes we must maintain military spending and strengthen the defense industrial base because of the growing technological sophistication of third world conflicts the bush administration had explained to congress while watching the berlin wall collapse taking with it the most efficient pretext for subsidy no one who has kept their eyes on the security system will be surprised to learn that both threats are to be enhanced

some of the funding for the emergency pentagon supplement is to be drawn from programs to help dismantle and safeguard the nuclear arsenals of the former ussr to protect ourselves from the resulting threat we will have to increase the defense departments budget florida democratic representative pete peterson commented furthermore third world weapons proliferation is to be stimulated with new contributions to its growing technological sophistication the us share in arms sales to third world countries has reached almost threequarters we must therefore provide them with even more advanced weaponry so that we can tremble in proper fear sale of f16 aircraft with taxpayersubzidized loans allows the air force to pay lockheed to upgrade the aircraft and to develop the f22 to counter the threat they pose the welfare programs extend beyond gingrich country general paul emphasized outlining the commitment to spin dualuse science  technology outside the military in the national interest enhancing our economic security particularly enhanced is the welfare of corporate america which is to transition our work general paul continued in standard bureaucratese

gingrichs favorite cash cow understands the scam perfectly lockheed propaganda warns that it is a dangerous world in which sophisticated fighter airplanes and air defense systems are being sold  mostly by its savior one of the authors adds weve sold the f16 all over the world what if a friend or ally turns against us to fend off that threat we have to sell potential adversaries still more advanced weapons and to transfer still more public funds to the shrinking sectors of the population that bear the burden of dazzling profits quite simple really

arms sales to undemocratic countries  virtually all the recipients  are opposed by a mere 96 percent of the population so these programs reflect the popular mandate even better than their companions4

the national security state is a natural favorite of the advocates of private tyrannies the device facilitates the transfer of public funds to advanced industry and to wealthy sectors generally with the public cowering in fear of foreign enemies so that planners can operate in technocratic insulation in world bank lingo furthermore the great beast has to be dealt with somehow and the natural device is to frighten them with internal enemies as well it is only reasonable that the directors of the contract should expand further the domestic security system organized and conducted by the powerful state they wish to nurture passing legislation permitting warrantless searches considered a bad idea by 69 of those who conferred the mandate5

while the important people are receiving the care they deserve from their nanny state social programs are being radically cut here the word to use is not security but welfare dependence the poor are to be helped to escape this grim fate imposed upon them by a failed liberalism the only problem with the story is the facts as discussed in earlier articles official welfare has sharply declined the average monthly benefit level dropped from 714 in 1970 to 510 in 1980 and 394 in 1993 1995 dollars marc breslow observes the one exception is health care for the poor medicaid which has risen though more slowly than general health care costs in large part as a result of the gross inefficiencies of the privatized system with its huge administrative and bureaucratic burdens public funding of profits salaries and advertising and now micromanagement of doctors to ensure minimal care and transfer of choice from doctor and patient to fat cats in insurance company offices

the correlation between welfare payments and family life is real though it is the reverse of what is claimed as support for the poor has declined unwed birthrates which had risen steadily from the 1940s through the mid1970s markedly increased over the last three decades the rate of poverty among children almost perfectly correlates with the birthrates among teenage mothers a decade later mike males points out that is child poverty seems to lead to teenage childbearing not the other way around as discussed in part ii of this series the dramatic impact of the war against children and families by reaganthatcher conservatives has been well studied but equally well concealed6

facts are irrelevant when there is serious business at hand right now intensified class war among the programs targeted for elimination or radical reduction are school lunches job training education generally assistance to homeless and veterans fuel and health care for the needy drugfree schools conversion of military industry to human needs  and generally anything that might help the undeserving majority thats doubtless in response to the fact that about 80 of the population think government has a responsibility to try to do away with poverty up from 70 when the great society programs were initiated 30 years ago to enter into sharp decline shortly after7

representative clay shaw chair of the house ways and means subcommittee on human resources explained that the proposals to punish millions of poor children are really tough love a compassionate effort to save them from dependence on the dole the programs do not pass without criticism new york times reporter david rosenbaum observes that however worthy the goals and however sensible the principles that inspire tough love these efforts to raise up the poor and needy face seemingly intractable contradictions  primarily impediments of the kind just reviewed which remain unmentioned8

jingoism is also in style clinton agrees that the us must lower its share of un peacekeeping operations but his rightwing adversaries want to go much further shackling or even ending them as for the irrelevant public well over 80 favor un peacekeeping operations half consistently support us participation 88 if there are fair prospects of success 510 consistently oppose such operations the remainder varying with circumstances the effect of fatalities in somalia was slight asked their general reaction if dead american soldiers were shown on tv 57 favored increasing us forces or striking back twothirds favored contributing us troops to a un operation to protect safe havens or to stop atrocities in bosnia 80 took the same position with regard to rwanda if the un concluded that genocide was underway9

along with security and welfare dependence the magic words include devolution and states rights programs that might help people are not only to be cut but also handed over to the states in block grants under conditions of relative equality this could be a move towards democracy under existing circumstances devolution is intended as a further blow to the eroding democratic processes major corporations investment firms and the like can constrain or directly control the acts of national governments and can set one national work force against another but the game is much easier when the only competing player that might remotely be influenced by the great beast is a state government and even middlesized enterprise can join in the shadow cast by business can thus be far darker and private power can move on to greater victories in the name of freedom another triviality that appears unworthy of comment

the way it works is described in a lead article in the boston globe business section headed line grows longer for state aid putting the businessfriendly administration of gov william weld in a bind private enterprises ranging from bigtimers like raytheon long dependent on the public dole to sports teams banks financial services and insurers and others are threatening to move elsewhere unless they receive big wage and benefit concessions from unions and millions of dollars worth of gifts disguised as breaks on taxes and utility bills an accompanying story describes how the truly powerful operate it reports microsoft magnate bill gatess boast that he had delivered an ultimatum to vicepresident gore warning that he would move the whole operation elsewhere unless washington settled an antitrust suit in his favor10

the richest city in the world with the help of the state government hopes to lead the pack new york governor pataki announced a budget plan that will reduce the top tax rate 25 percent and save taxpayers 68 billion a year the new york times reported the first part is true particularly for the rich for families with incomes over 150000 the tax reduction is seven times as high as for those with incomes under 25000 but the savings for the taxpayer are a mirage one such saving is a cut of 128 million next year in appropriations for the metropolitan area public transit system tacked on to a 113 million cut in city financing these savings will make a 25cent to 50cent increase in the already ridiculously high fares virtually inevitable transit advocates estimate  a tax hike for the more than four million moderateincome and working people of the city they add correctly and a huge and radically regressive one among other effects the savings remove fare reductions for schoolchildren yet another regressive tax

further savings to the taxpayer include reduction of support and health care for the blind and disabled children and defenseless people generally firing workers who merely provide services to the general public sharp increases in tuition at city and state universities cancellation or delay of desperately needed infrastructure repair doubling up of prisoners in maximum security prisons and elimination or sharp reduction of the meager assistance to pregnant women on welfare home care services for the elderly and disabled pensions cleanup of love canal assistance for single adults with children considered employable  perhaps in the satanic mills that are springing up throughout the city and on and on it will be a giant leap toward economic growth the president of the business council of new york state exulted perhaps thinking of those great caribbean vacations and evenings at luxury restaurants and the theater deductible as business expenses and other opportunities that will be afforded by the huge redistribution programs towards the needy rich in a city that has already surpassed guatemala in the inequality derby

mayor rudolph giuliani lost no time in showing that he too knows how to serve the powerful embracing the philosophy of gov george e patakis austere budget for the state the times reported the mayor will reduce for the first time public assistance and health care for the citys poorest residents and restructure government in ways that would affect virtually every new yorker although not evenly  a masterpiece of understatement in addition to the general cuts in welfare and health care the mayor called on workers to agree to savings in health care pensions and work rules sanitation services are a prime target they dont benefit the folks in the high rises and the effects should not be too much of an annoyance as their limousines pass by decaying trash and rotting people also to be cut are assistance to foster parents and preventive services for families considered to pose risks of child abuse that makes good sense as a component of the war against children and families that has been waged with unremitting intensity by the family value conservatives in the past 15 years

in these lean and mean times it would be unfair to target only the general population hence along with sharp reduction of programs that might benefit the general population there will also be reduction in property taxes on coops and condos as well as reductions in business taxes  so everyone shares in the suffering municipal hospitals and health services will close and public education will deteriorate still further all to stimulate job growth the report continues with a straight face11

for unexplained reasons the rising tax burden on poor and working people through fare increases and other regressive measures though plainly reducing their purchases of goods does not affect the jobs of those who might otherwise produce them in contrast job growth is stimulated by transfer of wealth to the rich for purchase of mercedes limousines and elegant yachts rich profits from speculation in the economic miracle of the mexican economy secured by the taxpayer when it predictably goes sour shifting of production to semislave economies maintained by usbacked violence abroad and other such free market miracles the mysteries of economic science are profound indeed

not all programs are to be axed however one public agency is to receive more money under the giuliani budget the police department which will gain 100 million that too makes sense as part of the general enhancement of state power and violence the rich have to be protected from the effects of the programs to turn new york into a typical third world city

at the federal level some programs are also safeguarded over threefourths of federal food spending goes for food stamps and that program is slated to keep federal guarantees for reasons explained quietly by the wall st journal the food stamp program is backed by big agribusiness associations so there is no place for tough love here we want one program at least to be a safety net for people who are truly needy rep pat roberts of kansas explained as the house agriculture committee that he chairs decided to impose federal requirements for the food stamp program thats the best way to achieve our goals of providing nutrition for the hungry and eliminating fraud from the program roberts continued it is a more pragmatic approach to achieve several of our goals republicans were uneasy about block grants that would give governors cash rather than give poor people coupons for food the journal noting that grocery chains and the agribusiness lobby were also uneasy federal guarantees in this case will best preserve a safety net for needy people the reason for the decision new york times reporter robert pear added is that house republicans feared that it would increase fraud and abuse if governors were given grants in this single case surely nothing else could have been on their minds  for example the fact that robertss congressional district received more farm subsidies over the last decade than any other over 5 billion a year with kansas farmers averaging 20000 to 30000 annually those are averages the agribusiness associations mentioned in the small print do not represent small farmers trying to scrape by the likely outcome will put limits on the program so that it cannot meet the needs of the hungry during periods of economic decline but will offer steady guarantees to agribusiness and leave discretion in the hands of states so that local powers can determine who are the worthy poor  not including mothers who merely care for children refusing to work

much as in totalitarian states satirists are given greater latitude to articulate what everyone knows in the boston globe the text of a steve wasserman cartoon reads we planned to eliminate food stamps but then we took pity we couldnt bear the hungry cries the outstretched hands of agribusiness lobbyists12

one must admire the delicate touch of the statist reactionaries finetuning the transfer programs unlike food stamps the women infants and children wic program is to be turned over to states as block grants one reason is again explained by the wall street journal this transfer repeals a costcontainment competitive bidding measure that placed onerous market conditions on the four pharmaceutical companies that sell infant formula they stand to gain as much as a billion dollars a year over and above the successes of their evasions of the federal law now being investigated by the federal trade commission note that taxpayers will save money with the ftc investigation terminated the new protection for the rich from market discipline should overcome other defects of the wic program a usda study found that every dollar spent brought up to 390 reduction of medicaid costs for newborns and mothers it also found a 22 drop in neonatal deaths among wic participants the effects of restriction of the program and transfer of its benefits to pharmaceutical companies are obvious without comment among them the mental and physical harm to surviving children of lowincome pregnant women deprived of sustenance which will improve the grim bell curve that condemns all but the cognitive elite to servitude as yet another science shows13

malnourished neonates and children deprived even of school lunches have no lobby working for them nor do the great majority of the population over 80 percent of the population say that working people have too little influence but the shadow cast by business ensures that they can do nothing about it except watch in dismay and unfocused anger as they sink into decline unlike the peasants and slumdwellers of haiti who were able to create a civil society rich and vibrant enough to establish a functioning democracy people here are lost and hopeless  a fact that sheds light on the standard propaganda line that we have to teach democracy to haitians but although 80 feel that working people have too little influence only 20 feel that way about labor unions while twice that number feel that unions have too much influence these figures reflect yet another remarkable victory for corporate propaganda14

the human consequences of the savings are immediate take elimination of home heating aid for the poor which had reached over 5 million households 72 have incomes below 8000 and spend over 18 of that on energy costs 4 for average middleclass families even with federal aid half the families had used up the allocation before christmas in 1993 and by midjanuary twice as many had died from the cold wave as in the los angeles earthquake boston city hospital researchers found that among children treated in the emergency room the national health service for the poor the percentage suffering malnutrition almost doubled in the winter the new measures will not only harm or kill more children but are also a useful blow to communities the oil vendors working with the program were mostly small businesses often multilingual community people so the threat of democracy is rolled back another notch15

another target is public broadcasting financially trivial but an important part of the campaign to mobilize some public support by a show of populism on the part of those who are happily grinding the public under foot the propaganda campaign to depict the public system as liberal and elitist is familiar it is unclear whether it has had much effect a recent poll finds that over 34 of the population want to keep the limited public funding but the idea that any element of the information system might remain within a potentially democratic system has always been galling to the totalitarian mentality so despite its marginality it may disappear16

also slated for demolition is the regulatory apparatus which only protects health safety welfare and lives  now and for future generations the measures proposed carry more immediate costs at least 250 million annually to enforce the complex provisions the congressional budget office estimates largely to pay more bureaucrats clinton is joining the parade his plans to rescind legislation that prevented banks from relying on federallyguaranteed funds for speculation were wonderfully timed this proposal for eliminating the legal and regulatory barriers among financial industries was announced in a frontpage new york times story alongside the news that even the strict regulatory system of quasifascist singapore had collapsed destroying britains most venerable merchant bank  a coincidence that is ironic the lobbyist for smaller banks observed these measures are also expected to concentrate extraordinary resources in a small number of superpowerful banks and investment firms another contribution to free markets the barings collapse is just another in a series of recent disasters including kidder peabody orange county procter  gamble metallgeschaft and mexican casino capitalism the costs will be paid by the usual victims17

it hasnt been easy for commentators to deal with recent developments one problem has been to reconcile the concept of a popular mandate with the unmistakeable fact that the public strenuously opposes it almost every step of the way and to preserve the doctrine that congress like the white house is dedicated to serving the public good richard berkes february 28 new york times report already cited concedes that the public doubts key parts of the gops agenda giving very partial evidence but explains that congress implements the programs that the public despises based on their reading of public sentiment congress has failed to notice what the polls have consistently demonstrated the doctrinal system permits accusations of imbecility but not of rational service to dominant powers adam smiths honesty would be damned as a conspiracy theory were anyone so bold as to reiterate it

some keep trying to conceal the obvious thus we find articles with such headlines as poll finds gop agenda is popular reporting that only 40 of americans have even heard of the contract with america and scarcely a third approve of gingrichs performance but the report in the washington post continues some components of the program are overwhelmingly popular specifically term limits for congress a balanced budget amendment and welfare reform unmentioned is the fact that term limits were quickly shelved advocacy of a balanced budget declines to small minorities if it entails cuts in social programs as of course it does and while the public does oppose welfare having been fed wild tales about welfare queens it strongly supports increased help for the poor

sometimes the facts even appear in stories framed to confirm the official line a lead frontpage story in the new york times in middecember informs us that americans like gop agenda reading on we find data which show quite the opposite about 23 say the government has a responsibility to take care of the poor while a mere 9 support a decrease in programs for poor children one of the major planks of the gop agenda on the balanced budget which is alleged to have overwhelming popular backing the polls showed that the percentages were 22 27 30 if cuts are required in spending on education medicare and social security respectively  as they would of course be in brief americans dislike gop agenda the real world however quickly disappeared by the time the balanced budget amendment hit the front pages in late february the issue had been reduced by governmentmedia fiat to social security with the crucial issue of general social spending and popular feelings about the matter completely suppressed in favor of meaningless claims that the public favors the amendment if nothing is touched the times correspondent responsible for analysis of the issue david rosenbaum rails about the nonsense produced by the politicians who are avoiding substance and proceeds to avoid the substance entirely allowing himself only a mention of military spending and social security massachusetts democrat john kerry explains how hard it was for him to vote against the amendment when 80 of the population are saying do something namely dont pass an amendment that will require cuts in soical spending without any counterforce to the manufacture of consent however image will become reality and the republicans should to be able to use the overwhelming public opposition to their actual stand on this issue as a powerful propaganda weapon

pointbypoint large majorities oppose specific programs that are being implemented with rare and interesting exceptions one can only speculate as to how people would react were they to read small items in the wall st journal spelling out the consequences of the gop vow to ease the burden of estate and gift taxes which they say are especially onerous for small businesses and family farms  and which the top tax official of the treasury department calculates will cut over 20 billion in tax receipts in ten years benefitting about half of 1 of estates  the richest18

the problems of reconciling fact with doctrine arise in the international arena as well it was wellnigh impossible to conceal the fact that the highlytouted mexican economic miracle on which the nafta propaganda campaign was founded was utter fraud as was wellknown to anyone with even a casual interest in the topic recall that this was the prize example of the miracle of the market according to the world bank and imf the economics profession the elite media and other experts also difficult to handle is the fact that the us taxpayer is assigned the responsibility of paying off speculators making a mint on the highly risky fraud they are not expected to pay the costs under free enterprise any more than their sl colleagues to steer through this maze takes some ingenuity thus under the headline socializing risk to foster free markets new york times thinker paul lewis recognizes that the circumstances might lead some to be cynical about a mechanism that would effectively provide insurance for the rich in case things go wrong but a more serious look shows that if mexico had defaulted the crisis might have undermined the freemarketbased development model that has become this decades economic signature tune  for the commissar class at least in fact both the mexican miracle for speculators investors and a few billionaires milking public resources and the way the risks were socialized are typical examples of really existing free markets19

rollback part iv

may 1995

towards a utopia of the masters

the economic crisis for the general population is a global one in the past 20 years economic growth has fallen well below the levels of the 1950s and 1960s which were to be sure historically unique world per capita income fell in 1993 for the fourth straight year while the unemployment situation already grim worsened in most countries the international labor organization ilo in its world employment 1995 report predicts rising global joblessness the wall street journal reports noting however that many management theorists regard the analysis as outdated because the whole concept of a job  steady work at steady pay from the same employer  must be discarded the only major exception to the growing catastrophe of global capitalism is east and southeast asia with the exception of the philippines  incidentally the sole part of the fastest growing economic region of the world that has been under tight us control for a century and coincidentally resembles the latin american disaster area

japans former colonies have resumed the rapid economic growth of the colonial period though a brutal imperial power japan treated its colonies quite differently from the western norm within the region dominated by japan and the overseas chinese financial network states have been powerful enough to organize capital as well as to control labor unlike the rest of the south they have not been encumbered by what economic historian paul bairoch calls the most extraordinary myth of economic science it is difficult to find another case where the facts so contradict a dominant theory than the one concerning the negative impact of protectionism he writes reviewing much of the record though considerably understating the significance of state intervention for the wealthy because he limits himself to a narrow category of market interferences the conclusions of course have been understood by the architects of policy which is why they have progressed while those subjected to their whims have suffered

the official tale is that the japanbased region is passionately dedicated to markets we even read that talk of labor standards enrages many exportoriented countries in asia the term countries here refers for example to the brutal and corrupt rulers in indonesias developmental state but not to the working people courageously struggling for the right to organize and demanding labor standards in internal discussion we find greater honesty thus a federal reserve report attributes singapores economic growth to a domestic forced savings policy and other state action1

unemployment remains higher in europe than in the us but as the ilo and others observe that fact has to be placed in the context of the much harsher conditions of work in the united states and the reduced social contract generally while the us work week is reaching postwar peaks the battle for a 40hour week having been lost long ago in europe it has fallen to 3839 hours with much longer holidays and leaves and more benefits to take just one case until 1993 the us was one of the very few countries in the world that did not provide for statutory maternity leave and its provisions still fall far below the european standard  in fact below the agreement negotiated by plantation workers in uganda which grants male workers seven days of paternal leave the same picture is revealed by ratification of ilo conventions guaranteeing labor rights the us has by far the worst record in the western hemisphere and europe with the exception of el salvador and lithuania it does not recognize even standard conventions on child labor and the right to organize2

the major factors that have led to the global economic crisis are well understood one is the globalization of production which has offered the masters tantalizing opportunities the business press frankly warns the pampered western workers that they must abandon their luxurious life styles and such market rigidities as contracts pensions health and safety in the workplace and other outdated nonsense even the very concept of a job economists talk of job flow pointing out that it is hard to estimate  and also largely beside the point the threat suffices to force working people to accept employers demands the end of the cold war returning most of eastern europe to its traditional third world service role places new weapons in the hands of the rulers as the business press has reported with unrestrained glee gm and vw can shift production to the restored third world in the east where they can find workers at a fraction of the cost of the pampered western workers meanwhile enjoying high tariff protection and the other amenities that really existing free markets provide for the rich the us and uk are leading the way in grinding down working people and the poor but others will follow along thanks to the globalization of production inequality is back to the depression days in the us back to victorian times in england though latin america still wins the prize for worst record in the world thanks to our kind tutelage over many years3

as many studies have shown relative equality is a significant factor in economic growth and improvement in health and living standards the fact is recognized by the world bank but without influencing the policies that it and its imf associate impose on the third world which dramatically increase inequality and undermine other factors that the bank identifies as essential for growth notably education and welfare there is ample historical precedent for over 200 years experiments have been conducted by the powerful following the highest principles of economic science with startlingly uniform results benefits for the experimenters and their power base tragedies for the experimental animals rightthinking people again are to draw no conclusions

a second factor in the general crisis is the huge explosion of unregulated financial capital since the bretton woods system was dismantled by richard nixon and the radical change in its constitution daily turnover on foreign exchange markets may be approaching 1 trillion some estimate in the early 1970s about 90 of capital in international exchanges was for investment and trade 10 for speculation by 1990 those figures had reversed and a 1993 estimate is that only 5 is related to real economic transactions wilfried guth of the deutsche bank who argues further that these processes are undermining free trade as do others the consequences were understood early on in his 1978 presidential address to the american economics association nobel laureate james tobin suggested that taxes be imposed to slow down speculative flows which if unimpeded would drive the world towards a lowgrowth lowwage economy with booming profits as well by now the point is widely recognized a commission headed by paul volcker former chairman of the federal reserve attributes about half of the 50 decline in growth rates since the early 1970s to the huge growth of currency speculation4

the world is being moved by statecorporate policy towards a kind of third world model with sectors of great wealth a huge mass of misery and a large superfluous population lacking any rights because they contribute nothing to profitmaking for the rich

these developments are commonly attributed to inexorable market forces analysts then divide over the contribution of various factors primarily trade and automation but the discussion cannot sensibly proceed without recognition of major interferences with markets huge state subsidy and intervention have always been required to make trade appear efficient not to speak of ecological costs imposed on future generations who do not vote in the market and other externalities consigned to footnotes to mention merely one slight market distortion a good part of the pentagon budget has been devoted to secure flow of oil at reasonable prices from the middle east overwhelmingly the preserve of the united states phebe marr of the national defense university  a contribution to the efficiency of trade that rarely receives attention apart from other contributions to the health of the economy there are plenty of others

as for automation it surely contributes to profit at some point but that point was reached by decades of protection within the state sector as david noble has shown furthermore the specific form of automation designed within the state system was often driven by considerations of power more than profit or efficiency it was designed to deskill workers and subordinate them to management not because of market principles or the nature of the technology but for reasons of domination and control5

such contributions to private power give further insight into the attractiveness of the military system for modern state capitalism particularly its appeal to conservatives who are commonly in the lead in demanding that markets be undermined for class interests reaganite america and thatchers england are the primary recent examples  both paragons of conservatism both leaders in expansion of statesubsidized industry the us case is wellknown as for thatcher her blind pursuit of friedmanite dogmas that were refuted at every turn succeeded in creating the worst crisis for manufacturing industry since the industrial revolution destroying almost 13 of the manufacturing plant within a few years a fact extensively detailed and deplored by actual conservatives notably ian gilmour nevertheless the disaster was somewhat alleviated by the growth of statesubsidized industry at least in military industry and sale of torture equipment to countries with awful human rights records england remains a world leader london is not far behind washington in its aggressive pursuit of arms sales including such meritorious customers as saddam hussein and suharto pursuing the shared doctrine expressed by thatchers defense procurement minister alan clark i dont really fill my mind much with what one set of foreigners is doing to another6

corporate decisions for power rather than simple profit are often reasonable enough as a tactic in relentless class war particular choices of technology provide one example the recent health care debacle is another case in point much of us industry would probably gain from a rational public insurance program which is why it was advocated editorially by business week but it is unwise to allow the general public to realize that government can carry out useful acts despite the heavy shadow cast by business government remains the one system of power and authority that is to some degree under public influence unlike private tyrannies which are almost entirely unaccountable enhancing their power is worth some sacrifice in profit

there are other reasons for sacrificing shortrun gain executives point out to the business press that it is worthwhile to ship manufacturing jobs even to germany with its much higher labor costs so as to facilitate class warfare a gillette corporation executive explains that the company is concerned about having only one place where a product is made primarily because of labor problems thus if boston workers strike gillette could supply both the european and us markets from its berlin plant thereby breaking the strike and vice versa it is only reasonable then that gillette should employ over three times as many workers abroad as in the us irrespective of costs strikes of critical importance are now underway in illinois where caterpillar and other corporations are attempting to destroy the last vestige of unions like many us companies caterpillar has pursued a business strategy that has nudged american workers away from defiance toward compliance business correspondent james tyson reports the strategy includes manufacturing at cheaper facilities abroad and relying on imports from factories in brazil japan and europe  and of course hiring scabs and temps and relying on the criminal state to refuse to enforce labor laws a stand raised to principle by the reaganites

such considerations help explain why us corporations are creating jobs overseas despite the fact that a dollar and falling labor costs have made american products increasingly competitive as the times reports overseas investment is rising at twice the rates of exports and profits corporations earn from production abroad are almost double those from exports these are natural ways to use the dazzling profits they reap from conservative social policies and the further gains anticipated from the gingrich contract7

courts too have sometimes been frank about their contributions to the rollback campaign denying an appeal by workers who had lost jobs when ohio plants were moved to states with cheaper labor the sixth circuit court of appeals stated accurately that states and counties in the united states compete with each other for companies contemplating relocation and labor laws neither discourage such relocations nor bar closing of unionized plants in favor of a nonunion plant in another part of the country or in a foreign country as contemplated by nafta the court then explained the background congress and the courts have made the social judgment rightly or wrongly that our capitalistic system darwinian though it may be will not discourage companies from locating on the basis of their own calculations of factors relating to efficiency and competitiveness the rules of the marketplace govern by so reflecting commercial interests the institutions of government serve  according to current legal and economic theory  the longterm best interests of society as a whole that is the basic social policy the country has opted to follow

the candor is unusual though the deception is typical the country has opted for no such course and it is radically false that the rules of the market place govern or that the system is darwinian in the intended sense of social darwinism which has little to do with biology  except of course for the poor and the weak who are indeeed subjected to these rules by those who cast their usual shadow by means of congress and the courts

as for the dedication of legal and economic theory to the longterm best interests of society as a whole perhaps that was best described by swiss economist simonde de sismondi 175 years ago commenting on the doctrines of the founder of modern economic theory david ricardo who patiently explained that employment was of no consequence to an economy as long as rent and profits which funded new investment were in good shape wealth is everything men are absolutely nothing sismondi replied in truth then there is nothing more to wish for than that the king remaining alone in the island by constantly turning a crank might produce through automata all the output of england others have no further right to be in england and should go elsewhere the laws of the new science proclaimed

the founders of the science were surpassed by none in their devotion to the happiness of the people and even advocated some extension of the franchise to this end not indeed universally to all people but to that part of them which cannot be supposed to have any interest in overturning the right of property david ricardo explained adding that still heavier restrictions would be appropriate if it were shown that limiting the elective franchise to the very narrowest bounds would guarantee more security for a good choice of representatives theres an ample record of similar thoughts and actions to the present day8

the internationalization of production puts quite a different cast on contemporary debate about american decline as a geographical entity the country is declining in many respects but the principal architects of policy have quite different interests as the merchants and manufacturers did in 18th century england and make sure that they are most peculiarly attended to whatever the effect on others including their own populations nothing fundamental has changed in that regard since adam smiths observations apart from the dedicated zeal of the efforts to suppress the obvious with these truisms in mind we should not be surprised to find that while the us role in manufacturing production is declining if we consider the geographical entity it is holding its own quite nicely if we consider the share in global production of usbased corporations the same is true of the trade deficit if we consider international borders the us has a huge deficit but when the commerce department recalculated counting profits of us companies abroad as us exports the deficit turned into a huge surplus the recalculation was reasonable the wall street journal explained because the profits gained abroad benefit companies domestically through greater investment and rd the recalculation interprets the words united states in the terms that matter for the principal architects of policy not the geographical area or its people but the people who count9

these remarks barely skim the surface its easy to understand the mood of desperation anxiety hopelessness and fear that is so prevalent in the world outside of wealthy and privileged sectors who see the opportunity to achieve at last the kind of power that was out of reach when the democratic distemper infected nationstates and popular forces could mobilize to win human rights and defend them

intractable contradictions

recall the concerns of new york times reporter david rosenbaum that however worthy the goals and however sensible the principles of the gingrich reformers their dedication to the poor faces seemingly intractable contradictions the most important one scrupulously ignored is the need to protect the wealthy and powerful from market discipline in traditional ways now being extended but there are other problems

educated and privileged sectors reasoning along ricardos lines see little problem in the fact that policies are executed in technocratic insulation unimpeded by public interests and concerns but the population has to be controlled somehow for obvious reasons one cannot appeal to them on grounds of the intended effects of the policies that are being implemented so other methods are required there are standard devices many can simply be locked up or confined to urban slums others can be entrapped by artificial creation of wants or other forms of diversion they can be left in confusion and despair by corporate and other propaganda a huge industry in the united states for many years or they can be mobilized in fear and hatred  of foreigners of one another  or by religious fundamentalist appeals

the masters of mankind understand very well that people must not be given opportunities to organize in a functioning civil society which might enable them to pool limited resources and to take their affairs into their own hands but when the limited admissible means are used to mobilize people to do such needed work as rolling back the social contract intractable contradictions arise the problems are classic they were recognized by german industrialists who had supported hitlers forces as a way to destroy the labor movement and found  not to their pleasure  that he and his followers had some ideas of their own the iranian merchants who relied on fundamentalist religious leaders to mobilize the public against the shah faced the same dilemma shortly after some similar intractable contradictions are arising right now as the rollback campaign gains force

the problems have troubled the business press a fortune cover story is headlined todays gop the partys over for big business to mobilize popular forces the corporate world has been compelled to resort to what are called cultural issues but its troops are now prepared to fight the culture war as pat buchanan and others refer to the various forms of fanaticism they are seeking to engender that process has opened a culture gap fortune observes the ceos are generally liberal in cultural attitudes they dont want their children to be forced to pray in schools or taught creation science they want their daughters to have opportunities they not only tend to be prochoice but about 60 of ceos are adamantly prochoice agreeing with the statement that a woman should be able to get an abortion if she wants one no matter what the reason they do not want to live in a society and culture dominated by christian fundamentalists people who worship the enola gay or run around with assault rifles or who debate subtle points about beast 666 from the book of revelations and listen to pat robertson explaining how presidents from wilson to bush may have been pawns of a tightly knit cabal run by freemasons and european bankers who seek a new order for the human race under the domination of lucifer but these are the sectors they are forced to turn to as a popular base for their assault on democracy and human rights

among ceos the overwhelming favorite for president is dick cheney bob dole and phil gramm were backed by a mere 17 and right down at the bottom of the pack with a 3 show of supportwas newt gingrich unfortunately for them however the religious right now controls the gop fortune comments in bold face religious conservatives are the single most powerful force within the gop no small group in one of the worlds most extreme religious fundamentalist cultures they hold veto power over the republican presidential nomination theres a real cultural disconnect between the fortune 500 and social conservatives a lobbyist with strong ties to christian fundamentalist groups and the new republicans observes

the wall street journal talks uneasily about class warfare  a term usually avoided like the plague in respectable circles  referring to a war over values that pits the uppermiddle class elites of professionals and managers their constituency against the guy in the street who supports the republican party that is supposed to do the bidding of these uppermiddle class elites the religious conservatives who hold veto power have no great interest in big business which they rightly see as hostile to the values that they uphold they gain support from a few large companies on the fringe of corporate america  the tobacco industry amway but within the functioning economy they are viewed with no little dismay apart from their role in implementing the rollback campaign they oppose government support for big corporations threatening a disaster for free enterprise if they cannot be kept down in the trenches they agree that its rollback time as one of their activists says but they have in mind something quite different from the ceos they dont like it when a corporation that has its home in gingrichs cobb county denounces an official resolution condemning the gay life style the ceos rightly fear that their troops may move beyond the culture war proceeding to undermine the basic framework of statesubsidized private power

funding for the gingrich army reveals the contradictions clearly major funders are from marketing schemes like amway smaller insurance companies hedgefunds and the like these sectors control plenty of money but are at the fringes of the economy they are very much in sync with the contract with america the wall street journal reports which is true only under a special but perhaps accurate interpretion of the support for the pentagon on the part of their forces who unlike the ceos are not much interested in the governments role as the savior of advanced industry furthermore they come from sectors of the population that really are cringing in fear and terror seeing enemies coming to get them on all sides a fact about the extraordinary cultural scene that one cannot simply ignore10

the contradictions are showing up in washington the commerce department under clinton has become a probusiness dynamo the wall street journal observes serving private power to an unprecedented degree but the gingrich army doesnt understand which leads to an uncanny circumstance big business allied with a democratic administration against republic proposals to trim commerces sails the same is true of the exportimport bank the national institutes of health which have given birth to the biotechnology industry the new york times observes and the national institute of standards and technology and the technology reinvestment project clintoninspired adjuncts to the pentagon subsidy to advanced industry these are wasteful because they are not devoted solely to military uses gop critics charge failing to comprehend the way the real economy works and perhaps believing the lurid tales about beast 666 arab terrorists and who knows what other agent of lucifer or the united nations even the hated regulatory agencies such as the fda have support from major corporations which can see ahead far enough to judge the effects of another thalidomide scandal11

in the early part of this century there was much fascination with corporate entities social organisms that have unique rights beyond those of mere individuals these ideas growing from more or less the same hegelian intellectual soil took several forms notably bolshevism fascism and the modern corporation corporations were granted extraordinary rights by courts and lawyers often with the support of progressives they are furthermore as totalitarian an institution as humans have managed so far to contrive terminology is crafted to avoid the substance behind the shadow so such terms as fascist and totalitarian are restricted to political entities but the similarity in character is unmistakeable two of these systems of centralized autocratic and unaccountable power have succumbed the third not only remains but is increasing its sway and dominance there are divisions and conflicts of course but also much similarity of general conception worldwide and overarching institutions are also taking shape the internal contradictions may or may not prove intractable but they have ominous import however they are resolved

the transition from containment of democracy and human rights to actual rollback should be seen against this background we should also recognize that the new phase of the struggle against the great beast is based upon social policies with particular goals that are not graven in stone or founded in laws of nature or society any more than the human institutions from which they arise
