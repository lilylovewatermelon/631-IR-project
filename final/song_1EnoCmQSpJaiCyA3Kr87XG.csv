turn on a neon light
at least make it feel like night
put on some this or that
maybe i wont feel so bad
i need a little background noise
to drown out this little voice
runnin circles round my brain
screamin louder than the pain

chorus both
my head is spinning
my resolve is reeling
i can tell by the heavy in my heart
im goin down soon
no use fightin the fight
its no contest tonight
my figured out has never been more confused
havin mixed drinks about feelings and you

verse 2 susan tedeschi
turn off the bedroom light
put on a brave face and face the night
its either get used to this dread
or the cold spot in our bed
the bottle helps but the memory burns
the whiskey soothes but i toss and turn
ill find sleep til dreams relent
wake up tired and try again
see eric church liveget tickets as low as 200you might also likechorus both
my head is spinning
my resolve is reeling
i can tell by the heavy in my heart
im goin down soon
no use fightin the fight
its no contest tonight
my figured out has never been more confused
havin mixed drinks about feelings and you
havin mixed drinks about feelings and you

outro
turn on a neon light
at least make it feel like nightembed"
