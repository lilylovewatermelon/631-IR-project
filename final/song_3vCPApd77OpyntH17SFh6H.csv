no i dont feel a thing
lifes going by me
but still i say
oh god im making the same mistakes

verse 2
low im on empty
try to erase all the bad times
free i dont seem to be
my soul remains tied to your life

chorus
every breath you breathe deep
i feel you circulating through me
ill never forgive myself again
im so sick and tired of making the same mistakes
the same mistakes
yeah

bridge
god help me
god help me
god help me

spoken interlude
there will be in the last days
terrible crime
and nothing so wonderful
as the love felt between
there will be terrible crime
because of the way people
see godsmack liveget tickets as low as 45you might also likeits because of the corruption
in the human heart

the corruption in the human heart
that will take even the most glorious
and wonderful and beautiful things
and making them into something
incredibly incredibly detrimental
to our wellbeingembed"
