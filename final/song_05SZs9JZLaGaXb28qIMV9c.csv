itll whisk you down the stream
but i never seem to have the time
so my toes just touch the water
my toes just touch the water

daydreamed on the bank again
i was swimming with the fish
and i thought this time that it may be true
my toes just touched the water
my toes just touched the water
my toes just touched the water

walked a mile just to find the edge
some place low enough to step right in
now im here and i cant begin to move

walked a mile just to find the edge
some place low enough to step right in
now im here and i cant begin to move

the spoiled sun up over there
it always has to have its way
and i know that the rivers there to shelter me
my toes just touched the water
my toes just touched the water
my toes just touched the water
my toes just touched the water
my toes just touched the water
my toes just touched the water
my toes just touched the water
my toes just touched the watersee norah jones liveget tickets as low as 26you might also likeembed"
