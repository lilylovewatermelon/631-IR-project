the atlantic was born today and ill tell you how
the clouds above opened up and let it out
i was standing on the surface of a perforated sphere
when the water filled every hole
and thousands upon thousands made an ocean
making islands where no island should go oh no

verse 2
most people were overjoyed they took to their boats
i thought it less like a lake and more like a moat
the rhythm of my footsteps crossing flatlands to your door
have been silenced forevermore
the distance is quite simply much too far for me to row
it seems farther than ever before oh no

refrain
i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer
see death cab for cutie liveget tickets as low as 147you might also likeinstrumental break

refrain
i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer

outro
so come on come on
so come on come on
so come on come on
so come on come on36embed"
