i called my doctor on the telephone
help me doctor theres something wrong
i cant shake it its gone too far
he said tell me what your symptoms are

chorus
i said my hands are sweaty and my knees are weak
i cant eat and i cant sleep
its turning me every way but loose
he said it sounds like loves got a hold on you
no doubt loves got a hold on you

verse 2
i told my buddies i was settling down
no more of this running around
they looked at me like i was a fool
and said come on tell us whats wrong with you

chorus
i said my hands are sweaty and my knees are weak
i cant eat and i cant sleep
its turning me every way but loose
he said it sounds like loves got a hold on you
no doubt loves got a hold on you

well i tossed and turned until the morning light
holding my pillow hanging on for life
there aint nothing i can do
they said it sounds like loves got a hold on you
sounds like loves got a hold on you

chorus
i said my hands are sweaty and my knees are weak
i cant eat and i cant sleep
its turning me every way but loose
he said it sounds like loves got a hold on you
it sounds like loves got a hold on you
it sounds like loves got a hold on you
no doubt loves got a hold on you
