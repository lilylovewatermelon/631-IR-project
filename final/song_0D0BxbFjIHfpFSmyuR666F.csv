yeah this place is wall to wall cant barely move takes fifteen minutes just to get a drink
its crazy here this crowd tonights so loud in here you can hardly think
but everythings fading babe cause youre all i see
its like were alone in here baby

chorus
we might as well be on an island we might as well be on the moon
the way youre looking at me baby cant take my eyes off you
feels like the world is disappearing every time we touch
were so caught up in each other its just the two of us
we might as well be on an island we might as well be on an island

verse 2
its just me and you back corner booth were sitting on the same seat
got my hands all over you and yeah girl youre all over me
like nobodys watching us baby let them all see
still that aint stopping us baby

chorus
we might as well be on an island we might as well be on the moon
the way youre looking at me baby cant take my eyes off you
feels like the world is disappearing every time we touch
were so caught up in each other its just the two of us
we might as well be on an island we might as well be on an island
you might also likebridge
we might as well be on an island
like were the last two on this earth
like were frozen here in time
like its empty here tonight

chorus
we might as well be on an island we might as well be on the moon
the way youre looking at me baby cant take my eyes off you
feels like the world is disappearing every time we touch
were so caught up in each other its just the two of us
we might as well be on an island we might as well be on an island yeahembed"
