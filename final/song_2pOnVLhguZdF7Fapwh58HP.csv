feeling sorrow
for all the things you had to steal and borrow
bring back the days we had before tomorrow
relapse and then collapse into yourself once more

waiting for this life to change seems like its taking me forever
and i cant hold on this life is breaking
into the day this life is going to change seems like its taking me forever
and i cant hold on this life is breaking
into the day

void i cant fill
the doctor tells me to relax and stand still
prescribes me a new pill to quell my anger
wish i could make her pull herself up off the floor

waiting for this life to change seems like its taking me forever
and i cant hold on this life is breaking
into the day this life is going to change seems like its taking me forever
and i cant hold on this life is breaking
into the dayagaininto the dayagain
waiting for this life to change seems like its taking me forever
and i cant hold on this life is breaking
into the day this life is going to change seems like its taking me forever
and i cant hold on this life is breaking
into the day
