one day i will get drunk and text you
and ill say and ill say
that i want you lets get coffee
when youre down when youre down
yeah you scare me the nicest person
i will wait i will wait
dali said that you want me also
will you say will you say

but its not surprising that you thought about me
i thought youd feel like an ocean all reactive
and lucid in emotion whyd you think about meyou might also like8embed"
