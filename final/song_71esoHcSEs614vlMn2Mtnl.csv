yeah as i stumble into the night
were touching but i feel like you are still out of reach
the people here are buzzin like a bug on a light
im feelin like i always see them but they cant see me
sentimental feelings
never get me anywhere
my heart continues beating
is there anybody anybody

hello hello
is anybody listening
let go as everyone lets go of me
ohoh wont somebody show me that im not alone not alone
no oh

verse 2
yeah im combing through this desert of stone
these faces on these statues that i used to know
wishin i was more than what my story has told
or hoping that im dreamin in the day and this isnt happening
gotta keep it all together
longing for a hand to hold
keep clear of the shadows
is there anybody anybody
