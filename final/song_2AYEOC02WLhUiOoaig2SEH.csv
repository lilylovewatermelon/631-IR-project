verse 1
forty days and forty nights
i waited for a girl like you
to come and save my life
recall the days i waited for you
you know the ones who said
id never find someone like you

chorus
you were out of my league
all the things i believe
you were just the right kind
yeah you were more than just a dream
you were out of my league
got my heartbeat racing
if i die dont wake me
cause you were more than just a dream

verse 2
from time to time i pinch myself
because i think my girl
mistakes me for somebody else
and every time she takes my hand
all the wonders that remain
become a simple fact

chorus
you were out of my league
all the things i believe
you were just the right kind
yeah you were more than just a dream
you were out of my league
got my heartbeat racing
if i die dont wake me
cause you were more than just a dream

yeah you were more than just a dream
you were out of my league
got my heartbeat racing
if i die dont wake me
cause you were more than just a dream
