man what haha
this shit funny one sec
oof this hennessy strong as fuck boy

chorus
she told me put my heart in the bag in the bag
and nobody gets hurt no hurt
now im running from her love im not fast fast
so im making it worse im making it worse
now im digging up a grave from my past
im a whole different person im a whole different person
its a gift and a curse its a gift and a curse
but i cannot reverse it

verse 1
i cant reverse it
it was a gift and a curse
and now im drinkin too much so ima talk with a slur
last time i saw you it ended in a blur
i woke up in a hearse
you said you loved me first first
one thing my dad told me was never let your woman know when youre insecure
so i put gucci on the fur
and i put my wrist on iceberg
one thing my heart tells me is
flex on a ho every time theyre insecure
i cant see it through im running from you
is your love for real for real for real
is your love really true

she told me put my heart in the bag in the bag
and nobody gets hurt hurt
now im running from her love im not fast fast
so im making it worse worse
now im digging up a grave from my past past
im a whole different person person
its a gift and a curse curse
but i cannot reverse it

bridge
you gave me the runaround
i really hate the runaround
you really got me paranoid
i always keep a gun around
you always give me butterflies
when you come around
when you come around
when you come around

verse 2
you let me know love is not the answer
not the answer not the answer
i love to do drugs so mind my manners
i get high when you dont decide to answer
phone home i need to phone home
im throwing rocks at your window i need to go home
i dont wanna leave
i just wanna be with you
you you you
chorus
she told me put my heart in the bag in the bag

now im running from her love im not fast fast
so im making it worse im making it worse

im a whole different person im a whole different person
its a gift and a curse its a gift and a curse
but i cannot reverse it284embed"
