come on

verse 1
shes no good for me i know that shes a wildflower
shes got a restlessness a beautifulness a thing about her
but here i am again callin her back
lettin her drive me crazy

chorus
its like i love this pain a little too much
love my heart all busted up
somethin about her we just dont work
but i cant walk away
its like i love this pain

verse 2
its just an on again and off again situation
its just strikin a match a tank of gas combination
but here i am again lightin it up
knowin that shell just burn me

chorus
its like i love this pain a little too much
love my heart all busted up
somethin about her we just dont work
but i cant walk away
its like i love this pain
see lady a liveget tickets as low as 205you might also likebridge
its like i love this life
when nothings right yeah somethings wrong
its like im just not me
if i cant be a sad sad song

chorus
its like i love this pain a little too much
love my heart all busted up
somethin about her we just dont work
but i cant walk away
its like i love this pain

outro
its like i love this pain
i cant walk away
oh no
its like i love this painembed"
