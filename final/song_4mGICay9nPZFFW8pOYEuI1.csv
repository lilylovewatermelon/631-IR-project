theres an old hardwood tree
staring through the glass at me
its been there since 85
sometimes i think it reads my mind i guess its true
you cant keep it from shining through

chorus
theres no denying ive been hiding
from this thing thats chasing me
yeah ive been running no good its showing
all these scars from yesterday
there comes a time you got to give it up
spin that wheel and try your luck
you never know what you will find
it might be love this time

verse 2
i knew it from that very first smile
i could taste it like a hungry child
not at all like all the risk
you know they say that last is best

bridge
like a rainbow on a cloudy day
just to shelter takes my breathe away
see alan jackson liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likechorus
and theres no denying ive been hiding
from this thing thats chasing me
yeah ive been running no good its showing
all these scars from yesterday
there comes a time you got to give it up
spin that wheel and try your luck
you never know what you will find
it might be love this time
theres no denying ive been hiding
from this thing thats chasing me
yeah ive been running no good its showing
all these scars from yesterday
there comes a time you got to give it up
spin that wheel and try your luck
you never know what you will find
it might be love this time
