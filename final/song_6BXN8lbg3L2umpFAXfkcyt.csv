got your freedom now boy
who do you serve
took for granted what you should have preserved
no time left no time left
to make amends
keep burning bridges while youre buying your new friends

prechorus
a day of reflection hits youre a shell
skin and bones counting costs
is it worth your soul
a day of reflection hits

chorus
its funny how times can change
rearrange and distance makes
the pain fade away
so important then doesnt matter now
both feet on the ground
come full circle yeah

postchorus
come full circle

verse 2
no access granted now boy
youve been denied
jump the fence to see whats on the other side
are you wanted are you wanted
the question is
could second chances mean another impression
see creed liveget tickets as low as 25you might also likeprechorus
a day of reflection hits youre a shell
skin and bones counting costs
is it worth your soul
a day of reflection hits

chorus
its funny how times can change

the pain fade away
so important then doesnt matter now
both feet on the ground
come full circle

postchorus
we come full circle

bridge
i got one foot stuck in heaven yeah
one boot stuck in hell
i looked at god he winked at me
i made this mess myself
dont be surprised and dont deny
hear every word i say
close the door and dont look back
or you will fade away
its funny how times can change
rearrange and distance makes
the pain fade away

chorus
its funny how times can change
rearrange and distance makes
the pain fade away
so important then doesnt matter now
both feet on the ground
come full circle
