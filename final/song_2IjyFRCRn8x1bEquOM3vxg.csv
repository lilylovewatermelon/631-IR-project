feeling like im breathing my last breath
feeling like im walking my last steps
look at all of these tears ive wept
look at all the promises that ive kept

prechorus
i put my all into your hands
heres my soul to keep
i let you in with all that i can
youre not hard to reach

chorus
and you bless me with the best gift
that ive ever known
you give me purpose
yeah youve given me purpose

verse 2
thinking my journeys come to an end
sending out a farewell to my friends for inner peace
ask you to forgive me for my sins oh would you please
im more than grateful for the time we spent my spirits at ease

prechorus
i put my heart into your hands
learn the lessons you teach
no matter when wherever i am
youre not hard to reach

and youve given me the best gift
that ive ever known
you give me purpose everyday
you give me purpose in every way

bridge
oh you are my everything
oh you are my everything

outro spoken
i don’t know if this is wrong because someone else is telling me that it’s wrong but i feel this so let me just like try my best not to let this happen again  we weren’t necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions

you can’t be hard on yourself for it these are the cards you were given so you have to understand that’s not who you are you know you’re trying to be the best you can be but that’s all you can do if you don’t give it all you got you’re only cheating yourself give it all you got but if it ends up happening it ends up happening

that’s what happening with me it’s like “god i’m giving it all i’ve got sometimes i’m weak and i’m going to do it” and it’s like i’m not giving myself grace i’m just like understanding that’s how it is27embed"
