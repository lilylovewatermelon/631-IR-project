i found verity
on norleans avenue
down where the air is thick
as la skies are blue
the water tried to break it down but it held through
it gave a little for the sake of staying true

verse 1
we cut ties we tell lies we hate change
and we wanna claim where we feel
we take tolls we rake yours
yeah we dig holes and were digging right in your fears

chorus
were waking up were waking up
and right on time and right on time
well take these roads well break them up
and right on time and right on time

verse 2
we got cars well write laws we wont pause
dont you know were all wizards working the hours
we dont lose we might bruise
yeah but well rain fire on you till youre playing all of your cards

were waking up were waking up
and right on time and right on time
well take these roads well break them up
and right on time and right on time
on time
right on time
waking up waking up
