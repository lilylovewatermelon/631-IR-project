hard to know maybe if i skim the stone
walk a different way back home it would all make sense
oh shut my eyes lose myself in teenage lies
if i fell in love a thousand times would it all make sense

chorus
cause ive been feeling pretty small
sometimes feel like im slipping down walls
and every line i ever get a hold it seems to break

verse 2
could call you up
i could tell you just how much
no no maybe i will just get drunk and it will all make sense
or if i werent so nice id convince my friends that you werent right
i could promise you my heart dont cry
but would it all make sense

chorus
cause i ive been feeling pretty small
sometimes feel like im slipping down walls
and every line i ever get a hold it seems to break
oh i ive been feeling pretty small
sometimes feel like im slipping down walls
and every line i ever get a hold it seems to breaksee tom odell liveget tickets as low as 48you might also like9embed"
