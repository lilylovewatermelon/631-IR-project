i found myself dreaming in silver and gold
like a scene from a movie that every broken heart knows
we were walking on moonlight and you pulled me close
split second and you disappeared and then i was all alone

prechorus meghan trainor
i woke up in tears with you by my side
a breath of relief and ive realised
no were not promised tomorrow

chorus meghan trainor
so im gonna love you like im gonna lose you
im gonna hold you like im saying goodbye
wherever were standin i wont take you for granted
cause well never know when when well run out of time
so im gonna love you like im gonna lose you lose you
im gonna love you like im gonna lose you

verse 2 john legend meghan trainor
in the blink of an eye just a whisper of smoke
you could lose everything the truth is you never know
so ill kiss you longer babe hey any chance that i get
ill make the most of the minutes and love with no regret

prechorus john legend meghan trainor both
