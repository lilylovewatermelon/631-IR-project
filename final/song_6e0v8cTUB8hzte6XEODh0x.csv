im the passionate activist version of nino brown
im martin luther marcus garvey mixed with john gotti malcolm x mr clark
strapped with a piece peace like gandhi
they say ooops you contradicting yourself because you freedom fightin but you stay with the heat
i mean i motivate my people but even mother teresa stayed with the peace piece

if im lyin im flyin and my feet aint left the motherfuckin ground
round 2 daylyt
i said in order for me to get my shine behind bars i had to killa nigga in front of everybody and make mad noise

my vision notorious i seen perfect in the dark
but i eye be too cocky when the shades off me
now i live by faith i keep gettin tested by these yucky niggas
but they dont realize its dot mobb winnin the lotto yall know

put a lil mo sweet shit on that round be a glaze
they like why be a slave

now you stuck in a world full of my lines just be amazed a maze
they said i was gassed lyt pennin with plenty throttle
now i got em screamin im so good goodz i should be light skinned with a henny bottle

lyt verse now i aint gotta try surely
you got cancer ooops god had a plan for you to die early

round 2 ooops
yall remember mamas family
yall remember saturday morning cartoons
and ice cream trucks
remember when no kids and motorolas was the only phones that it was
i meanrememberremembertechmo bowl and duck hunt
and mike tyson punch out
remember hood fights when nobody died
them problems thats how we talked it out
yall remember that
well lets relate it to battle rap
cause fuck reminiscing bro we want that ol day back
but you be hidin behind this punk ass image
but deep inside i can hear yo cries
i mean lets be honest i know you young  restless but we dont need no more of these days in our lives
you my brother so i knew fuckin you up wasnt gonna be fun day
i mean after this itll be hard to get up like a monday
see the problem is you got it a little confused day
i mean i gotta show you the facts of life and how to utilize those tools day tuesday
see let me tell you the truth it aint about where you been day
it aint even about your resume your loses or your wins day wednesday
look me in my eyes im a different nigga fuck what you heard day
this shit you do is absurd them aint my words its theres day thursday
see they ask me which one will show up is it the straight or the bi day
i say youll get a box for stealin if he off after i fry day friday
and when it comes to ya gal she looks sadder and sadder day
cause queens belong on a pedestal not a curb thats where you sat her day saturday
see when it comes to life lessons no problem i got a ton day
so after i crucify you i just want you to rise for your son day sunday
see i do this shit with ease tiers dont stand a chance wit me
im a one man army you couldve brought me seven days hes still weak week
yall thought because hes writers bloque i wasnt gon try and kill him
ice bath after the game the shit i spit be bone chillin
see im a real nigga my whole life why you think im still standin
punches hit him in the chest like a death in the family
but this is a rhetorical battle meaning not meant for reply
cause im wiggin on every level like a beauty supplies
if you that beast behind that fence ill go check it out
thats a sandlot skit
or give him never ending hooks on some lamb chop shit
so come in my zone he know better
i tell him no flex cause these piece full peaceful i came to protest
see yall heard him rappin
i mean i know yall was happy but they wasnt happy cause you was up here snappin
they was happy cause you wasnt doin antics and you was actually rappin
see yall be hypin these niggas up doin shit that they not
im from the streets so i guess talkin bout drugs what i should do
fuck it let me give it a shot
see when i was in the club no burner i got next to that pool table
a nigga get hit wit an 8 ball in a sock no
i said when i was younger pops used to send me to the corner with them 8 balls in my sock
til i was old enough to carry each 8 ball in my pocket
thats two 8s so any turf they fought me a st louis nigga ran back with the rock
but when i say that niggas really consider that im a real thug
let me tell yall the truth i aint never sold not one motherfuckin drug
but i have been shot stabbed robbed dont worry bout me
i return those favors
came back three weeks later just to return the razor
ask around here theyll tell you that im the next up
i came to show you that drive without the gas i am a tesla
i told yall i wont lose a motherfuckin ground
if im lyin im flyin and my feet aint left the motherfuckin ground

round 3 daylyt
what i did versus pat stay yall prolly hated that
tonight we gon call it the sequel
id like to sacrifice my third round just to talk to my people
they talkin bout what goes alone and lyt scout
well ima show you what life route
i think its time for me to tell the world what my life bout
at the age of four my best friend kenny got shot in the head right next to me
i grew up very sad
tellin myself the bullets didnt hit me i should be very glad
and then i thought about it im growin up very mad
cause i was a lil nigga i avoided every bag
i told myself im bout to start crippin blued up heavy flag
dickies cortez with the bottoms glued up heavy sag
it was pops at my front door every day it was never dad
i spent the rest of my life like a new myspace account a tom was the only friend that i ever had
but its true nigga cause livin in watts you gotta be a red a purple or a blue nigga
a fed an urkel or a true nigga
but either way it go you gon be a killer follow the rules nigga
steve urkel showed yall that if a square randomly get a machine then outta nowhere he a cool nigga
it happened to me i felt invincible with my machine
30 minutes later after a driveby i was back in the streets
and 30 minutes after that the shit happened to me
blocka blockaone in my hand
blocka blockatwo in my leg
blocka blockatwo in my belly
blocka blockatwo across my thigh
only thing i can remember is runnin blackin out like aww shit i died
layin on that hospital bed seein the white lights
ask god if death was planned
he said no son not for you ima give you a second chance
and here i am reborn i am spawn nigga
embrace that
cause when yall say im stupidgod is the reason i got the face tat
but i thought about it i grew up with no father he was not provided
i start crippin became a c sea god its not posideon
i was afraid of the real world so i use the block for hidin
one thing i could do was kill every enemy in my hood but we couldnt stop the sirens
rip mooky rip kalo them cop shots was flyin
all i kept sayin was goddamn the block is dyin
but you said in the last verse if a nigga kill yo brother you pull out the glock and ridin
but let a cop kill yo brother first thing you do is go to the street and scream stop the violence
but when its brother on brother he on stage sayin he a hardcore nine nigga
when its cops versus brother you in the street as just another cardboard sign nigga
but serious question tell me what the fuck did we accomplish from the million man march
nothing
all i seen is a million men march
in the street marchin but aint got the courage but was a million damn hearts
it shouldve been a million niggas on they way to the white house lettin a million cans spark
its true martin luther king was a busta
wait wait wait wait wait wait
in my heart martin luther king was a busta and i can say that in the best way
we shall overcome we shall overcome what
we shouldve been in the street chopper on the back the malcolm x way
real shit
my brother ooops i love you man time man
sike i lied nigga

round 3 ooops
i thought about talkin about ferguson and protestin andi felt like nah that aint gon fit
i figured id use my third round so i can talk my shit
cause they know that i talk theres certain shit that i get to
see you talkin all that protest shit but we aint have to go to selma to see what they went through
nah i told yall that i wasnt gon talk about fergusonwell at least tonight
because i gave yall that third round vs ored and you motherfuckas still blinded
half of yall dont even wanna fight
and to me thats a sad site
so i figured id use my third round to talk about my real life
my brother see actually he died when he was nine
i was sixand it wasnt cause of sickness or in his sleep
he violently got killed
two men came out the house arguin one shot the other one picked him up used him as a human shield
but let me fast forward that
whatchu know about bein on the phone wit your fiance
she drivin yall arguin so she hands up
now you mad at all type of shit
only to find out eight hours later that she didnt hang up she died in a tragic accident
she they look at my tattoos and they think that im crazy
i say my common sense is still here
what you know about havin a disease that they say you in remission but you still the pain
you know the pain is still there
i meanits been a lot of times bro i wanted to off myself but i thought about my family
but im a man so i still get scared
i wanted to those cans here to that cancer thats still there
i woke up wednesday 300 in the mornin cryin sweatin
like damnthat dream was so real
see i was on stage goin crazy but wasnt really sayin nothin that shit was so ill
but then the lights cut off and a spotlight shine see that shit got soweird
cause i turned around everybody disappeared but my daughter was righthere
she said daddy i like that new route you take
you know when you talk to niggas it seem like you teachin a lesson
the fact that you been through so much and you still here i consider that as a blessin
she say i remember you told ored he cant look you in yo eyes and ask you what yo life like nigga
fuck walkin in yo shoes he couldnt even handle the sound bites nigga
when you said that it damn near broke the stage
but you know what it did to me daddy it sent me in ain an emotional rage
see one of the best things in the world is the fact that you are our father
but the battle world the protest world they dont know what we go through bein ya daughter
see do he know that im the one you have to lie to sadly
im the one that slept witchu just in case you didnt wake up i know that you died happy
did he know that i gave you blue blockers
i said daddy i need you to wear these at night
just in case the grim reaper come and you lose that flight
put em on and itll blind you from the light
the fact that you might not be here tomorrow daddy i cant live through that type of stuff
thats why sometimes at 300 in the mornin i sneak in ya room when you have those nightmares im the one that wake you up
she say when i ask you daddy how you doin you tell me you fine you lie
so i be like okay i lie witchu
but when you in so much pain that you cant make it upstairs you sleep on the couch i lie witchu
even when you out there in the streets you fight i fight witchu
you come in the house cryin cause things will never change i cry witchu
she say but the crazy thing about it daddy is even when you wrong im right witchu
so if god decide to take you away ill die witchu
and then i woke up at 300 in the mornin
cause that shit was soreal
cause i was actually on stage goin crazy but not sayin much that shit was soill
but the crazy thing about it is even though when im on stage and this shit gets soweird
ill just think about my daughterthats the reason im still here1embed"
