looking back i see a million little things that wrecked us
she never liked my pickup truck parked up beside her lexus
and i never wore them khakis like she asked me
just trashy old blue jeans old skoal ring

prechorus
she packed up her chanel said go to hell taught me a lesson
and now as far as shes concerned
im in a deep and dark depression

chorus
but its happy hour drinking double shooters
buying whiskey sours for a pack of cougars
i know i should be sadder but it all seems silly
cause my good buddy waylon hooked me up with some willie
girl i know a breakup aint supposed to be fun
but im here at happy hour happy ours is done yeah

verse 2
and i know shell hear about my paint the town red gallivanting
and shell think i thought of her curves when i found that gal to dance with
and shell tell her friends im faking my hearts breaking time will take away my grin
but not when every bar i stumble in

chorus
is happy hour drinking double shooters
buying whiskey sours for a pack of cougars
i know i should be sadder but it all seems silly
cause my good buddy went and hooked me up with some willie
girl i know a breakup aint supposed to be fun
but im here at happy hour happy ours is done
see morgan wallen liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likebridge
well itll make her feel much better if she thinks my life is hell
tell her ever since she left me its like time is standing still

chorus
and its happy hour drinking double shooters
buying whiskey sours for a pack of cougars
i know i should be sadder but it all seems silly
cause my good buddy went and hooked me up with some willie
girl i know a breakup aint supposed to be fun
but im here at happy hour happy ours is done
yeah im here at happy hour happy ours is done yeah1embed"
