your bodys warm but you are not
you give a little not a lot
it could be love until we kiss
youre all i want but not like this
im watching you disappear
but you you were never here

chorus
its only your shadow
never yourself
its only your shadow
nobody else
its only your shadow
filling the room
arriving too late
and leaving too soon
and leaving too soon

verse 2
your body gives but then holds back
the sun is bright the sky is black
can only be another sign
i cannot keep what isnt mine
your laughter it lingers on
but you you were almost gone
you might also likechorus
its only your shadow
never yourself
its only your shadow
nobody else
its only your shadow
filling the room
arriving too late
and leaving too soon
and leaving too soon

bridge
how can i tell if you mean what you say
you say it so loud but you sound far away
maybe i had just a glimpse of your soul
or was that your shadow i saw on the wall
im watching you disappear
but you you were never here

chorus
it’s only your shadow
never yourself
it’s only your shadow
nobody else
it’s only your shadow
filling the room
arriving too late
no no no
it’s only your shadow
it’s only your shadow
nobody else
it’s only your shadow
arriving too late
and leaving too soon
ooh oh
it’s only your shadow5embed"
