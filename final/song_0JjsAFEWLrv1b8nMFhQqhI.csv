trillo beats you did it again
changed
i guess i guess im the one who changed changed for the better but drell on the track
my daughter straight bro we talkin for life for real akel akel

verse
we was once two niggas of the same kind
quick to holler at the hoes at the same line
im happy for you but im disappointed at the same time look
this for my nigga i know its been a little while
heard through the grapevine that you still holding it down
i couldnt find the pride to say this shit to your face
so i did it it over snares and bass music take me away
we was young and wild on a rush to get paid
runnin round your side of town nigga them was the days
and i was bottom boy surviving but the bottom was torn
brought me through your neighborhood and embraced me with open arms
so many ups and downs just tryna get to the loot
they probably wouldnt believe all of the shit we been through
my brother my ace my homie was closer than most
he couldnt get enough they sent my boy up the road
and when he came home i knew some shit was different
cause looking in his eyes i couldnt see it in him
when i got back in town you know i went to get him
i told him bout the pounds i told him bout the chickens
it always been our dreams to go from rags to riches
and now i got the scheme and you aint even with it
i laughed about his dreams a legitimate business
guess that was my way of showing you i got growin to do but hey
you might also likechorus
and i guess theres nothing wrong with change for the better
but ima be this way forever
and even though that its forever thuggin with me
never be scared to keep it a hundred with me
i aint mad at you yeah nah for real i cant even be mad at that you know what im saying
i cant be mad at you once you know a nigga like me im thuggin forever bro i dont need another nigga im still thuggin bitch ima die for you man
i aint mad at you yeah in the middle of the trenches nigga the middle of the room nigga in front of everybody nigga with my gun in my motherfuckin hand if i go out nigga

chorus
