my sexy love
so sexy

verse 1
she makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up
just one touch
and i erupt like a volcano and cover her with my love
baby girl you make me say

prechorus
and i just cant think of anything else id rather do
than to hear you sing sing my name the way you do
when we do our thing when we do the things we do
baby girl you make me say

chorus
sexy love
girl the things you do oh baby baby
keep me sprung
keep me running back to you
oh i love making love to you
baby girl you know youre my sexy love

verse 2
im so addicted to her
shes the sweetest drug
just enough
still too much say that im simping
and im sprung all of the above
i cant help she makes me say
