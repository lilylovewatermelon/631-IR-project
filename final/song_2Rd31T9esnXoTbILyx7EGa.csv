looking at himself but wishing he was someone else
because the posters on the wall they dont look like him at all
so he ties it up he tucks it in he pulls it back and gives a grin
laughing at himself because he knows he aint loved at all

verse 1
he gets his courage from the can
it makes him feel like a man
because hes loving all the ladies
but the ladies dont love him at all
because when hes not drunk
hes only stuck on himself
and then he has the nerve
to say he needs a decent girl

chorus 2
looking at herself but wishing she was someone else
because the body of the doll dont look like hers at all
so she straps it up she sets it in she throws it up it gets a grin
laughing at herself because she knows she aint born at all

verse 2
all caught up in the trends
well the truth began to bend
and the next thing you know man
theres just no truth left at all
because when the pretty girl walks
she walks so proud
and when the pretty girl laughs
oh man she laughs so loud
see jack johnson liveget tickets as low as 95you might also likeand if it aint this then its that
as a matter of fact
she hasnt had a day to relax
since she has lost her ability to think clearly

bridge
well im an energetic hypothetic version of another person
check out my outsides there aint nothing in here
well im a superficial systematic music television addict
check out my outsides there aint nothing in here

outro
looking at himself but wishing he was someone else
because the posters on the wall they dont look like him
so he ties it up he tucks it in he pulls it back and gives a grin
laughing at himself because he knows he aint loved at all
knows he aint loved at all1embed"
