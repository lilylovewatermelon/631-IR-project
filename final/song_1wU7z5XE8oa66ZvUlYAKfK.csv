still is the life
of your room when youre not inside
and all of your things
tell the sweetest story line
your tears on these sheets
and your footsteps are down the hall
so tell me what i did
i cant find where the moment went wrong at all

chorus
you can be mad in the morning
ill take back what i said
just dont leave me alone here
its cold baby
come back to bed
come back to bed
come back to bed
come back to bed come on back to bed

verse 2
what will this fix
you know youre not a quick forgive
and i wont sleep through this
i survive on the breath you are finished with
see john mayer liveget tickets as low as 99you might also likechorus
you can be mad in the morning
ill take back what i said
just dont leave me alone here
its cold baby
come back to bed
come back to bed
come back to bed
come back to bed

chorus
you can be mad in the morning
or the afternoon instead
but dont leave me
ninetyeight and six degrees of separation from you baby
come back to bed
come back to bed
come back to bed
why dont you come back to bed

outro
dont hold your love over my head
dont hold your love over my head
dont hold your love over my head
dont hold your love over my head
dont hold your love over my head
dont hold your love1embed"
