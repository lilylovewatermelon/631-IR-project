my knuckles were bruised like violets
sucker punching walls cursed you as i sleeptalked
spineless in my tomb of silence
tore your banners down took the battle underground
and maybe it was egos swinging
maybe it was her
flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur

chorus
all that bloodshed crimson clover
uhhuh sweet dream was over
my hand was the one you reached for
all throughout the great war
always remember
uhhuh tears on the lеtter
i vowed not to cry anymore
if wе survived the great war

verse 2
you drew up some good faith treaties
i drew curtains closed drank my poison all alone
you said i have to trust more freely
but diesel is desire you were playing with fire
and maybe its the past thats talking
screaming from the crypt
telling me to punish you for things you never did
so i justified it

all that bloodshed crimson clover
uhhuh the bombs were closer
my hand was the one you reached for
all throughout the great war
always remember
uhhuh the burning embers
i vowed not to fight anymore
if we survived the great war

postchorus
uhhuh uhhuh

bridge
it turned into something bigger
somewhere in the haze got a sense id been betrayed
your finger on my hairpin triggers
soldier down on that icy ground
looked up at me with honor and truth
broken and blue so i called off the troops
that was the night i nearly lost you
i really thought id lost you

verse 3
we can plant a memory garden
say a solemn prayer place a poppy in my hair
theres no morning glory it was war it wasnt fair
and we will never go back
chorus
to that bloodshed crimson clover
uhhuh the worst was over
my hand was the one you reached for
all throughout the great war
always remember
uhhuh were burned for better
i vowed i would always be yours
cause we survived the great war

outro
uhhuh uhhuh
i will always be yours
cause we survived the great war
uhhuh
i vow i will always be yours31embed"
