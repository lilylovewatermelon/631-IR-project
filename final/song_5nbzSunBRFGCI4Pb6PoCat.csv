we dont know how we feel
were just praying that were doing this right
though thats not the way it seems
summer gone now winters on its way
i will miss the days we had
the days we had
i will miss the days we had
the days we had
oh ill miss the days we had

loving leaving its too late for this now
such esteem for each has gone
has time driven our season away
cause thats the way it seems
in the world of the speech that is new
ill be back again to stay
again to stay
ill be back again to stay
again to stay
ill be back again to staysee the head and the heart liveget tickets as low as 58you might also like2embed"
