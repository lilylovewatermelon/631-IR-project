my name is regina george
and i am a massive deal

stand and stare at me
and these these are real

ive got money and looks
i am like drunk with power

i never weigh more than onefifteen
my name is regina george
and i am a massive deal
i dont care who you are
i dont care how you feel

janis spoken
thats gretchen wieners she knows everything about everybody 

damian spoken
thats why her hair is so big its full of secrets 

gretchen
yes regina

every waking hour
i spend making sure regina
george can stay in power
if regina is the sun
then im a disco ball
cause im just as bright and fun
if youve had alcohol
i worm your secrets out of you
and bring them to my master
then i watch regina make your life a big disaster

damian janis
