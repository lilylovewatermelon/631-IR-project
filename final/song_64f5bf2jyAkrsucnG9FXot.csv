youre never gonna love me so whats the use
whats the point in playing a game youre gonna lose
whats the point in saying you love me like a friend
whats the point in saying its never gonna end

prechorus
youre too proud to say that you made a mistake
youre a coward til the end
i dont wanna admit that were not gonna fit
no im not the type that you like
why dont we just pretend

chorus
lies
dont wanna know dont wanna know oh
i cant let you go cant let you go oh
i just want it to be perfect
to believe its all been worth the fight
lies
dont wanna know dont wanna know oh

verse 2
you only ever touch me in the dark
only if were drinking can you see my spark
and only in the evening could you give yourself to me
cause the night is your woman and shell set you free
