look at my history
im tryna see whats different from that guy and the richer me
the only thing i see is custom owls from tiffany
and some gunnas thatll hit you outta nowhere like epiphany
really thats it to me
aside from the obvious man it changes in scenery
testin me gon have my niggas testin machinery
they say that they happy my man thats not how they seem to be
the boy he wild and peaceful rest in peace teena marie
ethics and values mob traditions old fashioned
monopoly action
bronny buyin up brentwood like he still in akron
a lot of pain a lot of passion
a lot of relaxin while other niggas is overreactin
thats how we continue down the path of jordan and jackson
thats some insight for yall even if no ones askin
last year niggas really feel like they rode on me
last year niggas got hot cause they told on me
im bout to call the bluff of anybody that fold on me
im buyin the buildin of every door that closed on me
yeah loro piana and brioni the one and only
champagne popper the love doctor
your baby mother call me when she lonely
my tailor see me twice a week he like my homie
forever grateful forever thankful
diamond necklace but she wears it on her ankle
the bitch is trendy
my enemies send each other the texts that they could never send me
im bankin two million a show for the residency
nevada gaming commission in a frenzy
how much money can this casino lend me
rippin markers up over shots of the henny
vivid memory can someone send me a real nigga interlude
to me benihana is pigeon food
this not a forgivin mood
so much we gotta count the 20s up in a different room
i am just a body that my brothers are livin through
keepin my connections strictly physical
everyone thats married is miserable
i know that that is not a lifestyle i can give into
the rise to the top of this mountain has been biblical
i dont carry cash cause the money is digital
its the american expresser the debt collector
hailin all the way from the mecca
got something for trudy and rebecca
this shit could last forever
the mind controller the ayatollah
i built a bridge to success and had visions of me ridin over
step in the room and october gets a lot closer
haunted houses
i dont know how to count in thousands only millions
now tell your friends im not the villain
send em to lagos or turks and caicos
barbados trinidad and tobago
never go the same places they go
separate vacations
a far cry from when drizzy had slept in the basement
i was never on the path to get into cambridge
i mean i was good at doin math but im better with language
borderline dangerous approach with caution
i plan to buy your most personal belongings when they up for auction
man truth be told i think about it often
the petty king the overseer of many things
i wish that i was playin in a sport where we were gettin rings
i wouldnt have space on either hand for anything
west hollywood know my presence is menacing
cosa nostra shady dealings
racketeering the syndicate got they hand in plenty things
the things that weve done to protect the name are unsettling
but no regrets though the namell echo
years later none greater
death to a coward and a traitor thats just in my nature yeahsee drake liveget tickets as low as 90you might also like31embed"
