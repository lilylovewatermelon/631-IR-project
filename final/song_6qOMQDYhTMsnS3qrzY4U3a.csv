crazy enough to think that we might make it
well maybe if we take it
slow enough to make love cause baby i believe

never in my life girl have i been this close to something so real
something so good that it makes me feel like
damn baby its the way we take this thing to another place
that ive never been

damn baby you driving me crazy
what do you say we lock the door and leave the world outside
hey break me cause ive been known to
walk away when i get this close but baby not this time

never in my life girl have i been this close to something so real
something so good that it makes me feel like
damn baby its the way we take this thing to another place
that ive never been damn baby
