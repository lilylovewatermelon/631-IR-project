well i was there on the day they sold the cause for the queen
and when the lights all went out we watched our lives on the screen
i hate the ending myself but it started with an alright scene

verse 1
it was the roar of the crowd that gave me heartache to sing
it was a lie when they smiled and said you wont feel a thing
and as we ran from the cops we laughed so hard it would sting
yeah yeah woah

prechorus
if im so wrong so wrong so wrong
how can you listen all night long night long night long
now will it matter after im gone
because you never learned a goddamn thing

chorus
youre just a sad song with nothing to say
about a lifelong wait for a hospital stay
and if you think that im wrong
this never meant nothing to you

verse 2
i spent my high school career spit on and shoved to agree
so i could watch all my heroes sell a car on tv
bring out the old guillotine well show em what we all mean
yeah yeah woah

if im so wrong so wrong so wrong
how can you listen all night long night long night long
now will it matter long after im gone
because you never learned a goddamn thing

chorus
youre just a sad song with nothing to say
about a lifelong wait for a hospital stay
and if you think that im wrong
this never meant nothing to you

so go go away
just go run away
but where did you run to
and where did you hide
go find another way
price you pay

chorus
youre just a sad song with nothing to say
about a lifelong wait for a hospital stay
and if you think that im wrong

youre just a sad song with nothing to say
about a lifelong wait for a hospital stay
and if you think that im wrong
this never meant nothing to you
