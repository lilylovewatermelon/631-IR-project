this is a crazy world
these can be lonely days
its hard to know whos on your side
most of the time
who can you really trust
who do you really know
is there anybody out there
who can make you feel less alone
sometimes you just cant make it on your own

chorus
if you need a place where you can run
if you need a shoulder to cry on
well ill always be your friend
when you need some shelter from the rain
when you need a healer for your pain
i will be there time and time again
when you need someone to love you
here i am hmmm

verse 2
if you have broken dreams
just lay them all on me
ill be the one who understands
so take my hand
if there is emptiness
you know ill do my best
to fill you up with all the love
that i can show someone
i promise you youll never walk alone
