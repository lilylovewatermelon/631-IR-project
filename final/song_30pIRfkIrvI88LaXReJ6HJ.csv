verse 1
i got all tricked out and came up to this thing
looking so fire hot a twenty out of ten
i saw you watching me watching you on the floor
hitting me up like what you waiting for

prechorus
its alright to say you want it
get inside my dirty mind
burns like ice the way i bring it
again and again and again all night

chorus
the beat just dropped and the room got sexy
youre watching me like theres no one else around
i know you want me like kids want candy
so keep watching me go down and up and down

postchorus
down and up and down and up
and down and up and down
down and up and down and up
and down and up and down

but i dont care because i know its jealousy
they see me on you like they think ill give it up
but i aint easy just not afraid to rush

prechorus
its alright to say you want it
get inside my dirty mind
burns like ice the way i bring it
again and again and again all night

chorus
the beat just dropped and the room got sexy
youre watching me like theres no one else around
i know you want me like kids want candy
so keep watching me go down and up and down

postchorus

i can almost feel my lace slipping off cause of the bass
i can tell thats what youre tripping on
tripping on tripping on
i can almost feel my lace slipping off cause of the bass
i can tell thats what youre tripping on
tripping on tripping on

chorus
the beat just dropped and the room got sexy
youre watching me like theres no one else around
i know you want me like kids want candy
so keep watching me go down and up and down
the beat just dropped and the room got sexy
