today is the day
the worst day of my life
you sulk until it hurts me
i dont know why
the cost of misery
is at an all time high
i keep it hidden
close to the surface inside

chorus
im learning to fall i cant hardly breathe
when im going down dont worry bout me
dont try this at home pretend you dont see
i dont wanna know that you know it should have been me

verse 2
could you be with him or was it just a lie
he doesnt get you like i do and you dont know why
you change your clothes and your hair
but i cant change your mind
oh im uninvited
so unrequited now

chorus
im learning to fall i cant hardly breathe
when im going down dont worry bout me
dont try this at home pretend you dont see
i dont wanna know that you know it should have been me
see boys like girls liveget tickets as low as 77you might also likebridge
words screaming in my head
why did you leave
and i cant stop dreaming
watching you and him
when it should have been
it should have been me
today is the day
the worst day of my life

chorus
im learning to fall i cant hardly breathe
when im going down dont worry bout me
dont try this at home pretend you dont see
i dont wanna know that you know it should have been me
whoa im learning to fall i cant hardly breathe
i dont wanna know that you know it should have been me
tell me that you know it should have been me
whoa dont try this at home pretend you dont see
i dont wanna know that you know it should have been me
whoa im learning to fall i cant hardly breathe
i dont wanna know that you know it should have been me
tell me that you know it should have been me
whoa dont try this at home pretend you dont see
i dont wanna know that you know it should have been meembed"
