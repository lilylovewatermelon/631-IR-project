as the reality of the times take hold
we come to terms with the sadness we bear
missing the times we never get to share
wohwoh wohwoh wohwoh
wohwoh wohwoh
just a few words because we care
still i got all the memories
wohwoh wohwoh wohwoh wohwoh

chorus
say when mi look up inna mi life its plain to see
that its never gonna be the same
take another step on towards my destiny
but the memories still remain
deep inna mi brain inna mi soul i hold the key
said its never gonna be the same
throughout all life and beyond all eternity
yo we keep burnin up the flame

verse 1
wish i could rewind all the hands of time and bring back
daddigon a great bredren of mine i
sit and remember all the things that we spoke of
all of the serious reasonings an all di tings we make jokes of
still cannot believe them took your life away
but those who pull the trigger cannot take away
the covenant the righteous have with jah jah
