so we let it go to start again
knowin now how all our best intensions
never lit the world on fire
and the lights illuminate the exit signs
over the wings the skies an open endless sea
crowding up surrounding me

chorus
and all of detroit waves
goodnight
spread out
beneath
me now
if i could if i could change
believe me
i would i would for you

verse 2
and when youre warm enough to share your sheets
cold enough to make it seem like i was only there long enough to disappear
ill still say your name to fall asleep
over and over a cynic sayin rosary
a liar living make believe

chorus
and all of detroit waves
goodnight
spread out
beneath
me now
if i could if i could change
believe me
i would cause i would

and detroit waves
and detroit waves
comes around around around
comes around around around
comes around around around again

chorus
and detroit waves goodnight
spread out
beneath me now
if i could
if i could change
believe me
i would
yes i would
