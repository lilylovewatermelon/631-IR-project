turn my mic up louder i got to say somethin
lightweights step it aside when we come in
feel it in your chest the syllables get pumpin
people on the street they panic and start runnin
words on looseleaf sheet complete comin
i jump in my mind and summon the rhyme im dumpin
healing the blind i promise to let the sun in
sick of the dark ways we march to the drummin
jump when they tell us that they wanna see jumpin
fuck that i wanna see some fists pumpin
risk something take back whats yours
say somethin that you know they might attack you for
cause im sick of being treated like i have before
like its stupid standin for what im standin for
like this wars really just a different brand of war
like it doesnt cater to rich and abandon poor
like they understand you in the back of the jet
when you cant put gas in your tank
these fuckers are laughin their way to the bank and cashin the check
asking you to have compassion and have some respect

refrain mike shinoda
for a leader so nervous in an obvious way
stutterin and mumblin for nightly news to replay
and the rest of the world watchin at the end of the day
in the livin room laughin like what did he say
you might also likechorus choir
amen amen
amen amen
amen

verse 2 mike shinoda
in my livin room watching but i am not laughin
cause when it gets tense i know what might happen
the world is cold the bold men take action
have to react or get blown into fractions
ten years old something to see
another kid my age drugged under a jeep
taken and bound and found later under a tree
i wonder if he had thought the next one could be me
do you see the soldiers that are out today
they brush the dust from bulletproof vests away
its ironic at times like this youd pray
but a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday
theres bombs on the buses bikes roads
inside your market your shops your clothes
my dad hes got a lot of fear i know
but enough pride inside not to let that show
my brother had a book he would hold with pride
a little red cover with a broken spine
on the back he handwrote a quote inside
when the rich wage war its the poor who die
refrain mike shinoda
meanwhile the leader just talks away
stutterin and mumblin for nightly news to replay
the rest of the world watchin at the end of the day
both scared and angry like what did he say

chorus choir
amen amen
amen amen
amen

outro mike shinoda  chester bennington choir
with hands held high into a sky so blue amen
as the ocean opens up to swallow you amen
with hands held high into a sky so blue amen
as the ocean opens up to swallow you amen
with hands held high into a sky so blue amen
as the ocean opens up to swallow you amen
with hands held high into a sky so blue amen
as the ocean opens up to swallow you amen
with hands held high into a sky so blue amen
as the ocean opens up to swallow you amen
with hands held high into a sky so blue amen
as the ocean opens up to swallow you amen48embed"
