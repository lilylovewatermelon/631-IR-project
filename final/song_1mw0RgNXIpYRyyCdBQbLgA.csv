baby you were the love of my life woah
maybe you dont know whats lost till you find it

verse 1
take a walk on sunday through the afternoon
we can always find somethin for us to do
we dont really like whats on the news but its on all the time
i take you with me every time i go away
in a hotel usin someone elses name
i remember back at jonnys place its not the same anymore

chorus
baby you were the love of my life woah
maybe you dont know whats lost till you find it
its not what i wantеd to leave you behind
dont know whеre youll land when you fly
but ​baby you were the love of my life

postchorus
its unfortunate ooh
just coordinates ooh

verse 2
i dont know you half as well as all my friends
i wont pretend that ive been doin everything i can
to get to know your creases and your ends
are they the same

​baby you were the love of my life woah
maybe you dont know whats lost till you find it
its not what i wanted to leave you behind
dont know where youll land when you fly
but ​baby you were the love of my life
