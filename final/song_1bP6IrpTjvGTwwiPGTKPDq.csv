im cold im ugly
im always confused by everything
i can stare into a thousand eyes
but every smile hides a boldfaced lie

verse 1 corey taylor
it itches it seethes it festers and breathes
my heroes are dead they died in my head
thin out the herd squeeze out the pain
something inside me has opened up again

prechorus corey taylor
thoughts of me exemplified all the little flaws i have denied
forget today forget whatever happened
every day i see a little more of overall deficiencies
im nothing short of being one complete catastrophe

chorus corey taylor  chris fehn
what the hell the hell
did i do to deserve all of this
what the hell the hell
did i do to deserve all of this

verse 2 corey taylor
i save all the bullets from ignorant minds
your insults get stuck in my teeth as they grind
way past good taste on our way to bad omens
i decrease while my symptoms increase

god what the fuck is wrong you act like you knew it all along
your timing sucks your silence is a blessing
all i ever wanted out of you was something you could never be
now take a real good look at what youve fucking done to me

chorus corey taylor  chris fehn
what the hell the hell
did i do to deserve all of this
what the hell the hell
did i do to deserve all of this

interlude
i haven’t got time for the living”
i havent got time for the living

give me any reason why id need you

verse 3 corey taylor
i keep my scars from prying eyes incapable of ever knowing why
somebody breathe ive got to have an answer
why am i so fascinated by bigger pictures better things
but i dont care what you think youll never understand me

chorus corey taylor  chris fehn
what the hell the hell
did i do to deserve all of this
what the hell the hell
did i do to deserve all of this
what the hell the hell
did i do to deserve all of this
what the hell the hell
did i do to deserve all of this
