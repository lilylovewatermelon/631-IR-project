now the futures staring at me
like a vision from the past
and i know these crumbs they sold me
theyre never going to last
though we know the culture war
we dont know what its for but
weve lived the southern strategy
you know its never going to last
so keep it in the past

chorus
these are different times that were living in
these are different times
now the kids are growing up so fast
paying for our crimes

verse 2
you left while i was sleeping
you said its down to me
oh ive read a little bible
you see what you want to see
oh we know the culture war
we dont know what its for but
weve lived your southern strategy
you know its never going to last
so keep that shit in the past

these are different times that were living in
cause these are different times
now the kids are growing up so fast
theyre paying for our crimes

verse 3
the dominos they never fell
but bodies they still burn
throw my hand into the fire
but still i never learn
will i ever learn

chorus
that these are different times
now the kids are growing up so fast
and paying for our crimes
well be soldiers for you mommy and daddy
in your culture war
well be soldiers for you mommy and daddy
but we dont know what its for

verse 4
were soldiers now in the culture war
were soldiers now but we dont know what its for
were soldiers now in the culture war
were soldiers now but we dont know what its for
so tell me whats it for
outro
you want it you got it heres your culture war
you want it now youve got it so tell me whats it forembed"
