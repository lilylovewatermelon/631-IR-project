verse 1
here i am on the
phone again and
awkward silence is on
the other end
i used to know the sound of a smile
in your voice
but right now but right now all i feel all i feel
is the pain of the fighting starting up again

prechorus
all the things we talked about
you know they stay on my mind on my mind
all the things we laugh about
theyll bring us through it every time after time after time

chorus
dont say a word i know you feel the same
just give me a sign say anything say anything
please dont walk away i know you wanna stay
if you just give me a sign say anything say anything

verse 2
some say that time changes
best friends can become strangers
but i dont want that no not for you
if you just stay with me we could make it through
so here we are again the same old argument
now im wondering if things will ever change yeah
when will you laugh again laugh like you did back when
wed make noise until 3 am and the neighbors would complain
