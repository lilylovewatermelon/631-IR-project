leaving the earth behind is impossible for us to do
we soon depart from the so called heaven
its not a secret anymore
everyone will soon understand

heaven
a place full of lies
heaven
heavens on standby

that is a space station on the planet terra
nothing could compare to this type of euphoria
use the ladder to reach level seven
go to sleep my beautiful children
we will be waiting for your cheerful eyes

heaven
a place full of lies
heaven
heavens on standby
a group of children
the galaxy extends
garden of imagination
you might also likereach that one bright light
lift off and youll live forever tonight

heaven
a place full of lies
heaven
heavens on standby
heaven
a place full of lies
heaven
heavens on standbyembed"
