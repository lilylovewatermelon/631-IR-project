six beers and five guys and if i remember right it was a
wednesday when we got our buzz on for second hand six pack
half smoked soft pack light it up boys take a drag
and when i fought that cough off everyone else thought i was so damn cool

prechorus
but my head was spinnin like a tiltawhirl
yeah man it really rocked my world

chorus
back when everything seemed just a little bit stronger
back when the weekend lasted a little longer
i cant tell you why they did but things seemed to never end back then
oh way back when when a little went a long way

verse 2
one girl 45 bucks was all it took that night
hit the steakhouse makeout and the movies way up in the back
credits roll on paceto make it all the way to second base
tried to play it cool like it was nothin new and she didnt have a clue

prechorus
but my head was spinnin like a tiltawhirl
yeah man she really rocked my world

back when things seemed just a little bit stronger
back when the weekend lasted a little longer
i cant tell you why they did things seemed to never end back then
oh way back when when a little went a long way

chorus
back when everything seemed just a little bit stronger
back when the weekend lasted a little longer
i cant tell you why they did but things seemed to never end back then
oh way back when when a little went a long long way
a long wayembed"
