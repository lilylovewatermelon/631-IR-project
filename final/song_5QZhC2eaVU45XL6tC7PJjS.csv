verse 1
speak it all the time speak it all the time
and ill never tell you what is mine
i dont know what it means but i see it its fine
its hardly any other it can borrow inside
think it all the time think it all the time
and i know that i tell you but boy its mine
i dont know what it is and that it is fine
its hardly any other it can borrow inside
oooh

interlude
being myself makes me feel like i cant touch the ground
here on the earth makes me feel like i cant get the sound
being myself makes me feel like i know who you are
cause boy you can be what the words
who you are what you are

chorus

sometimes you know that i wonder why up and down up and down
i dont want to dream but boy im lying upside down

chorus
being myself makes me feel like i dont know the trees
cause boy you can be what you what you want to be
