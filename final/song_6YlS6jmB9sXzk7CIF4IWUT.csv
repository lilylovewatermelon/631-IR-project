jet fuel in a coffee cup
lord knows i aint givin up
gonna take on the world today

sometimes its green green grass
other times it kicks my ass
halffull halfempty glass
dont matter either way

im gonna live the life that im gonna live
it aint what i thought it was
but it is what it is baby

this aint no rodeo
no dog and pony show
aint no rollercoaster ride
aint no highway
sure aint no river baby
its just my so called
just my so called life

some days i own this town
other days it shoots me down
as long as im still hangin round
im holdin on to hope
you might also likefaith is a powerful thing
chasin after the big brass ring
might be a pocket full of jingaling
but theres one thing that i know

ya just gotta keep keepin on doin like ya do
you look around when its said and done
and realize that its true baby

this aint no rodeo
no dog and pony show
aint no rollercoaster ride
aint no highway
sure aint no river baby
its just my so called
just my so called life

my so called

this aint no rodeo
no dog and pony show
aint no rollercoaster ride yeah
aint no highway
sure aint no river baby
its just my so called
just my so called life
my so calledembed"
