i was too young to see the truth
in my grandmas lap im drownin in her perfume
too naive to even care
bout the words she whispered while she brushed out my hair

prechorus
people gonna say
if you need a break someonell take your place
people gonna try
to tell you that youre fine with dollars in their eyes
just remember

chorus
dont let them fuck you honey no oh
dont let them try ooh
dont let them hurt you baby
just say recess im tired

verse 2
sittin in my room lookin at all ive done
everything i wanted has come to fruition
i should be happy but i cant get out my bed
stressin bout the voices screamin inside my head

prechorus
people gonna say
if you need a break someonell take your place
people gonna try
to tell you that youre fine with dollars in their eyes
just remember

bridge
where has my time gone
and my mind gone
i cant find euphoria
when i get upset
i think in my head
back to what she said

prechorus
people gonna say
if you need a break someonell take your place
people gonna try
to tell you that youre fine with dollars in their eyes
just remember

chorus
dont let them fuck you honey no oh
dont let them try ooh
dont let them hurt you baby
