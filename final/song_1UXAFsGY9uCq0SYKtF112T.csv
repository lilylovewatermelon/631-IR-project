i found viktor vaughn the next morning nearly frozen to death

verse viktor vaughn
party people know the name
vik with a k if its all the same
if it aint dont bother
told the little monster no i aint yo father
its uncle viktor shut the lights—im gettin dizzy
and close the door—cant you see ya momma busy
what a scoundrel
gassed up the town fool to go rob the crown jewel
hes like a lego megalomaniac
whos into electronic and techno a real brainiac
smackdab in the hip hop gold rush
v rather the old stuff
preferably the cold crush
it gets deeper than deepak chopra
except he keep a stack and some cheapass vodka
kneecap poppa only when he miss the chewy center
at least he always hits who he meant ta
remember he got a short fuse and bad temper
and a plan to claim emperor by december
member of the most playerhated race
who made this invaded place and stated with a straight face
if i cut her off i might miss her
but one of these days—right in the kisser
she probably get mad at me i bet ya
it gets her nowhere like flattery
she said where were you last saturday
and dont lie—we got your fingerprints off the battery
dont make me have to bling you
or see you in the street and doubleteam you with the emu
he told her when the gem paper tear off
itll probably tear her ear off before yall even square off
no good goodfornothin
kill her high for no frill like good will huntin
he feels out of place like bizarro
fiesty chick comes all out her face like charo
its vaughn hes back on
and you know he dont care like jimmy crack corn
wax off wax on
tried to raise taxes on cracks and black porn
another year passes
gone are the days when he used to wear glasses
now he wear contacts unfrozen caveman look over the contracts
these crews is too soft
he came to tear the roof off to get paid to goof off
they dont really wanna battle
all they gon do is get mad and go tattle
tell em a retard said it
he ripped up the we card sign and jetted
you gotta give us three card credit
even though at times he can be hardheaded
yeah the main thing cream by all means and harebrained schemes
the lords performance was flawless
he rocked with a crown and a bobby brown cordless
the broad he was with was gorgeous
the only flaw he saw was she cause a nigga more stress
not trying to diss her
but i used to know this sister that could put a whole fist in her
hell i made it momma
grammy for the worlds most celebrated rhymer
dead the drama scama four gs of pizzy from bahama
v the lead brown man
and never count your chickens before you read soundscan
what about mom and pops
they might as well cooperate and wait till the bomb drop
get more cabbage often time he wonder how they get so savage
v—not your average often time he wonder how they got so savageyou might also like4embed"
