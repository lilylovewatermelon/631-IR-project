never bite that hand that feeds you bro niggas greedy
never felt what it was like to be loved bitches be cheatin
finally got my hand on some paper im gettin even
main mans turned to a hater this shit is deep
over money youll turn your back on your brother
cause of money i dont know a bitch who really love me aint it funny
i could fill the east up with hunnids
make a freak fuck for nothin i dont beef much at all
still in the hood reminiscin bout my dawgs
every time my nigga call i show out for him
my bitch been in the house of course i been goin out more
the fuck i need clout for i cant be outscored
nigga i cant be outscored

verse 1
for all my niggas thats callin bitch im still ballin
fortythree for these and i play mike jordan
but i play em like stockton these bitches sellin like oxy
see a hatin nigga pop em gettin rich the only option
bitch i grew up with them doctors you lil niggas impostors
might invest a couple houses all in houston for my youngins
lookin for the pints of wocky
who aint gettin money stop it
i might up a million dollars
i done fucked a million bitches
bitch i got a million problems nah for real
next time a nigga diss us he gettin killed
bitches think they slick aint slick enough baby i see you
if you think you can do this shit without me then so be it
the rest of my time and money gettin spent on appeals
crib on the hills bad bitch who like to chill
doggybone on her nails free my fuckin uncle nell
million dollars on his bail dont give a fuck no more
real recognize real nah i dont trust no ho
real recognize real nah i dont trust

tell me if you with me my nigga or are you gon leave
main mans turned to a hater all for some cheese

chorus
never bite that hand that feeds you bro niggas greedy
never felt what it was like to be loved bitches be cheatin
finally got my hand on some paper im gettin even
main mans turned to a hater this shit is deep
over money youll turn your back on your brother
cause of money i dont know a bitch who really love me aint it funny
i could fill the east up with hunnids
make a freak fuck for nothin i dont beef much at all
still in the hood reminiscin bout my dawgs
every time my nigga call i show out for him
my bitch been in the house of course i been goin out more
the fuck i need clout for i cant be outscored
nigga i cant be outscored i cant be outscored

verse 2
you know a nigga came from the slums
whats crackin to the pastor still got faith from all the guns
handheld with a drum on a nigga if not three
it got one a nigga give em my all i dont stunt on my niggas
ayy tell me if you with me my nigga or you gon leave
why i never get the same love cause im me
and my drugs told me you could be somethin special on rece
how the fuck am i stressin thought i aint need you
back and forth on this tether it aint easy
momma please show me how to save my money
remember countin down ninety days im comin
chorus
never bite that hand that feeds you bro niggas greedy
never felt what it was like to be loved bitches be cheatin
finally got my hand on some paper im gettin even
main mans turned to a hater this shit is deep
over money youll turn your back on your brother
cause of money i dont know a bitch who really love me aint it funny
i could fill the east up with hunnids
make a freak fuck for nothin i dont beef much at all
still in the hood reminiscin bout my dawgs
every time my nigga call i show out for him
my bitch been in the house of course i been goin out more
