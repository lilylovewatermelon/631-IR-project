thinking about you
feat ayah marar
if i told you that this couldnt get better baby
and your heartbeat it lets me know you feel the same
i can hold you keep you safe until you fall asleep
never worried cause i can give you what you need
now everything i do is all for loving you
its not something that were used to
no other way to say i need you every day
and now im gonna change my ways
and its a part of you i never wanna lose
ill do anything you want me to
like any other day i know ill find a wayaaaay
and if ever im alone youll say
ill be thinking about you
ill be thinking about you
ill be thinking about you
ill be thinking about you
ill be thinking about you
in a moment i know that everything could change
and i know that my life would never be the same
youre the only one thats making sense to me
when i close my eyes youre the one i see
theres no other way i could ever be  without you babe
now everything i do is all for loving you
its not something that were used to
no other way to say i need you everyday
and now im gonna change my ways
and its a part of you i never wanna lose
ill do anything you want me to
like any other day i know ill find a wayaaaay
and if ever im alone youll say
ill be thinking about you
ill be thinking about you
ill be thinking about you
ill be thinking about you
ill be thinking about you
ill be thinking about you
ill be thinking about you
ill be thinking about youyou might also likeembed"
