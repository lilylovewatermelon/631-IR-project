verse 1 sam smith
you lift my heart up when the rest of me is down
you you enchant me even when youre not around
if there are boundaries i will try to knock them down
im latching on babe now i know what i have found

prechorus sam smith
i feel were close enough
i wanna lock in your love
i think were close enough
could i lock in your love baby

chorus sam smith
now ive got you in my space
i wont let go of you
got you shackled in my embrace
im latching on to you
now ive got you in my space
i wont let go of you
got you shackled in my embrace
im latching on to you
