bells around st petersburg when i saw you
i hope i get what you deserve
and this is where i findâ€”
smoke surrounds your perfect face and im falling
pushing a broom out into space
and this where i find a way

chorus anthony kiedis john frusciante
the stadium arcadium
a mirror to the moon mirror to the moon
well im forming and im warming warming to you
state of the art until the clouds come crashing
stranger things have happened
both before and after noon before and after noon
well im forming and im warming warming to you
pushing myself and no i dont mind asking now

verse 2 anthony kiedis with john frusciante
alone inside my forest room and its storming
i never thought id be in bloom but this is where i start
derelict days and the stereo plays for the all night crowd that it cannot phase
and im calling
tedious weeds that the media breeds but the animal gets what the animal needs
and im sorry
see red hot chili peppers liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likechorus anthony kiedis john frusciante

rays of dust that wrap around your citizen
kind enough to disavow and this is where i stand
