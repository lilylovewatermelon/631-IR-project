they tried their best to drag him out
of a courthouse down in montgomery
now they want to kick him out of school
and take him off our money
they can take those words off of paper and stone
but he aint gone no

chorus
he aint the leavin kind
hed never walk away
even from those who dont believe
and wanna leave him behind
he aint the leavin kind

verse 2
she stayed mad at him for a lot of years
for taking her husband
started losing her faith and thinking that
her life meant nothin
but when she looks at those kids
she raised all by herself
she knows she had some help
yeah she knows

chorus
he aint the leavin kind
hed never walk away
even from those who dont believe
and wanna leave him behind
he aint the leavin kind

no matter what you do
no matter where you go hes
always right there
with you

outro
even from those who dont believe
and wanna leave him behind
he aint the leavin kindembed"
