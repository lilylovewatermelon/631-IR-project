you get no younger from those colors in your hair
you teach your kids how they’re all young enough to fight
you talk about the answer
tell them they’re alright

change nothing
futures in
close the door
wear a name
be the same
take some more

lazy gun messed up my television fun
shoot the shotgun but the war is never won
who’s the enemy who’s sucking on my sun
i’m the only one left now you’ve taken all my fun

change nothing
futures in
close the door
wear a name
be the same
take some more

change nothing
futures in
close the door
wear a name
be the same
