she wont let me help her tie her shoes
no daddy i can do it myself
when she dont get her way
shell cross her arms and hold her breath
shes a handful shes a mess
diggin in the dirt in her princess dress
goes from tiny tornado to sleepin on my chest

chorus
god bless the boy
that melts the way i do
when she smiles at him the first time
hell be done oh hell be through
give him patiencе and kindness
and a heart thats full of her
and thе sense to know just what shes worth
cause aint nobody ever gonna be good enough
so god bless the boy she decides to love

verse 2
i hope his daddys teachin him
how to shake my hand and look me in the eye
and takin him fishin and bustin his butt
when he aint actin right
i hope hes in every prayer his mama prays
and learns to work for every dollar he gets
and has a sense of humor gonna need it for a girl like this

god bless the boy
that melts the way i do
when she smiles at him the first time
hell be done oh hell be through
give him patience and kindness
and a heart thats full of her
and the sense to know just what shes worth
cause aint nobody ever gonna be good enough
so god bless the boy she decides to love

chorus
god bless the boy
that melts the way i do
when she smiles at him the first time
hell be done oh hell be through
there aint nobody ever gonna be good enough
so god bless the boy she decides to love
oh god bless the boy she decides to love1embed"
