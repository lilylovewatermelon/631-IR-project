uh local boy makin fuckin global noise yes i came to destroy ayy
sold out shows round the globe twice now i feel like a fucking viceroy i do
never say no to whatever drugs i always enter the void
when it is time that i die make sure im buried in ftp corduroy
uicideboy most avoided most ignored i like their old stuff from before i do
who am i freud
im not who i thought i was anymore

refrain 1 lord of loneliness
im not like you
im not like you
i dont want the life you live im not
i dont want the wife and kids like you
i dont want to die and miss im not
all the things that sailed around me like you
i dont want the life you live im not
i dont want the fucking kids like you
i dont want to die and miss im not
all the things that sailed around me like you
i dont want the life you live im not
i dont want the fucking kids like you
i dont want to die and miss im not
all the things that sailed around me like you

verse 2 banny da pint drinker
ask me if im happy stupid motherfucking question hold up
no pity needed fightin grown men
i was seven was sad then
runnin drugs up on my bike you know i had a weapon
then them drugs became my obsession
nobody can say they gave me a fuckin thing yuh
got out from the mud now im a god hold up
born southside west bank livin legend
reborn yung christ this your fuckin day of reckonin
northside shawty off the porch sippin dip
lil lick wanna quit life overrated as shit
everyday eatin sticks gotta wash it down
and when i wash it down you know what its with bitch
see uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likerefrain 2 banny da pint drinker
i just want some happiness
to live a normal life again
sleep late and do nothin
talk with my cousin like he actually my cousin i said
i just want some happiness
to live a normal life again
sleep late and do nothin
talk to my cousin like he actually my cousin
