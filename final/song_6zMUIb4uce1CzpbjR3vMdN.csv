ooh i trusted you i trusted you
so sad so sad what love will make you do
all the things that we accept
be the things that we regret
so all of my ladies ladies

bridge
see when i get the strength to leave
you always tell me that you need me
and im weak cause i believe you
and im mad because i love you
so i stop and think that maybe
you can learn to appreciate me
then it all remains the same
that you aint never gonna change
never gonna change never gonna change

but im hurting while im with you
and though my heart cant take no more no more no more
i keep on running back to you

outro
baby why you hurt me leave me and desert me
boy i gave you all my heart and all you did was tear it up
looking out my window knowing that i should go
even when i pack my bags this something always holds me back26embed"
