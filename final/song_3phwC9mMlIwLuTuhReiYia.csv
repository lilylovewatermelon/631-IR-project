city of angels
land of god
a city of demons
land for us
in the city of angels
in the land of god
in the city of demons
thats the land for us

verse 1
la la the place of all places
drug use and doll faces can make or break you
i stood off by the wall and watched them skip the line
one night its gon be me inside
god damn it aint easy let me tell ya
account is overdrawn doin sessions in the valley every other night
connections only get you so far so far
but oh what a feeling how it feels
oh what a thrill you would kill
to look down from these hills put the life i knew behind but still
its dont feel for real cause i still aint ate a meal
my stomach growlin but im fuckin stylin
spent my last 20 drunk and uber ridin
aint nobody cuttin checks if you aint happy smilin
thats shit takes all the talent yeah
you might also likeprechorus
and it aint easy let me tell ya
account is overdrawn doin sessions in the valley every other night
and it goes on and on

chorus
yet im proud that im chasin something
its all in all better than bein broke bored and back at home
oh yes its all about makin somethin
thats all in all bigger than anything id ever known

verse 2
la la the sun can shine vicious
poor folks and tall riches and plus the bitches
i stood off by the wall and watched em pick a side
one day from now we all could die
god damn it aint easy let me tell ya
account is overdrawn doin sessions in the valley every other night
connections only get you so far so far
but oh what a feelin how it feels
oh what a thrill you would kill
to look down from these hills put the life i knew behind but still
this dont feel for real cause i still cant cut a deal
i want a rollie but its movin slowly
spent my last 20 buyin drinks for homies
and everybody want to know me just to say you owe me
this shit been gettin phony damn
prechorus
and it aint easy let me tell ya
account is overdrawn doin sessions in the valley every other night
that shit goes on and on

chorus
yet im proud that im chasin something oh
its all in all better than bein broke bored and back at home
oh yes its all about makin somethin
thats all in all bigger than anything id ever known7embed"
