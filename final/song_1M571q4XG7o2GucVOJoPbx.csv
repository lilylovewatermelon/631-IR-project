come on uhh

verse 1
ill tell you how the stories told
i always wanted so much more
and way on down the road
i caught a glimpse of the sunlight

prechorus 1
workin on my favorite thing
using every piece of me
drinking and smoking and fucking and making nothing

chorus
i didnt do it for money i didnt do it for money
i did it all for free i did it all for free
i did it all to fill the fucking hole inside of me
so far its working out
everythings different now so far

verse 2
think about what you know
forget about what youre told
see how your story grows
and let it come from your own mind
