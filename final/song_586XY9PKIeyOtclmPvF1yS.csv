up the staircase first door to your left
walls of white a window tenbyten
a treasure chest of everything ive ever known
safe inside my childhood home

prechorus
every record i have ever heard
i know every melody and every word
a little book of every dream i ever had
sleeping in that twin sized bed

chorus
all of the laughter
all the sleepless nights
waiting for ever aftеr
snow falling outside keeping on the night light

prechorus
cardboard boxes covеring the floor
guess i wont be living in here anymore
take down the posters of the pop stars on the wall
empty room it looks so small

chorus
all of the laughter
all the sleepless nights
waiting for ever after
snow falling outside keeping on the night light
see laufey liveget tickets as low as 53you might also likeinstrumental break

bridge
take down the posters of the pop stars on the wall
empty room it feels so small

chorus
all of the laughter
all the sleepless nights
waiting for ever after
snow falling outside keeping on the night lightembed"
