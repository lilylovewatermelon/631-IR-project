i am watching you watching the way you watch people do
the things that they do as you grow older learning
child understanding
bout the way that a soul on a soul on a soul
can be born can be beautiful
child understanding
i see the smile that lights your face
when you understand and realize
oh child in this world
strange how we forget the things that made us first smile

chorus
ho hey never stop learning
ho hey never stop wandering
babys growing older
oh my child never stop learning

verse 2
and im learning too
about the way that people do the things that they do
never meaning to hurt anyone
but we all do things that we regret and wish wed never done
oh child and there you are wandering through the garden of life
picking up flowers and eating them
and the world will smile when you smile
and we all have smiles inside of us
