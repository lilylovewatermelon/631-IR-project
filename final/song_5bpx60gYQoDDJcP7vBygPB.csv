used to dream of being a millionaire without a care
but if im seeing my dreams and you arent there
cause its over that just wont be fair darlin
id rather be a poor woman livin on the street no food to eat
cause i dont want no pie if i have to cry
cause its over when you said goodbye

chorus
all at once i had it all
but it doesnt mean anything now that youre gone
from afar seems i had it all
but it doesnt mean anything since youre gone

verse 2
now i see myself through different eyes its no surprise
what being alone would make you realize
when its over all in love is fair
i shoulda been there i shoulda been there i shoulda shoulda

chorus
all at once i had it all
but it doesnt mean anything now that youre gone
from afar seems i had it all
but it doesnt mean anything since youre gone

i know i pushed you away
what can i do that will save our love
take these material things
they dont mean nothing its you that i want

chorus
all at once i had it all
but it doesnt mean anything now that youre gone
from afar seems i had it all
but it doesnt mean anything since youre gone
i shoulda been there i shoulda been there i shoulda shoulda
all at once i had it all
but it doesnt mean anything now that youre gone
from afar seems i had it all
but it doesnt mean anything since youre gone4embed"
