i like bein alone
come around here spend plenty of time on your own
cause the city aint kind
on the people who sign up for judgin but cant take no
complacent
this aint a place to be makin friends they all got agendas
these eyes on your back fangs in your neck
thinkin of venom venom fienin for a taste of this shit
seem so thirsty smell fresh meat in the air blood on the floor
so the real test after breakfast
well see who will still be here

prechorus
this pressure aint for everybody
weighing so heavy on my body body yeah

chorus
spine shivers eyes met
head in it heart set yeah
gold on my mind yeah

iceice drippin cold sweat
ice drippin cold sweat
ice drippin cold sweat
ice drippin cold sweat

verse 3
wish i always got my way
time for me to accept defeat when my hands are tied
like to dine in the lights with you tonight
dont trip everything will end up just fine
these summers they aint the same
these lovers they aint the game
these feelings they dont mean nothing
these ceilings cant keep the pain
explanations you say i deserve it
why after all this time im finally worth it
aint it funny how power comes with money
and how now im out here poppin
they come back like theyre an option
man this shit is hella scummy
they claimin that they love me
cause they realize that my time is finally comin
they know it
cause my night is young moon is high
and the stars are all aligned42embed"
