its horrible
one little evening alone home
end up with carpal tunnel syndrome
and here i am known for giving heavy back aches
grown and living off of little debbie snack cakes
supposed to be checking emails
all i got is messages from ass naked females
i dont know a jenny
she said its free and i wont owe her a penny
and thats the last time i saw her
but thousands of more horrors on online gomorrah
and sodom they got em with they curls out
and they got a better sales pitch than the girl scouts
i wonder what i owe her
for a whole box of caramel coconut samoa
nite nite uh okay honey sweet dreams
now its time to get serious like peek freans
a metal handful wipe it on the quilt
wife wake up and im killt over spilt milk
locked in looking at your picture
fully clothed winter and im right there with ya
thinking about the last time i split your wishbone
a man could only wish you do the same til he get home
fat chance at least he get snacks
thatd have to do til a brother get back
until then smack oneeyed jack
and hope one of his peoples can hook him with a tripack
thats three different flavors
chocolate vanilla and strawberry wafers
acting all hard bout to get beat up
ill show him what time it is once i get this sheet up
soon as he fell off the beat down
all i hear is 13th cell put the sheet down
damn co what the hell do she know
besides the fact she wanna get dug out on the dlow
a workaholic with a fountain in the ink pen
out in the mountains and i stopped drinking again
in the wee hours hes gotten farther
needing three showers being hot and bothered
the wiz with her legs bent pregnant
god bless the day she wondered where her egg went
i need a l its hard to drink without it
and could use some kookies but trying not to think about it
watching bet on jazz for knowledge on file
every other commercial college hoes gone wild
soft batch i prefer the other bunch
like we got for lunch chocolate fudge butter crunch

verse 2
he dont mess with the ritz bits
wheat thins saltines or triscuits
matzos or cheezits
catch sugar fits every time that he sees
chips ahoy double chocolate chunk
something with the bubble and the junk in the trunk
even the oreos no matter what weather
always kept em dipped in milk and stuck together
in the game hes shameless
even uses a code name famous amos
its cheaper than a short stay at the days inn
and good like 25 cent oatmeal raisin
give a hand to who invented the camera
skip past the graham animal and grandmaâ€™s
shh make sure she dont wake from her dream chill
or get caught with a handful of cream fill

interlude
oh honey what are you doing thats so nasty
it might seem ill
ew go wash your hands no
kookies
get out of here
