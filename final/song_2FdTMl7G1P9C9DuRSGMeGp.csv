would you lay with me in a field of stone
if my needs were strong would you lay with me
should my lips grow dry would you wet them dear
in the midnight hour if my lips were dry

refrain
would you go away to another land
walk a thousand miles through the burning sand
wipe the blood away from my dying hand
if i give myself to you

verse 2
will you bathe me with me in the stream of life
when the moon is full will you bathe with me
will you still love me when im down and out
in my time of trial will you stand by me

refrain
would you go away to another land
walk a thousand miles through the burning sand
wipe the blood away from my dying hand
if i give myself to you

verse 3
would you lay with me in a field of stone
if my lips grow dry would you wet them dear
would you bathe with me in the stream of life
will you still love me when im down and out

would you lay with me in a field of stone
when the moon is full will you lay with me1embed"
