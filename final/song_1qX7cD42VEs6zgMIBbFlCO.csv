you cant say i didnt warn ya
when you chased her out to california
then she went and married someone else
it didnt really matter where you been
we always pick back up again
make our way on down that shelf

chorus
nothin new under the neon
same old stories girls and glory
and the same old blue buzz that we lean on
just drinking down loving
life aint nothin new under the neon

verse 2
remember when you lost your father
we blew threw a couple hundred dollars
missin him reminiscing him toasting his name
i never saw my name in lights but i still play here on friday nights
yeah i guess somethings never change

chorus
nothin new under the neon
same old stories girls and glory
and the same old blue buzz that we lean on
just drinking down loving
life aint nothin new under the neon
see midland liveget tickets as low as 57you might also likewho knows when well be back here
how many miles how many years
how many laughs how many beers weve both been through

chorus
nothin new under the neon
same old stories girls and glory
and the same old blue buzz that we lean on
just drinking down loving
life aint nothin new under the neonembed"
