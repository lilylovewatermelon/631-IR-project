faded levis worn out chucks
twenty in my pocket feels like a million bucks
blueeyed beauty lean in to me
we got our own show in the back row
missed the whole damn movie

chorus
american nights one headlight
cutting down main street in the dark
muscle shoals muscle cars
earning our stripes underneath these stars

verse 2
blue ribbon bottles big block throttles
all night if you wanna gonna make it last
a little taste of freedom a little small town dreaming
no need to preach no need to shout we believe in

chorus
american nights one headlight
cutting down main street in the dark
muscle shoals muscle cars
earning our stripes underneath these stars
american nights yeah

pray the morning dont come
and these colors dont run
stay up and stay all
american nights

chorus
american nights one headlight
cutting down main street in the dark
muscle shoals muscle cars
earning our stripes underneath these stars
american nights american nights

twenty in my pocket feels like a million bucks
