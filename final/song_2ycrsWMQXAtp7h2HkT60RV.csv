i never ask you where youre goin
ive never asked you where youve been
ive never called and checked your story
you stayed out with all your friends
ive never tried to catch you lyin
i didnt want to know the truth
id rather go on lovin blind girl
than go on lovin without you

chorus
i wish i didnt know now what i didnt know then
i wish i could start this whole thing over again
im not sayin that you could ever be true
i just dont want to know how it ends
youd still have my heart in the palm of your hand
id still look like a fool in front of your friends
yeah i wish somehow i didnt know now
what i didnt know then

verse 2
ive always said what i dont know
couldnt hurt as bad as leavin you
turns out i knew what i was thinkin
it aint an easy thing to do
well i guess i should be goin
i sure found out too much to stay
please dont say youre sorry
i might wait another day

i wish i didnt know now what i didnt know then
i wish i could start this whole thing over again
im not sayin that you could ever be true
i just dont want to know how it ends
youd still have my heart in the palm of your hand

yeah i wish somehow i didnt know now
what i didnt know then
