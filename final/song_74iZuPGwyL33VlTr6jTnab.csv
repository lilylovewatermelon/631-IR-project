that arizona sky
burnin in your eyes
you look at me and babe i wanna catch on fire
it’s buried in my soul
like california gold
you found the light in me that i couldn’t find

chorus
so when im all choked up and i cant find the words
every time we say goodbye baby it hurts
when the sun goes down
and the band wont play
ill always remember us this way

verse 2
lovers in the night
poets tryna write
we dont know how to rhyme but damn we try
but all i really know
youre where i wanna go
the part of me thats you will never die

chorus
so when im all choked up and i cant find the words
every time we say goodbye baby it hurts
when the sun goes down
and the band wont play
ill always remember us this way
