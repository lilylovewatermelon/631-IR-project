my love my love dont come easy babe
im nothing easy to please and i dont fall easily
summer came and went and i seen you in your bikini
sitting pool side with your cigarettes
they aint never seem sexy at all oh oh
i can read you from head to toe head to pedicure
youre just a distraction babe
looking for a reaction babe
march was good and the sex was great
but i need someone more official babe
youre just a distraction babe
and you know know know
yes you know
thats why thats why

hook
my love my love dont come easy babe
my love my love dont come easy babe
dont come easy

verse 2
whats up with you after manyamoons girl
why do you act like im sexist or something just for calling you sexy
even though were not together i still find you sexy
its like a wolf hollering at the moon every time that i see ya
girl youre bad and you break hearts for a living
you dont smile and you say youre in love but thats why i dont love
you might also likehook
my love my love dont come easy babe
my love my love dont come easy babe
it dont come easy

outro
whats up with you after manyamoons girl
why do you act like im sexist or something just for calling you sexy
even though were not together i still find you sexy9embed"
