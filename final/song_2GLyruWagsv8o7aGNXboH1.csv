mama i dont have time for dancing

verse 1
thats just gonna have to wait a while
aint got time for messing around
and its not my style
this old town can slow you down
people taking the easy way
but i know exactly where im going
im gettin closer and closer every day

chorus
and im almost there im almost there
people down here think im crazy
but i dont care
trials and tribulations ive had my share
there aint nothing gonna stop me now
cause im almost there

verse 2
i remember daddy told me
fairy tales cant come true
you gotta make em happen
it all depends on you
so i work real hard each and every day
now things for sure are going my way
just doin what i do
look out boys im comin through

and im almost there im almost there
people gonna come here from everywhere
and im almost there
im almost there

outro
theres been trials and tribulations
you know ive had my share
but ive climbed a mountain ive crossed a river
and im almost there
im almost there
im almost there9embed"
