i get a thrill outta playin with fire
cause you hold your life when you hold that flame
i get a kick outta thunder and lightnin
and tearing through the night hollerin your name

verse 2
i get a laugh outta starin at darkness
and wondering why people live in the light
i drive fast and i rumble the hardest
i dont feel alive if i aint in the fight

verse 3
i cant sleep when theres something to do
you spend your whole life dreamin and you wake up dead
its a long night can i spend it with you
cause youre ohso pretty when you stand on the edge

chorus 1
oh little darlin dont you look charmin
here in the eye of a hurricane
real or imagined what does it matter
oh come inside can i get you to stay

chorus 2
oh little darlin dont you like fallin down
through the sky like a divin plane
real or imagined what does it matter
now come inside can i get you to stay
see lord huron liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likebridge
what is life
only visions
when i die
im comin right on back for you
who am i
an illusion
would i lie
im comin right on back for you

chorus 1
oh little darlin dont you look charmin
here in the eye of a hurricane
real or imagined what does it matter
oh come inside can i get you to stay

chorus 3
oh little darlin dont you get lonely
look in my eyes gimme one more day
real or imagined what does it matter
now come inside can i get you to stay1embed"
