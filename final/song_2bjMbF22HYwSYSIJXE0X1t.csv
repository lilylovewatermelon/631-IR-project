we are the lost
the ones forgotten
and this time
the future is ours
its in our hands

verse 1
were the tear in your eyes
were the blood in your veins
were the beat of your hearts
were the sweat on your face
were the ones that you chase
were the promise that you made
were the voice in your head
were the lies that you said
were the kids that you pushed away

chorus
we are
we are the lost
the ones forgotten
and this time
the future is ours
its in our hands
we are one

were the pride of your lives
were the light shining deep in your eyes
were the choice that you made
were the smile on your face
when you sleep at night
were the best thing you had
but you left us behind
were the kids that you pushed away

chorus
we are
we are the lost
the ones forgotten
and this time
the future is ours
its in our hands
we are one
one

were the pain that you feel
were the scars that dont heal
were the tear in your eyes
were the reason you cry
were the voice in your head
were the lies that you said
were the best thing you had
but you pushed us away
chorus
we are the lost
the ones forgotten
and this time
the future is ours
its in our hands
we are we are the lost
the ones forgotten
and weve got nothing to lose
together we stand up tall
we are oneembed"
