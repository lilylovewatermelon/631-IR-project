give me a sad song that i can hold on to
anything to set me free
just one big cry big tears in my eyes
to wash you away from me

verse 1
i need a night all by myself
got some things i need to work out
i got this fever that just wont break
i got some troubles i got to shake
give me give me

chorus

verse 2
i know i know im gonna have to cleanse my soul
if im ever gonna get back on my way
one night one night one dark and lonely night
and then will come a brighter day
just give me one night one night one dark and lonely night
and then will come a brighter day
