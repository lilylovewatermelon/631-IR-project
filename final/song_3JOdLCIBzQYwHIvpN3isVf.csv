where is your boy tonight
i hope he is a gentleman
maybe he wont find out what i know
you were the last good thing about this part of town

verse 1
when i wake up
im willing to take my chances on
the hope id forget that you hate him more than you notice
i wrote this for you for you soâ€¦

prechorus
you need him i could be him
i could be an accident but im still trying
and thats more than i can say for him

where is your boy tonight
i hope he is a gentleman
maybe he wont find out what i know
you were the last good thing about this part of town
