you used to get it in your fishnets
now you only get it in your night dress
discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
landed in a very common crisis
everythings in order in a black hole
nothing seems as pretty as the past though
that bloody marys lacking in tabasco
remember when you used to be a rascal

chorus
oh the boys a slag the best you ever had
the best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams
werent as daft as they seem arent as daft as they seem
my love when you dream them up

verse 2
flicking through a little book of sex tips
remember when the boys were all electric
now when shes told shes gonna get it
im guessing that shed rather just forget it
clinging till im getting sentimental
said she wasnt going but she went still
likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
was it a mecca dauber or a betting pencil

oh the boys a slag the best you ever had
the best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams
werent as daft as they seem not as daft as they seem

oh flo where did you go

youre falling about
you took a left off last laugh lane
just sounding it out
but youre not coming back again
youre falling about
you took a left off last laugh lane
you were just sounding it out
but youre not coming back again

outro
you used to get it in your fishnets
falling about
now you only get it in your night dress
discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
you took a left off last laugh lane
landed in a very common crisis
everythings in order in a black hole
you were just sounding it out
is anything as pretty in the past though
that bloody marys lacking in tabasco
youre not coming back again
remember when you used to be a rascal
