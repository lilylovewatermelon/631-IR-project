verse 1
yeah i wrote this in my downtime but sometimes
i feel like i do better under pressure in the crunch time
when i got deadlines
and radio wont give me no airtime
they telling me to wait for my time
they said that last time
im asking myself like why cant i get an email back
or catch a break like halftime
this next line dont even have to have the same scheme
because if theres one thing i learned
its that the truth dont have a punchline
yeah okay i rest my case
whats a kid like me do without a dream to chase
whats the right girl in the wrong time and place
and whats a baseball game if you dont got home plate
its pointless
so what im tryna say
is that today im just chilling and enjoying my way
cause i learned its not always about the top of the mountain
because the memories are made from the journey we take
its like that that that

hook
now its 1111 but only eight in la
we aint been there
but baby we gon make it one day
you gotta good head on your shoulders
but they got chips and scars all over
but for now we in the middle of nowhere
and for once i could say that i dont care
cause up to now i aint been living it right
ill find the answers tomorrow man im just living tonight
its like that
you might also likeits like that
oh its like that its like that its like that its like that its like that
oh come on
come and live with me come on come on come on
come and live with me its like that
yeah i love you like that

verse 2
in the mean time lets unwind if its okay
man imma go and switch it up this time yeah yeah yeah
you know what
they must heard that i was relishing the moment
wont you please catch up
i aint never been to cali
but im working hard all four seasons
like my name was frank valli
honestly i dont know if this is gonna pan out
but i dont really give a fuck
if its all planned out
but watch your mouth young man
its what i heard right then
my facebook is just filled with dont forget me whens
but im so far away from that
that i just message them back
like god damn it man please dont ever say that again
and they stop
yeah im no director but these people around me
just keep on giving me props
i got the staged set now i gotta finish the plot
and the truth dont have a punchline in case you forgot
its like that
