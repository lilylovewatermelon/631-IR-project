arent you somethin to admire
cause your shine is somethin like a mirror
and i cant help but notice
you reflect in this heart of mine
if you ever feel alone and
the glare makes me hard to find
just know that im always
parallel on the other side

prechorus
cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
i can tell you theres no place we couldnt go
just put your hand on the glass
ill be tryna pull you through
you just gotta be strong

chorus
cause i dont wanna lose you now
im lookin right at the other half of me
the vacancy that sat in my heart
is a space that now you hold
show me how to fight for now
and ill tell you baby it was easy
comin back here to you once i figured it out
you were right here all along
refrain
its like youre my mirror oh
my mirrors staring back at me  oh
i couldnt get any bigger oh
with anyone else beside me oh
and now its clear as this promise
that were making
two reflections into one
cause its like youre my mirror oh
my mirrors staring back at me staring back at me

verse 2
arent you somethin an original
cause it doesnt seem merely assembled
and i cant help but stare cause
i see truth somewhere in your eyes
ooh i cant ever change without you
you reflect me i love that about you
and if i could i
would look at us all the time

prechorus
cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
i can tell you theres no place we couldnt go
just put your hand on the glass
im here tryna pull you through
you just gotta be strong
