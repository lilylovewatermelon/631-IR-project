you can take the throne
body glows like gold
beating hearts locked close
without you time moves slow

prechorus
do you think that i could stay
cause if i leave then ill complain
i know this feelings not a crime
you said you feel it all the time

chorus
but if you have to go away again
i just dont see you enough
i wish i saw you enough
its something in the way i feel your skin
i just dont see you enough
i wish i saw you enough

verse 2
if you saw me every morning would you feel less important
is that too much of forcing
cause i dont wanna be much
i love the way that we touch

before youd ever mention
that you got timе here to stay
is that too much for your brain

chorus
but if you had to go away again
i just dont see you enough
i wish i saw you еnough
its something in the way i feel your skin
i just dont see you enough
i wish i saw you enough

instrumental break

chorus
but if you had to go away again
i just dont see you enough
i wish i saw you enough
but if you had to go away again

i just dont see you enough
i wish i saw you enough1embed"
