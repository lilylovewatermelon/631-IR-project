big town
synthetic apparitions of not being lonely
look hes having a breakdown
oh what a letdown a shame i think he might die
and now shes dancing enthralling i guess i gotta wait my turn
i said dont fall in love with the moment
she said ive got a lot to learn

prechorus
and you know im in love with this city
but the green is turning brown
and i just look pathetic now

chorus
if she likes it cause we just dont eat
and were so intelligent shes american
if she says ive got to fix my teeth
then shes so american shes american
and if she likes it cause we just dont eat
and were socially relevant shes american
if she says ive got to fix my teeth
then shes so american shes american

verse 2
shes inducing sleep to avoid pain
and i think shes got a gun divinely decreed and custom made
she calls on the phone like the old days expecting the world
and dont fall in love with the moment
and think youre in love with the girl
see the 1975 liveget tickets as low as 9you might also likeprechorus
theres no more water in this city
but be careful or youll drown
you think youve got it figured out

chorus
if she likes it cause we just dont eat
and were so intelligent shes american
if she says ive got to fix my teeth
then shes so american shes american
and if she likes it cause we just dont eat
and were socially relevant shes american
if she says ive got to fix my teeth
then shes so american shes american

bridge
well your face has got a hold on me
but your brain is proper weird
are you feeling the same
you just keep nodding at me looking vacant

breakdown
she likes it cause we just dont eat
and were so intelligent
shes american shes american
she says ive got to fix my teeth
then shes so american
shes american
chorus
if she likes it cause we just dont eat
and were so intelligent shes american
if she says ive got to fix my teeth
then shes so american shes american
if she likes it cause we just dont eat
and were socially relevant shes american
if she says ive got to fix my teeth
then shes so american shes american38embed"
