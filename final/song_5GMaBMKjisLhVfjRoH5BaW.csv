ahone two three four

verse 1
who needs a house up on a hill
when you can have one on four wheels
and take it anywhere the wind might blow
you dont ever have to mow the yard
just hang a map and throw a dart
and pray to god the engine starts and go

chorus 1
water and electric
and a place to drain the septic
any koa is aok as long as im with you
so come on hitch your wagon
to the living room im draggin
if i cant bring you to my house ill bring my house to you

verse 2
parking lots and county lines
and countin mile marker signs
where the buffalo and antelope all roam
greetings from niagara falls
one more postcard for the wall
off in our own sweet home away from home

water and electric
and a place to drain the septic
any koa is aok as long as im with you
so come on hitch your wagon
to the living room im draggin
if i cant bring you to my house ill bring my house to you

bridge
in washington in idaho
in oregon and away we go
to tennessee and arkansas
no we wont stop til weve seen em all
til weve seen em all

chorus 2
so what else could you ask for
you dont even need a passport
to see the whole world from our living room
so come on hitch your wagon
to the happiness im draggin
if i cant bring you to my house ill bring my house to you
if i cant bring you to my house ill bring my house to you

outro
it dont matter where we go
well never be alone
anywhere beside you is a place that ill call home
it dont matter where we go
well never be alone
anywhere beside you is a place that ill call home2embed"
