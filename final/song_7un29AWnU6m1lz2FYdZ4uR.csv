oh its a cold world
dont let yourself be corrupted
be yourself lifes second hand smoke

verse 1 sage the gemini
huh lifes second hand smoke thoughts of being a criminal
far from being a doctor my opera is singing kill these fools
around here its just me buddy ricky and cameron
man we aint wanna hurt nobody if anything scare them
eleven by the street code outside of the screen doors
where all the niggas sell pounds next week riding in three lows
carrying two hundred not dollars thousands
no time for restrooms use the side of the houses
bring a pack to big homie sit down lets count it
aw there go by something for your housing
dont spend it up live it up somebody rob you just give it up
dont be selfish appoint your niggas
find something to split it up

chorus eric bellinger
aint even got to smoke to get faded
you aint gotta drink to say you made it
ohnana second hand smoke

i aint worried about you im a do what i like
my niggas keep it real we aint living the life
aint fucking with that second hand smoke
aint no time for the second hand smoke

yeah yeah lifes a second hand smoke thoughts of being a criminal
money needs i should find a few girls and start pimping them
how should i ask when i do will they handle it
never mind i go to jail like pimping and pondering uh
and i cant do the pen unless its record deals
i made a hit at eighteen and its the record still
follow up the real hits be bottled up
used to sneak soda in mcdonalds cups
and still never got enough huh

chorus eric bellinger
