actually went down
so foolishly i would sit aside
hoping you’d come around
so i stand in my place
with a strong poker face
mending my own mind
no thinking things would
slip from our grip
not looking at the signs
i’ve got nothing left to say
but where was i when all this changed
it happened so quickly
i swear it was meant to be
but when you look at reality
you’re gone and
i’m trying to stay standing
you put air on this fire
and now we’re really burning
you know how we work
we just keep on learning
it’s never whose best or who’s worst
who comes up with ideas last or first
at times i feel so empty inside
you still stand with your pride
who saw it coming
who saw it coming
who saw it coming
but couldn’t stand up to face it all
who saw it coming
standing up to make the callyou might also likeembed"
