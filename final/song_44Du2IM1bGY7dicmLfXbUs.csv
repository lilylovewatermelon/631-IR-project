yeah i never really
talk about dick that i wanna give you or places i wanna get to
neck grab hair grab
arch back heart attack cardiac
i need it nasty like like evil angel like vivid
you know nasty like how they give it
you know i need you to be open like kais kitchen
that pussy kinda sound like waves hittin kshh
soothin keep it right there no movin
make my way around the baseses
i wanna take you to oasises
bein honest i dont really know what patience is
ayy freaky like the red leather michael
zombie revival this aint like you
this that new you this aint high school hi
i like best when youre fresh faced and no foundation
willin and ready for the takin
earthshatterin groundbreakin
headscarf for after our relations
no judgment is our arrangement
make that face up if you dare
but just be prepared that i am gonna cause that lipstick to smear
and the mascara tears to run down
i always need a glass of wine by sundown
i always get your ass over here somehow
i hope that the apocalypse is the only thing that doesnt come now we’re one now
see drake liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likeinterlude
did somebody…
whod they say that baby look like

cashed out my neck is frozen
careful when were mixin potion
slashin like guns n roses

to deal with you the way you like
the way you like it woo woo woo woo
to deal with you the way you like
the way you like it woo woo woo woo
cashed out my neck is frozen
careful when were mixin potion
slashin like guns n roses
you got options but i been chosen
to deal with you the way you like
the way you like it yeah15embed"
