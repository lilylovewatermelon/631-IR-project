you are my fairytale
dont you wanna stay
you are my fairytale
i hope that you dont run away

verse 1
now we should run away
i can now hear them tapping on the ground
where do we wanna go
i know an ambush where we wont be found

verse 2
so we went to the place honey
listening to the allnightsingingsweetmelodiesfairy trees
and there is no better place to be
and so we took off to the moon
and all the shining lights in the night

chorus
you are my fairytale
dont you wanna stay
you are my fairytale
i hope that you dont run away
