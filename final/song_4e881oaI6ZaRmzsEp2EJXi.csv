spaghetti western swing

they rode in from the east west
they rode in from the west on clydesdales
no you got it all wrong oh what do you know
whos tellin this story i am settle down oh
many a good cowboy has told a story about mama luigis restaurant
oh the italian food
or was it a chinese restaurant
they ordered spaghetti
you know theres nothin like western spaghetti
and pasta primavera but
they were out of spaghetti
then there was an argument
and trouble ensued ooh

so now theyre being chased
thats not how it happened at all
do you want it to be interesting or do you want it to be true
so far its neither

and shots were fired
hurry up theyre gainin on us
softer george its more effective
hurry up theyre gainin on us
see brad paisley liveget tickets as low as 55you might also likeshoot low boys theyre riding shetland ponies
not you jimmy you shoot normal

and they lived happily ever after
tune in next time for the kung pao buckaroo buffet
yeahembed"
