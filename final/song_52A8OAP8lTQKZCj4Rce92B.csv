intro
uh

verse 1
since a youngin always dreamed of gettin rich
look at me my nigga
fantasize about a white picket fence
with some trees my nigga
used to want a pathfinder with some tints
thats all i need my nigga
throw some 20s on that bitch and get it rinsed
but now i see my nigga
that the worlds a lot bigger ever since
picked up the paper
and they say my nigga eddie caught a body im convinced
anybody is a killer all you gotta do is push em to the limits
fuck being timid in the civic
politicin with the pushers and the pimps
im tryna write a story can i get a glimpse
yeah can i get a glimpse
chorus 1
last night i had a bad dream bad dream bad dream
that i was trapped in this city
then i asked is that really such a bad thing bad thing bad thing
they robbin niggas on the daily
can you blame a nigga that aint never had things
whats the value of a thing guess not
last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like—
ugh nice watch run it
hands in the air now hands in the air run it
hands in the air now hands in the air run it
hands in the air now hands in the air
hands in the air now hands in the air

outro
father forgive me for my childish ways
i look outside and all the clouds are gray
i need your hands to take me miles away
your wish is my command my command my command
but before you go ive got to warn you now
whatever goes up surely must come down
and youll get your piece but know peace wont be found
so why just take me man take me man take me man
your wish is my command my command my command375embed"
