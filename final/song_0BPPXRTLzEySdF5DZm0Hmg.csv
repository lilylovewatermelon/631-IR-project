woo
we on a wave that luxury flow
and i dont watch what i say but i say what i know
dont wait on me its too late for me
i walk with that step cali air what i breathe
and ive been drinkin all night so please excuse me
if i say what i mean blame it on the hennessy
cant stop wont stop baby uh

chorus
its too late for me
i poured it too strong now baby im gone
its too late for me

its too late late late late

verse 2
designer on me im covered in that gucci
is there tension in the air or baby is that just me
too strong im gone yeah
let me switch this flow up real quick
gogetter v for vendetta
whatever i just do better
trendsetter search for the cheddar
no pressure float like a feather
smooth dude big moves
big trees like snoop
now im back now im back
let me bring it back to the track oh yeah
