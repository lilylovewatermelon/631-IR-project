verse 1
she said i know i know i know your music
i prefer your old shit to your new shit
that song with pitbull it was kinda cool
but after that you went left and i couldnt fuck with you
well damn couldnt help but appreciate
that she was bold enough to say this to my face
she even went as far to give me her twitter name
she said i tweeted you and told you the same thing
but she said i never thought id meet
and you cuter in real life than on tv
you a celebrity
you could have any girl you want
what the hell you want with me

chorus
i told her baby there is a difference
between what you really want and what you can get
i can have anything but i dont want just anything
i want you i i want you yeah


verse 2
i said you got you got you got me twisted
what my celebrity got to do with it
just cause i can have dont mean i want them chicks
i take quality over quantity any day you dig
she said im hood though neyo
and i know you be on your goody good though neyo
get ratchet yes i could though neyo
mess up your image i probably would though neyo
i said you dont scare me
the word gentleman starts with g
she said you a celebrity

what you want with me

verse 3
yeah yeah
now so she sat there starin at me like she wasnt sure
questionin my intentions why and what for
thinkin he can have actresses singers or models galore
i work in a nail shop every day in that bitch from 8 until 4
shawtys a rose that grows through the cracks in the concrete
her mothers body but her brothers knowledge of the street
kick all you beautiful lies shawty aint goin for em
she type stubborn like her daddy but she dont know him
got me feelin like i aint good enough
i aint a dboy or a thug so i aint hood enough
or maybe its the other way around and shawtys self esteem is down
not good enough to wife but good enough to fuck nah mama
im really tryna get to know
whats under your guard and not just whats under your clothes
you feel me
and dont concern yourself with status i dont
it aint about what i can have its about what i want you dig
chorus
baby there is a difference
between what you really want and what you can get
i can have anything but i dont want just anything
i want you i i want you yeah1embed"
