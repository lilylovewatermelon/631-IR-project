tell me your name
i dont ever wanna let you down
no i just wanna kiss your lips in the rain
you know ill pull you closer if you start to drown
drown own
then my hand meets your thighs
with that look in your eyes i can never forget
then its back to my room
what a wonderful view love
and thats when i said no

chorus mitchel cave
roxanne
why you wanna leave me on my own now
roxanne
i think we should go but im not sure enough
roxanne

verse 2 mitchel cave
ill drive us somewhere far away from out of town
now im falling deep within your eyes like cocaine
im hoping that youll be there when im coming down
down own
and girl you know that you gotta believe me
now now
and girl you know that we have to try
no say
