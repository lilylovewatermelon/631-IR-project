now you say youre lonely
you cried the whole night through
well you can cry me a river
cry me a river
i cried a river over you

verse 2
and now you say youre sorry
for being so untrue
well you can cry me a river
mm cry me a river
cause i cried a river over you

bridge
you drove me
nearly out of my head
while you never shed a tear babe
remember
i remember all that you said
you told me love was too plebeian
told me you were through with me

verse 3
and now you say you love me
well just to prove that you do
why dont you cry me a river
cry me a river
cause i cried a river over you over you
you might also likerefrain
you say you love me but you lie

verse 4
now you say you love me
well just to prove that you do
come on and cry me a river
oh cry me a river
i cried a river over you
i cried a river over you

i cried a river
now you can too
cry me a river
cry me a river2embed"
