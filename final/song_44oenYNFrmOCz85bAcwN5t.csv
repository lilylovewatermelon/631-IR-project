a broad incision sits across the evening
the victim to our fathers lost war
the restless children sit and mourn the graves
of those theyve never seen before
will they be buried here among the dead
in the silent secret

prechorus
the pioneers
in dealing with it they march for dawn
of will and worthy
the truth be told the child was born

chorus
man your own jackhammer
man your battle stations
well have you dead pretty soon
and now
sincerely written from my brothers blood machine
man your battle stations
well have you home pretty soon
and now

verse 2
awake through motion with curious to curtain your first move
over arms length theyll break protocol
jealous envy for the youngest one
to be the hero is all ill ask
can i be buried here among the dead
with room to honor me here in the end
youll be better off too soon
youll be better off when you get home

chorus
man your own jackhammer
man your battle stations
well have you dead pretty soon
and now
sincerely written from my brothers blood machine
man your battle stations
well have you home pretty soon

for you id do anything
just to make you happy hear you tell me that youre proud of me
for them ill kill anything
cut the throats of babies for them break their hearts for they were them
waiting for you to say
i love you too
the navigator the pilot her favorite
the one they call the vision that bears the gift
the navigator the pilot her favorite
the one they call the vision that bears the gift
will do the children really understand
the things you did to them
and why oh why should they conjure up the will
for you my love i would kill him
were coming home pretty soon
coming home
in the seventh turning hour will the victims shadow fall
should the irony grow hungry with the victory and all they sought before
we were one among the fence
one among the fence

woahohohoh ohohoh ohohoh
woahohohoh ohohoh ohohoh

chorus
man your own jackhammer
man your battle stations
well have you dead pretty soon
and now
sincerely written from my brothers blood machine
man your battle stations
well have you home pretty soon
