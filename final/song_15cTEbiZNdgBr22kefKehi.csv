trapped under the surface of your words
there is a new intention
new whispers that once could not be heard
catching your intention
wait talking with braces on your tongue
just to provoke my combat
new weapons to snap those final strings
just to watch me fall back

chorus
do you like that do you like that no
do you like that
do you like that do you like that do you like that

verse 2
push down into membranes and layers
creating a slow dissection
i stumble into your tar trap
an addition to your collection

chorus
do you like that
do you like that
do you like that
do you like that

fall into your eyes like a grave
all that is insidе all your anger all your disgust all your resentmеnt
bury me to the sound of your name
fall into your eyes like a grave
all your differences all your pain all your
bury me to the sound of your name
all your pain
