dont worry

even when i think she is hiding from me
even when its so hard for me to break the ice
i can see theres something in her eyes
somethings missing in her smile
even when shes hiding from me

im gonna find a way
im gonna find the way
im gonna find my way to her
elena dont worry

someone will help you to forget
jajaja brujaja brujaja
dont you worry no elena
you have to have that all inside your heart
and ill help you find it
ill help you find it
ill help you find it
ill help you find it find it
ohohohoh

matching perfectly the weather
the london weather
she wears gray and black as winter
showing very little care
for all those whod die for her
wearing gray as past as winter

im gonna find my way to her

and ill help you find it
