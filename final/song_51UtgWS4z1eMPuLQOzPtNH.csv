brainstorm take me away from the norm
i got to tell you somethin
this phenomenon i had to put it in a song
and it goes like

chorus
whoa amber is the color of your energy
whoa shades of gold displayed naturally

verse 1
you wanna know what brings me here oh
you glide through my head blind to fear
and i know why

chorus
whoa amber is the color of your energy
whoa shades of gold displayed naturally

instrumental break

chorus
whoa amber is the color of your energy
whoa shades of gold displayed naturally

bridge
you live too far away
your voice rings like a bell anyway
dont give up your independence
unless it feels so right
nothing good comes easily
sometimes youve got to fight

whoa amber is the color of your energy
whoa shades of gold displayed naturally

verse 2
launched a thousand ships in my heart so easy
still its fine from afar
and you know that

outro
whoa brainstorm take me away from the norm
whoa i got to tell you somethin22embed"
