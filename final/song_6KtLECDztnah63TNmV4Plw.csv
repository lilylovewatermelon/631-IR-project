i dig my toes into the sand
the ocean looks like a thousand diamonds strewn across a blue blanket
i lean against the wind pretend that i am weightless
and in this moment i am happy happy

chorus
i wish you were here
i wish you were here
i wish you were here
i wish you were here

verse 2
i lay my head onto the sand
the sky resembles a backlit canopy with holes punched in it
im counting ufos i signal them with my lighter
and in this moment i am happy happy

chorus
i wish you were here
i wish you were here
i wish you were here
wish you were here

bridge
oh yeah woahoh
the worlds a roller coaster and i am not strapped in
maybe i should hold with care but my hands are busy in the air saying

i wish you were here
i wish you were

chorus
i wish you were here
i wish you were here
i wish you were here
