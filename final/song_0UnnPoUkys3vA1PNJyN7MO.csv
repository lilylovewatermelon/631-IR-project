dont cry when i die
when its my time i probably wont die
ill just lie down and close my eyes
and think about stuff
these eyes got too wide
seeing too much of lifes goodbyes
should have spent less time making loot
spent more time in my birthday suit with you

prechorus 1
and everybody upstairs
everybody downstairs
im not gonna have time to hang out with them

chorus 1
cause ill be hanging out with you
not jimi hendrix jesus or the dude
who played the sheriff in blazing saddles
you not chris farley mister rogers
oh ive waited so long
you can finally meet my mom

verse 2
life is good but love its better
even bieber aint forever
we all got to go you know
so you might as well go in style
see train liveget tickets as low as 24you might also likeprechorus 2
everybody praying
everybody singing
im not gonna have time to hang out with them

chorus 2
cause ill be hanging out with you
not gilda radner buddha or the dude
who had pop rocks and soda at the same time
you not jesse james paul newman
oh ive waited so long
you can finally meet my mom

bridge
im not making light of things
but whos to say whos right with things like this
theres so much that we miss
trying so hard to be rich and famous
pretty and thin to win
its a shame that youth is wasted on the young

prechorus 3
so forget everything
and just be with me here now
for as long as we can
and whoever goes first save a spot
chorus 3
you not etta james bob marley
or the girls who won my heart along the way
you not sitting bull ella or bach
and i almost forgot
you can finally meet my mom
you can finally meet my mom
you can finally meet my mom
you can finally meet my mom
you can finally meet my mom

verse 4
no steve jobs or ty cobbs
al capone or any other mobs
no whitney houston no chet baker
andr√© the giant or the undertaker just you

outro
you can finally meet my mom
you can finally meet my mom
you can finally meet my mom
you can finally meet my mom
you can finally meet my mom
you can finally meet my mom2embed"
