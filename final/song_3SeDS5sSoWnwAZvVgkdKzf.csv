when i saw you standing there
with the dyedup blonded hair
they said that you had clout
i said i didnt care
when the liquor was all clear
i could see you through the glass
theres something i could tell you
but i forgot to ask

chorus
in the shadow of the stars
the lighter makes a spark
but i look better in the dark
i look better in the dark

verse 2
do you think it would be weird
if i dropped into a dream
always the first to know
always the last to leave
if youre sober in the morning
we can always just pretend
that you drank on your way home
and the party didnt end
you might also likechorus
when the sunlight meets the dawn
youll see im not the one you want
cause i look better in the dark

outro
the night is a thief some poet once wrote
that steals the colors from the day
its kind of pretty if you like words but
theyre not exactly true
because there are colors at night
the burning red of passion
the angry green of jealousy
the ugly and terrifying blackembed"
