always been a fighter scrapper and a clawer
used up some luck in lawyers
like huck from tom sawyer jumped on my raft
and shoved off chasing my dreams
reeling in big fishes
i had some hits and a few big misses
i gave em hell and got a few stitches
and these days i show off my scars

chorus
with one arm around my baby
and one arm around my boys
a heart thats still pretty crazy
and a head that hates the noise
if the world comes knocking
tell em im not home
im finally holdin my own

verse 2
ive burned up the fast lane
dodging drugs and divorce
if im proof of anything
god sure loves troubadours
sometimes late at night
i miss the smoke and neon
sneak out of bed grab a sixstring
play whats still turnin me on
like that tight oldtime rock and roll
or that rightdownhome country gold
i miss blues and soul
but not more than i miss being home
see eric church liveget tickets as low as 200you might also likechorus
with one arm around my baby
and one arm around my boys
a heart thats still pretty crazy
and a head that got sick of noise
if the world comes knocking wondering where ive gone
tell em im not home
im finally holdin my own

bridge
til i run out of time
im gonna spend the rest of mine

chorus
with one arm around my baby
and one arm around my boys
a heart thats still pretty crazy
and a head that just got sick of noise
if the world comes knocking
tell em im not home
im finally holdin my own

outro
and when my time on earth is done
i want they write it on my stone
i lived loved and died holdin my own
i lived loved and died holdin my ownembed"
