its like when youre makin conversation
and youre tryin not to scream
and youre tryin not to tell em
you dont care what they mean
and youre really feelin fragile
and you really cant get home
and you really feel abandoned
but you wanna be alone

chorus
old friends they shine like diamonds
old friends you can always call
old friends lord you cant buy em
you know its old friends after all

verse 2
and when the house is empty
and the lights begin to fade
and theres nothin to protect you
except thе window shade
and its hard to put your finger
on the thing that scarеs you most
and you cant tell the difference
between an angel and a ghost

old friends they shine like diamonds
old friends you can always call
old friends lord you cant buy em
you know its old friends after all
old friends they shine like diamonds
old friends you can always call
old friends lord you cant buy em
you know its old friends after allembed"
