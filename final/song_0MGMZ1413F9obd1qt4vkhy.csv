ten million more in books written beneath my bed
i wrote or read them all when searchin in the swarms
still cant find how to hold my hands
and i know you need me in the next room over
but i am stuck in here all paralyzed
for months i got myself in ruts
too much time spent in mirrors framed in yellow walls
aint it like most people im no different
we love to talk on things we dont know about
aint it like most people im no different
we love to talk on things we dont know about
and everyone around me shakes their head in disbelief
and says im too caught up
they say young is good and old is fine
and truth is cool but all that matters
is you have your good times
but their good times come with prices
and i cant believe it when i hear the jokes they make
at anyones expense except their own
would they laugh if they knew who paid

aint it like most people im no different
we love to talk on things we dont know about
aint it like most people im no different
we love to talk on things we dont know about
see the avett brothers liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likeand after we are through ten years
of making it to be the most of glorious debuts
ill come back home without my things
cause the clothes i wore out there i will not wear round you
and theyll be quick to point out our shortcomings
and how the experts all have had their doubts

aint it like most people im no different
we love to talk on things we dont know about
aint it like most people im no different
we love to talk on things we dont know about

aint it like most people im no different
we love to talk on things we dont know about
aint it like most people im no different
we love to talk on things we dont know about2embed"
