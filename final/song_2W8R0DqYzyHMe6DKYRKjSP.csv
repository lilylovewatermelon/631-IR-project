i count the steps from one end of my island to the other
its a hundred steps from where i sleep to the sea
and when i say ive learned all there is to know
well theres another little island lesson
gramma tala shows me

i know where i am from the scent of the breeze
the ascent of the climb
from the tangle of the trees
from the angle of the mountain
to the sand on our island shore
ive been here before

theres gotta be more
i know theres more theres always more
someday ill be out on the sea
and im gonna see more
yes theres gotta be more
i know theres more theres always—

villagers
moana slow down

moana
sorry im always in somebodys way
they do the same thing every day
they work they eat they sleep they pray
they tell me
you might also likemoana and villagers
moana calm down

moana
thats all they ever seem to say
the other kids just dance and play
how can you play
theres so much out there to explorechief tui
she stares at the sky she stumbles down the beaches
she mumbles all the names that her gramma tala teaches
 
with one foot here and another in the distant past
 
sina
shes growing up too fast 
 
 
 
moana
and i wanna soar
 
so much to exploremoana
like i said before
theres gotta be more
i know theres more theres always more
one day ill be brave and sail on the wave
that leads me to more
theres gotta be more
i know theres more theres always more
my father the chief says dont cross the reef
but oh every turn i take every trail i track
every path i make every road leads back to the sea
im standing at the edge of the sea
as they all say

moana and sina
moana slow down
moana dream small
moana dont drown

moana
can you drown at the call of the sea
cause i can hear it calling me

ancestors
aue aue

moana
a thousand years ago we used to sail to distant islands
a thousand years ago maui spoke to the sea
so maybe just maybe i was born to break the silence
i know my story could be extraordinary
i know my story doesnt end at the shore
theres gotta be more
i know theres more theres always more
im gonna break through and find something new
im gonna find more

theres gotta be more
i know theres more theres always more
one day ill decide to roll with the tide
and im gonna see

villagers
moana stand tall

moana
i will cross the divide i will ride
i will see whats on the other side

villagers
moana stand proud

moana
with the ocean as my guide on the tide
i will go where no ones ever been before
theres always more5embed"
