youre hard to hug tough to talk to
and i never fall asleep when youre in my bed
all you give me is a heartbeat
ive turned into a statue
and it makes me feel depressed
cause the only time you open up is when we get undressed

prechorus 1
you dont love me big fucking deal
ill never tell you how i feel
you dont love me not a big deal
ill never tell you how i feel

chorus
it almost feels like a joke to play out a part
when you are not the starring role in someone elses heart
you know id rather walk alone id rather walk alone
than play a supporting role
if i cant get the starring role

verse 2
sometimes i ignore you so i feel in control
cause really i adore you and i cant leave you alone
fed up with the fantasies that cover what is wrong
come on baby lets just get drunk
forget we dont get on
see marina liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likeprechorus 2
youre like my dad youd get on well
i send my best regards from hell

chorus
it almost feels like a joke to play out a part
when you are not the starring role in someone elses heart
you know id rather walk alone id rather walk alone
than play a supporting role
if i cant get the starring role

bridge
i never sang for love i never had a heart to mend
because before the start began i always saw the end yeah
i wait for you to open up to give yourself to me
but nothings ever gonna give ill never set you free
yeah ill never set you free

chorus
it almost feels like a joke to play out a part
when you are not the starring role in someone elses heart
you know id rather walk alone id rather walk alone
than play a supporting role
if i cant get the starring role
