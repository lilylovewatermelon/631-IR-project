close your eyes beddy bye tin soldier
mommy says that its time for sleep
if my folks were wiser and older
theyd know kids and toys dont need sleep

dont be bad little cotton dolly
see how nice mickey mouse sleeps now
even my brass drummer boy has stopped all his noise
cause he knows its past bedtime for toys

speaking
ya know every christmas santa claus goes all over the world with his reindeer
sled and a big bag of toys and hell come to your house this year too
but sometimes just sometimes he doesnt have enough time to see every little boy and girl because the world is so big
so maybe we should sing a song for all the children that santa didnt visit

bless the child who has no tin soldier
no brass drummer boy to put to bed
he will still grow wiser and older
loving one small rag doll instead

he wont have a cotton dolly
mickey mouse wont come to his house
hold that rag doll to your heart nothing can destroy
the beauty one shall find in one small toyyou might also likeembed"
