verse 1
youve got these little things that youve been running from
you either love it or i guess you dont
youre such a pretty thing to be running from anyone
a vision with nowhere to go
so tell me right now ya think youre ready for it
i wanna know why you got me going
so lets go well take it outta here
i think im ready to leap im ready to live

verse 2
youve got these little things you wanted something for em
youll either get it or i guess you wont

theres a million ways it could go
so tell me right now ya think youre ready for it
i wanna know why you got me going
so lets go well take it outta here
