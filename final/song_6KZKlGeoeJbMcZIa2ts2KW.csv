casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down
the stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
following the footsteps through the neondarkened corridors
of silent desperation never speaking to a soul
the poisoned air hes breathing has the dirty smell of dying
cause its never seen the sunshine and its never felt the rain
but casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
of the clicking of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains

refrain
oh she said casey its been so long since ive seen you
here she said just a kiss to make a body smile
see she said ive put on new stockings just to please you
lord she said casey can you only stay a while

verse 2
casey leaves the underground and stops inside the golden crown
for something wet to wipe away the chill thats on his bones
seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
who reach for anything they can to keep from going home
standing in the corner casey drinks his pint of bitter
never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
then he stumbles as hes leaving and he wonders if the reason
is the beer thats in his belly or the tear thats in his eye
you might also likerefrain
oh she said i suppose you seldom think about me
now she said now that youve a family of your own
still she said its so blessed good to feel your body
lord she said casey its a shame to be alone
oh she said casey its been so long since ive seen you
here she said just a kiss to make a body smile
see she said ive put on new stockings just to please you
lord she said casey can you only stay a while
oh she said casey its been so long since ive seen youembed"
