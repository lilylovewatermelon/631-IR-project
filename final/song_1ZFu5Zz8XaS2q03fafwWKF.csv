this is all i ever wanted
all i ever thought id be
its the only place i truly feel
as though i can be me

prechorus 1
but the way i arrived
it was overnight
ive been on my worst behaviour
been on my worst behaviour

chorus
if only it aint been like this
now i can hold my heart in a fist
and all the voices leave
i can finally put it on my sleeve
oh if only theyd really seen it
maybe they would finally believe me
when i say ive won
and my father gets to see his son
that he can feel proud of
he can feel proud of
hes proud of me

verse 2
this is all i ever wanted
all i ever thought id be
but the way that i behaved
could have seen quite the contrary
