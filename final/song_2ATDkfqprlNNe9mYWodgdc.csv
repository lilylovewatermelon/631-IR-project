you can dance you can jive
having the time of your life
ooh see that girl watch that scene
digging the dancing queen

verse 1
friday night and the lights are low
looking out for a place to go
where they play the right music getting in the swing
you come to look for a king
anybody could be that guy
night is young and the musics high
with a bit of rock music everything is fine
youre in the mood for a dance
and when you get the chance

chorus
you are the dancing queen
young and sweet only seventeen
dancing queen
feel the beat from the tambourine oh yeah
you can dance you can jive
having the time of your life
ooh see that girl watch that scene
digging the dancing queen

youre a teaser you turn em on
leave em burning and then youre gone
looking out for another anyone will do
youre in the mood for a dance
and when you get the chance

chorus
you are the dancing queen
young and sweet only seventeen
dancing queen
feel the beat from the tambourine oh yeah
you can dance you can jive
having the time of your life
ooh see that girl watch that scene
digging the dancing queen
