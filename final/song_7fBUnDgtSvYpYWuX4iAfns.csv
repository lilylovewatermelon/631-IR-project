verse 1
ooh the rhythm takes you over
takes you to a different place
a different space
ooh the smoke is getting closer
i can feel our young blood race
through cityscapes

prechorus
and everybody wants to be touched
everybody wants to get some
but dont you play a song about love
when i move my body
i dont have to talk about none
let the chemicals do its stuff
til the energy is too much

chorus

is the rhythm
