last king

chorus jess jackson
all i see is black crowns
king me cause this is my time now
so all you other niggas bow down
cause all i see on me is black crowns black crowns

verse 1 tyga
uhh heavenly father appoint me to the coronation
i deserve it brought music for clarification
envision my past egypt reincarnated
negativity hill over the hump camels waiting
never gave up most of my peers forsaken
one make it we all make it but i was never that patient
king chronicles never write it too logical
fake niggas saying what up fam but we ain’t biological
hands down to my mother she the greatest ever
since i was the only child wasn’t too much to stress her
waking up before work leaving allowance on the dresser
raising the prince under pressure no king no refuge
it’s all good got homies like boyz n the hood
we all good i mean no matter what circumstances was
champagne weed pills it do the same
these niggas gassed up too much butane
working hard like one day i’ll afford the fourdoor porsche
approaching every corner cautious
too much shopping niggas calling you a target
too much flossing niggas gossiping that blog shit
i rather put one in the air congratulate careers
death defying moments people that i ain’t seen in years
what you running from when you you’re your only fear
guess my time is here now all i see is
see tyga liveget tickets as low as 300you might also likechorus jess jackson

so all you other niggas bow down
cause all i see on me is black crowns black crowns
all i see is black crowns
king me cause this is my time now
so all you other niggas bow down
cause all i see on me is black crowns black crowns

verse 2 tyga
uhh fatigue i’m feeling jaded
she gave me the number but i ain’t never saved it
shit is solid why these niggas played it
dealt the right cards but i have yet to play it
determined payrolls living the lifestyle
you couldn’t be in if you was to see it right now
i think i see it right now
they judge me every day life on trial
take your money niggas betting on my downfall
many all real hoes bitches gon call
five fingers pledge allegiance to my one god
we’d have been through hell so heaven ain’t far
two cars sedans tearing it on the way to the grammys
guess we nominated guess they appreciate us
these niggas often imitate us
we just stay creative now all i see is
chorus jess jackson  tyga

so all you other niggas bow down
cause all i see on me is black crowns black crowns
all i see is black crowns
one time in the one time its my time now
two times in the two times in the air for the bow down
both hands in the air if you feel me yeah
