not havin that much money
led to dreamin that much more
and that got me to nashville
tryna knock down slammin doors

prechorus
one call led to a red eye goodbye
what have i got to lose
then one thing led to another led to another
it all led to you

chorus
thank god for the hangups and the breakups
and the wakeup makeup tears on my pillowcase
the all wrongs and the almosts
and the all time lows all took me to the way
my head fits on your shoulder
my heart cant help but stop
mmm look at us how could i not look at you
and thank god thank god thank god thank god
thank god thank god thank god thank god
