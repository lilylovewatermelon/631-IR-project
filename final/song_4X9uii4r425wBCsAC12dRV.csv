mmm

verse 1
ever since i was a baby girl i had a dream
cinderella theme crazy as it seems
always knew that deep inside that there would come that day
but i would have to wait make so many mistakes
i couldnt comprehend as i watched it unfold
this classic story told i left it in the cold
walking through unopened doors that led me back to you
each one unlocking more of the truth

prechorus 1
i finally stopped tripping on my youth
i finally got lost inside of you
i finally know i needed to grow
and finally my mate has met my soul

chorus
finally now my destiny can begin
though we will have our differences
something strange and new is happening
finally now my life doesnt seem so bad
its the best that ive ever had
give my love to him finally

i remember the beginning you already knew
i acted like a fool just trying to be cool
fronting like it didnt matter i just ran away
but on another phase was lost in my own space
found what its like to hurt selfishly
scared to give up me afraid to just believe
i was in a jealous insecure pathetic place
stumbled through the mess that i had made

prechorus 2
i finally got out of my own way
i finally started living for today uh
i finally know i needed to grow
and finally my mate has met my soul

chorus
finally now my destiny can begin
though we will have our differences
something strange and new is happening
finally now my life doesnt seem so bad
its the best that ive ever had
give my love to him finally

interlude
mmm
finally finally
chorus
finally now my destiny can begin
though we will have our differences
something beautiful is happening is happening
finally now my life doesnt seem so bad
its the best that ive ever had
give my love to him finally
