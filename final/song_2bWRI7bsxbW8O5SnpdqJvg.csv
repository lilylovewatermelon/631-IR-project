goodwin circuit judge

james vincent albertini appeals his conviction on two counts of violating 18 usc sec 1382 1982 for distributing political leaflets outside the gate of the pearl harbor naval base albertinis appeal raises three main issues 1 whether his leafletting was protected by the first amendment 2 whether he was denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial and 3 whether he was denied due process of law when the trial court retroactively applied a supreme court case that reversed a ninth circuit decision holding that his conduct was not illegal additionally the government moved to dismiss this appeal for albertinis alleged procedural errors

from 1972 to 1981 albertini received a series of bar letters denying him access to a number of military bases in hawaii the bar letters were the militarys response to albertinis peace and nuclear disarmament demonstrations conducted at certain bases the bar letters forbade him from reentering bases without written permission from the commander or a designate citing 18 usc sec 1382 which provides

whoever within the jurisdiction of the united states goes upon any military naval or coast guard reservation post fort arsenal yard station or installation for any purpose prohibited by law or lawful regulation or

whoever reenters or is found within any such reservation post fort arsenal yard station or installation after having been removed therefrom or ordered not to reenter by any officer or person in command or charge thereof

shall be fined not more than 500 or imprisoned not more than six months or both

18 usc sec 1382 1982 emphasis added

on may 16 1981 albertini and four companions entered hickam air force base during the bases annual armed forces day open house the group conducted a peaceful demonstration criticizing the nuclear arms race albertini took photographs of the displays while his companions passed out leaflets and unfurled a banner in front of a b52 bomber display an officer recognized albertini and recalled that he had been barred from hickam nine years before albertini and his companions were escorted off the base albertini was convicted after a bench trial of violating sec 1382

he appealed the conviction and on july 22 1983 this court held that the military had transformed hickam into a temporary public forum during the open house and that it thus could not exclude even the holder of a bar letter from peaceful expressive activity united states v albertini 710 f2d 1410 1417 9th cir1983 revd 472 us 675 105 sct 2897 86 led2d 536 1985

in december 1983 about 18 months before the supreme court reversed albertinis case albertinis lawyer wrote the pearl harbor commander to inform him that albertini intended to exercise his first amendment rights under his recent court decision by distributing peace materials at the next navy visit ship open house

the navy responded by serving albertini with a letter barring him from entering a number of military bases in hawaii including the pearl harbor base the pearl harbor base commander also sent albertinis lawyer a letter expressing his intention to bar albertini access to the base claiming that the albertini decision was inapplicable because a visit ship open house was distinguishable from other open houses the letter did not explain the distinctions between armed forces day open house and visit ship open houses

on february 4 1984 albertini and seven others arrived at pearl harbors main gate the nimitz gate with the intention of peacefully distributing leaflets during the visit ship open house albertini introduced himself to a base policeman and handed him a copy of this courts albertini decision albertini was told by the sentry at the gate that he would be arrested if he passed through the gate albertini and his companions accordingly altered their plans and decided to leaflet on the sidewalk outside the fencedin portion of the base in front of the sentry control shack which was adjacent to the traffic control podium
the military police soon asked them to leave that area saying they were still on military property even though they were outside the fenced portion of the base no visible marker delineated the boundary of the base property albertini alone was arrested while he and his companions waited for an officer who had offered to draw the property line in chalk on the pavement

on march 3 1984 the navy held another visit ship open house prior to which security personnel were shown photos of albertini albertini and others again appeared at the nimitz gate to distribute peace materials after albertini was informed that he would not be allowed on the base he and at least one other person began leafletting on the sidewalk outside the sentry gate a military guard then approached them and told them they would have to move because they were on military property albertini again was arrested

on april 7 1984 albertini and several companions again went to the nimitz gate to leaflet at another naval open house he was again arrested on the sidewalk in front of the sentry control shack

the arrests arising from the leafletting activities on feb 4 march 3 and april 7 1984 form the basis of this appeal the government petitioned the supreme court for certiorari in albertini 9th on april 3 1984 between the dates of the march 3 and april 7 demonstrations

on april 24 albertini moved on the basis of his ninth circuit decision to dismiss the information filed against him on april 18 for three counts of trespassing in violation of 18 usc sec 1382 over albertinis objection the district court granted the prosecutions motion to continue indefinitely the trial date on the ground that the government had petitioned for certiorari

the supreme court granted certiorari in albertini 9th december 3 1984 469 us 1071 105 sct 562 83 led2d 504 1984 the court reversed albertini 9th in june 1985 holding 1 that a military base is not a public forum and that hickam did not become such a forum on armed forces day merely because the public had been invited and ideas were being communicated and 2 that even if hickam constituted a public forum on the day of the open house albertinis receipt of a bar letter distinguished him from the general public and provided a reasonable ground for excluding him from the base albertini 472 us at 68490 105 sct at 290408 the court reasoned that the exclusion of bar letter recipients from military open houses does not infringe the first amendment because such an exclusion promotes an important governmental interest in assuring the security of military installations id at 68789 105 sct at 2906071

six months later in december 1985 the government recalendared albertinis trial for the three 1984 offenses albertinis motion to dismiss the amended information was again denied

in july 1986 a jury found albertini not guilty as to the february 4 incident but guilty of violating 18 usc sec 1382 as to the march 3 and april 7 counts he was sentenced to two consecutive sixmonth prison terms which were suspended two concurrent fiveyear probation terms and 200 hours of community service involving physical not mental activityidue process claim

we do not reach the questions presented under the first amendment and the speedy trial act because we reverse the judgment on the basis of albertinis due process claim

albertini argues that he protested outside the pearl harbor naval base during the visit ship and open house events in reliance on this courts decision favorable to his position in his own case he argues that due process precludes the retroactive application of the supreme courts reversing decision to the trespass charges based on the very conduct that this circuit had held in albertini 9th to be constitutionally protected

the narrow question we must decide is whether a person whose conduct has been tried in court and vindicated on appeal can rely upon the courts decision in repeating the same conduct after receiving the appellate judgment when the government has either filed a petition for certiorari or still has time to file such a petition and the supreme court has not acted to grant or deny the petition conceptually the tension is between the policy against ex post facto laws and the power of the supreme court to correct any errors of law that have been made by the inferior federal courts

the government claims that the litigation in which albertinis claims were ultimately resolved against him by the supreme court was a unitary case or controversy and that this court could create no window of opportunity to engage in challenged conduct while supreme court review was still a possibility albertini says that after he received a favorable decision from this court and at least before the petition for certiorari was granted he was acting within his adjudicated legal rights and had a due process right to rely upon the judgment of this court

the united states constitution provides that neither congress nor any state shall pass any ex post facto law us const art i sec 9 cl 3 art i sec 10 cl 1 see miller v florida  us  107 sct 2446 2450 96 led2d 351 1987 the prohibition against ex post facto enactments bans every law that makes an action done before the passing of the law and which was innocent when done criminal and punishes such action id at 2450 quoting calder v bull 3 us 3 dall 386 390 1 led 648 1798
although the ex post facto clause applies to the legislature and not to the courts the principle on which the clause is basedthe notion that persons have a right to fair warning of that conduct which will give rise to criminal penaltiesis fundamental to our concept of constitutional liberty marks v united states 430 us 188 191 97 sct 990 992 51 led2d 260 1977 hence the judicial enlargement of a criminal statute by retroactive application violates the fifth amendment due process clause in the same way a legislative enlargement does id 430 us at 192 97 sct at 993 camitsch v risley 705 f2d 351 355 9th cir1983

the government contends that this issue has already been decided in its favor in united states v walsh 770 f2d 1490 9th cir1985 this court reasoned that another protester who was also a bar letter recipient could not properly rely on the very ninth circuit decision in issue here albertini 9th because that decision was reversed by the supreme court and thus never became settled circuit law id at 1492 additionally the walsh court stated that the supreme courts albertini decision was not an unforeseen departure from or reversal of prior law it did not enlarge the scope of section 1382 to cover behavior not considered unlawful in the past id at 149293

walsh s language about the due process argument is obiter however as the court held that walshs conduct was not protected by the first amendment even under albertini 9th id at 1493 the walsh case noted that albertini 9th involved the presence of a bar letter recipient at a military open house whereas walsh involved a bar letter recipients entry on a closed military base walshs conduct was as illegal before the supreme courts decision in albertini as after id we agree that walsh could not depend on albertini 9th but walsh does not hold that albertini could not rely on our holding

the concept of settled circuit law and the governments argument that albertini in the supreme court was not an unforeseen departure from prior law are inapplicable in the instant case in effect albertini obtained a declaratory judgment from this court that the actions in which he engaged were lawful if the due process clause is to mean anything it should mean that a person who holds the latest controlling court opinion declaring his activities constitutionally protected should be able to depend on that ruling to protect like activities from criminal conviction until that opinion is reversed or at least until the supreme court has granted certiorari2 see united states v mancuso 139 f2d 90 92 3rd cir1943 reasoning that defendant could rely on district courts order and was not subject to criminal penalties for act or omission until the district courts initial decision was reversed or vacated state v jones 44 nm 623 63031 107 p2d 324 329 1940 state v longino 109 miss 125 13135 67 so 902 90304 1915 state v oneil 147 iowa 513 51423 126 nw 454 45457 1910

in its pretrial motion in limine to exclude evidence of albertini 9th from the trial the government argued that mistake of law is never a defense there is an exception to the mistake of law doctrine however in circumstances where the mistake results from the defendants reasonable reliance upon an officialbut mistaken or later overruledstatement of the law see united states v duggan 743 f2d 59 83 2d cir1984 kratz v kratz 477 fsupp 463 480 edpa1979 it would be an act of intolerable injustice to hold criminally liable a person who had engaged in certain conduct in reasonable reliance upon a judicial opinion instructing that such conduct is legal kratz 477 fsupp at 481 footnotes omitted as delineated by section 204 of the model penal code3 the doctrine may in some circumstances protect a defendants reasonable reliance on official advisory opinions such as an attorney generals opinion see united states v barker 546 f2d 940 956 dccir1976 merhige j concurring the doctrine is applied most often when an individual acts in reliance on a statute or an express decision by a competent court of general jurisdiction which is later overruled id

this court unanimously held in albertini 9th that the air force could not refuse to admit a bar letter recipient to a military base because the air force had turned the base into at least a limited public forum during the hours of a base open house the government argues that a visit ship open house is more restricted than a regular open house we note however that certain areas were closed to the public even in the arguably less restricted open house in albertini 9th and that albertini peacefully confined himself to the areas set aside for the open house albertini 9th 710 f2d at 141213

we also note that albertini tried to comply with the military authorities by remaining outside the fencedin area of the base even though albertini 9th arguably permitted him access within the gates confines when the military had opened the base to the public we do not reach albertinis first amendment arguments concerning the boundary of military control at the base but we note that he was more deferential to the military police than albertini 9th suggested would have been necessary

hence albertini acted during a window of time when he reasonably believed his acts were protected under albertini 9th he cannot be convicted for acting in reliance on that opinion at least until the supreme court has granted certiorari see marks 430 us at 19192 97 sct at 99293 mancuso 139 f2d at 92 to hold otherwise would sanction a kind of entrapment by the governmentconvicting albertini for acts that the government has told him are protected by the first amendment against prosecution cox v louisiana 379 us 559 571 85 sct 476 484 13 led2d 487 rehg denied 1965 concluding that due process prevented the conviction of a defendant entrapped by a police chief who advised him to protest across the street to avoid conviction under a statute prohibiting demonstrations near the courthouse raley v ohio 360 us 423 42526 79 sct 1257 125960 3 led2d 1344 1959 holding that convictions violated due process where a state investigating commission had assured witnesses that they could invoke their privilege against selfincrimination but where the court later denied them the privilege

when the entrapment has been caused by a judicial opinion the argument in favor of recognizing the reliance defense is even more compelling since courts are the very entities charged with interpreting the law kratz 477 fsupp at 482 n 51 as the third circuit noted in mancuso

we think the defendant cannot be convicted for failing to obey an order issuance of which is forbidden by the courts injunction while it is true that men are in general held responsible for violations of the law whether they know it or not we do not think the layman participating in a law suit is required to know more law than the judge

mancuso 139 f2d at 92 footnote omitted see also longino 109 miss at 135 67 so at 904iithe governments motion to dismiss this appeal

on january 8 1987 the government moved this court to dismiss this appeal on several procedural grounds the government argues that albertini 1 failed to include in the record on appeal certain transcripts 2 failed to include in his opening brief the standard of review or to designate which rulings or orders he was appealing and 3 raised the due process claim for the first time on appeal even in the aggregate the errors complained of are not so egregious as to warrant dismissal of the appeal

as to the governments first complaint the failure to include the exhibits as part of the record on appeal is of little consequence because the exhibits were available in time for oral argument the exhibits were also irrelevant on the issue upon which the appeal is based
we also do not find the absence of the transcript of jury instructions critical to support albertinis due process argument the trial transcript repeatedly mentions the fact that the parties agreed before trial that they would not discuss the existence of albertini 9th in front of the jury there thus is sufficient evidence of the absence of any kind of information or instruction on this issue even without the jury instructions

as to the second issue neither of these flaws is fatal under the circumstances of this case

the third issue likewise does not warrant dismissal albertini has preserved his right to appeal the denial of his due process claim through his various pretrial objections to both the prosecution and to the motion in limine which the trial court granted disallowing any exposure of albertini 9th to the jury but assuming arguendo that he failed to raise the due process claim until the instant appeal a due process objection may be raised for the first time on appeal under fedrcrimp 52b as a defect affecting albertinis substantial rights

reversed



1      on remand this court decided in light of the supreme court        opinion that due process did not require the hickam        commander to hold a hearing before issuing the bar letter nor        did the enforcement of the bar letter offend due process        united states v albertini 783 f2d 1484 148688 9th        cir1986

2     we do not reach the issue raised in walsh because albertini        relied upon a court opinion concerning his own actions we        also need not reach the issue whether albertini would have        been justified in relying upon albertini 9th in the period after        the supreme court granted certiorari and before it reversed        albertini 9th

3     the applicable model penal code section provides

3 a belief that conduct does not legally constitute an offense is a defense to a prosecution for that offense based upon such conduct when

  

b the actor acts in reasonable reliance upon an official statement of the law afterward determined to be invalid or erroneous contained in i a statute or other enactment ii a judicial decision opinion or judgment iii an administrative order or grant of permission or iv an official interpretation of the public officer or body charged by law with responsibility for the interpretation administration or enforcement of the law defining the offense
