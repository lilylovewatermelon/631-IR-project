my heart is filled with love and care
not an ounce of gas i would get up there
the answers simple
you lift me up
the view up here i see all the stars
ooh there go venus and there go mars
somethin you been through
youre from above hey

prechorus pharrell williams
when i first saw you i got excited
tried to keep my composure tryna hide it
but i didnt know
i didnt let go
then it occurred to me while tryna fight it
just like a kite you learn to ride it
but i didnt know
you sposed to let it go

chorus daft punk
like a gust of wind
you head me off sometimes
like a gust of wind
you push me back every once in a while
like a gust of wind
you remind me theres someone up there
who ushers in
the air i need to power my sail

when i open the window
i wanna hug you
cause you remind me of the air
i said yeah
cause when im feelin real low
i remember i love you
i put my hands in the air
and you were there

verse 2 pharrell williams
with your love i can board the skies
riding away that electrified mothership other
can i stow away can i stow away girl girl
colorful winds of the northern sky
its the closest thing and here is why
cause were color
you blow me away blow me away girl girl

prechorus pharrell williams
i need it like i breathe it
music and colors can make one hover
who cares if they dont see you
dont you know that theyre the same
i need it like i breathe it
if you never discover forever youll suffer
who cares if they dont see you
you gotta tap in and learn the way
chorus daft punk
like a gust of wind
you head me off sometimes
like a gust of wind
you push me back every once in a while
like a gust of wind
you remind me theres someone up there
who ushers in
the air i need to power my sail

postchorus pharrell williams
when i open the window
i wanna hug you
cause you remind me of the air
i said yeah
cause when im feelin real low
i remember i love you
i put my hands in the air
and you were there
