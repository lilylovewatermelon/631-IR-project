oh pour me another drink
and punch me in the face
you can call me nancy
every man wears a symbol
and i know i have mine
ive got my right hand stamped
in the concentration camp
where my organs scream
slow down man

chorus
ooh how was i to know
milk and honey flowed
just a couple states below
ooh

verse 2
oh hook me up to the tank
and roll me to the door
im going where my body leads me
i can fend for myself
with what looks i have left
ill put away a few
and pretty soon ill be breaking things like howard hughes

ooh how was i to know
milk and honey flowed
just a couple states below

outro
ooh give me how it was
our place under the sun
before the devil made me run
run boy
run boy
