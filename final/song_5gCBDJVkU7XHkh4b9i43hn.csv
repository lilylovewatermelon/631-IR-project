your satin dress and your long hair
you were crazy as hell and didn’t even care
you were on a midnight train to birmingham
and you had a onetrack mind it was just like mine
we were both set on the world but leavin it way far behind
ooh way far behind

prechorus
and i had my guitar in a bag you had your makeup and hair
and it was awfully strange when we got there
cause we both ended up but we didn’t want to goo

chorus
and you were mine all mine with your hair in mess
looking like a crazy fool in that expensive dress
ooh you were mine all mine
ooh you were mine all mine

verse 2
and when we left the club you said where to now
i said let’s find a place where we can lay our heads down
and you said that sounds mighty fine
and you said that sounds mighty fine

chorus
and you were mine all mine with your hair in mess
looking like a crazy fool in that expensive dress
ooh you were mine all mine
ooh you were mine all mine
you might also likebridge
you had a onetrack mind it was just like mine
we were both set on the world but leavin it way far behind
ooh way far behind

prechorus
and i had my guitar in a bag
you had your makeup and hair
and it was awfully strange when we got there
cause we both ended up but we didn’t want to goo

chorus
you were mine all mine with your hair in mess
looking like a crazy fool in that expensive dress
ooh you were mine all mineembed"
