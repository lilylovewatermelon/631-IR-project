verse 1
listen you can call me what you want black and ugly
but you cant convince me the lord dont love me
when my cds drop they sell the best
you call it luck why cant it just be im blessed
im a track star runnin through life chasin my dreams
best deal i made was tradin the mic for that triple beam
i zone off thinkin is there really heaven or hell
if so what happens to a changed man that dies in a cell
i need no answers to these questions cause time will tell

verse 2
some days im in the crowd all by myself
bunch of niggas around im still by myself
i drift off on a cloud by myself
thinkin bout nothin more than life  what else
these days its hard to tell who really cares for me
so when you hear this song you should say a prayer for me
i put a message in my music hope it brightens your day
if times are hard when you hear it know youll be okay
a og told me gods favorites have a hard time
youre out the hood thats good now stay on the grind
im a sponge knowledge and wisdom i absorb fast
im in a class by myself you do the math
chorus
