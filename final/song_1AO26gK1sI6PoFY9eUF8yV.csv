stone love with the number one sound
a four four in the background
a platinum selector of the time
dont watch my size in this hall
while my backs against the wall
take a ride competition take a ride
pull it operator try the other side
thought it was over so far from done
as they dance into the sun

chorus
some bring up new style holding trophy cups
rory select while my speakers erupt
the sounds sweeter in an echo chamber
dont you know that they are the danger
three bottles of cristal and its agreed
the best could only come from the don wesley
close my eyes while i take a ride

verse
fold the bag in a yard style
dont worry bout that you see its all natural
police chasing this bandilero
runnin down the road with my thick pay roll
one stop was my music shop
when i heard this guitar screamin
you might also likeinstrumental

chorus
some bring up new style holding trophy cups
rory select while my speakers erupt
the sounds sweeter in an echo chamber
dont you know that they are the danger
three bottles of cristal and its agreed
the best could only come from the don wesley
close my eyes and take a ride

outro
take a ride everybody take a ride
take a ride everybody take a ride
take a ride everybody take a ride stone love with the number one sound
take a ride everybody take a ride stone love with the number one sound
take a ride everybody take a ride stone love with the number one sound
take a ride everybody take a ride stone love with the number one sound
take a ride everybody take a ride stone love stone love stone
take a ride everybody take a ride stone love stone love stone
take a ride everybody take a ride stone love stone love stone
take a ride everybody take a ride stone love stone love stone
take a ride everybody take a ride stone love stone love stoneembed"
