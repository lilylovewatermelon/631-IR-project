i never liked this apple much
it always seemed too big to touch
i cant remember how i found
my way before she came around

chorus
i tell everyone
i smile just because
ive got a city love
i found it in lydia
and i cant remember life before her name

verse 2
she keeps a toothbrush at my place
as if i had the extra space
she steals my clothes to wear to work
i know her hairs are on my shirts

chorus
i tell everyone
i smile just because
ive got a city love
i found it in lydia
and i cant remember life before her name

the day
she called up and came to me
covered in rain
and dinnertime shadowing
and as her clothes spun we spooned
and i knew i was through
when i said i love you
friday evening weve been drinking
2 am i swear i might propose
but we close the tab
split a cab
and call each other up when we get home
falling asleep to the sound
of sirens

chorus
i tell everyone
i smile just because
ive got a city love
i found it in lydia
and i cant remember life before her name

bridge
from the battery
to the gallery
its the kind of thing you only see
in scented glossy magazines
outro
and i cant remember life before her name4embed"
