verse 1
this one’s for the lonely child
brokenhearted running wild
this was written for the ones to blame
one who believes they are the cause of chaos in everything

verse 2
you may find yourself in the dead of night
lost somewhere out there in the great big beautiful sky
you were all just perfect little satellites
spinning round and round this broken earthly life

hook
this is so you’ll know the sound
of someone who loves you
from the ground
tonight youre not alone at all
this is me sending out my satellite call

interlude
