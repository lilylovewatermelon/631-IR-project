if you dont wanna see me

verse 1

thinking bout the way i was
did the heartbreak change me maybe
but look at where i ended up

im all good already
so moved on its scary
im not where you left me at all so

if you dont wanna see me dancing with somebody
if you wanna believe that anything could stop me

dont show up dont come out
dont start caring about me now
walk away you know how
dont start caring about me now

verse 2
arent you the guy who tried to
hurt me with the word goodbye
