put your white tennis shoes on and follow me
why work so hard when you could just be free
you got your money now you got your legacy
lets leave the world for the ones who change everything

prechorus
nothing could stop
the two of us
lets just get lost
thats what we want

chorus
and i will never sing again
and you wont work another day
i will never sing again
with just one wave it goes away
it will be our swan song
it will be our swan song
be our swan song
it will be our swan song

verse 2
dive in dive deep and dive blue my sweet
rushing up from the water where the ice meets
and youve been gone so long you missed everything
the world can change in a day if you go away

but nothing could stop
the two of us
if thats what we want
we could just get lost

chorus
and i will never sing again
and you wont work another day
i will never sing again
with just one wave it goes away
it will be our swan song
it will be our swan song
be our swan song
it will be our swan song

do you like
do you like where youve been and where youre going to

say goodnight
say goodnight to the life and the world you knew
im gonna follow you

chorus
and i will never sing again
and you wont work another day
and i will never sing again
you wont work another day
it will be our swan song
it will be our swan song
be our swan song
it will be our swan song
