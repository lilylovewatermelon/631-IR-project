im her world and she revolves around me
just being close to me makes her love grow
each night she thanks god for the day she found me
when she came home this morning she told me so

chorus
and theres roses blooming in the arctic circle
icebergs in the gulf of mexico
and theres not one star in heaven or a sunrise every morning
id believe it if she told me so

verse 2
i know people say she has a lover
referring to this guy shes come to know
well theyre just friends she loves him like a brother
and shes never even kissed him she told me so

chorus
and theres roses blooming in the arctic circle
icebergs in the gulf of mexico
and theres not one star in heaven or a sunrise every morning
id believe it if she told me sosee george strait liveget tickets as low as 102you might also likeembed"
