i got a fetish for fuckin you witcha skirt on

but patiently waitin for you to tell a nigga to move on
between me and you we can find each other
flyin abroad in my private g2
i aint tryin to g you ma im tryin to see you
bend over you know how we do it feet to shoulders
bring heat to coldest night so ferocious
now you street promotin the dick game is potent
cause in the bed a nigga go hard like jordan

grippin the sheets lookin at me lickin at me
cause every woman just wanna be happy
