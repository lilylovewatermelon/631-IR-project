and i heard as it were the noise of thunder
one of the four beasts saying come and see
and i saw and behold a white horse

verse 1
theres a man goin round takin names
and he decides who to free and who to blame
everybody wont be treated all the same
therell be a golden ladder reachin down
when the man comes around

verse 2
the hairs on your arm will stand up
at the terror in each sip and in each sup
will you partake of that last offered cup
or disappear into the potters ground
when the man comes around

chorus
hear the trumpets hear the pipers
one hundred million angels singin
multitudes are marchin to the big kettledrum
voices callin voices cryin
some are born and some are dyin
its alpha and omegas kingdom come
and the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
the virgins are all trimming their wicks
the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
its hard for thee to kick against the pricks

till armageddon no shalam no shalom
then the father hen will call his chickens home
the wise man will bow down before the throne
and at his feet theyll cast their golden crowns
when the man comes around

verse 4
whoever is unjust let him be unjust still
whoever is righteous let him be righteous still
whoever is filthy let him be filthy still
listen to the words long written down
when the man comes around

chorus
hear the trumpets hear the pipers
one hundred million angels singin
multitudes are marchin to the big kettledrum
voices callin voices cryin
some are born and some are dyin
its alpha and omegas kingdom come
and the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
the virgins are all trimming their wicks
the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
its hard for thee to kick against the prick
in measured hundredweight and penny pound
when the man comes around
outro
and i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts 
and i looked and behold a pale horse
and his name that sat on him was death
and hell followed with him18embed"
