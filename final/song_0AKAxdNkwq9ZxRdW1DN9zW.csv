ohoh oh oh oh
ohoh oh oh

verse 1
seems like just yesterday
you were a part of me
i used to stand so tall
i used to be so strong
your arms around me tight
everything it felt so right
unbreakable like nothing could go wrong

prechorus
now i cant breathe
no i cant sleep
im barely hangin on

chorus
here i am once again
im torn into pieces
cant deny it cant pretend
just thought you were the one
broken up deep inside
but you wont get to see the tears i cry
behind these hazel eyes
see kelly clarkson liveget tickets as low as 275you might also likeverse 2
i told you everything
opened up and let you in
you made me feel alright for once in my life
now all thats left of me
is what i pretend to be
so together but so broken up inside

prechorus
cause i cant breathe
no i cant sleep
im barely hangin on

chorus
here i am once again
im torn into pieces
cant deny it cant pretend
just thought you were the one
broken up deep inside
but you wont get to see the tears i cry
behind these hazel eyes

bridge
swallow me then spit me out
for hating you i blame myself
seeing you it kills me now
no i dont cry on the outside
anymore
anymore
chorus
here i am once again
im torn into pieces
cant deny it cant pretend
just thought you were the one
broken up deep inside
but you wont get to see the tears i cry
behind these hazel eyes
here i am once again
im torn into pieces
cant deny it cant pretend
just thought you were the one
broken up deep inside
but you wont get to see the tears i cry
behind these hazel eyes17embed"
