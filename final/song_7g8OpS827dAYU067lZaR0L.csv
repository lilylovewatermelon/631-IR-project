it was two weeks after the day she turned eighteen
all dressed in white goin to the church that night
she had his box of letters in the passenger seat
sixpence in a shoe somethin borrowed somethin blue

prechorus
and when the church doors opened up wide
she put her veil down tryin to hide the tears
oh she just couldnt believe it
she heard the trumpets from the military band
and the flowers fell out of her hands

chorus
baby whyd you leave me whyd you have to go
i was countin on forever now ill never know
i cant even breathe
its like im lookin from a distance standin in the background
everybodys sayin hes not comin home now
this cant be happenin to me
this is just a dream

verse 2
the preacher man said let us bow our heads and pray
lord please lift his soul and heal this hurt
then the congregation all stood up and sang
the saddest song that she ever heard
prechorus
and then they handed her a foldedup flag
and she held on to all she had left of him
oh and what could have been
and then the guns rang one last shot
and it felt like a bullet in her heart

chorus
baby whyd you leave me whyd you have to go
i was countin on forever now ill never know
i cant even breathe
its like im lookin from a distance standin in the background
everybodys sayin hes not comin home now
this cant be happenin to me
this is just a dream

bridge
ooh baby whyd you leave me whyd you have to go
i was countin on forever
now ill never know
oh ill never know

chorus
its like im lookin from a distance standin in the background
everybodys sayin hes not comin home now
this cant be happenin to me
this is just a dream
