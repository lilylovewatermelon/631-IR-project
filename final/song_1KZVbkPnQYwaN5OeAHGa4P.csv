visiting is pretty visitin is good
seems that all they ever wanted was a brother
this can be a secret we can keep it good
even all they ever wanted had a problem

this is a call to all my past resignations
this is a call to all

verse 2
fingernails are pretty fingernails are good
seems that all they ever wanted was a markin
them balloons are pretty big and say they should
ever fall to ground call the magic marker

chorus
this is a call to all my past resignations
this is a call to all
this is a call to all my past resignations
its been too long
