i was warned about you
but then i was worn
through then
but then i let the sound in
of torches along the path’s edge
rustling in my eyes and ears
our eyes and ears
hours would pass and nothing…

verse 2
all contorted in row
these antlers don’t
cut through
nor do they tessellate with
anything along where we’re walking
cutting out and in
and out and out and in again
hours would pass and nothing

chorus
i know you
you know our bodies move in unison
ooo the answer’s within that
i could be burning houses but i’m not
i knew you
i thought our bodies moved in unison
ooo lucile i rescind that
i could be burning houses but i’m not
you might also likeoutro
i’m not
i’m not
i’m not
i’m notembed"
