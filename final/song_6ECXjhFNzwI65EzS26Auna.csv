when the men take me to the devil tree
i will be free and shining like before
papa dont tell me what i shouldve done
shes the one shes the one who begged me
take me take me home

verse 2
when the wind wraps me like the reapers hand
i will swing free until they cut me down
papa dont tell me what i couldve done
shes the one shes the one who begged me
take me take me home

verse 3
when the sea takes me like my mothers arms
i will breathe free as any word of god
