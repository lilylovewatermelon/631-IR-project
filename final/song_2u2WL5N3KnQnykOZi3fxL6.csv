you cut me down a tree and brought it back to me
and thats what made me see where i was going wrong
you put me on a shelf and kept me for yourself
i can only blame myself you can only blame me

chorus 1
and i could write a song a hundred miles long
well thats where i belong and you belong with me
and i could write it down or spread it all around
get lost and then get found or swallowed in the sea

verse 2
you put me on a line and hung me out to dry
and darling thats when i decided to go see
you cut me down to size and opened up my eyes
made me realize what i could not see

chorus 2
and i could write a book the one theyll say that shook
the world and then it took it took it back from me
and i could write it down or spread it all around
get lost and then get found and youll come back to me
not swallowed in the sea
