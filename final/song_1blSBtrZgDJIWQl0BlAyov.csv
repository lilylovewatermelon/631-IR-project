girl youve had one of those days
seems like theyve been going around
youre a long way from being where you wanna be
when the world isnt going your way
whatever bad luck is getting you down
honey ill be right here for you
with open arms you can run to me

chorus
baby loves gonna make it
loves gonna make it alright
baby loves gonna make it
loves gonna make it alright
tonight tonight tonight

verse 2
we can go out and paint the town
we can dance your cares away
we can watch em all fall out on the floor
and if you want to we can close em down
and we can leave whenever you say
ill chase you down the hallway
watch the sun come up behind our bedroom door

chorus
baby loves gonna make it
loves gonna make it alright
baby loves gonna make it
loves gonna make it alright
tonight tonight tonight

chorus
baby loves gonna make it
loves gonna make it alright
baby loves gonna make it
loves gonna make it alright
tonight tonight tonight
