niggas screw they face up at me
on some real shit son they don’t want beef
i cock that aim that shit out the window and spray
there ain’t a shell left in my heat
y’all niggas better lay down yeah i mean stay down
you get hit with ak round your ass ain’t gon’ make it
you niggas will get laid out your blood and your brains out
have you on the concrete shivering and shaking
i’m from southside motherfucker where them gats explode
if you feel like you’re on fire boy drop and roll
niggas will eat your ass up cause they heart turned cold
now you can be a victim or you can lock and load
the party jump shorty bouncin that ass i wanna fuck
gimme a second i’mma holla i’mma see whassup
i got my razor in my hand got my pistol in the trunk
carve your ass up nice you play me like a punk

chorus
in my hood niggas got love for me
but i don’t go nowhere without my strap
in my hood a little ’dro a little hennessy
and niggas just don’t know how to act
in my hood niggas is grimey
i stay on point i roll with my gat
in my hood niggas might buck at me
so i keep something around to buck back
in my hood
see 50 cent liveget tickets as low as 49you might also likeverse 2
i don’t trust a muh’fuckin soul
when the d’s come they fold on my first case they told
where i’m from it ain’t safe to have more than a eighth
niggas’ll come to your place put a gun in your face
tell you open the safe as your heart start to race
cause a robbery could turn into a homo’ case
cooperate or doc’ll have to operate
niggas i’ll pop you run a light then pop at jake
trust me son niggas’ll go hard for that cake
these thirsty niggas are lurking you’ll have to catch ’em and merk ’em
i’m observant in my hood cause niggas be dumbing
shots forfeit the dice game all you see is the running
they make it harder and harder to pump on the block
i’m a hustler how the fuck i’m ’sposed to eat when it’s hot

chorus
in my hood niggas got love for me
but i don’t go nowhere without my strap
in my hood a little ’dro a little hennessy
and niggas just don’t know how to act
in my hood niggas is grimey
i stay on point i roll with my gat
in my hood niggas might buck at me
so i keep something around to buck back
in my hood
verse 3
the house party go off the hook go until them shots go go off go
well that’s what you get for stuntin on my block showoff
ah you shit out of luck if niggas catch you slippin uhhuh
crack money slow so you know niggas is trippin yea
shorty down there on that queens tracks takin a whippin
sheeit bitch get out of pocket she need some discipline
peep the fiend shootin diesel in his arm in the alley ahhhhh
look at the chrome spinner spinnin on that black denali wooo
the grimey niggas where i’m from don’t wanna see you chipped up
you shine they gon jux you or probably shoot your whip up
it ain’t good to do good in my hood
gun cocking and firing sound effect
you know not to do good now

chorus
in my hood niggas got love for me
but i don’t go nowhere without my strap
in my hood a little ’dro a little hennessy
and niggas just don’t know how to act
in my hood niggas is grimey
i stay on point i roll with my gat
in my hood niggas might buck at me
so i keep something around to buck back
