         “frailty thy name is woman”
         “the earth waits for her queen”

the connection between these quotations may not be obvious but it is strict yet would any contradict us if we made them applicable to the other side and began also

        frailty thy name is man
        the earth waits for its king

yet man if not yet fully installed in his powers has given much earnest of his claims frail he is indeed—how frail how impure yet often has the vein of gold displayed itself amid the baser ores and man has appeared before us in princely promise worthy of his future

if oftentimes we see the prodigal son feeding on the husks in the fair field no more his own anon we raise the eyelids heavy from bitter tears to behold in him the radiant apparition of genius and love demanding not less than the all of goodness power and beauty we see that in him the largest claim finds a due foundation that claim is for no partial sway no exclusive possession he cannot be satisfied with any one gift of life any one department of knowledge or telescopic peep at the heavens he feels himself called to understand and aid nature that she may through his intelligence be raised and interpreted to be a student of and servant to the universespirit and king of his planet that as an angelic minister he may bring it into conscious harmony with the law of that spirit

in clear triumphant moments many times has rung through the spheres the prophecy of his jubilee and those moments though past in time have been translated into eternity by thought the bright signs they left hang in the heavens as single stars or constellations and already a thickly sown radiance consoles the wanderer in the darkest night other heroes since hercules have fulfilled the zodiac of beneficent labors and then given up their mortal part to the fire without a murmur while no god dared deny that they should have their reward

        siquis tamen hercule siquis
        forte deo doliturus erit daia praemia nollet
        sed meruise dari sciet invitus que probabit
        assensere dei

sages and lawgivers have bent their whole nature to the search for truth and thought themselves happy if they could buy with the sacrifice of all temporal ease and pleasure one seed for the future eden poets and priests have strung the lyre with the heartstrings poured out their best blood upon the altar which reared anew from age to age shall at last sustain the flame pure enough to rise to highest heaven shall we not name with as deep a benediction those who if not so immediately or so consciously in connection with the eternal truth yet led and fashioned by a divine instinct serve no less to develop and interpret the open secret of love passing into life energy creating for the purpose of happiness the artist whose hand drawn by a preexistent harmony to a certain medium moulds it to forms of life more highly and completely organized than are seen elsewhere and by carrying out the intention of nature reveals her meaning to those who are not yet wise enough to divine it the philosopher who listens steadily for laws and causes and from those obvious infers those yet unknown the historian who in faith that all events must have their reason and their aim records them and thus fills archives from which the youth of prophets may be fed the man of science dissecting the statements testing the facts and demonstrating order even where he cannot its purpose

lives too which bear none of these names have yielded tones of no less significance the candlestick set in a low place has given light as faithfully where it was needed as that upon the hill in close alleys in dismal nooks the word has been read as distinctly as when shown by angels to holy men in the dark prison those who till a spot of earth scarcely larger than is wanted for a grave have deserved that the sun should shine upon its sod till violets answer

so great has been from time to time the promise that in all ages men have said the gods themselves came down to dwell with them that the allcreating wandered on the earth to taste in a limited nature the sweetness of virtue that the allsustaining incarnated himself to guard in space and time the destinies of this world that heavenly genius dwelt among the shepherds to sing to them and teach them how to sing indeed
         “der stets den hirten gnadig sich bewies”
“he has constantly shown himself favorable to shepherds”

and the dwellers in green pastures and natural students of the stars were selected to hail first among men the holy child whose life and death were to present the type of excellence which has sustained the heart of so large a portion of mankind in these later generations

such marks have been made by the footsteps of man still alas to be spoken of as the ideal man wherever he has passed through the wilderness of men and whenever the pigmies stepped in one of those they felt dilate within the breast somewhat that promised nobler stature and purer blood they were impelled to forsake their evil ways of decrepit scepticism and covetousness of corruptible possessions convictions flowed in upon them they too raised the cry god is living now today and all beings are brothers for they are his children simple words enough yet which only angelic natures can use or hear in their full free sense

these were the triumphant moments but soon the lower nature took its turn and the era of a truly human life was postponed

thus is man still a stranger to his inheritance still a pleader still a pilgrim yet his happiness is secure in the end and now no more a glimmering consciousness but assurance begins to be felt and spoken that the highest ideal man can form of his own powers is that which he is destined to attain whatever the soul knows how to seek it cannot fail to obtain this is the law and the prophets knock and it shall be opened seek and ye shall find it is demonstrated it is a maxim man no longer paints his proper nature in some form and says “prometheus had it it is godlike” but “man must have it it is human” however disputed by many however ignorantly used or falsified by those who do receive it the fact of an universal unceasing revelation has been too clearly stated in words to be lost sight of in thought and sermons preached from the text “be ye perfect” are the only sermons of a pervasive and deepsearching influence

but among those who meditate upon this text there is a great difference of view as to the way in which perfection shall be sought

“through the intellect” say some “gather from every growth of life its seed of thought look behind every symbol for its law if thou canst see clearly the rest will follow”

“through the life” say others “do the best thou knowest today shrink not from frequent error in this gradual fragmentary state follow thy light for as much as it will show thee be faithful as far as thou canst in hope that faith presently will lead to sight help others without blaming their need of thy help love much and be forgiven”

“it needs not intellect needs not experience” says a third “if you took the true way your destiny would be accomplished in a purer and more natural order you would not learn through facts of thought or action but express through them the certainties of wisdom in quietness yield thy soul to the causal soul do not disturb thy apprenticeship by premature effort neither check the tide of instruction by methods of thy own be still seek not but wait in obedience thy commission will be given”

could we indeed say what we want could we give a description of the child that is lost he would be found as soon as the soul can affirm clearly that a certain demonstration is wanted it is at hand when the jewish prophet described the lamb as the expression of what was required by the coming era the time drew nigh but we say not see not as yet clearly what we would those who call for a more triumphant expression of love a love that cannot be crucified show not a perfect sense of what has already been given love has already been expressed that made all things new that gave the worm its place and ministry as well as the eagle a love to which it was alike to descend into the depths of hell or to sit at the right hand of the father

yet no doubt a new manifestation is at hand a new hour in the day of man we cannot expect to see any one sample of completed being when the mass of men still lie engaged in the sod or use the freedom of their limbs only with wolfish energy the tree cannot come to flower till its root be free from the cankering worm and its whole growth open to air and light while any one is base none can be entirely free and noble yet something new shall presently be shown of the life of man for hearts crave if minds do not know how to ask it

among the strains of prophecy the following by an earnest mind of a foreign land written some thirty years ago is not yet outgrown and it has the merit of being a positive appeal from the heart instead of a critical declaration what man should not do

“the ministry of man implies that he must be filled from the divine fountains which are being engendered through all eternity so that at the mere name of his master he may be able to cast all his enemies into the abyss that he may deliver all parts of nature from the barriers that imprison them that he may purge the terrestrial atmosphere from the poisons that infect it that he may preserve the bodies of men from the corrupt influences that surround and the maladies that afflict them still more that he may keep their souls pure from the malignant insinuations which pollute and the gloomy images that obscure them that he may restore its serenity to the word which false words of men fill with mourning and sadness that he may satisfy the desires of the angels who await from him the development of the marvels of nature that in fine his world may be filled with god as eternity is” footnote st martin
another attempt we will give by an obscure observer of our own day and country to draw some lines of the desired image it was suggested by seeing the design of crawfords orpheus and connecting with the circumstance of the american in his garret at rome making choice of this subject that of americans here at home showing such ambition to represent the character by calling their prose and verse “orphic sayings”—”orphics” we wish we could add that they have shown that musical apprehension of the progress of nature through her ascending gradations which entitled them so to do but their attempts are frigid though sometimes grand in their strain we are not warmed by the fire which fertilized the soil of greece

orpheus was a lawgiver by theocratic commission he understood nature and made her forms move to his music he told her secrets in the form of hymns nature as seen in the mind of god his soul went forth toward all beings yet could remain sternly faithful to a chosen type of excellence seeking what he loved he feared not death nor hell neither could any shape of dread daunt his faith in the power of the celestial harmony that filled his soul

it seemed significant of the state of things in this country that the sculptor should have represented the seer at the moment when he was obliged with his hand to shade his eyes

        each orpheus must to the depths descend
        for only thus the poet can be wise
        must make the sad persephone his friend
        and buried love to second life arise
        again his love must lose through too much love
        must lose his life by living life too true
        for what he sought below is passed above
        already done is all that he would do
        must tune all being with his single lyre
        must melt all rooks free from their primal pain
        must search all nature with his one souls fire
        must bind anew all forms in heavenly chain
        if he already sees what he must do
        well may he shade his eyes from the farshining view

a better comment could not be made on what is required to perfect man and place him in that superior position for which he was designed than by the interpretation of bacon upon the legends of the syren coast “when the wise ulysses passed” says he “he caused his mariners to stop their ears with wax knowing there was in them no power to resist the lure of that voluptuous song but he the much experienced man who wished to be experienced in all and use all to the service of wisdom desired to hear the song that he might understand its meaning yet distrusting his own power to be firm in his better purpose he caused himself to be bound to the mast that he might be kept secure against his own weakness but orpheus passed unfettered so absorbed in singing hymns to the gods that he could not even hear those sounds of degrading enchantment”

meanwhile not a few believe and men themselves have expressed the opinion that the time is come when eurydice is to call for an orpheus rather than orpheus for eurydice that the idea of man however imperfectly brought out has been far more so than that of woman that she the other half of the same thought the other chamber of the heart of life needs now take her turn in the full pulsation and that improvement in the daughters will best aid in the reformation of the sons of this age

it should be remarked that as the principle of liberty is better understood and more nobly interpreted a broader protest is made in behalf of woman as men become aware that few men have had a fair chance they are inclined to say that no women have had a fair chance the french revolution that strangely disguised angel bore witness in favor of woman but interpreted her claims no less ignorantly than those of man its idea of happiness did not rise beyond outward enjoyment unobstructed by the tyranny of others the title it gave was “citoyen” “citoyenne” and it is not unimportant to woman that even this species of equality was awarded her before she could be condemned to perish on the scaffold for treason not as a citizen but as a subject the right with which this title then invested a human being was that of bloodshed and license the goddess of liberty was impure as we read the poem addressed to her not long since by beranger we can scarcely refrain from tears as painful as the tears of blood that flowed when “such crimes were committed in her name” yes man born to purify and animate the unintelligent and the cold can in his madness degrade and pollute no less the fair and the chaste yet truth was prophesied in the ravings of that hideous fever caused by long ignorance and abuse europe is conning a valued lesson from the bloodstained page the same tendencies further unfolded will bear good fruit in this country
yet by men in this country as by the jews when moses was leading them to the promised land everything has been done that inherited depravity could do to hinder the promise of heaven from its fulfilment the cross here as elsewhere has been planted only to be blasphemed by cruelty and fraud the name of the prince of peace has been profaned by all kinds of injustice toward the gentile whom he said he came to save but i need not speak of what has been done towards the red man the black man those deeds are the scoff of the world and they have been accompanied by such pious words that the gentlest would not dare to intercede with “father forgive them for they know not what they do”

here as elsewhere the gain of creation consists always in the growth of individual minds which live and aspire as flowers bloom and birds sing in the midst of morasses and in the continual development of that thought the thought of human destiny which is given to eternity adequately to express and which ages of failure only seemingly impede only seemingly and whatever seems to the contrary this country is as surely destined to elucidate a great moral law as europe was to promote the mental culture of man

though the national independence be blurred by the servility of individuals though freedom and equality have been proclaimed only to leave room for a monstrous display of slavedealing and slavekeeping though the free american so often feels himself free like the roman only to pamper his appetites end his indolence through the misery of his fellowbeings still it is not in vain that the verbal statement has been made “all men are born free and equal” there it stands a golden certainty wherewith to encourage the good to shame the bad the new world may be called clearly to perceive that it incurs the utmost penalty if it reject or oppress the sorrowful brother and if men are deaf the angels hear but men cannot be deaf it is inevitable that an external freedom an independence of the encroachments of other men such as has been achieved for the nation should be so also for every member of it that which has once been clearly conceived in the intelligence cannot fail sooner or later to be acted out it has become a law as irrevocable as that of the medes in their ancient dominion men will privately sin against it but the law as expressed by a leading mind of the age

         “tutti fatti a semblanza dun solo
        figli tutti dun solo riscatto
        in qualora in qual parte del suolo
        trascorriamo quest aura vital
        siam fratelli siam stretti ad un patto
        maladetto colui che lo infrange
        che sinnalza sul finoco che piange
        che contrista uno spirto immortal” footnote manzoni

         “all made in the likeness of the one
        all children of one ransom
        in whatever hour in whatever part of the soil
        we draw this vital air
        we are brothers we must be bound by one compact
        accursed he who infringes it
        who raises himself upon the weak who weep
        who saddens an immortal spirit”

this law cannot fail of universal recognition accursed be he who willingly saddens an immortal spirit—doomed to infamy in later wiser ages doomed in future stages of his own being to deadly penance only short of death accursed be he who sins in ignorance if that ignorance be caused by sloth

we sicken no less at the pomp than the strife of words we feel that never were lungs so puffed with the wind of declamation on moral and religious subjects as now we are tempted to implore these “wordheroes” these wordcatos wordchrists to beware of cant footnote dr johnsons one piece of advice should be written on every door “clear your mind of cant” but byron to whom it was so acceptable in clearing away the noxious vine shook down the building sterlings emendation is worthy of honor

         “realize your cant not cast it off”

above all things to remember that hypocrisy is the most hopeless as well as the meanest of crimes and that those must surely be polluted by it who do not reserve a part of their morality and religion for private use landor says that he cannot have a great deal of mind who cannot afford to let the larger part of it lie fallow and what is true of genius is not less so of virtue the tongue is a valuable member but should appropriate but a small part of the vital juices that are needful all over the body we feel that the mind may “grow black and rancid in the smoke” even “of altars” we start up from the harangue to go into our closet and shut the door there inquires the spirit “is this rhetoric the bloom of healthy blood or a false pigment artfully laid on” and yet again we know where is so much smoke must be some fire with so much talk about virtue and freedom must be mingled some desire for them that it cannot be in vain that such have become the common topics of conversation among men rather than schemes for tyranny and plunder that the very newspapers see it best to proclaim themselves “pilgrims” “puritans” “heralds of holiness” the king that maintains so costly a retinue cannot be a mere boast or carabbas fiction we have waited here long in the dust we are tired and hungry but the triumphal procession must appear at last

of all its banners none has been more steadily upheld and under none have more valor and willingness for real sacrifices been shown than that of the champions of the enslaved african and this band it is which partly from a natural following out of principles partly because many women have been prominent in that cause makes just now the warmest appeal in behalf of woman

though there has been a growing liberality on this subject yet society at large is not so prepared for the demands of this party but that its members are and will be for some time coldly regarded as the jacobins of their day

“is it not enough” cries the irritated trader “that you have done all you could to break up the national union and thus destroy the prosperity of our country but now you must be trying to break up family union to take my wife away from the cradle and the kitchenhearth to vote at polls and preach from a pulpit of course if she does such things she cannot attend to those of her own sphere she is happy enough as she is she has more leisure than i have—every means of improvement every indulgence”

“have you asked her whether she was satisfied with these indulgences”

“no but i know she is she is too amiable to desire what would make me unhappy and too judicious to wish to step beyond the sphere of her sex i will never consent to have our peace disturbed by any such discussions”

“consent—you it is not consent from you that is in question—it is assent from your wife”

“am not i the head of my house”

“you are not the head of your wife god has given her a mind of her own

“i am the head and she the heart”

“god grant you play true to one another then i suppose i am to be grateful that you did not say she was only the hand if the head represses no natural pulse of the heart there can be no question as to your giving your consent both will be of one accord and there needs but to present any question to get a full and true answer there is no need of precaution of indulgence nor consent but our doubt is whether the heart does consent with the head or only obeys its decrees with a passiveness that precludes the exercise of its natural powers or a repugnance that turns sweet qualities to bitter or a doubt that lays waste the fair occasions of life it is to ascertain the truth that we propose some liberating measures”

thus vaguely are these questions proposed and discussed at present but their being proposed at all implies much thought and suggests more many women are considering within themselves what they need that they have not and what they can have if they find they need it many men are considering whether women are capable of being and having more than they are and have and whether if so it will be best to consent to improvement in their condition

this morning i open the boston “daily mail” and find in its “poets corner” a translation of schillers “dignity of woman” in the advertisement of a book on america i see in the table of contents this sequence “republican institutions american slavery american ladies”

i open the “deutsche schnellpost” published in new york and find at the head of a column juden und frauenemancipation in ungarn—”emancipation of jews and women in hungary”

the past year has seen action in the rhode island legislature to secure married women rights over their own property where men showed that a very little examination of the subject could teach them much an article in the democratic review on the same subject more largely considered written by a woman impelled it is said by glaring wrong to a distinguished friend having shown the defects in the existing laws and the state of opinion from which they spring and on answer from the revered old man j q adams in some respects the phocion of his time to an address made him by some ladies to this last i shall again advert in another place

these symptoms of the times have come under my view quite accidentally one who seeks may each month or week collect more

the numerous party whose opinions are already labeled and adjusted too much to their mind to admit of any new light strive by lectures on some modelwoman of bridelike beauty and gentleness by writing and lending little treatises intended to mark out with precision the limits of womans sphere and womans mission to prevent other than the rightful shepherd from climbing the wall or the flock from using any chance to go astray

without enrolling ourselves at once on either side let us look upon the subject from the best point of view which today offers no better it is to be feared than a high housetop a high hilltop or at least a cathedralspire would be desirable

it may well be an antislavery party that pleads for woman if we consider merely that she does not hold property on equal terms with men so that if a husband dies without making a will the wife instead of taking at once his place as head of the family inherits only a part of his fortune often brought him by herself as if she were a child or ward only not an equal partner

we will not speak of the innumerable instances in which profligate and idle men live upon the earnings of industrious wives or if the wives leave them and take with them the children to perform the double duty of mother and father follow from place to place and threaten to rob them of the children if deprived of the rights of a husband as they call them planting themselves in their poor lodgings frightening them into paying tribute by taking from them the children running into debt at the expense of these otherwise so overtasked helots such instances count up by scores within my own memory i have seen the husband who had stained himself by a long course of low vice till his wife was wearied from her heroic forgiveness by finding that his treachery made it useless and that if she would provide bread for herself and her children she must be separate from his ill fame—i have known this man come to install himself in the chamber of a woman who loathed him and say she should never take food without his company i have known these men steal their children whom they knew they had no means to maintain take them into dissolute company expose them to bodily danger to frighten the poor woman to whom it seems the fact that she alone had borne the pangs of their birth and nourished their infancy does not give an equal right to them i do believe that this mode of kidnapping—and it is frequent enough in all classes of society—will be by the next age viewed as it is by heaven now and that the man who avails himself of the shelter of mens laws to steal from a mother her own children or arrogate any superior right in them save that of superior virtue will bear the stigma he deserves in common with him who steals grown men from their motherland their hopes and their homes

i said we will not speak of this now yet i have spoken for the subject makes me feel too much i could give instances that would startle the most vulgar and callous but i will not for the public opinion of their own sex is already against such men and where cases of extreme tyranny are made known there is private action in the wifes favor but she ought not to need this nor i think can she long men must soon see that as on their own ground woman is the weaker party she ought to have legal protection which would make such oppression impossible but i would not deal with “atrocious instances” except in the way of illustration neither demand from men a partial redress in some one matter but go to the root of the whole if principles could be established particulars would adjust themselves aright ascertain the true destiny of woman give her legitimate hopes and a standard within herself marriage and all other relations would by degrees be harmonized with these

but to return to the historical progress of this matter knowing that there exists in the minds of men a tone of feeling toward women as toward slaves such as is expressed in the common phrase “tell that to women and children” that the infinite soul can only work through them in already ascertained limits that the gift of reason mans highest prerogative is allotted to them in much lower degree that they must be kept from mischief and melancholy by being constantly engaged in active labor which is to be furnished and directed by those better able to think c c—we need not multiply instances for who can review the experience of last week without recalling words which imply whether in jest or earnest these views or views like these—knowing this can we wonder that many reformers think that measures are not likely to be taken in behalf of women unless their wishes could be publicly represented by women

“that can never be necessary” cry the other side “all men are privately influenced by women each has his wife sister or female friends and is too much biased by these relations to fail of representing their interests and if this is not enough let them propose and enforce their wishes with the pen the beauty of home would be destroyed the delicacy of the sex be violated the dignity of halls of legislation degraded by an attempt to introduce them there such duties are inconsistent with those of a mother” and then we have ludicrous pictures of ladies in hysterics at the polls and senatechambers filled with cradles

but if in reply we admit as truth that woman seems destined by nature rather for the inner circle we must add that the arrangements of civilized life have not been as yet such as to secure it to her her circle if the duller is not the quieter if kept from “excitement” she is not from drudgery not only the indian squaw carries the burdens of the camp but the favorites of louis xiv accompany him in his journeys and the washerwoman stands at her tub and carries home her work at all seasons and in all states of health those who think the physical circumstances of woman would make a part in the affairs of national government unsuitable are by no means those who think it impossible for negresses to endure fieldwork even during pregnancy or for sempstresses to go through their killing labors

as to the use of the pen there was quite as much opposition to womans possessing herself of that help to free agency as there is now to her seizing on the rostrum or the desk and she is likely to draw from a permission to plead her cause that way opposite inferences to what might be wished by those who now grant it

as to the possibility of her filling with grace and dignity any such position we should think those who had seen the great actresses and heard the quaker preachers of modern times would not doubt that woman can express publicly the fulness of thought and creation without losing any of the peculiar beauty of her sex what can pollute and tarnish is to act thus from any motive except that something needs to be said or done woman could take part in the processions the songs the dances of old religion no one fancied her delicacy was impaired by appearing in public for such a cause

as to her home she is not likely to leave it more than she now does for balls theatres meetings for promoting missions revival meetings and others to which she flies in hope of an animation for her existence commensurate with what she sees enjoyed by men governors of ladiesfairs are no less engrossed by such a charge than the governor of a state by his presidents of washingtonian societies no less away from home than presidents of conventions if men look straitly to it they will find that unless their lives are domestic those of the women will not be a house is no home unless it contain food and fire for the mind as well as for the body the female greek of our day is as much in the street as the male to cry “what news” we doubt not it was the same in athens of old the women shut out from the marketplace made up for it at the religious festivals for human beings are not so constituted that they can live without expansion if they do not get it in one way they must in another or perish

as to mens representing women fairly at present while we hear from men who owe to their wives not only all that is comfortable or graceful but all that is wise in the arrangement of their lives the frequent remark “you cannot reason with a woman”—when from those of delicacy nobleness and poetic culture falls the contemptuous phrase “women and children” and that in no light sally of the hour but in works intended to give a permanent statement of the best experiences—when not one man in the million shall i say no not in the hundred million can rise above the belief that woman was made for man—when such traits as these are daily forced upon the attention can we feel that man will always do justice to the interests of woman can we think that he takes a sufficiently discerning and religious view of her office and destiny ever to do her justice except when prompted by sentiment—accidentally or transiently that is for the sentiment will vary according to the relations in which he is placed the lover the poet the artist are likely to view her nobly the father and the philosopher have some chance of liberality the man of the world the legislator for expediency none

under these circumstances without attaching importance in themselves to the changes demanded by the champions of woman we hail them as signs of the times we would have every arbitrary barrier thrown down we would have every path laid open to woman as freely as to man were this done and a slight temporary fermentation allowed to subside we should see crystallizations more pure and of more various beauty we believe the divine energy would pervade nature to a degree unknown in the history of former ages and that no discordant collision but a ravishing harmony of the spheres would ensue

yet then and only then will mankind be ripe for this when inward and outward freedom for woman as much as for man shall be acknowledged as a right not yielded as a concession as the friend of the negro assumes that one man cannot by right hold another in bondage so should the friend of woman assume that man cannot by right lay even wellmeant restrictions on woman if the negro be a soul if the woman be a soul apparelled in flesh to one master only are they accountable there is but one law for souls and if there is to be an interpreter of it he must come not as man or son of man but as son of god

were thought and feeling once so far elevated that man should esteem himself the brother and friend but nowise the lord and tutor of woman—were he really bound with her in equal worship—arrangements as to function and employment would be of no consequence what woman needs is not as a woman to act or rule but as a nature to grow as an intellect to discern as a soul to live freely and unimpeded to unfold such powers as were given her when we left our common home if fewer talents were given her yet if allowed the free and full employment of these so that she may render back to the giver his own with usury she will not complain nay i dare to say she will bless and rejoice in her earthly birthplace her earthly lot let us consider what obstructions impede this good era and what signs give reason to hope that it draws near

i was talking on this subject with miranda a woman who if any in the world could might speak without heat and bitterness of the position of her sex her father was a man who cherished no sentimental reverence for woman but a firm belief in the equality of the sexes she was his eldest child and came to him at an age when he needed a companion from the time she could speak and go alone he addressed her not as a plaything but as a living mind among the few verses he ever wrote was a copy addressed to this child when the first locks were cut from her head and the reverence expressed on this occasion for that cherished head he never belied it was to him the temple of immortal intellect he respected his child however too much to be an indulgent parent he called on her for clear judgment for courage for honor and fidelity in short for such virtues as he knew in so far as he possessed the keys to the wonders of this universe he allowed free use of them to her and by the incentive of a high expectation he forbade so far as possible that she should let the privilege lie idle

thus this child was early led to feel herself a child of the spirit she took her place easily not only in the world of organized being but in the world of mind a dignified sense of selfdependence was given as all her portion and she found it a sure anchor herself securely anchored her relations with others were established with equal security she was fortunate in a total absence of those charms which might have drawn to her bewildering flatteries and in a strong electric nature which repelled those who did not belong to her and attracted those who did with men and women her relations were noble—affectionate without passion intellectual without coldness the world was free to her and she lived freely in it outward adversity came and inward conflict but that faith and selfrespect had early been awakened which must always lead at last to an outward serenity and an inward peace

of miranda i had always thought as an example that the restraints upon the sex were insuperable only to those who think them so or who noisily strive to break them she had taken a course of her own and no man stood in her way many of her acts had been unusual but excited no uproar few helped but none checked her and the many men who knew her mind and her life showed to her confidence as to a brother gentleness as to a sister and not only refined but very coarse men approved and aided one in whom they saw resolution and clearness of design her mind was often the leading one always effective

when i talked with her upon these matters and had said very much what i have written she smilingly replied “and yet we must admit that i have been fortunate and this should not be my good fathers early trust gave the first bias and the rest followed of course it is true that i have had less outward aid in after years than most women but that is of little consequence religion was early awakened in my soul—a sense that what the soul is capable to ask it must attain and that though i might be aided and instructed by others i must depend on myself as the only constant friend this selfdependence which was honored in me is deprecated as a fault in most women they are taught to learn their rule from without not to unfold it from within

“this is the fault of man who is still vain and wishes to be more important to woman than by right he should be”

“men have not shown this disposition toward you” i said

“no because the position i early was enabled to take was one of selfreliance and were all women as sure of their wants as i was the result would be the same but they are so overloaded with precepts by guardians who think that nothing is so much to be dreaded for a woman as originality of thought or character that their minds are impeded by doubts till they lose their chance of fair free proportions the difficulty is to got them to the point from which they shall naturally develop selfrespect and learn selfhelp

“once i thought that men would help to forward this state of things more than i do now i saw so many of them wretched in the connections they had formed in weakness and vanity they seemed so glad to esteem women whenever they could

“the soft arms of affection said one of the most discerning spirits will not suffice for me unless on them i see the steel bracelets of strength

“but early i perceived that men never in any extreme of despair wished to be women on the contrary they were ever ready to taunt one another at any sign of weakness with

“art thou not like the women who—
the passage ends various ways according to the occasion and rhetoric of the speaker when they admired any woman they were inclined to speak of her as above her sex silently i observed this and feared it argued a rooted scepticism which for ages had been fastening on the heart and which only an age of miracles could eradicate ever i have been treated with great sincerity and i look upon it as a signal instance of this that an intimate friend of the other sex said in a fervent moment that i deserved in some star to be a man he was much surprised when i disclosed my view of my position and hopes when i declared my faith that the feminine side the side of love of beauty of holiness was now to have its full chance and that if either were better it was better now to be a woman for even the slightest achievement of good was furthering an especial work of our time he smiled incredulously she makes the best she can of it thought he let jews believe the pride of jewry but i am of the better sort and know better

“another used as highest praise in speaking of a character in literature the words a manly woman

“so in the noble passage of ben jonson

        i meant the daystar should not brighter ride
        nor shed like influence from its lucent seat
        i meant she should be courteous facile sweet
        free from that solemn vice of greatness pride
        i meant each softest virtue there should meet
        fit in that softer bosom to abide
        only a learned and a manly soul
        i purposed her that should with even powers
        the rock the spindle and the shears control
        of destiny and spin her own free hours“

“me thinks” said i “you are too fastidious in objecting to this jonson in using the word manly only meant to heighten the picture of this the true the intelligent fate with one of the deeper colors”

“and yet” said she “so invariable is the use of this word where a heroic quality is to be described and i feel so sure that persistence and courage are the most womanly no less than the most manly qualities that i would exchange these words for others of a larger sense at the risk of marring the fine tissue of the verse read a heavenward and instructed soul and i should be satisfied let it not be said wherever there is energy or creative genius she has a masculine mind“

this by no means argues a willing want of generosity toward woman man is as generous towards her as he knows how to be

wherever she has herself arisen in national or private history and nobly shone forth in any form of excellence men have received her not only willingly but with triumph their encomiums indeed are always in some sense mortifying they show too much surprise “can this be you” he cries to the transfigured cinderella “well i should never have thought it but i am very glad we will tell every one that you have surpassed your sex“

in everyday life the feelings of the many are stained with vanity each wishes to be lord in a little world to be superior at least over one and he does not feel strong enough to retain a lifelong ascendency over a strong nature only a theseus could conquer before he wed the amazonian queen hercules wished rather to rest with dejanira and received the poisoned robe as a fit guerdon the tale should be interpreted to all those who seek repose with the weak

but not only is man vain and fond of power but the same want of development which thus affects him morally prevents his intellectually discerning the destiny of woman the boy wants no woman but only a girl to play ball with him and mark his pocket handkerchief

thus in schillers dignity of woman beautiful as the poem is there is no “grave and perfect man” but only a great boy to be softened and restrained by the influence of girls poets—the elder brothers of their race—have usually seen further but what can you expect of everyday men if schiller was not more prophetic as to what women must be even with richter one foremost thought about a wife was that she would “cook him something good” but as this is a delicate subject and we are in constant danger of being accused of slighting what are called “the functions” let me say in behalf of miranda and myself that we have high respect for those who “cook something good” who create and preserve fair order in houses and prepare therein the shining raiment for worthy inmates worthy guests only these “functions” must not be a drudgery or enforced necessity but a part of life let ulysses drive the beeves home while penelope there piles up the fragrant loaves they are both well employed if these be done in thought and love willingly but penelope is no more meant for a baker or weaver solely than ulysses for a cattleherd
the sexes should not only correspond to and appreciate but prophesy to one another in individual instances this happens two persons love in one another the future good which they aid one another to unfold this is imperfectly or rarely done in the general life man has gone but little way now he is waiting to see whether woman can keep step with him but instead of calling but like a good brother “you can do it if you only think so” or impersonally “any one can do what he tries to do” he often discourages with schoolboy brag “girls cant do that girls cant play ball” but let any one defy their taunts break through and be brave and secure they rend the air with shouts

this fluctuation was obvious in a narrative i have lately seen the story of the life of countess emily plater the heroine of the last revolution in poland the dignity the purity the concentrated resolve the calm deep enthusiasm which yet could when occasion called sparkle up a holy an indignant fire make of this young maiden the figure i want for my frontispiece her portrait is to be seen in the book a gentle shadow of her soul short was the career like the maid of orleans she only did enough to verify her credentials and then passed from a scene on which she was probably a premature apparition

when the young girl joined the army where the report of her exploits had preceded her she was received in a manner that marks the usual state of feeling some of the officers were disappointed at her quiet manners that she had not the air and tone of a stageheroine they thought she could not have acted heroically unless in buskins had no idea that such deeds only showed the habit of her mind others talked of the delicacy of her sex advised her to withdraw from perils and dangers and had no comprehension of the feelings within her breast that made this impossible the gentle irony of her reply to these selfconstituted tutors not one of whom showed himself her equal in conduct or reason is as good as her indignant reproof at a later period to the general whose perfidy ruined all

but though to the mass of these men she was an embarrassment and a puzzle the nobler sort viewed her with a tender enthusiasm worthy of her “her name” said her biographer “is known throughout europe i paint her character that she may be as widely loved”

with pride he shows her freedom from all personal affections that though tender and gentle in an uncommon degree there was no room for a private love in her consecrated life she inspired those who knew her with a simple energy of feeling like her own “we have seen” they felt “a woman worthy the name capable of all sweet affections capable of stern virtue”

it is a fact worthy of remark that all these revolutions in favor of liberty have produced female champions that share the same traits but emily alone has found a biographer only a near friend could have performed for her this task for the flower was reared in feminine seclusion and the few and simple traits of her history before her appearance in the field could only have been known to the domestic circle her biographer has gathered them up with a brotherly devotion

no man is not willingly ungenerous he wants faith and love because he is not yet himself an elevated being he cries with sneering scepticism “give us a sign” but if the sign appears his eyes glisten and he offers not merely approval but homage

the severe nation which taught that the happiness of the race was forfeited through the fault of a woman and showed its thought of what sort of regard man owed her by making him accuse her on the first question to his god—who gave her to the patriarch as a handmaid and by the mosaical law bound her to allegiance like a serf—even they greeted with solemn rapture all great and holy women as heroines prophetesses judges in israel and if they made eve listen to the serpent gave mary as a bride to the holy spirit in other nations it has been the same down to our day to the woman who could conquer a triumph was awarded and not only those whose strength was recommended to the heart by association with goodness and beauty but those who were bad if they were steadfast and strong had their claims allowed in any age a semiramis an elizabeth of england a catharine of russia makes her place good whether in a large or small circle how has a little wit a little genius been celebrated in a woman what an intellectual triumph was that of the lonely aspasia and how heartily acknowledged she indeed met a pericles but what annalist the rudest of men the most plebeian of husbands will spare from his page one of the few anecdotes of roman women—sappho eloisa the names are of threadbare celebrity indeed they were not more suitably met in their own time than the countess colonel plater on her first joining the army they had much to mourn and their great impulses did not find due scope but with time enough space enough their kindred appear on the scene across the ages forms lean trying to touch the hem of their retreating robes the youth here by my side cannot be weary of the fragments from the life of sappho he will not believe they are not addressed to himself or that he to whom they were addressed could be ungrateful a recluse of high powers devotes himself to understand and explain the thought of eloisa he asserts her vast superiority in soul and genius to her master he curses the fate that casts his lot in another age than hers he could have understood her he would have been to her a friend such as abelard never could and this one woman he could have loved and reverenced and she alas lay cold in her grave hundreds of years ago his sorrow is truly pathetic these responses that come too late to give joy are as tragic as anything we know and yet the tears of later ages glitter as they fall on tassos prison bars and we know how elevating to the captive is the security that somewhere an intelligence must answer to his

the man habitually most narrow towards woman will be flushed as by the worst assault on christianity if you say it has made no improvement in her condition indeed those most opposed to new acts in her favor are jealous of the reputation of those which have been done

we will not speak of the enthusiasm excited by actresses improvisatrici female singers—for here mingles the charm of beauty and grace—but female authors even learned women if not insufferably ugly and slovenly from the italian professors daughter who taught behind the curtain down to mrs carter and madame dacier are sure of an admiring audience and what is far better chance to use what they have learned and to learn more if they can once get a platform on which to stand

but how to get this platform or how to make it of reasonably easy access is the difficulty plants of great vigor will almost always struggle into blossom despite impediments but there should be encouragement and a free genial atmosphere for those of move timid sort fair play for each in its own kind some are like the little delicate flowers which love to hide in the dripping mosses by the sides of mountain torrents or in the shade of tall trees but others require an open field a rich and loosened soil or they never show their proper hues

it may be said that man does not have his fair play either his energies are repressed and distorted by the interposition of artificial obstacles ay but he himself has put them there they have grown out of his own imperfections if there is a misfortune in womans lot it is in obstacles being interposed by men which do not mark her state and if they express her past ignorance do not her present needs as every man is of woman born she has slow but sure means of redress yet the sooner a general justness of thought makes smooth the path the better

man is of woman born and her face bends over him in infancy with an expression he can never quite forget eminent men have delighted to pay tribute to this image and it is an hackneyed observation that most men of genius boast some remarkable development in the mother the rudest tar brushes off a tear with his coatsleeve at the hallowed name the other day i met a decrepit old man of seventy on a journey who challenged the stage company to guess where he was going they guessed aright “to see your mother” “yes” said he “she is ninetytwo but has good eyesight still they say i have not seen her these forty years and i thought i could not die in peace without” i should have liked his picture painted as a companionpiece to that of a boisterous little boy whom i saw attempt to declaim at a school exhibition—

“o that those lips had language life has passed
with me but roughly since i heard thee last”
he got but very little way before sudden tears shamed him from the stage

some gleams of the same expression which shone down upon his infancy angelically pure and benign visit man again with hopes of pure love of a holy marriage or if not before in the eyes of the mother of his child they again are seen and dim fancies pass before his mind that woman may not have been born for him alone but have come from heaven a commissioned soul a messenger of truth and love that she can only make for him a home in which he may lawfully repose in so far as she is

         “true to the kindred points of heaven and home”

in gleams in dim fancies this thought visits the mind of common men it is soon obscured by the mists of sensuality the dust of routine and he thinks it was only some meteor or ignis fatuus that shone but as a rosicrucian lamp it burns unwearied though condemned to the solitude of tombs and to its permanent life as to every truth each age has in some form borne witness for the truths which visit the minds of careless men only in fitful gleams shine with radiant clearness into those of the poet the priest and the artist

whatever may have been the domestic manners of the ancients the idea of woman was nobly manifested in their mythologies and poems whore she appears as site in the ramayana a form of tender purity as the egyptian isis footnote for an adequate description of the isis see appendix a of divine wisdom never yet surpassed in egypt too the sphynx walking the earth with lion tread looked out upon its marvels in the calm inscrutable beauty of a virgins face and the greek could only add wings to the great emblem in greece ceres and proserpine significantly termed “the great goddesses” were seen seated side by side they needed not to rise for any worshipper or any change they were prepared for all things as those initiated to their mysteries knew more obvious is the meaning of these three forms the diana minerva and vesta unlike in the expression of their beauty but alike in this—that each was selfsufficing other forms were only accessories and illustrations none the complement to one like these another might indeed be the companion and the apollo and diana set off one anothers beauty of the vesta it is to be observed that not only deepeyed deepdiscerning greece but ruder rome who represents the only form of good man the always busy warrior that could be indifferent to woman confided the permanence of its glory to a tutelary goddess and her wisest legislator spoke of meditation as a nymph

perhaps in rome the neglect of woman was a reaction on the manners of etruria where the priestess queen warrior queen would seem to have been so usual a character

an instance of the noble roman marriage where the stern and calm nobleness of the nation was common to both we see in the historic page through the little that is told us of brutus and portia shakspeare has seized on the relation in its native lineaments harmonizing the particular with the universal and while it is conjugal love and no other making it unlike the same relation as seen in cymbeline or othello even as one star differeth from another in glory

         “by that great vow
        which did incorporate and make us one
        unfold to me yourself your other half
        why you are heavy 
        dwell i but in the suburbs
        of your good pleasure if it be no more
        portia is brutus harlot not his wife”

mark the sad majesty of his tone in answer who would not have lent a lifelong credence to that voice of honor

         “you are my true and honorable wife
        as dear to me as are the ruddy drops
        that visit this sad heart”

it is the same voice that tells the moral of his life in the last words—

         “countrymen
        my heart doth joy that yet in all my life
        i found no man but he was true to me”
        it was not wonderful that it should be so

shakspeare however was not content to let portia rest her plea for confidence on the essential nature of the marriage bond

         “i grant i am a woman but withal
        a woman that lord brutus took to wife
        i grant i am a woman but withal
        a woman well reputed—catos daughter
        think you i am no stronger than my sex
        being so fathered and so husbanded”

and afterward in the very scene where brutus is suffering under that “insupportable and touching loss” the death of his wife cassius pleads—

         “have you not love enough to bear with me
        when that rash humor which my mother gave me
        makes me forgetful

        brutus—yes cassius and henceforth
        when you are overearnest with your brutus
        hell think your mother chides and leaves you so”

as indeed it was a frequent belief among the ancients as with our indians that the body was inherited from the mother the soul from the father as in that noble passage of ovid already quoted where jupiter as his divine synod are looking down on the funeral pyre of hercules thus triumphs—

         “neo nisi materna vulcanum parte potentem
        sentiet aeternum est à me quod traxit et expers
        atque immune neois nullaque domabile flamma
        idque ego defunctum terrà coelestibus oris
        accipiam cunctisque meum laetabile factum
        dis fore confido

         “the part alone of gross maternal flame
        fire shall devour while that from me he drew
        shall live immortal and its force renew
        that when hes dead ill raise to realms above
        let all the powers the righteous act approve”

it is indeed a god speaking of his union with an earthly woman but it expresses the common roman thought as to marriage—the same which permitted a man to lend his wife to a friend as if she were a chattel

         “she dwelt but in the suburbs of his good pleasure”

yet the same city as i have said leaned on the worship of vesta the preserver and in later times was devoted to that of isis in sparta thought in this respect as in all others was expressed in the characters of real life and the women of sparta were as much spartans as the men the “citoyen citoyenne” of france was here actualized was not the calm equality they enjoyed as honorable as the devotion of chivalry they intelligently shared the ideal life of their nation

like the men they felt

         “honor gone alls gone
        better never have been born”

they were the true friends of men the spartan surely would not think that he received only his body from his mother the sage had he lived in that community could not have thought the souls of “vain and foppish men will be degraded after death to the forms of women and if they do not then make great efforts to retrieve themselves will become birds”

by the way it is very expressive of the hard intellectuality of the merely mannish mind to speak thus of birds chosen always by the feminine poet as the symbols of his fairest thoughts

we are told of the greek nations in general that woman occupied there an infinitely lower place than man it is difficult to believe this when we see such range and dignity of thought on the subject in the mythologies and find the poets producing such ideals as cassandra iphigenia antigone macaria where sibylline priestesses told the oracle of the highest god and he could not be content to reign with a court of fewer than nine muses even victory wore a female form

but whatever were the facts of daily life i cannot complain of the age and nation which represents its thought by such a symbol as i see before me at this moment it is a zodiac of the busts of gods and goddesses arranged in pairs the circle breathes the music of a heavenly order male and female heads are distinct in expression but equal in beauty strength and calmness each male head is that of a brother and a king—each female of a sister and a queen could the thought thus expressed be lived out there would be nothing more to be desired there would be unison in variety congeniality in difference

coming nearer our own time we find religion and poetry no less true in their revelations the rude man just disengaged from the sod the adam accuses woman to his god and records her disgrace to their posterity he is not ashamed to write that he could be drawn from heaven by one beneath him—one made he says from but a small part of himself but in the same nation educated by time instructed by a succession of prophets we find woman in as high a position as she has ever occupied no figure that has ever arisen to greet our eyes has been received with more fervent reverence than that of the madonna heine calls her the dame du comptoir of the catholic church and this jeer well expresses a serious truth

and not only this holy and significant image was worshipped by the pilgrim and the favorite subject of the artist but it exercised an immediate influence on the destiny of the sex the empresses who embraced the cross converted sons and husbands whole calendars of female saints heroic dames of chivalry binding the emblem of faith on the heart of the bestbeloved and wasting the bloom of youth in separation and loneliness for the sake of duties they thought it religion to assume with innumerable forms of poesy trace their lineage to this one nor however imperfect may be the action in our day of the faith thus expressed and though we can scarcely think it nearer this ideal than that of india or greece was near their ideal is it in vain that the truth has been recognized that woman is not only a part of man bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh born that men might not be lonely—but that women are in themselves possessors of and possessed by immortal souls this truth undoubtedly received a greater outward stability from the belief of the church that the earthly parent of the saviour of souls was a woman

the assumption of the virgin as painted by sublime artists as also petrarchs hymn to the madonna footnote appendix b cannot have spoken to the world wholly without result yet oftentimes those who had ears heard not

see upon the nations the influence of this powerful example in spain look only at the ballads woman in these is “very woman” she is the betrothed the bride the spouse of man there is on her no hue of the philosopher the heroine the savante but she looks great and noble why because she is also through her deep devotion the betrothed of heaven her upturned eyes have drawn down the light that casts a radiance round her see only such a ballad as that of “lady teresas bridal” where the infanta given to the moorish bridegroom calls down the vengeance of heaven on his unhallowed passion and thinks it not too much to expiate by a life in the cloister the involuntary stain upon her princely youth footnote appendix c it was this constant sense of claims above those of earthly love or happiness that made the spanish lady who shared this spirit a guerdon to be won by toils and blood and constant purity rather than a chattel to be bought for pleasure and service

germany did hot need to learn a high view of woman it was inborn in that race woman was to the teuton warrior his priestess his friend his sister—in truth a wife and the christian statues of noble pairs as they lie above their graves in stone expressing the meaning of all the bygone pilgrimage by hands folded in mutual prayer yield not a nobler sense of the place and powers of woman than belonged to the altvater day the holy love of christ which summoned them also to choose “the better part—that which could not be taken from them” refined and hallowed in this nation a native faith thus showing that it was not the warlike spirit alone that left the latins so barbarous in this respect

but the germans taking so kindly to this thought did it the more justice the idea of woman in their literature is expressed both to a greater height and depth than elsewhere

i will give as instances the themes of three ballads

one is upon a knight who had always the name of the virgin on his lips this protected him all his life through in various and beautiful modes both from sin and other dangers and when he died a plant sprang from his grave which so gently whispered the ave maria that none could pass it by with an unpurified heart

another is one of the legends of the famous drachenfels a maiden one of the earliest converts to christianity was carried by the enraged populace to this dread haunt of “the dragons fabled brood” to be their prey she was left alone but undismayed for she knew in whom she trusted so when the dragons came rushing towards her she showed them a crucifix and they crouched reverently at her feet next day the people came and seeing these wonders were all turned to the faith which exalts the lowly

the third i have in mind is another of the rhine legends a youth is sitting with the maid he loves on the shore of an isle her fairy kingdom then perfumed by the blossoming grapevines which draped its bowers they are happy all blossoms with them and life promises its richest vine a boat approaches on the tide it pauses at their foot it brings perhaps some joyous message fresh dew for their flowers fresh light on the wave no it is the usual check on such great happiness the father of the count departs for the crusade will his son join him or remain to rule their domain and wed her he loves neither of the affianced pair hesitates a moment “i must go with my father”—”thou must go with thy father” it was one thought one word “i will be here again” he said “when these blossoms have turned to purple grapes” “i hope so” she sighed while the prophetic sense said “no”

and there she waited and the grapes ripened and were gathered into the vintage and he came not year after year passed thus and no tidings yet still she waited

he meanwhile was in a moslem prison long he languished there without hope till at last his patron saint appeared in vision and announced his release but only on condition of his joining the monastic order for the service of the saint

and so his release was effected and a safe voyage home given and once more he sets sail upon the rhine the maiden still watching beneath the vines sees at last the object of all this patient love approach—approach but not to touch the strand to which she with outstretched arms has rushed he dares not trust himself to land but in low heartbroken tones tells her of heavens will and that he in obedience to his vow is now on his way to a convent on the riverbank there to pass the rest of his earthly life in the service of the shrine and then he turns his boat and floats away from her and hope of any happiness in this world but urged as he believes by the breath of heaven

the maiden stands appalled but she dares not murmur and cannot hesitate long she also bids them prepare her boat she follows her lost love to the convent gate requests an interview with the abbot and devotes her elysian isle where vines had ripened their ruby fruit in vain for her to the service of the monastery where her love was to serve then passing over to the nunnery opposite she takes the veil and meets her betrothed at the altar and for a lifelong union if not the one they had hoped in earlier years

is not this sorrowful story of a lofty beauty does it not show a sufficiently high view of woman of marriage this is commonly the chivalric still more the german view

yet wherever there was a balance in the mind of man of sentiment with intellect such a result was sure the greek xenophon has not only painted us a sweet picture of the domestic woman in his economics but in the cyropedia has given in the picture of panthea a view of woman which no german picture can surpass whether lonely and quiet with veiled lids the temple of a vestal loveliness or with eyes flashing and hair flowing to the free wind cheering on the hero to fight for his god his country or whatever name his duty might bear at the time this picture i shall copy by and by yet xenophon grew up in the same age with him who makes iphigenia say to achilles

“better a thousand women should perish than one man cease to see
the light”
this was the vulgar greek sentiment xenophon aiming at the ideal man caught glimpses of the ideal woman also from the figure of a cyrus the pantheas stand not afar they do not in thought they would not in life

i could swell the catalogue of instances far beyond the readers patience but enough have been brought forward to show that though there has been great disparity betwixt the nations as between individuals in their culture on this point yet the idea of woman has always cast some rays and often been forcibly represented

far less has woman to complain that she has not had her share of power this in all ranks of society except the lowest has been hers to the extent that vanity would crave far beyond what wisdom would accept in the very lowest where man pressed by poverty sees in woman only the partner of toils and cares and cannot hope scarcely has an idea of a comfortable home he often maltreats her and is less influenced by her in all ranks those who are gentle and uncomplaining too candid to intrigue too delicate to encroach suffer much they suffer long and are kind verily they have their reward but wherever man is sufficiently raised above extreme poverty or brutal stupidity to care for the comforts of the fireside or the bloom and ornament of life woman has always power enough if she choose to exert it and is usually disposed to do so in proportion to her ignorance and childish vanity unacquainted with the importance of life and its purposes trained to a selfish coquetry and love of petty power she does not look beyond the pleasure of making herself felt at the moment and governments are shaken and commerce broken up to gratify the pique of a female favorite the english shopkeepers wife does not vote but it is for her interest that the politician canvasses by the coarsest flattery france suffers no woman on her throne but her proud nobles kiss the dust at the feet of pompadour and dubarry for such flare in the lighted foreground where a roland would modestly aid in the closet spain that same spain which sang of ximena and the lady teresa shuts up her women in the care of duennas and allows them no book but the breviary but the ruin follows only the more surely from the worthless favorite of a worthless queen relying on mean precautions men indeed cry peace peace where there is no peace

it is not the transient breath of poetic incense that women want each can receive that from a lover it is not lifelong sway it needs but to become a coquette a shrew or a good cook to be sure of that it is not money nor notoriety nor the badges of authority which men have appropriated to themselves if demands made in their behalf lay stress on any of these particulars those who make them have not searched deeply into the need the want is for that which at once includes these and precludes them which would not be forbidden power lest there be temptation to steal and misuse it which would not have the mind perverted by flattery from a worthiness of esteem it is for that which is the birthright of every being capable of receiving it—the freedom the religious the intelligent freedom of the universe to use its means to learn its secret as far as nature has enabled them with god alone for their guide and their judge

ye cannot believe it men but the only reason why women over assume what is more appropriate to you is because you prevent them from finding out what is fit for themselves were they free were they wise fully to develop the strength and beauty of woman they would never wish to be men or manlike the wellinstructed moon flies not from her orbit to seize on the glories of her partner no for she knows that one law rules one heaven contains one universe replies to them alike it is with women as with the slave

         “vor dem sklaven wenn er die kette bricht
        vor dem frelen menschen erzittert nicht”

tremble not before the free man but before the slave who has chains to break

in slavery acknowledged slavery women are on a par with men each is a worktool an article of property no more in perfect freedom such as is painted in olympus in swedenborgs angelic state in the heaven where there is no marrying nor giving in marriage each is a purified intelligence an enfranchised soul—no less

         “jene himmlische gestalten
        sie fragen nicht nach mann und welb
        und keine kielder keine falten
        umgeben den verklarten leib”

the child who song this was a prophetic form expressive of the longing for a state of perfect freedom pure love she could not remain here but was translated to another air and it may be that the air of this earth will never be so tempered that such can bear it long but while they stay they must bear testimony to the truth they are constituted to demand

that an era approaches which shall approximate nearer to such a temper than any has yet done there are many tokens indeed so many that only a few of the most prominent can here be enumerated

the reigns of elizabeth of england and isabella of castile foreboded this era they expressed the beginning of the new state while they forwarded its progress these were strong characters and in harmony with the wants of their time one showed that this strength did not unfit a woman for the duties of a wife and a mother the other that it could enable her to live and die alone a wide energetic life a courageous death elizabeth is certainly no pleasing example in rising above the weakness she did not lay aside the foibles ascribed to her sex but her strength must be respected now as it was in her own time

mary stuart and elizabeth seem types moulded by the spirit of the time and placed upon an elevated platform to show to the coming ages woman such as the conduct and wishes of man in general is likely to make her the first shows woman lovely even to allurement quick in apprehension and weak in judgment with grace and dignity of sentiment but no principle credulous and indiscreet yet artful capable of sudden greatness or of crime but not of a steadfast wisdom nor selfrestraining virtue the second reveals woman halfemancipated and jealous of her freedom such as she has figured before or since in many a combative attitude mannish not equally manly strong and prudent more than great or wise able to control vanity and the wish to rule through coquetry and passion but not to resign these dear deceits from the very foundation as unworthy a being capable of truth and nobleness elizabeth taught by adversity put on her virtues as armor more than produced them in a natural order from her soul the time and her position called on her to act the wise sovereign and she was proud that she could do so but her tastes and inclinations would have led her to act the weak woman she was without magnanimity of any kind

we may accept as an omen for ourselves that it was isabella who furnished columbus with the means of coming hither this land must pay back its debt to woman without whose aid it would not have been brought into alliance with the civilized world

a graceful and meaning figure is that introduced to us by mr prescott in the conquest of mexico in the indian girl marina who accompanied cortez and was his interpreter in all the various difficulties of his career she stood at his side on the walls of the besieged palace to plead with her enraged countrymen by her name he was known in new spain and after the conquest her gentle intercession was often of avail to the conquered the poem of the future may be read in some features of the story of “malinche”

the influence of elizabeth on literature was real though by sympathy with its finer productions she was no more entitled to give name to an era than queen anne it was simply that the fact of having a female sovereign on the throne affected the course of a writers thoughts in this sense the presence of a woman on the throne always makes its mark life is lived before the eyes of men by which their imaginations are stimulated as to the possibilities of woman “we will die for our king maria theresa” cry the wild warriors clashing their swords and the sounds vibrate through the poems of that generation the range of female character in spenser alone might content us for one period britomart and belphoebe have as much room on the canvas as florimel and where this is the case the haughtiest amazon will not murmur that una should be felt to be the fairest type

unlike as was the english queen to a fairy queen we may yet conceive that it was the image of a queen before the poets mind that called up this splendid court of women shakspeares range is also great but he has left out the heroic characters such as the macaria of greece the britomart of spenser ford and massinger have in this respect soared to a higher flight of feeling than he it was the holy and heroic woman they most loved and if they could not paint an imogen a desdemona a rosalind yet in those of a stronger mould they showed a higher ideal though with so much less poetic power to embody it than we see in portia or isabella the simple truth of cordelia indeed is of this sort the beauty of cordelia is neither male nor female it is the beauty of virtue

the ideal of love and marriage rose high in the mind of all the christian nations who were capable of grave and deep feeling we may take as examples of its english aspect the lines

         “i could not love thee dear so much
        loved i not honor more”

or the address of the commonwealths man to his wife as she looked out from the tower window to see him for the last time on his way to the scaffold he stood up in the cart waved his hat and cried “to heaven my love to heaven and leave you in the storm”

such was the love of faith and honor—a love which stopped like colonel hutchinsons “on this side idolatry” because it was religious the meeting of two such souls donne describes as giving birth to an “abler soul”

lord herbert wrote to his love

         “were not our souls immortal made
        our equal loves can make them such”

in the “broken heart” of ford penthea a character which engages my admiration even more deeply than the famous one of calanthe is made to present to the mind the most beautiful picture of what these relations should be in their purity her life cannot sustain the violation of what she so clearly feels

shakspeare too saw that in true love as in fire the utmost ardor is coincident with the utmost purity it is a true lover that exclaims in the agony of othello

“if thou art false o then heaven mocks itself”
the son framed like hamlet to appreciate truth in all the beauty of relations sinks into deep melancholy when he finds his natural expectations disappointed he has no other she to whom he gave the name disgraces from his hearts shrine all the sex

“frailty thy name is woman”
it is because a hamlet could find cause to say so that i have put the line whose stigma has never been removed at the head of my work but as a lover surely hamlet would not have so far mistaken as to have finished with such a conviction he would have felt the faith of othello and that faith could not in his more dispassionate mind have been disturbed by calumny

in spain this thought is arrayed in a sublimity which belongs to the sombre and passionate genius of the nation calderons justina resists all the temptation of the demon and raises her lover with her above the sweet lures of mere temporal happiness their marriage is vowed at the stake their goals are liberated together by the martyr flame into “a purer state of sensation and existence”

in italy the great poets wove into their lives an ideal love which answered to the highest wants it included those of the intellect and the affections for it was a love of spirit for spirit it was not ascetic or superhuman but interpreting all things gave their proper beauty to details of the common life the common day the poet spoke of his love not as a flower to place in his bosom or hold carelessly in his hand but as a light toward which he must find wings to fly or “a stair to heaven” he delighted to speak of her not only as the bride of his heart but the mother of his soul for he saw that in cases where the right direction had been taken the greater delicacy of her frame and stillness of her life left her more open than is man to spiritual influx so he did not look upon her as betwixt him and earth to serve his temporal needs but rather betwixt him and heaven to purify his affections and lead him to wisdom through love he sought in her not so much the eve as the madonna

in these minds the thought which gleams through all the legends of chivalry shines in broad intellectual effulgence not to be misinterpreted and their thought is reverenced by the world though it lies far from the practice of the world as yet—so far that it seems as though a gulf of death yawned between

even with such men the practice was often widely different from the mental faith i say mental for if the heart were thoroughly alive with it the practice could not be dissonant lord herberts was a marriage of convention made for him at fifteen he was not discontented with it but looked only to the advantages it brought of perpetuating his family on the basis of a great fortune he paid in act what he considered a dutiful attention to the bond his thoughts travelled elsewhere and while forming a high ideal of the companionship of minds in marriage he seems never to have doubted that its realization must be postponed to some other state of being dante almost immediately after the death of beatrice married a lady chosen for him by his friends and boccaccio in describing the miseries that attended in this case

         “the form of an union where union is none”

speaks as if these were inevitable to the connection and as if the scholar and poet especially could expect nothing but misery and obstruction in a domestic partnership with woman

centuries have passed since but civilized europe is still in a transition state about marriage not only in practice but in thought it is idle to speak with contempt of the nations where polygamy is an institution or seraglios a custom while practices far more debasing haunt wellnigh fill every city and every town and so far as union of one with one is believed to be the only pure form of marriage a great majority of societies and individuals are still doubtful whether the earthly bond must be a meeting of souls or only supposes a contract of convenience and utility were woman established in the rights of an immortal being this could not be she would not in some countries be given away by her father with scarcely more respect for her feelings than is shown by the indian chief who sells his daughter for a horse and beats her if she runs away from her new home nor in societies where her choice is left free would she be perverted by the current of opinion that seizes her into the belief that she must marry if it be only to find a protector and a home of her own neither would man if he thought the connection of permanent importance form it so lightly he would not deem it a trifle that he was to enter into the closest relations with another soul which if not eternal in themselves must eternally affect his growth neither did he believe woman capable of friendship footnote see appendix d spinozas view would he by rash haste lose the chance of finding a friend in the person who might probably live half a century by his side did love to his mind stretch forth into infinity he would not miss his chance of its revelations that he might the sooner rest from his weariness by a bright fireside and secure a sweet and graceful attendant “devoted to him alone” were he a step higher he would not carelessly enter into a relation where he might not be able to do the duty of a friend as well as a protector from external ill to the other party and have a being in his power pining for sympathy intelligence and aid that he could not give

what deep communion what real intercourse is implied in sharing the joys and cares of parentage when any degree of equality is admitted between the parties it is true that in a majority of instances the man looks upon his wife as an adopted child and places her to the other children in the relation of nurse or governess rather than that of parent her influence with them is sure but she misses the education which should enlighten that influence by being thus treated it is the order of nature that children should complete the education moral and mental of parents by making them think what is needed for the best culture of human beings and conquer all faults and impulses that interfere with their giving this to these dear objects who represent the world to them father and mother should assist one another to learn what is required for this sublime priesthood of nature but for this a religious recognition of equality is required

where this thought of equality begins to diffuse itself it is shown in four ways

first—the household partnership in our country the woman looks for a “smart but kind” husband the man for a “capable sweettempered” wife the man furnishes the house the woman regulates it their relation is one of mutual esteem mutual dependence their talk is of business their affection shows itself by practical kindness they know that life goes more smoothly and cheerfully to each for the others aid they are grateful and content the wife praises her husband as a “good provider” the husband in return compliments her as a “capital housekeeper” this relation is good so far as it goes

next comes a closer tie which takes the form either of mutual idolatry or of intellectual companionship the first we suppose is to no one a pleasing subject of contemplation the parties weaken and narrow one another they lock the gate against all the glories of the universe that they may live in a cell together to themselves they seem the only wise to all others steeped in infatuation the gods smile as they look forward to the crisis of cure to men the woman seems an unlovely syren to women the man an effeminate boy

the other form of intellectual companionship has become more and more frequent men engaged in public life literary men and artists have often found in their wives companions and confidants in thought no less than in feeling and as the intellectual development of woman has spread wider and risen higher they have not unfrequently shared the same employment as in the case of roland and his wife who were friends in the household and in the nations councils read regulated home affairs or prepared public documents together indifferently it is very pleasant in letters begun by roland and finished by his wife to see the harmony of mind and the difference of nature one thought but various ways of treating it

this is one of the best instances of a marriage of friendship it was only friendship whose basis was esteem probably neither party knew love except by name roland was a good man worthy to esteem and be esteemed his wife as deserving of admiration as able to do without it

madame roland is the fairest specimen we yet have of her class as clear to discern her aim as valiant to pursue it as spensers britomart austerely set apart from all that did not belong to her whether as woman or as mind she is an antetype of a class to which the coming time will afford a field—the spartan matron brought by the culture of the age of books to intellectual consciousness and expansion selfsufficingness strength and clearsightedness were in her combined with a power of deep and calm affection she too would have given a son or husband the device for his shield “return with it or upon it” and this not because she loved little but much the page of her life is one of unsullied dignity her appeal to posterity is one against the injustice of those who committed such crimes in the name of liberty she makes it in behalf of herself and her husband i would put beside it on the shelf a little volume containing a similar appeal from the verdict of contemporaries to that of mankind made by godwin in behalf of his wife the celebrated the by most men detested mary wolstonecraft in his view it was an appeal from the injustice of those who did such wrong in the name of virtue were this little book interesting for no other cause it would be so for the generous affection evinced under the peculiar circumstances this man had courage to love and honor this woman in the face of the worlds sentence and of all that was repulsive in her own past history he believed he saw of what soul she was and that the impulses she had struggled to act out were noble though the opinions to which they had led might not be thoroughly weighed he loved her and he defended her for the meaning and tendency of her inner life it was a good fact

mary wolstonecraft like madame dudevant commonly known as george sand in our day was a woman whose existence better proved the need of some new interpretation of womans rights than anything she wrote such beings as these rich in genius of most tender sympathies capable of high virtue and a chastened harmony ought not to find themselves by birth in a place so narrow that in breaking bonds they become outlaws were there as much room in the world for such as in spensers poem for britomart they would not run their heads so wildly against the walls but prize their shelter rather they find their way at last to light and air but the world will not take off the brand it has set upon them the champion of the rights of woman found in godwin one who would plead that cause like a brother he who delineated with such purity of traits the form of woman in the marguerite of whom the weak st leon could never learn to be worthy—a pearl indeed whose price was above rubies—was not false in life to the faith by which he had hallowed his romance he acted as he wrote like a brother this form of appeal rarely fails to touch the basest man—”are you acting toward other women in the way you would have men act towards your sister” george sand smokes wears male attire wishes to be addressed as “mon frère”—perhaps if she found those who were as brothers indeed she would not care whether she were brother or sister footnote a note appended by my sister in this place in the first edition is here omitted because it is incorporated in another article in this volume treating of george sand more at length—ed we rejoice to see that she who expresses such a painful contempt for men in most of her works as shows she must have known great wrong from them depicts in “la roche mauprat” a man raised by the workings of love from the depths of savage sensualism to a moral and intellectual life it was love for a pure object for a steadfast woman one of those who the italian said could make the “stair to heaven”

this author beginning like the many in assault upon bad institutions and external ills yet deepening the experience through comparative freedom sees at last that the only efficient remedy must come from individual character these bad institutions indeed it may always be replied prevent individuals from forming good character therefore we must remove them agreed yet keep steadily the higher aim in view could you clear away all the bad forms of society it is vain unless the individual begin to be ready for better there must be a parallel movement in these two branches of life and all the rules left by moses availed less to further the best life than the living example of one messiah

still the mind of the age struggles confusedly with these problems better discerning as yet the ill it can no longer bear than the good by which it may supersede it but women like sand will speak now and cannot be silenced their characters and their eloquence alike foretell an era when such as they shall easier learn to lead true lives but though such forebode not such shall be parents of it footnote appendix e those who would reform the world must show that they do not speak in the heat of wild impulse their lives must be unstained by passionate error they must be severe lawgivers to themselves they must be religious students of the divine purpose with regard to man if they would not confound the fancies of a day with the requisitions of eternal good their liberty must be the liberty of law and knowledge but as to the transgressions against custom which have caused such outcry against those of noble intention it may be observed that the resolve of eloisa to be only the mistress of abelard was that of one who saw in practice around her the contract of marriage made the seal of degradation shelley feared not to be fettered unless so to be was to be false wherever abuses are seen the timid will suffer the bold will protest but society has a right to outlaw them till she has revised her law and this she must be taught to do by one who speaks with authority not in anger or haste

if godwins choice of the calumniated authoress of the “rights of woman” for his honored wife be a sign of a new era no less so is an article to which i have alluded some pages back published five or six years ago in one of the english reviews where the writer in doing fall justice to eloisa shows his bitter regret that she lives not now to love him who might have known bettor how to prize her love than did the egotistical abelard

these marriages these characters with all their imperfections express an onward tendency they speak of aspiration of soul of energy of mind seeking clearness and freedom of a like promise are the tracts lately published by goodwyn barmby the european pariah as he calls himself and his wife catharine whatever we may think of their measures we see in them wedlock the two minds are wed by the only contract that can permanently avail that of a common faith and a common purpose

we might mention instances nearer home of minds partners in work and in life sharing together on equal terms public and private interests and which wear not on any side the aspect of offence shown by those lastnamed persons who steer straight onward yet in our comparatively free life have not been obliged to run their heads against any wall but the principles which guide them might under petrified and oppressive institutions have made them warlike paradoxical and in some sense pariahs the phenomena are different the law is the same in all these cases men and women have been obliged to build up their house anew from the very foundation if they found stone ready in the quarry they took it peaceably otherwise they alarmed the country by pulling down old towers to get materials

these are all instances of marriage as intellectual companionship the parties meet mind to mind and a mutual trust is produced which can buckler them against a million they work together for a common purpose and in all these instances with the same implement—the pen the pen and the writingdesk furnish forth as naturally the retirement of woman as of man

a pleasing expression in this kind is afforded by the union in the names of the howitts william and mary howitt we heard named together for years supposing them to be brother and sister the equality of labors and reputation even so was auspicious more so now we find them man and wife in his late work on germany howitt mentions his wife with pride as one among the constellation of distinguished englishwomen and in a graceful simple manner and still we contemplate with pleasure the partnership in literature and affection between the howitts—the congenial pursuits and productions—the pedestrian tours wherein the married pair showed that marriage on a wide enough basis does not destroy the “inexhaustible” entertainment which lovers find in one anothers company

in naming these instances i do not mean to imply that community of employment is essential to the union of husband and wife more than to the union of friends harmony exists in difference no less than in likeness if only the same keynote govern both parts woman the poem man the poet woman the heart man the head such divisions are only important when they are never to be transcended if nature is never bound down nor the voice of inspiration stifled that is enough we are pleased that women should write and speak if they feel need of it from having something to tell but silence for ages would be no misfortune if that silence be from divine command and not from mans tradition

while goetz von berlichingen rides to battle his wife is busy in the kitchen but difference of occupation does not prevent that community of inward life that perfect esteem with which he says

         “whom god loves to him gives he such a wife”

manzoni thus dedicates his “adelchi”

“to his beloved and venerated wife enrichetta luigia blondel who with conjugal affection and maternal wisdom has preserved a virgin mind the author dedicates this adelchi grieving that he could not by a more splendid and more durable monument honor the dear name and the memory of so many virtues”

the relation could not be fairer nor more equal if she too had written poems yet the position of the parties might have been the reverse as well the woman might have sung the deeds given voice to the life of the man and beauty would have been the result as we see in pictures of arcadia the nymph singing to the shepherds or the shepherd with his pipe alluring the nymphs either makes a good picture the sounding lyre requires not muscular strength but energy of soul to animate the hand which would control it nature seems to delight in varying the arrangements as if to show that she will be fettered by no rule and we must admit the same varieties that she admits

the fourth and highest grade of marriage union is the religious which may be expressed as pilgrimage toward a common shrine this includes the others home sympathies and household wisdom for these pilgrims must know how to assist each other along the dusty way intellectual communion for how sad it would be on such a journey to have a companion to whom you could not communicate your thoughts and aspirations as they sprang to life who would have no feeling for the prospects that open more and more glorious as we advance who would never see the flowers that may be gathered by the most industrious traveller it must include all these

such a fellowpilgrim count zinzendorf seems to have found in his countess of whom he thus writes

“twentyfive years experience has shown me that just the helpmeet whom i have is the only one that could suit my vocation who else could have so carried through my family affairs who lived so spotlessly before the world who so wisely aided me in my rejection of a dry morality who so clearly set aside the pharisaism which as years passed threatened to creep in among us who so deeply discerned as to the spirits of delusion which sought to bewilder us who would have governed my whole economy so wisely richly and hospitably when circumstances commanded who have taken indifferently the part of servant or mistress without on the one side affecting an especial spirituality on the other being sullied by any worldly pride who in a community where all ranks are eager to be on a level would from wise and real causes have known how to maintain inward and outward distinctions who without a murmur have seen her husband encounter such dangers by land and sea who undertaken with him and sustained such astonishing pilgrimages who amid such difficulties would have always held up her head and supported me who found such vast sums of money and acquitted them on her own credit and finally who of all human beings could so well understand and interpret to others my inner and outer being as this one of such nobleness in her way of thinking such great intellectual capacity and so free from the theological perplexities that enveloped me”

let any one peruse with all intentness the lineaments of this portrait and see if the husband had not reason with this air of solemn rapture and conviction to challenge comparison we are reminded of the majestic cadence of the line whose feet stop in the just proportion of humanity

“daughter of god and mati accomplished eve”
an observer footnote spangenberg adds this testimony

“we may in many marriages regard it as the best arrangement if the man has so much advantage over his wife that she can without much thought of her own be led and directed by him as by a father but it was not so with the count and his consort she was not made to be a copy she was an original and while she loved and honored him she thought for herself on all subjects with so much intelligence that he could and did look on her as a sister and friend also”

compare with this refined specimen of a religiously civilized life the following imperfect sketch of a north american indian and we shall see that the same causes will always produce the same results the flying pigeon ratchewaine was the wife of a barbarous chief who had six others but she was his only true wife because the only one of a strong and pure character and having this inspired a veneration as like as the mind of the man permitted to that inspired by the countess zinzendorf she died when her son was only four years old yet left on his mind a feeling of reverent love worthy the thought of christian chivalry grown to manhood he shed tears on seeing her portrait

                        the flying pigeon

“ratchewaine was chaste mild gentle in her disposition kind generous and devoted to her husband a harsh word was never known to proceed from her mouth nor was she ever known to be in a passion mabaskah used to say of her after her death that her hand was shut when those who did not want came into her presence but when the really poor came in it was like a strainer full of holes letting all she held in it pass through in the exercise of generous feeling she was uniform it was not indebted for its exercise to whim nor caprice nor partiality no matter of what nation the applicant for her bounty was or whether at war or peace with her nation if he were hungry she fed him if naked she clothed him and if houseless she gave him shelter the continued exercise of this generous feeling kept her poor and she has been known to give away her last blanket—all the honey that was in the lodge the last bladder of bears oil and the last piece of dried meat

“she was scrupulously exact in the observance of all the religious rites which her faith imposed upon her her conscience is represented to have been extremely tender she often feared that her acts were displeasing to the great spirit when she would blacken her face and retire to some lone place and fast and pray”

to these traits should be added but for want of room anecdotes which show the quick decision and vivacity of her mind her face was in harmony with this combination her brow is as ideal and the eyes and lids as devout and modest as the italian picture of the madonna while the lower part of the face has the simplicity and childish strength of the indian race her picture presents the finest specimen of indian beauty we have ever seen such a woman is the sister and friend of all beings as the worthy man is their brother and helper

with like pleasure we survey the pairs wedded on the eve of missionary effort they indeed are fellowpilgrims on the wellmade road and whether or no they accomplish all they hope for the sad hindoo or the nearer savage we feel that in the burning waste their love is like to be a healing dew in the forlorn jungle a tent of solace to one another they meet as children of one father to read together one book of instruction

we must insert in this connection the most beautiful picture presented by ancient literature of wedded love under this noble form

it is from the romance in which xenophon the chivalrous greek presents his ideal of what human nature should be

the generals of cyrus had taken captive a princess a woman of unequalled beauty and hastened to present her to the prince as that part of the spoil he would think most worthy of his acceptance cyrus visits the lady and is filled with immediate admiration by the modesty and majesty with which she receives him he finds her name is panthea and that she is the wife of abradatus a young king whom she entirely loves he protects her as a sister in his camp till he can restore her to her husband

after the first transports of joy at this reunion the heart of panthea is bent on showing her love and gratitude to her magnanimous and delicate protector and as she has nothing so precious to give as the aid of abradatus that is what she most wishes to offer her husband is of one soul with her in this as in all things

the description of her grief and selfdestruction after the death which ensued upon this devotion i have seen quoted but never that of their parting when she sends him forth to battle i shall copy both if they have been read by any of my readers they may be so again with profit in this connection for never were the heroism of a true woman and the purity of love in a true marriage painted in colors more delicate and more lively

“the chariot of abradatus that had four perches and eight horses was completely adorned for him and when he was going to put on his linen corslet which was a sort of armor used by those of his country panthea brought him a golden helmet and armpieces broad bracelets for his wrists a purple habit that reached down to his feet and hung in folds at the bottom and a crest dyed of a violet color these things she had made unknown to her husband and by taking the measure of his armor he wondered when he saw them and inquired thus of panthea and have you made me these arms woman by destroying your own ornaments no by jove said panthea not what is the most valuable of them for it is you if you appear to others to be what i think you that will be my greatest ornament and saying that she put on him the armor and though she endeavored to conceal it the tears poured down her checks when abradatus who was before a man of fine appearance was set out in those arms he appeared the most beautiful and noble of all especially being likewise so by nature then taking the reins from the driver he was just preparing to mount the chariot when panthea after she had desired all that were there to retire thus said

“o abradatus if ever there was a woman who had a greater regard to her husband than to her own soul i believe you know that i am such an one what need i therefore speak of things in particular for i reckon that my actions have convinced you more than any words i can now use and yet though i stand thus affected toward you as you know i do i swear by this friendship of mine and yours that i certainly would rather choose to be put under ground jointly with you approving yourself a brave man than to live with you in disgrace and shame so much do i think you and myself worthy of the noblest things then i think that we both lie under great obligations to cyrus that when i was a captive and chosen out for himself he thought fit to treat me neither as a slave nor indeed as a woman of mean account but he took and kept me for you as if i were his brothers wife besides when araspes who was my guard went away from him i promised him that if he would allow me to send for you you would come to him and approve yourself a much better and move faithful friend than araspes

“thus she spoke and abradatus being struck with admiration at her discourse laying his hand gently on her head and lifting up his eyes to heaven made this prayer do thou o greatest jove i grant me to appear a husband worthy of panthea and a friend worthy of cyrus who has done us so much honor

“having said this he mounted the chariot by the door of the drivers seat and after he had got up when the driver shut the door panthea who had now no other way to salute him kissed the seat of the chariot the chariot then moved and she unknown to him followed till abradatus turning about and seeing her said take courage panthea fare you happily and well and now go your ways on this her women and servants carried her to her conveyance and laying her down concealed her by throwing the covering of a tent over her the people though abradatus and his chariot made a noble spectacle were not able to look at him till panthea was gone”

after the battle—

“cyrus calling to some of his servants tell me said he has any one seen abradatus for i admire that he now does not appear one replied my sovereign it is because he is not living but died in the battle as he broke in with his chariot on the egyptians all the rest except his particular companions they say turned off when they saw the egyptians compact body his wife is now said to have taken up his dead body to have placed it in the carriage that she herself was conveyed in and to have brought it hither to some place on the river pactolus and her servants are digging a grave on a certain elevation they say that his wife after setting him out with all the ornaments she has is sitting on the ground with his head on her knees cyrus hearing this gave himself a blow on the thigh mounted his horse at a leap and taking with him a thousand horse rode away to this scene of affliction but gave orders to gadatas and gobryas to take with them all the rich ornaments proper for a friend and an excellent man deceased and to follow after him and whoever had herds of cattle with him he ordered them to take both oxen and horses and sheep in good number and to bring them away to the place where by inquiry they should find him to be that he might sacrifice these to abradatus

“as soon as he saw the woman sitting on the ground and the dead body there lying he shed tears at the afflicting sight and said alas thou brave and faithful soul hast thou left us and art thou gone at the same time he took him by the right hand and the hand of the deceased came away for it had been cut off with a sword by the egyptians he at the sight of this became yet much more concerned than before the woman shrieked out in a lamentable manner and taking the hand from cyrus kissed it fitted it to its proper place again as well as she could and said the rest cyrus is in the same condition but what need you see it and i know that i was not one of the least concerned in these his sufferings and perhaps you were not less so for i fool that i was frequently exhorted him to behave in such a manner as to appear a friend to you worthy of notice and i know he never thought of what he himself should suffer but of what he should do to please you he is dead therefore said she without reproach and i who urged him on sit here alive cyrus shedding tears for some time in silence then spoke—he has died woman the noblest death for he has died victorious do you adorn him with these things that i furnish you with gobryas and gadatas were then come up and had brought rich ornaments in great abundance with them then said he be assured that he shall not want respect and honor in all other things but over and above multitudes shall concur in raising him a monument that shall be worthy of us and all the sacrifices shall be made him that are proper to be made in honor of a brave man you shall not be left destitute but for the sake of your modesty and every other virtue i will pay you all other honors as well as place those about you who will conduct you wherever you please do you but make it known to me where it is that you desire to be conveyed to and panthea replied be confident cyrus i will not conceal from you to whom it is that i desire to go

“he having said this went away with great pity for her that she should have lost such a husband and for the man that he should have left such a wife behind him never to see her more panthea then gave orders for her servants to retire till such time said she as i shall have lamented my husband as i please her nurse she bid to stay and gave orders that when she was dead she would wrap her and her husband up in one mantle together the nurse after having repeatedly begged her not to do this and meeting with no success but observing her to grow angry sat herself down breaking out into tears she being beforehand provided with a sword killed herself and laying her head down on her husbands breast she died the nurse set up a lamentable cry and covered them both as panthea had directed

“cyrus as soon as he was informed of what the woman had done being struck with it went to help her if he could the servants three in number seeing what had been done drew their swords and killed themselves as they stood at the place where she bad ordered them and the monument is now said to have been raised by continuing the mound on to the servants and on a pillar above they say the names of the man and woman were written in syriac letters

“below were three pillars and they were inscribed thus of the servants cyrus when he came to this melancholy scene was struck with admiration of the woman and having lamented over her went away he took care as was proper that all the funeral rites should be paid them in the noblest manner and the monument they say was raised up to a very great size”

these be the ancients who so many assert had no idea of the dignity of woman or of marriage such love xenophon could paint as subsisting between those who after death “would see one another never more” thousands of years have passed since and with the reception of the cross the nations assume the belief that those who part thus may meet again and forever if spiritually fitted to one another as abradatus and panthea were and yet do we see such marriages among them if at all how often

i must quote two more short passages from xenophon for he is a writer who pleases me well

cyrus receiving the armenians whom he had conquered—

“tigranes said he at what rate would you purchase the regaining of your wife now tigranes happened to be but lately married and had a very great love for his wife” that clause perhaps sounds modern

“cyrus said he i would ransom her at the expense of my life

“take then your own to yourself said he 

“when they came home one talked of cyrus wisdom another of his patience and resolution another of his mildness one spoke of his beauty and smallness of his person and on that tigranes asked his wife and do you armenian dame think cyrus handsome truly said she i did not look at him at whom then did you look said tigranes at him who said that to save me from servitude he would ransom me at the expense of his own life“

from the banquet—

“socrates who observed her with pleasure said this young girl has confirmed me in the opinion i have had for a long time that the female sex are nothing inferior to ours excepting only in strength of body or perhaps his steadiness of judgment“

in the economics the manner in which the husband gives counsel to his young wife presents the model of politeness and refinement xenophon is thoroughly the gentleman gentle in breeding and in soul all the men he describes are so while the shades of manner are distinctly marked there is the serene dignity of socrates with gleams of playfulness thrown across its cool religious shades the princely mildness of cyrus and the more domestic elegance of the husband in the economics

there is no way that men sin more against refinement as well as discretion than in their conduct toward their wives let them look at the men of xenophon such would know how to give counsel for they would know how to receive it they would feel that the most intimate relations claimed most not least of refined courtesy they would not suppose that confidence justified carelessness nor the reality of affection want of delicacy in the expression of it

such men would be too wise to hide their affairs from the wife and then expect her to act as if she knew them they would know that if she is expected to face calamity with courage she must be instructed and trusted in prosperity or if they had failed in wise confidence such as the husband shows in the economics they would be ashamed of anger or querulous surprise at the results that naturally follow

such men would not be exposed to the bad influence of bad wives for all wives bad or good loved or unloved inevitably influence their husbands from the power their position not merely gives but necessitates of coloring evidence and infusing feelings in hours when the—patient shall i call him—is off his guard those who understand the wifes mind and think it worth while to respect her springs of action know bettor where they are but to the bad or thoughtless man who lives carelessly and irreverently so near another mind the wrong he does daily back upon himself recoils a cyrus an abradatus knows where he stands

but to return to the thread of my subject

another sign of the times is furnished by the triumphs of female authorship these have been great and are constantly increasing women have taken possession of so many provinces for which men had pronounced them unfit that though these still declare there are some inaccessible to them it is difficult to say just where they must stop

the shining names of famous women have cast light upon the path of the sex and many obstructions have been removed when a montague could learn better than her brother and use her lore afterwards to such purpose as an observer it seemed amiss to hinder women from preparing themselves to see or from seeing all they could when prepared since somerville has achieved so much will any young girl be prevented from seeking a knowledge of the physical sciences if she wishes it de staels name was not so clear of offence she could not forget the woman in the thought while she was instructing you as a mind she wished to be admired as a woman sentimental tears often dimmed the eagle glance her intellect too with all its splendor trained in a drawingroom fed on flattery was tainted and flawed yet its beams make the obscurest schoolhouse in new england warmer and lighter to the little rugged girls who are gathered together on its wooden bench they may never through life hear her name but she is not the less their benefactress

the influence has been such that the aim certainly is now in arranging school instruction for girls to give them as fair a field as boys as yet indeed these arrangements are made with little judgment or reflection just as the tutors of lady jane grey and other distinguished women of her time taught them latin and greek because they knew nothing else themselves so now the improvement in the education of girls is to be made by giving them young men as teachers who only teach what has been taught themselves at college while methods and topics need revision for these new subjects which could better be made by those who had experienced the same wants women are often at the head of these institutions but they have as yet seldom been thinking women capable of organizing a new whole for the wants of the time and choosing persons to officiate in the departments and when some portion of instruction of a good sort is got from the school the far greater proportion which is infused from the general atmosphere of society contradicts its purport yet books and a little elementary instruction are not furnished in vain women are better aware how great and rich the universe is not so easily blinded by narrowness or partial views of a home circle “her mother did so before her” is no longer a sufficient excuse indeed it was never received as an excuse to mitigate the severity of censure but was adduced as a reason rather why there should be no effort made for reformation

whether much or little has been done or will be done—whether women will add to the talent of narration the power of systematizing—whether they will carve marble as well as draw and paint—is not important but that it should be acknowledged that they have intellect which needs developing—that they should not be considered complete if beings of affection and habit alone—is important

yet even this acknowledgment rather conquered by woman than proffered by man has been sullied by the usual selfishness too much is said of women being better educated that they may become better companions and mothers for men they should be fit for such companionship and we have mentioned with satisfaction instances where it has been established earth knows no fairer holier relation than that of a mother it is one which rightly understood must both promote and require the highest attainments but a being of infinite scope must not be treated with an exclusive view to any one relation give the soul free course let the organization both of body and mind be freely developed and the being will be fit for any and every relation to which it may be called the intellect no more than the sense of hearing is to be cultivated merely that woman may be a more valuable companion to man but because the power who gave a power by its mere existence signifies that it must be brought out toward perfection

in this regard of selfdependence and a greater simplicity and fulness of being we must hail as a preliminary the increase of the class contemptuously designated as “old maids”

we cannot wonder at the aversion with which old bachelors and old maids have been regarded marriage is the natural means of forming a sphere of taking root in the earth it requires more strength to do this without such an opening very many have failed and their imperfections have been in every ones way they have been more partial more harsh more officious and impertinent than those compelled by severer friction to render themselves endurable those who have a more full experience of the instincts have a distrust as to whether the unmarried can be thoroughly human and humane such as is hinted in the saying “oldmaids and bachelors children are well cared for” which derides at once their ignorance and their presumption

yet the business of society has become so complex that it could now scarcely be carried on without the presence of these despised auxiliaries and detachments from the army of aunts and uncles are wanted to stop gaps in every hedge they rove about mental and moral ishmaelites pitching their tents amid the fixed and ornamented homes of men

in a striking variety of forms genius of late both at home and abroad has paid its tribute to the character of the aunt and the uncle recognizing in these personages the spiritual parents who have supplied defects in the treatment of the busy or careless actual parents

they also gain a wider if not so deep experience those who are not intimately and permanently linked with others are thrown upon themselves and if they do not there find peace and incessant life there is none to flatter them that they are not very poor and very mean

a position which so constantly admonishes may be of inestimable benefit the person may gain undistracted by other relationships a closer communion with the one such a use is made of it by saints and sibyls or she may be one of the lay sisters of charity a canoness bound by an inward vow—or the useful drudge of all men the martha much sought little prized—or the intellectual interpreter of the varied life she sees the urania of a halfformed worlds twilight

or she may combine all these not needing to care that she may please a husband a frail and limited being her thoughts may turn to the centre and she may by steadfast contemplation entering into the secret of truth and love use it for the good of all men instead of a chosen few and interpret through it all the forms of life it is possible perhaps to be at once a priestly servant and a loving muse

saints and geniuses have often chosen a lonely position in the faith that if undisturbed by the pressure of near ties they would give themselves up to the inspiring spirit it would enable them to understand and reproduce life better than actual experience could

how many “old maids” take this high stand we cannot say it is an unhappy fact that too many who have come before the eye are gossips rather and not always goodnatured gossips but if these abuse and none make the best of their vocation yet it has not failed to produce some good results it has been seen by others if not by themselves that beings likely to be left alone need to be fortified and furnished within themselves and education and thought have tended more and more to regard these beings as related to absolute being as well as to others it has been seen that as the breaking of no bond ought to destroy a man so ought the missing of none to hinder him from growing and thus a circumstance of the time which springs rather from its luxury than its purity has helped to place women on the true platform

perhaps the next generation looking deeper into this matter will find that contempt is put upon old maids or old women at all merely because they do not use the elixir which would keep them always young under its influence a gem brightens yearly which is only seen to more advantage through the fissures time makes in the casket footnote appendix f no one thinks of michael angelos persican sibyl or st theresa or tassos leonora or the greek electra as an old maid more than of michael angelo or canova as old bachelors though all had reached the period in lifes course appointed to take that degree

see a common woman at forty scarcely has she the remains of beauty of any soft poetic grace which gave her attraction as woman which kindled the hearts of those who looked on her to sparkling thoughts or diffused round her a roseate air of gentle love see her who was indeed a lovely girl in the coarse fullblown dahlia flower of what is commonly matronbeauty “fat fair and forty” showily dressed and with manners as broad and full as her frill or satin cloak people observe “how well she is preserved” “she is a fine woman still” they say this woman whether as a duchess in diamonds or one of our city dames in mosaics charms the poets heart no more and would look much out of place kneeling before the madonna she “does well the honors of her house”—”leads society”—is in short always spoken and thought of upholsterywise

or see that careworn face from which every soft line is blotted—those faded eyes from which lonely tears have driven the flashes of fancy the mild white beam of a tender enthusiasm this woman is not so ornamental to a teaparty yet she would please better in picture yet surely she no more than the other looks as a human being should at the end of forty years forty years have they bound those brows with no garland shed in the lamp no drop of ambrosial oil

not so looked the iphigenia in aulis her forty years had seen her in anguish in sacrifice in utter loneliness but those pains were borne for her father and her country the sacrifice she had made pure for herself and those around her wandering alone at night in the vestal solitude of her imprisoning grove she has looked up through its “living summits” to the stars which shed down into her aspect their own lofty melody at forty she would not misbecome the marble

not so looks the persica she is withered she is faded the drapery that enfolds her has in its dignity an angularity too that tells of age of sorrow of a stern resignation to the must but her eye that torch of the soul is untamed and in the intensity of her reading we see a soul invincibly young in faith and hope her age is her charm for it is the night of the past that gives this beaconfire leave to shine wither more and more black chrysalid thou dost but give the winged beauty time to mature its splendors

not so looked victoria colonna after her life of a great hope and of true conjugal fidelity she had been not merely a bride but a wife and each hour had helped to plume the noble bird a coronet of pearls will not shame her brow it is white and ample a worthy altar for love and thought

even among the north american indians a race of men as completely engaged in mere instinctive life as almost any in the world and where each chief keeping many wives as useful servants of course looks with no kind eye on celibacy in woman it was excused in the following instance mentioned by mrs jameson a woman dreamt in youth that she was betrothed to the sun she built her a wigwam apart filled it with emblems of her alliance and means of on independent life there she passed her days sustained by her own exertions and true to her supposed engagement

in any tribe we believe a woman who lived as if she was betrothed to the sun would be tolerated and the rays which made her youth blossom sweetly would crown her with a halo in age

there is on this subject a nobler view than heretofore if not the noblest and improvement here must coincide with that in the view taken of marriage “we must have units before we can have union” says one of the ripe thinkers of the times

if larger intellectual resources begin to be deemed needful to woman still more is a spiritual dignity in her or even the mere assumption of it looked upon with respect joanna southcote and mother anne lee are sure of a band of disciples ecstatica dolorosa of enraptured believers who will visit them in their lowly huts and wait for days to revere them in their trances the foreign noble traverses land and sea to hear a few words from the lips of the lowly peasant girl whom he believes especially visited by the most high very beautiful in this way was the influence of the invalid of st petersburg as described by de maistre

mysticism which may be defined as the brooding soul of the world cannot fail of its oracular promise as to woman “the mothers” “the mother of all things” are expressions of thought which lead the mind towards this side of universal growth whenever a mystical whisper was heard from behmen down to st simon sprang up the thought that if it be true as the legend says that humanity withers through a fault committed by and a curse laid upon woman through her pure child or influence shall the new adam the redemption arise innocence is to be replaced by virtue dependence by a willing submission in the heart of the virginmother of the new race

the spiritual tendency is toward the elevation of woman but the intellectual by itself is not so plato sometimes seems penetrated by that high idea of love which considers man and woman as the twofold expression of one thought this the angel of swedenborg the angel of the coming age cannot surpass but only explain more fully but then again plato the man of intellect treats woman in the republic as property and in the timæus says that man if he misuse the privileges of one life shall be degraded into the form of woman and then if ho do not redeem himself into that of a bird this as i said above expresses most happily how antipoetical is this state of mind for the poet contemplating the world of things selects various birds as the symbols of his most gracious and ethereal thoughts just as he calls upon his genius as muse rather than as god but the intellect cold is ever more masculine than feminine warmed by emotion it rushes toward motherearth and puts on the forms of beauty

the electrical the magnetic element in woman has not been fairly brought out at any period everything might be expected from it she has far more of it than man this is commonly expressed by saying that her intuitions are more rapid and more correct you will often see men of high intellect absolutely stupid in regard to the atmospheric changes the fine invisible links which connect the forms of life around them while common women if pure and modest so that a vulgar self do not overshadow the mental eye will seize and delineate these with unerring discrimination

women who combine this organization with creative genius are very commonly unhappy at present they see too much to act in conformity with those around them and their quick impulses seem folly to those who do not discern the motives this is an usual effect of the apparition of genius whether in man or woman but is more frequent with regard to the latter because a harmony an obvious order and selfrestraining decorum is most expected from her

then women of genius even more than men are likely to be enslaved by an impassioned sensibility the world repels them more rudely and they are of weaker bodily frame

those who seem overladen with electricity frighten those around them “when she merely enters the room i am what the french call herissé” said a man of petty feelings and worldly character of such a woman whose depth of eye and powerful motion announced the conductor of the mysterious fluid

woe to such a woman who finds herself linked to such a man in bonds too close it is the crudest of errors he will detest her with all the bitterness of wounded selflove he will take the whole prejudice of manhood upon himself and to the utmost of his power imprison and torture her by its imperious rigors

yet allow room enough and the electric fluid will be found to invigorate and embellish not destroy life such women are the great actresses the songsters such traits we read in a late searching though too french analysis of the character of mademoiselle rachel by a modern la rochefeucault the greeks thus represent the muses they have not the golden serenity of apollo they are overflowed with thought there is something tragic in their air such are the sibyls of gueroino the eye is overfull of expression dilated and lustrous it seems to have drawn the whole being into it

sickness is the frequent result of this overcharged existence to this region however misunderstood or interpreted with presumptuous carelessness belong the phenomena of magnetism or mesmerism as it is now often called where the trance of the ecstatica purports to be produced by the agency of one human being on another instead of as in her case direct from the spirit

the worldling has his sneer at this as at the services of religion “the churches can always be filled with women”—”show me a man in one of your magnetic states and i will believe”

women are indeed the easy victims both of priestcraft and selfdelusion but this would not be if the intellect was developed in proportion to the other powers they would then have a regulator and be more in equipoise yet must retain the same nervous susceptibility while their physical structure is such as it is

it is with just that hope that we welcome everything that tends to strengthen the fibre and develop the nature on more sides when the intellect and affections are in harmony when intellectual consciousness is calm and deep inspiration will not be confounded with fancy

        then “she who advances
        with rapturous lyrical glances
        singing the song of the earth singing
        its hymn to the gods”

will not be pitied as a madwoman nor shrunk from as unnatural

the greeks who saw everything in forms which we are trying to ascertain as law and classify as cause embodied all this in the form of cassandra cassandra was only unfortunate in receiving her gift too soon the remarks however that the world still makes in such cases are well expressed by the greek dramatist

in the trojan dames there are fine touches of nature with regard to cassandra hecuba shows that mixture of shame and reverence that prosaic kindred always do toward the inspired child the poet the elected sufferer for the race

when the herald announces that cassandra is chosen to be the mistress of agamemnon hecuba answers with indignation betraying the pride and faith she involuntarily felt in this daughter

         “hec the maiden of phoebus to whom the goldenhaired
        gave as a privilege a virgin life

        tal love of the inspired maiden hath pierced him

        hec then cast away my child the sacred keys and from thy person
        the consecrated garlands which thou wearest”

yet when a moment after cassandra appears singing wildly her inspired song hecuba calls her “my frantic child”

yet how graceful she is in her tragic raptus the chorus shows

         “chorus how sweetly at thy houses ills thou smilst
        chanting what haply thou wilt not show true”

if hecuba dares not trust her highest instinct about her daughter still less can the vulgar mind of the herald talthybius a man not without feeling but with no princely no poetic blood abide the wild prophetic mood which insults all his prejudices

         “tal the venerable and that accounted wise
        is nothing better than that of no repute
        for the greatest king of all the greeks
        the dear son of atreus a possessed with the love
        of this madwoman i indeed am poor
        yet i would not receive her to my bed”

the royal agamemnon could see the beauty of cassandra he was not afraid of her prophetic gifts

the best topic for a chapter on this subject in the present day would be the history of the seeress of prevorst the best observed subject of magnetism in our present times and who like her ancestresses of delphos was roused to ecstasy or phrensy by the touch of the laurel

i observe in her case and in one known to me here that what might have been a gradual and gentle disclosure of remarkable powers was broken and jarred into disease by an unsuitable marriage both these persons were unfortunate in not understanding what was involved in this relation but acted ignorantly as their friends desired they thought that this was the inevitable destiny of woman but when engaged in the false position it was impossible for them to endure its dissonances as those of less delicate perceptions can and the fine flow of life was checked and sullied they grew sick but even so learned and disclosed more than those in health are wont to do

in such cases worldlings sneer but reverent men learn wondrous news either from the person observed or by thoughts caused in themselves by the observation fenelon learns from guyon kerner from his seeress what we fain would know but to appreciate such disclosures one must be a child and here the phrase “women and children” may perhaps be interpreted aright that only little children shall enter into the kingdom of heaven

all these motions of the time tides that betoken a waxing moon overflow upon our land the world at large is readier to let woman learn and manifest the capacities of her nature than it ever was before and here is a less encumbered field and freer air than anywhere else and it ought to be so we ought to pay for isabellas jewels

the names of nations are feminine—religion virtue and victory are feminine to those who have a superstition as to outward reigns it is not without significance that the name of the queen of our motherland should at this crisis be victoria—victoria the first perhaps to us it may be given to disclose the era thus outwardly presaged

another isabella too at this time ascends the throne might she open a new world to her sex but probably these poor little women are least of any educated to serve as examples or inspirers for the rest the spanish queen is younger we know of her that she sprained her foot the other day dancing in her private apartments of victoria that she reads aloud in a distinct voice and agreeable manner her addresses to parliament on certain solemn days and yearly that she presents to the nation some new prop of royalty these ladies have very likely been trained more completely to the puppet life than any other the queens who have been queens indeed were trained by adverse circumstances to know the world around them and their own powers

it is moving while amusing to read of the scottish peasant measuring the print left by the queens foot as she walks and priding himself on its beauty it is so natural to wish to find what is fair and precious in high places—so astonishing to find the bourbon a glutton or the guelph a dullard or gossip

in our own country women are in many respects better situated than men good books are allowed with more time to read them they are not so early forced into the bustle of life nor so weighed down by demands for outward success the perpetual changes incident to our society make the blood circulate freely through the body politic and if not favorable at present to the grace and bloom of life they are so to activity resource and would be to reflection but for a low materialist tendency from which the women are generally exempt in themselves though its existence among the men has a tendency to repress their impulses and make them doubt their instincts thus often paralyzing their action during the best years

but they have time to think and no traditions chain them and few conventionalities compared with what must be met in other nations there is no reason why they should not discover that the secrets of nature are open the revelations of the spirit waiting for whoever will seek them when the mind is once awakened to this consciousness it will not be restrained by the habits of the past but fly to seek the seeds of a heavenly future

their employments are more favorable to meditation than those of men

woman is not addressed religiously here more than elsewhere she is told that she should be worthy to be the mother of a washington or the companion of some good man but in many many instances she has already learned that all bribes have the same flaw that truth and good are to be sought solely for their own sakes and already an ideal sweetness floats over many forms shines in many eyes

already deep questions are put by young girls on the great theme what shall i do to enter upon the eternal life

men are very courteous to them they praise them often check them seldom there is chivalry in the feeling toward “the ladies” which gives them the best seats in the stagecoach frequent admission not only to lectures of all sorts but to courts of justice halls of legislature reform conventions the newspaper editor “would be better pleased that the ladys book should be filled up exclusively by ladies it would then indeed be a true gem worthy to be presented by young men to the mistress of their affections” can gallantry go further

in this country is venerated wherever seen the character which goethe spoke of as an ideal which he saw actualized in his friend and patroness the grand duchess amelia “the excellent woman is she who if the husband dies can be a father to the children” and this if read aright tells a great deal

women who speak in public if they have a moral power such as has been felt from angelina grimke and abby kelly—that is if they speak for conscience sake to serve a cause which they hold sacred—invariably subdue the prejudices of their hearers and excite an interest proportionate to the aversion with which it had been the purpose to regard them

a passage in a private letter so happily illustrates this that it must be inserted here

abby kelly in the townhouse of ——

“the scene was not unheroic—to see that woman true to humanity and her own nature a centre of rude eyes and tongues even gentlemen feeling licensed to make part of a species of mob around a female out of her sphere as she took her seat in the desk amid the great noise and in the throng full like a wave of something to ensue i saw her humanity in a gentleness and unpretension tenderly open to the sphere around her and had she not been supported by the power of the will of genuineness and principle she would have failed it led her to prayer which in woman especially is childlike sensibility and will going to the side of god and looking up to him and humanity was poured out in aspiration

“she acted like a gentle hero with her mild decision and womanly calmness all heroism is mild and quiet and gentle for it is life and possession and combativeness and firmness show a want of actualness she is as earnest fresh and simple as when she first entered the crusade i think she did much good more than the men in her place could do for woman feels more as being and reproducing—this brings the subject more into home relations men speak through and mostly from intellect and this addresses itself to that in others which is combative”

not easily shall we find elsewhere or before this time any written observations on the same subject so delicate and profound

the late dr channing whose enlarged and tender and religious nature shared every onward impulse of his tune though his thoughts followed his wishes with a deliberative caution which belonged to his habits and temperament was greatly interested in these expectations for women his own treatment of them was absolutely and thoroughly religious he regarded them as souls each of which had a destiny of its own incalculable to other minds and whose leading it must follow guided by the light of a private conscience he had sentiment delicacy kindness taste but they were all pervaded and ruled by this one thought that all beings had souls and must vindicate their own inheritance thus all beings were treated by him with an equal and sweet though solemn courtesy the young and unknown the woman and the child all felt themselves regarded with an infinite expectation from which there was no reaction to vulgar prejudice he demanded of all he met to use his favorite phrase “great truths”

his memory every way dear and reverend is by many especially cherished for this intercourse of unbroken respect

at one time when the progress of harriet martineau through this country angelina grimkes appearance in public and the visit of mrs jameson had turned his thoughts to this subject he expressed high hopes as to what the coming era would bring to woman he had been much pleased with the dignified courage of mrs jameson in taking up the defence of her sex in from which women usually shrink because if they express themselves on such subjects with sufficient force and clearness to do any good they are exposed to assaults whose vulgarity makes them painful in intercourse with such a woman he had shared her indignation at the base injustice in many respects and in many regions done to the sex and been led to think of it far more than ever before he seemed to think that he might some time write upon the subject that his aid is withdrawn from the cause is a subject of great regret for on this question as on others he would have known how to sum up the evidence and take in the noblest spirit middle ground he always furnished a platform on which opposing parties could stand and look at one another under the influence of his mildness and enlightened candor

two younger thinkers men both have uttered noble prophecies auspicious for woman kinmont all whose thoughts tended towards the establishment of the reign of love and peace thought that the inevitable means of this would be an increased predominance given to the idea of woman had he lived longer to see the growth of the peace party the reforms in life and medical practice which seek to substitute water for wine and drugs pulse for animal food he would have been confirmed in his view of the way in which the desired changes are to be effected

in this connection i must mention shelley who like all men of genius shared the feminine development and unlike many knew it his life was one of the first pulsebeats in the present reformgrowth he too abhorred blood and heat and by his system and his song tended to reinstate a plantlike gentleness in the development of energy in harmony with this his ideas of marriage were lofty and of course no less so of woman her nature and destiny

for woman if by a sympathy as to outward condition she is led to aid the enfranchisement of the slave must be no less so by inward tendency to favor measures which promise to bring the world more thoroughly and deeply into harmony with her nature when the lamb takes place of the lion as the emblem of nations both women and men will be as children of one spirit perpetual learners of the word and doers thereof not hearers only

a writer in the new york pathfinder in two articles headed “femality” has uttered a still more pregnant word than any we have named he views woman truly from the soul and not from society and the depth and leading of his thoughts are proportionably remarkable he views the feminine nature as a harmonizer of the vehement elements and this has often been hinted elsewhere but what he expresses most forcibly is the lyrical the inspiring and inspired apprehensiveness of her being

this view being identical with what i have before attempted to indicate as to her superior susceptibility to magnetic or electric influence i will now try to express myself more fully

there are two aspects of womans nature represented by the ancients as muse and minerva it is the former to which the writer in the pathfinder looks it is the latter which wordsworth has in mind when he says

         “with a placid brow
        which woman neer should forfeit keep thy vow”

the especial genius of woman i believe to be electrical in movement intuitive in function spiritual in tendency she excels not so easily in classification or recreation as in an instinctive seizure of causes and a simple breathing out of what she receives that has the singleness of life rather than the selecting and energizing of art

more native is it to her to be the living model of the artist than to set apart from herself any one form in objective reality more native to inspire and receive the poem than to create it in so far as soul is in her completely developed all soul is the same but in so far as it is modified in her as woman it flows it breathes it sings rather than deposits soil or finishes work and that which is especially feminine flushes in blossom the face of earth and pervades like air and water all this seeming solid globe daily renewing and purifying its life such may be the especially feminine element spoken of as femality but it is no more the order of nature that it should be incarnated pure in any form than that the masculine energy should exist unmingled with it in any form

male and female represent the two sides of the great radical dualism but in fact they are perpetually passing into one another fluid hardens to solid solid rushes to fluid there is no wholly masculine man no purely feminine woman

history jeers at the attempts of physiologists to bind great original laws by the forms which flow from them they make a rule they say from observation what can and cannot be in vain nature provides exceptions to every rule she sends women to battle and sets hercules spinning she enables women to bear immense burdens cold and frost she enables the man who feels maternal love to nourish his infant like a mother of late she plays still gayer pranks not only she deprives organizations but organs of a necessary end she enables people to read with the top of the head and see with the pit of the stomach presently she will make a female newton and a male syren

man partakes of the feminine in the apollo woman of the masculine as minerva

what i mean by the muse is that unimpeded clearness of the intuitive powers which a perfectly truthful adherence to every admonition of the higher instincts would bring to a finely organized human being it may appear as prophecy or as poesy it enabled cassandra to foresee the results of actions passing round her the seeress to behold the true character of the person through the mask of his customary life sometimes she saw a feminine form behind the man sometimes the reverse it enabled the daughter of linnæus to see the soul of the flower exhaling from the flower footnote the daughter of linnaeus states that while looking steadfastly at the red lily she saw its spirit hovering above it as a red flame it is true this like many fair spiritstories may be explained away as an optical illusion but its poetic beauty and meaning would even then make it valuable as an illustration of the spiritual fact it gave a man but a poetman the power of which he thus speaks “often in my contemplation of nature radiant intimations and as it were sheaves of light appear before me as to the facts of cosmogony in which my mind has perhaps taken especial part” he wisely adds “but it is necessary with earnestness to verify the knowledge we gain by these flashes of light” and none should forget this sight must be verified by light before it can deserve the honors of piety and genius yet sight comes first and of this sight of the world of causes this approximation to the region of primitive motions women i hold to be especially capable even without equal freedom with the other sex they have already shown themselves so and should these faculties have free play i believe they will open new deeper and purer sources of joyous inspiration than have as yet refreshed the earth

let us be wise and not impede the soul let her work as she will let us have one creative energy one incessant revelation let it take what form it will and let us not bind it by the past to man or woman black or white jove sprang from rhea pallas from jove so let it be

if it has been the tendency of these remarks to call woman rather to the minerva side—if i unlike the more generous writer have spoken from society no less than the soul—let it be pardoned it is love that has caused this—love for many incarcerated souls that might be freed could the idea of religious selfdependence be established in them could the weakening habit of dependence on others be broken up

proclus teaches that every life has in its sphere a totality or wholeness of the animating powers of the other spheres having only as its own characteristic a predominance of some one power thus jupiter comprises within himself the other twelve powers which stand thus the first triad is demiurgic or fabricative that is jupiter neptune vulcan the second defensive vesta minerva mars the third vivific ceres juno diana and the fourth mercury venus apollo elevating and harmonic in the sphere of jupiter energy is predominant—with venus beauty but each comprehends and apprehends all the others

when the same community of life and consciousness of mind begin among men humanity will have positively and finally subjugated its brute elements and titanic childhood criticism will have perished arbitrary limits and ignorant censure be impossible all will have entered upon the liberty of law and the harmony of common growth

then apollo will sing to his lyre what vulcan forges on the anvil and the muse weave anew the tapestries of minerva

it is therefore only in the present crisis that the preference is given to minerva the power of continence must establish the legitimacy of freedom the power of selfpoise the perfection of motion

every relation every gradation of nature is incalculably precious but only to the soul which is poised upon itself and to whom no loss no change can bring dull discord for it is in harmony with the central soul

if any individual live too much in relations so that he becomes a stranger to the resources of his own nature he falls after a while into a distraction or imbecility from which he can only be cured by a time of isolation which gives the renovating fountains time to rise up with a society it is the same many minds deprived of the traditionary or instinctive means of passing a cheerful existence must find help in selfimpulse or perish it is therefore that while any elevation in the view of union is to be hailed with joy we shall not decline celibacy as the great fact of the time it is one from which no vow no arrangement can at present save a thinking mind for now the rowers are pausing on their oars they wait a change before they can pull together all tends to illustrate the thought of a wise cotemporary union is only possible to those who are units to be fit for relations in time souls whether of man or woman must be able to do without them in the spirit

it is therefore that i would have woman lay aside all thought such as she habitually cherishes of being taught and led by men i would have her like the indian girl dedicate herself to the sun the sun of truth and go nowhere if his beams did not make clear the path i would have her free from compromise from complaisance from helplessness because i would have her good enough and strong enough to love one and all beings from the fulness not the poverty of being

men as at present instructed will not help this work because they also are under the slavery of habit i have seen with delight their poetic impulses a sister is the fairest ideal and how nobly wordsworth and even byron have written of a sister

there is no sweeter sight than to see a father with his little daughter very vulgar men become refined to the eye when leading a little girl by the hand at that moment the right relation between the sexes seems established and you feel as if the man would aid in the noblest purpose if you ask him in behalf of his little daughter once two fine figures stood before me thus the father of very intellectual aspect his falcon eye softened by affection as he looked down on his fair child she the image of himself only more graceful and brilliant in expression i was reminded of southeys kehama when lo the dream was rudely broken they were talking of education and he said

“i shall not have maria brought too forward if she knows too much she will never find a husband superior women hardly ever can”

“surely” said his wife with a blush “you wish maria to be as good and wise as she can whether it will help her to marriage or not”

“no” he persisted “i want her to have a sphere and a home and some one to protect her when i am gone”

it was a trifling incident but made a deep impression i felt that the holiest relations fail to instruct the unprepared and perverted mind if this man indeed could have looked at it on the other side he was the last that would have been willing to have been taken himself for the home and protection he could give but would have been much more likely to repeat the tale of alcibiades with his phials

but men do not look at both sides and women must leave off asking them and being influenced by them but retire within themselves and explore the groundwork of life till they find their peculiar secret then when they come forth again renovated and baptized they will know how to turn all dross to gold and will be rich and free though they live in a hut tranquil if in a crowd then their sweet singing shall not be from passionate impulse but the lyrical overflow of a divine rapture and a new music shall be evolved from this manychorded world

grant her then for a while the armor and the javelin let her put from her the press of other minds and meditate in virgin loneliness the same idea shall reappear in due time as muse or ceres the allkindly patient earthspirit

among the throng of symptoms which denote the present tendency to a crisis in the life of woman—which resembles the change from girlhood with its beautiful instincts but unharmonized thoughts its blind pupilage and restless seeking to selfpossessed wise and graceful womanhood—i have attempted to select a few

one of prominent interest is the unison upon the subject of three male minds which for width of culture power of selfconcentration and dignity of aim take rank as the prophets of the coming age while their histories and labors are rooted in the past

swedenborg came he tells us to interpret the past revelation and unfold a new he announces the new church that is to prepare the way for the new jerusalem a city built of precious stones hardened and purified by secret processes in the veins of earth through the ages

swedenborg approximated to that harmony between the scientific and poetic lives of mind which we hope from the perfected man the links that bind together the realms of nature the mysteries that accompany her births and growths were unusually plain to him he seems a man to whom insight was given at a period when the mental frame was sufficiently matured to retain and express its gifts

his views of woman are in the main satisfactory in some details we my object to them as in all his system there are still remains of what is arbitrary and seemingly groundless—fancies that show the marks of old habits and a nature as yet not thoroughly leavened with the spiritual leaven at least so it seems to me now i speak reverently for i find such reason to venerate swedenborg from an imperfect knowledge of his mind that i feel one more perfect might explain to me much that does not now secure my sympathy

his idea of woman is sufficiently large and noble to interpose no obstacle to her progress his idea of marriage is consequently sufficient man and woman share an angelic ministry the union is of one with one permanent and pure

as the new church extends its ranks the needs of woman must be more considered

quakerism also establishes woman on a sufficient equality with man but though the original thought of quakerism is pure its scope is too narrow and its influence having established a certain amount of good and made clear some truth must by degrees be merged in one of wider range footnote in worship at stated periods in daily expression whether by word or deed the quakers have placed woman on the same platform with man can any one assert that they have reason to repent this the mind of swedenborg appeals to the various nature of man and allows room for aesthetic culture and the free expression of energy

as apostle of the new order of the social fabric that is to rise from love and supersede the old that was based on strife charles fourier comes next expressing in an outward order many facts of which swedenborg saw the secret springs the mind of fourier though grand and clear was in some respects superficial he was a stranger to the highest experiences his eye was fixed on the outward more than the inward needs of man yet he too was a seer of the divine order in its musical expression if not in its poetic soul he has filled one department of instruction for the new era and the harmony in action and freedom for individual growth he hopes shall exist and if the methods he proposes should not prove the true ones yet his fair propositions shall give many hints and make room for the inspiration needed for such

he too places woman on an entire equality with man and wishes to give to one as to the other that independence which must result from intellectual and practical development

those who will consult him for no other reason might do so to see how the energies of woman may be made available in the pecuniary way the object of fourier was to give her the needed means of selfhelp that she might dignify and unfold her life for her own happiness and that of society the many now who see their daughters liable to destitution or vice to escape from it may be interested to examine the means if they have not yet soul enough to appreciate the ends he proposes

on the opposite side of the advancing army leads the great apostle of individual culture goethe swedenborg makes organization and union the necessary results of solitary thought fourier whose nature was above all constructive looked to them too exclusively better institutions he thought will make better men goethe expressed in every way the other side if one man could present better forms the rest could not use them till ripe for them

fourier says as the institutions so the men all follies are excusable and natural under bad institutions

goethe thinks as the man so the institutions there is no excuse for ignorance and folly a man can grow in any place if he will

ay but goethe bad institutions are prisonwalls and impure air that make him stupid so that he does not will

and thou fourier do not expect to change mankind at once or even “in three generations” by arrangement of groups and series or flourish of trumpets for attractive industry if these attempts are made by unready men they will fail

yet we prize the theory of fourier no less than the profound suggestion of goethe both are educating the age to a clearer consciousness of what man needs what man can be and better life must ensue

goethe proceeding on his own track elevating the human being in the most imperfect states of society by continual efforts at selfculture takes as good care of women as of men his mother the bold gay frau aja with such playful freedom of nature the wise and gentle maiden known in his youth over whose sickly solitude “the holy ghost brooded as a dove” his sister the intellectual woman par excellence the duchess amelia lili who combined the character of the woman of the world with the lyrical sweetness of the shepherdess on whose chaste and noble breast flowers and gems were equally at home all these had supplied abundant suggestions to his mind as to the wants and the possible excellences of woman and from his poetic soul grew up forms new and more admirable than life has yet produced for whom his clear eye marked out paths in the future

in faust margaret represents the redeeming power which at present upholds woman while waiting for a better day the lovely little girl pure in instinct ignorant in mind is misled and profaned by man abusing her confidencefootnote as faust says her only fault was a “kindly delusion”—”ein guter wahn” to the mater dolorosa she appeals for aid it is given to the soul if not against outward sorrow and the maiden enlightened by her sufferings refusing to receive temporal salvation by the aid of an evil power obtains the eternal in its stead

in the second part the intellectual man after all his manifold strivings owes to the interposition of her whom he had betrayed his salvation she intercedes this time herself a glorified spirit with the mater gloriosa

leonora too is woman as we see her now pure thoughtful refined by much acquaintance with grief

iphigenia he speaks of in his journals as his “daughter” and she is the daughter footnote goethe was as false to his ideas in practice as lord herbert and his punishment was the just and usual one of connections formed beneath the standard of right from the impulses of the baser self iphigenia was the worthy daughter of his mind but the son child of his degrading connection in actual life corresponded with that connection this son on whom goethe vainly lavished so much thought and care was like his mother and like goethes attachment for his mother “this young man” says a late wellinformed writer m henri blaze “wieland with good reason called the son of the servant der sohn der magd he inherited from his father only his name and his physique” whom a man will wish even if he has chosen his wife from very mean motives she is the virgin steadfast soul to whom falsehood is more dreadful than any other death

but it is to wilhelm meisters apprenticeship and wandering years that i would especially refer as these volumes contain the sum of the sages observations during a long life as to what man should do under present circumstances to obtain mastery over outward through an initiation into inward life and severe discipline of faculty

as wilhelm advances into the upward path he becomes acquainted with better forms of woman by knowing how to seek and how to prize them when found for the weak and immature man will often admire a superior woman but he will not be able to abide by a feeling which is too severe a tax on his habitual existence but with wilhelm the gradation is natural and expresses ascent in the scale of being at first he finds charm in mariana and philina very common forms of feminine character not without redeeming traits no less than charms but without wisdom or purity soon he is attended by mignon the finest expression ever yet given to what i have called the lyrical element in woman she is a child but too fullgrown for this man he loves but cannot follow her yet is the association not without an enduring influence poesy has been domesticated in his life and though he strives to bind down her heavenward impulse as art or apothegm these are only the tents beneath which he may sojourn for a while but which may be easily struck and carried on limitless wanderings

advancing into the region of thought he encounters a wise philanthropy in natalia instructed let us observe by an uncle practical judgment and the outward economy of life in theresa pure devotion in the fair saint

further and last he comes to the house of macaria the soul of a star that is a pure and perfected intelligence embodied in feminine form and the centre of a world whose members revolve harmoniously around her she instructs him in the archives of a rich human history and introduces him to the contemplation of the heavens

from the hours passed by the side of mariana to these with macaria is a wide distance for human feet to traverse nor has wilhelm travelled so far seen and suffered so much in vain he now begins to study how he may aid the next generation he sees objects in harmonious arrangement and from his observations deduces precepts by which to guide his course as a teacher and a master “helpfull comfortfull”

in all these expressions of woman the aim of goethe is satisfactory to me he aims at a pure selfsubsistence and a free development of any powers with which they may be gifted by nature as much for them as for men they are units addressed as souls accordingly the meeting between man and woman as represented by him is equal and noble and if he does not depict marriage he makes it possible

in the macaria bound with the heavenly bodies in fixed revolutions the centre of all relations herself unrelated he expresses the minerva side of feminine nature it was not by chance that goethe gave her this name macaria the daughter of hercules who offered herself as a victim for the good of her country was canonized by the greeks and worshipped as the goddess of true felicity goethe has embodied this felicity as the serenity that arises from wisdom a wisdom such as the jewish wise man venerated alike instructed in the designs of heaven and the methods necessary to carry them into effect upon earth

mignon is the electrical inspired lyrical nature and wherever it appears we echo in our aspirations that of the child

         “so let me seem until i be—
        take not the white robe away”
                            
         “though i lived without care and toil
        yet felt i sharp pain enough to
        make me again forever young”

all these women though we see them in relations we can think of as unrelated they all are very individual yet seem nowhere restrained they satisfy for the present yet arouse an infinite expectation

the economist theresa the benevolent natalia the fair saint have chosen a path but their thoughts are not narrowed to it the functions of life to them are not ends but suggestions

thus to them all things are important because none is necessary their different characters have fair play and each is beautiful in its minute indications for nothing is enforced or conventional but everything however slight grows from the essential life of the being

mignon and theresa wear male attire when they like and it is graceful for them to do so while macaria is confined to her armchair behind the green curtain and the fair saint could not bear a speck of dust on her robe

all things are in their places in this little world because all is natural and free just as “there is room for everything out of doors” yet all is rounded in by natural harmony which will always arise where truth and love are sought in the light of freedom

goethes book bodes an era of freedom like its own of “extraordinary generous seeking” and new revelations new individualities shall be developed in the actual world which shall advance upon it as gently as the figures come out upon his canvas

i have indicated on this point the coincidence between his hopes and those of fourier though his are directed by an infinitely higher and deeper knowledge of human nature but for our present purpose it is sufficient to show how surely these different paths have conducted to the same end two earnest thinkers in some other place i wish to point out similar coincidences between goethes model school and the plans of fourier which may cast light upon the page of prophecy

many women have observed that the time drew nigh for a better care of the sex and have thrown out hints that may be useful among these may be mentioned—

miss edgeworth who although restrained by the habits of her age and country and belonging more to the eighteenth than the nineteenth century has done excellently as far as she goes she had a horror of sentimentalism and of the love of notoriety and saw how likely women in the early stages of culture were to aim at these therefore she bent her efforts to recommending domestic life but the methods she recommends are such as will fit a character for any position to which it may be called she taught a contempt of falsehood no less in its most graceful than in its meanest apparitions the cultivation of a clear independent judgment and adherence to its dictates habits of various and liberal study and employment and a capacity for friendship her standard of character is the same for both sexes—truth honor enlightened benevolence and aspiration after knowledge of poetry she knows nothing and her religion consists in honor and loyalty to obligations once assumed—in short in “the great idea of duty which holds us upright” her whole tendency is practical

mrs jameson is a sentimentalist and therefore suits us ill in some respects but she is full of talent has a just and refined perception of the beautiful and a genuine courage when she finds it necessary she does not appear to have thought out thoroughly the subject on which we are engaged and her opinions expressed as opinions are sometimes inconsistent with one another but from the refined perception of character admirable suggestions are given in her “women of shakspeare” and “loves of the poets”

but that for which i most respect her is the decision with which she speaks on a subject which refined women are usually afraid to approach for fear of the insult and scurrile jest they may encounter but on which she neither can nor will restrain the indignation of a full heart i refer to the degradation of a large portion of women into the sold and polluted slaves of men and the daring with which the legislator and man of the world lifts his head beneath the heavens and says “this must be it cannot be helped it is a necessary accompaniment of civilization”

so speaks the citizen man born of woman the father of daughters declares that he will and must buy the comforts and commercial advantages of his london vienna paris new york by conniving at the moral death the damnation so far as the action of society can insure it of thousands of women for each splendid metropolis

o men i speak not to you it is true that your wickedness for you must not deny that at least nine thousand out of the ten fall through the vanity you have systematically flattered or the promises you have treacherously broken yes it is true that your wickedness is its own punishment your forms degraded and your eyes clouded by secret sin natural harmony broken and fineness of perception destroyed in your mental and bodily organization god and love shut out from your hearts by the foul visitants you have permitted there incapable of pure marriage incapable of pure parentage incapable of worship o wretched men your sin is its own punishment you have lost the world in losing yourselves who ruins another has admitted the worm to the root of his own tree and the fuller ye fill the cup of evil the deeper must be your own bitter draught but i speak not to you—you need to teach and warn one another and more than one voice rises in earnestness and all that women say to the heart that has once chosen the evil path is considered prudery or ignorance or perhaps a feebleness of nature which exempts from similar temptations

but to you women american women a few words may not be addressed in vain one here and there may listen

you know how it was in the oriental clime one man if wealth permitted had several wives and many handmaidens the chastity and equality of genuine marriage with “the thousand decencies that flow” from its communion the precious virtues that gradually may be matured within its enclosure were unknown

but this man did not wrong according to his light what he did he might publish to god and man it was not a wicked secret that hid in vile lurkingplaces and dens like the banquets of beasts of prey those women were not lost not polluted in their own eyes nor those of others if they were not in a state of knowledge and virtue they were at least in one of comparative innocence

you know how it was with the natives of this continent a chief had many wives whom he maintained and who did his household work those women were but servants still they enjoyed the respect of others and their own they lived together in peace they knew that a sin against what was in their nation esteemed virtue would be as strictly punished in man as in woman

now pass to the countries where marriage is between one and one i will not speak of the pagan nations but come to those which own the christian rule we all know what that enjoins there is a standard to appeal to

see now not the mass of the people for we all know that it is a proverb and a bitter jest to speak of the “downtrodden million” we know that down to our own time a principle never had so fair a chance to pervade the mass of the people but that we must solicit its illustration from select examples

take the paladin take the poet did they believe purity more impossible to man than to woman did they wish woman to believe that man was less amenable to higher motives—that pure aspirations would not guard him against bad passions—that honorable employments and temperate habits would not keep him free from slavery to the body o no love was to them a part of heaven and they could not even wish to receive its happiness unless assured of being worthy of it its highest happiness to them was that it made them wish to be worthy they courted probation they wished not the title of knight till the banner had been upheld in the heats of battle amid the rout of cowards

i ask of you young girls—i do not mean you whose heart is that of an old coxcomb though your looks have not yet lost their sunny tinge not of you whose whole character is tainted with vanity inherited or taught who have early learned the love of coquettish excitement and whose eyes rove restlessly in search of a “conquest” or a “beau” you who are ashamed not to be seen by others the mark of the most contemptuous flattery or injurious desire to such i do not speak but to thee maiden who if not so fair art yet of that unpolluted nature which milton saw when he dreamed of comus and the paradise thou child of an unprofaned wedlock brought up amid the teachings of the woods and fields kept fancyfree by useful employment and a free flight into the heaven of thought loving to please only those whom thou wouldst not be ashamed to love i ask of thee whose cheek has not forgotten its blush nor thy heart its larklike hopes if he whom thou mayest hope the father will send thee as the companion of lifes toils and joys is not to thy thought pure is not manliness to thy thought purity not lawlessness can his lips speak falsely can he do in secret what he could not avow to the mother that bore him o say dost thou not look for a heart free open as thine own all whose thoughts may be avowed incapable of wronging the innocent or still further degrading the fallen—a man in short in whom brute nature is entirely subject to the impulses of his better self

yes it was thus that thou didst hope for i have many many times seen the image of a future life of a destined spouse painted on the tablets of a virgin heart

it might be that she was not true to these hopes she was taken into what is called “the world” froth and scum as it mostly is on the social caldron there she saw fair woman carried in the waltz close to the heart of a being who appeared to her a satyr being warned by a male friend that he was in fact of that class and not fit for such familiar nearness to a chaste being the advised replied that “women should know nothing about such things” she saw one fairer given in wedlock to a man of the same class “papa and mamma said that all men were faulty at some time in their lives they had a great many temptations frederick would be so happy at home he would not want to do wrong” she turned to the married women they o tenfold horror laughed at her supposing “men were like women” sometimes i say she was not true and either sadly accommodated herself to “womans lot” or acquired a taste for satyrsociety like some of the nymphs and all the bacchanals of old but to those who could not and would not accept a mess of pottage or a circe cup in lieu of their birthright and to these others who have yet their choice to make i say courage i have some words of cheer for you a man himself of unbroken purity reported to me the words of a foreign artist that “the world would never be better till men subjected themselves to the same laws they had imposed on women” that artist he added was true to the thought the same was true of canova the same of beethoven “like each other demigod they kept themselves free from stain” and michael angelo looking over here from the loneliness of his century might meet some eyes that need not shun his glance

in private life i am assured by men who are not so sustained and occupied by the worship of pure beauty that a similar consecration is possible is practised that many men feel that no temptation can be too strong for the will of man if he invokes the aid of the spirit instead of seeking extenuation from the brute alliances of his nature in short what the child fancies is really true though almost the whole world declares it a lie man is a child of god and if he seeks his guidance to keep the heart with diligence it will be so given that all the issues of life may be pure life will then be a temple

        the temple round
        spread green the pleasant ground
        the fair colonnade
        be of pure marble pillars made
        strong to sustain the roof
        time and tempest proof
        yet amidst which the lightest breeze
        can play as it please
        the audience hall
        be free to all
        who revere
        the power worshipped here
        sole guide of youth
        unswerving truth
        in the inmost shrine

        only seen

        those who initiated are
        declare
        as the hours
        usher in varying hopes and powers
        it changes its face
        it changes its age
        now a young beaming grace
        now nestorian sage
        but to the pure in heart
        this shape of primal art
        in age is fair
        in youth seems wise
        beyond compare
        above surprise
        what it teaches native seems
        its new lore our ancient dreams
        incense rises from the ground
        music flows around
        firm rest the feet below clear gaze the eyes above
        when truth to point the way through life assumes the wand of love
        but if she cast aside the robe of green
        winters silver sheen
        white pure as light
        makes gentle shroud as worthy weed as bridal robe had been

         footnote as described by the historians—

         “the temple of juno is like what the character of woman should be

        porch noble inviting aspect of the life
        kaos receives the worshippers see here the statue of the divinity

we are now in a transition state and but few steps have yet been taken from polygamy europe passed to the marriage de convenance this was scarcely an improvement an attempt was then made to substitute genuine marriage the mutual choice of souls inducing a permanent union as yet baffled on every side by the haste the ignorance or the impurity of man

where man assumes a high principle to which he is not yet ripened it will happen for a long time that the few will be nobler than before the many worse thus now in the country of sidney and milton the metropolis is a den of wickedness and a sty of sensuality in the country of lady russell the custom of english peeresses of selling their daughters to the highest bidder is made the theme and jest of fashionable novels by unthinking children who would stare at the idea of sending them to a turkish slavedealer though the circumstances of the bargain are there less degrading as the will and thoughts of the person sold are not so degraded by it and it is not done in defiance of an acknowledged law of right in the land and the age

i must here add that i do not believe there ever was put upon record more depravation of man and more despicable frivolity of thought and aim in woman than in the novels which purport to give the picture of english fashionable life which are read with such favor in our drawingrooms and give the tone to the manners of some circles compared with the cold hardhearted folly there described crime is hopeful for it at least shows some power remaining in the mental constitution

to return—attention has been awakened among men to the stains of celibacy and the profanations of marriage they begin to write about it and lecture about it it is the tendency now to endeavor to help the erring by showing them the physical law this is wise and excellent but forget not the better half cold bathing and exercise will not suffice to keep a life pure without an inward baptism and noble exhilarating employment for the thoughts and the passions early marriages are desirable but if and the world is now so out of joint that there are a hundred thousand chances to one against it a man does not early or at all find the person to whom he can be united in the marriage of souls will you give him in the marriage de convenance or if not married can you find no way for him to lead a virtuous and happy life think of it well ye who think yourselves better than pagans for many of them knew this sure way footnote the persian sacred books the desatir describe the great and holy prince ky khosrou as being “an angel and the son of an angel” one to whom the supreme says “thou art not absent from before me for one twinkling of an eye i am never out of thy heart and i am contained in nothing but in thy heart and in a heart like thy heart and i am nearer unto thee than thou art to thyself” this prince had in his golden seraglio three ladies of surpassing beauty and all four in this royal monastery passed their lives and left the world as virgins

the persian people had no scepticism when the history of such a mind was narrated

to you women of america it is more especially my business to address myself on this subject and my advice may be classed under three heads

clear your souls from the taint of vanity

do not rejoice in conquests either that your power to allure may be seen by other women or for the pleasure of rousing passionate feelings that gratify your love of excitement

it must happen no doubt that frank and generous women will excite love they do not reciprocate but in nine cases out of ten the woman has half consciously done much to excite in this case she shall not be held guiltless either as to the unhappiness or injury of the lover pure love inspired by a worthy object must ennoble and bless whether mutual or not but that which is excited by coquettish attraction of any grade of refinement must cause bitterness and doubt as to the reality of human goodness so soon as the flush of passion is over and that you may avoid all taste for these false pleasures

         “steep the soul
        in one pure love and it will lost thee long”

the love of truth the love of excellence whether you clothe them in the person of a special object or not will have power to save you from following duessa and lead you in the green glades where unas feet have trod

it was on this one subject that a venerable champion of good the last representative of the spirit which sanctified the revolution and gave our country such a sunlight of hope in the eyes of the nations the same who lately in boston offered anew to the young men the pledge taken by the young men of his day offered also his counsel on being addressed by the principal of a girls school thus—

                                reply of mr adams

mr adams was so deeply affected by the address of miss foster as to be for some time inaudible when heard he spoke as follows

“this is the first instance in which a lady has thus addressed me personally and i trust that all the ladies present will be able sufficiently to enter into my feelings to know that i am more affected by this honor than by any other i could hare received

“you have been pleased madam to allude to the character of my father and the history of my family and their services to the country it is indeed true that from the existence of the republic as an independent nation my father and myself have been in the public service of the country almost without interruption i came into the world as a person having personal responsibilities with the declaration of independence which constituted us a nation i was a child at that time and had then perhaps the greatest of blessings that can be bestowed on man—a mother who was anxious and capable to form her children to be what they ought to be from that mother i derived whatever instruction—religious especially and moral—has pervaded a long life i will not say perfectly and as it ought to be but i will say because it is justice only to the memory of her whom i revere that if in the course of my life there has been any imperfection or deviation from what she taught me the fault is mine and not hers

“with such a mother and such other relations with the sex of sister wife and daughter it has been the perpetual instruction of my life to love and revere the female sex and in order to carry that sentiment of love and reverence to its highest degree of perfection i know of nothing that exists in human society better adapted to produce that result than institutions of the character that i have now the honor to address

“i have been taught as i have said through the course of my life to love and to revere the female sex but i have been taught also—and that lesson has perhaps impressed itself on my mind even more strongly it may be than the other—i have been taught not to flatter them it is not unusual in the intercourse of man with the other sex—and especially for young men—to think that the way to win the hearts of ladies is by flattery to love and to revere the sex is what i think the duty of man but not to flatter them and this i would say to the young ladies here—and if they and others present will allow me with all the authority which nearly four score years may have with those who have not yet attained one score—i would say to them what i have no doubt they say to themselves and are taught here not to take the flattery of men as proof of perfection

“i am now however i fear assuming too much of a character that does not exactly belong to me i therefore conclude by assuring you madam that your reception of me has affected me as you perceive more than i can express in words and that i shall offer my best prayers till my latest hour to the creator of us all that this institution especially and all others of a similar kind designed to form the female mind to wisdom and virtue may prosper to the end of time”

it will be interesting to add here the character of mr adams mother as drawn by her husband the first john adams in a family letter footnote journal and correspondence of miss adams vol i p 246 written just before his death

“i have reserved for the last the life of lady russell this i have not yet read because i read it more than forty years ago on this hangs a tale which you ought to know and communicate it to your children i bought the life and letters of lady russell in the year 1775 and sent it to your grandmother with an express intent and desire that she should consider it a mirror in which to contemplate herself for at that time i thought it extremely probable from the daring and dangerous career i was determined to run that she would one day find herself in the situation of lady russell her husband without a head this lady was more beautiful than lady russell had a brighter genius more information a more refined taste and at least her equal in the virtues of the heart equal fortitude and firmness of character equal resignation to the will of heaven equal in all the virtues and graces of the christian life like lady russell she never by word or look discouraged me from running all hazards for the salvation of my countrys liberties she was willing to share with me and that her children should share with us both in all the dangerous consequences we had to hazard”

will a woman who loves flattery or an aimless excitement who wastes the flower of her mind on transitory sentiments ever be loved with a love like that when fifty years trial have entitled to the privileges of “the golden marriage”

such was the love of the ironhanded warrior for her not his handmaid but his helpmeet

“whom god loves to him gives he such a wife”

i find the whole of what i want in this relation in the two epithets by which milton makes adam address his wife

in the intercourse of every day he begins

         “daughter of god and man accomplished eve”
         footnote see appendix h
in a moment of stronger feeling

         “daughter of god and man immortal eve”

what majesty in the cadence of the line what dignity what reverence in the attitude both of giver and receiver

the woman who permits in her life the alloy of vanity the woman who lives upon flattery coarse or fine shall never be thus addressed she is not immortal so far as her will is concerned and every woman who does so creates miasma whose spread is indefinite the hand which casts into the waters of life a stone of offence knows not how far the circles thus caused may spread their agitations

a little while since i was at one of the most fashionable places of public resort i saw there many women dressed without regard to the season or the demands of the place in apery or as it looked in mockery of european fashions i saw their eyes restlessly courting attention i saw the way in which it was paid the style of devotion almost an open sneer which it pleased those ladies to receive from men whose expression marked their own low position in the moral and intellectual world those women went to their pillows with their heads full of folly their hearts of jealousy or gratified vanity those men with the low opinion they already entertained of woman confirmed these were american ladies that is they were of that class who have wealth and leisure to make full use of the day and confer benefits on others they were of that class whom the possession of external advantages makes of pernicious example to many if these advantages be misused

soon after i met a circle of women stamped by society as among the most degraded of their sex “how” it was asked of them “did you come here” for by the society that i saw in the former place they were shut up in a prison the causes were not difficult to trace love of dress love of flattery love of excitement they had not dresses like the other ladies so they stole them they could not pay for flattery by distinctions and the dower of a worldly marriage so they paid by the profanation of their persons in excitement more and more madly sought from day to day they drowned the voice of conscience

now i ask you my sisters if the women at the fashionable house be not answerable for those women being in the prison

as to position in the world of souls we may suppose the women of the prison stood fairest both because they had misused less light and because loneliness and sorrow had brought some of them to feel the need of better life nearer truth and good this was no merit in them being an effect of circumstance but it was hopeful but you my friends and some of you i have already met consecrate yourselves without waiting for reproof in free love and unbroken energy to win and to diffuse a better life offer beauty talents riches on the altar thus shall you keep spotless your own hearts and be visibly or invisibly the angels to others

i would urge upon those women who have not yet considered this subject to do so do not forget the unfortunates who dare not cross your guarded way if it do not suit you to act with those who have organized measures of reform then hold not yourself excused from acting in private seek out these degraded women give them tender sympathy counsel employment take the place of mothers such as might have saved them originally

if you can do little for those already under the ban of the world—and the bestconsidered efforts have often failed from a want of strength in those unhappy ones to bear up against the sting of shame and the prejudices of the world which makes them seek oblivion again in their old excitements—you will at least leave a sense of love and justice in their hearts that will prevent their becoming utterly embittered and corrupt and you may learn the means of prevention for those yet uninjured these will be found in a diffusion of mental culture simple tastes best taught by your example a genuine selfrespect and above all what the influence of man tends to hide from woman the love and fear of a divine in preference to a human tribunal

but suppose you save many who would have lost their bodily innocence for as to mental the loss of that is incalculably more general through mere vanity and folly there still remain many the prey and spoil of the brute passions of man for the stories frequent in our newspapers outshame antiquity and vie with the horrors of war

as to this it must be considered that as the vanity and proneness to seduction of the imprisoned women represented a general degradation in their sex so do these acts a still more general and worse in the male where so many are weak it is natural there should be many lost where legislators admit that ten thousand prostitutes are a fair proportion to one city and husbands tell their wives that it is folly to expect chastity from men it is inevitable that there should be many monsters of vice

i must in this place mention with respect and gratitude the conduct of mrs child in the case of amelia norman the action and speech of this lady was of straightforward nobleness undeterred by custom or cavil from duty toward an injured sister she showed the case and the arguments the counsel against the prisoner had the assurance to use in their true light to the public she put the case on the only ground of religion and equity she was successful in arresting the attention of many who had before shrugged their shoulders and let sin pass as necessarily a part of the company of men they begin to ask whether virtue is not possible perhaps necessary to man as well as to woman they begin to fear that the perdition of a woman must involve that of a man this is a crisis the results of this case will be important

in this connection i must mention eugene sue the french novelist several of whose works have been lately translated among us as having the true spirit of reform as to women like every other french writer he is still tainted with the transmissions of the old regime still falsehood may be permitted for the sake of advancing truth evil as the way to good even george sand who would trample on every graceful decorum and every human law for the sake of a sincere life does not see that she violates it by making her heroines able to tell falsehoods in a good cause these french writers need ever to be confronted by the clear perception of the english and german mind that the only good man consequently the only good reformer is he

“who bases good on good alone and owes
to virtue every triumph that he knows”

still sue has the heart of a reformer and especially towards women he sees what they need and what causes are injuring them from the histories of fleur de marie and la louve from the lovely and independent character of rigolette from the distortion given to matildas mind by the present views of marriage and from the truly noble and immortal character of the “humpbacked sempstress” in the “wandering jew” may be gathered much that shall elucidate doubt and direct inquiry on this subject in reform as in philosophy the french are the interpreters to the civilized world their own attainments are not great but they make clear the post and break down barriers to the future

observe that the good man of sue is as pure as sir charles grandison

apropos to sir charles women are accustomed to be told by men that the reform is to come from them “you” say the men “must frown upon vice you must decline the attentions of the corrupt you must not submit to the will of your husband when it seems to you unworthy but give the laws in marriage and redeem it from its present sensual and mental pollutions”

this seems to us hard men have indeed been for more than a hundred years rating women for countenancing vice but at the same time they have carefully hid from them its nature so that the preference often shown by women for bad men arises rather from a confused idea that they are bold and adventurous acquainted with regions which women are forbidden to explore and the curiosity that ensues than a corrupt heart in the woman as to marriage it has been inculcated on women for centuries that men have not only stronger passions than they but of a sort that it would be shameful for them to share or even understand that therefore they must “confide in their husbands” that is submit implicitly to their will that the least appearance of coldness or withdrawal from whatever cause in the wife is wicked because liable to turn her husbands thoughts to illicit indulgence for a man is so constituted that he must indulge his passions or die

accordingly a great part of women look upon men as a kind of wild beasts but “suppose they are all alike” the unmarried are assured by the married that “if they knew men as they do” that is by being married to them “they would not expect continence or selfgovernment from them”

i might accumulate illustrations on this theme drawn from acquaintance with the histories of women which would startle and grieve all thinking men but i forbear let sir charles grandison preach to his own sex or if none there be who feels himself able to speak with authority from a life unspotted in will or deed let those who are convinced of the practicability and need of a pure life as the foreign artist was advise the others and warn them by their own example if need be

the following passage from a female writer on female affairs expresses a prevalent way of thinking on this subject

“it may be that a young woman exempt from all motives of vanity determines to take for a husband a man who does not inspire her with a very decided inclination imperious circumstances the evident interest of her family or the danger of suffering celibacy may explain such a resolution if however she were to endeavor to surmount a personal repugnance we should look upon this as injudicious such a rebellion of nature marks the limit that the influence of parents or the selfsacrifice of the young girl should never pass we shall be told that this repugnance is an affair of the imagination it may be so but imagination is a power which it is temerity to brave and its antipathy is more difficult to conquer than its preference” footnote madame necker de saussure

among ourselves the exhibition of such a repugnance from a woman who had been given in marriage “by advice of friends” was treated by an eminent physician as sufficient proof of insanity if he had said sufficient cause for it he would have been nearer right

it has been suggested by men who were pained by seeing bad men admitted freely to the society of modest women—thereby encouraged to vice by impunity and corrupting the atmosphere of homes—that there should be a senate of the matrons in each city and town who should decide what candidates were fit for admission to their houses and the society of their daughters footnote see goethes tasso “a synod of good women should decide”—if the golden age is to be restored

such a plan might have excellent results but it argues a moral dignity and decision which does not yet exist and needs to be induced by knowledge and reflection it has been the tone to keep women ignorant on these subjects or when they were not to command that they should seem so “it is indelicate” says the father or husband “to inquire into the private character of such an one it is sufficient that i do not think him unfit to visit you” and so this man who would not tolerate these pages in his house “unfit for family reading” because they speak plainly introduces there a man whose shame is written on his brow as well as the open secret of the whole town and presently if respectable still and rich enough gives him his daughter to wife the mother affects ignorance “supposing he is no worse than most men” the daughter is ignorant something in the mind of the new spouse seems strange to her but she supposes it is “womans lot” not to be perfectly happy in her affections she has always heard “men could not understand women” so she weeps alone or takes to dress and the duties of the house the husband of course makes no avowal and dreams of no redemption

“in the heart of every young woman” says the female writer above quoted addressing herself to the husband “depend upon it there is a fund of exalted ideas she conceals represses without succeeding in smothering them so long as these ideas in your wife are directed to you they are no doubt innocent but take care that they be not accompanied with too much pain in other respects also spare her delicacy let all the antecedent parts of your life if there are such which would give her pain be concealed from her her happiness and her respect for you would suffer from this misplaced confidence allow her to retain that flower of purity which should distinguish her in your eyes from every other woman” we should think so truly under this canon such a man must esteem purity an exotic that could only be preserved by the greatest care of the degree of mental intimacy possible in such a marriage let every one judge for himself

on this subject let every woman who has once begun to think examine herself see whether she does not suppose virtue possible and necessary to man and whether she would not desire for her son a virtue which aimed at a fitness for a divine life and involved if not asceticism that degree of power over the lower self which shall “not exterminate the passions but keep them chained at the feet of reason” the passions like fire are a bad muster but confine them to the hearth and the altar and they give life to the social economy and make each sacrifice meet for heaven

when many women have thought upon this subject some will be fit for the senate and one such senate in operation would affect the morals of the civilized world

at present i look to the young as preparatory to the senate i should like to see a society of novices such as the world has never yet seen bound by no oath wearing no badge in place of an oath they should have a religious faith in the capacity of man for virtue instead of a badge should wear in the heart a firm resolve not to stop short of the destiny promised him as a son of god their service should be action and conservatism not of old habits but of a better nature enlightened by hopes that daily grow brighter

if sin was to remain in the world it should not be by their connivance at its stay or one moments concession to its claims

they should succor the oppressed and pay to the upright the reverence due in heroworship by seeking to emulate them they would not denounce the willingly bad but they could not be with them for the two classes could not breathe the same atmosphere

they would heed no detention from the timeserving the worldly and the timid

they could love no pleasures that were not innocent and capable of good fruit

i saw in a foreign paper the title now given to a party abroad “los exaltados” such would be the title now given these children by the world los exaltados las exaltadas but the world would not sneer always for from them would issue a virtue by which it would at last be exalted too

i have in my eye a youth and a maiden whom i look to as the nucleus of such a class they are both in early youth both as yet uncontaminated both aspiring without rashness both thoughtful both capable of deep affection both of strong nature and sweet feelings both capable of large mental development they reside in different regions of earth but their place in the soul is the same to them i look as perhaps the harbingers and leaders of a new era for never yet have i known minds so truly virgin without narrowness or ignorance

when men call upon women to redeem them they mean such maidens but such are not easily formed under the present influences of society as there are more such young men to help give a different tone there will be more such maidens

the english novelist disraeli has in his novel of “the young duke” made a man of the most depraved stock be redeemed by a woman who despises him when he has only the brilliant mask of fortune and beauty to cover the poverty of his heart and brain but knows how to encourage him when he enters on a better course but this woman was educated by a father who valued character in women

still there will come now and then one who will as i hope of my young exaltada be example and instruction for the rest it was not the opinion of woman current among jewish men that formed the character of the mother of jesus

since the sliding and backsliding men of the world no less than the mystics declare that as through woman man was lost so through woman must man be redeemed the time must be at hand when she knows herself indeed as “accomplished” still more as “immortal eve” this may be

as an immortal she may also know and inspire immortal love a happiness not to be dreamed of under the circumstances advised in the last quotation where love is based on concealment it must of course disappear when the soul enters the scene of clear vision

and without this hope how worthless every plan every bond every power

“the giants” said the scandinavian saga “had induced loke the spirit that hovers between good and ill to steal for them iduna goddess of immortality and her apples of pure gold he lured her out by promising to show on a marvellous tree he had discovered apples beautiful as her own if she would only take them with her for a comparison thus having lured her beyond the heavenly domain she was seized and carried away captive by the powers of misrule

“as now the gods could not find their friend iduna they were confused with grief indeed they began visibly to grow old and gray discords arose and love grew cold indeed odur spouse of the goddess of love and beauty wandered away and returned no more at last however the gods discovering the treachery of loke obliged him to win back iduna from the prison in which she sat mourning he changed himself into a falcon and brought her back as a swallow fiercely pursued by the giant king in the form of an eagle so she strives to return among us light and small as a swallow we must welcome her form as the speck on the sky that assures the glad blue of summer yet one swallow does not make a summer let us solicit them in flights and flocks”

returning from the future to the present let us see what forms iduna takes as she moves along the declivity of centuries to the valley where the lily flower may concentrate all its fragrance

it would seem as if this time were not very near to one fresh from books such as i have of late been—no not reading but sighing over a crowd of books having been sent me since my friends knew me to be engaged in this way on womans “sphere” womans “mission” and womans “destiny” i believe that almost all that is extant of formal precept has come under my eye among these i read with refreshment a little one called “the whole duty of woman” “indited by a noble lady at the request of a noble lord” and which has this much of nobleness that the view it takes is a religious one it aims to fit woman for heaven the main bent of most of the others is to fit her to please or at least not to disturb a husband

among these i select as a favorable specimen the book i have already quoted “the study footnote this title seems to be incorrectly translated from the french i have not seen the original of the life of woman by madame necker de saussure of geneva translated from the french” this book was published at philadelphia and has been read with much favor here madame necker is the cousin of madame de stael and has taken from her works the motto prefixed to this

“cette vie na quelque prix que si elle sert a leducation morale do notre coeur”

mde necker is by nature capable of entire consistency in the application of this motto and therefore the qualifications she makes in the instructions given to her own sex show forcibly the weight which still paralyzes and distorts the energies of that sex

the book is rich in passages marked by feeling and good suggestions but taken in the whole the impression it leaves is this

woman is and shall remain inferior to man and subject to his will and in endeavoring to aid her we must anxiously avoid anything that can be misconstrued into expression of the contrary opinion else the men will be alarmed and combine to defeat our efforts

the present is a good time for these efforts for men are less occupied about women than formerly let us then seize upon the occasion and do what we can to make our lot tolerable but we must sedulously avoid encroaching on the territory of man if we study natural history our observations may be made useful by some male naturalist if we draw well we may make our services acceptable to the artists but our names must not be known and to bring these labors to any result we must take some man for our head and be his hands

the lot of woman is sad she is constituted to expect and need a happiness that cannot exist on earth she must stifle such aspirations within her secret heart and fit herself as well as she can for a life of resignations and consolations

she will be very lonely while living with her husband she must not expect to open her heart to him fully or that after marriage he will be capable of the refined service of love the man is not born for the woman only the woman for the man “men cannot understand the hearts of women” the life of woman must be outwardly a wellintentioned cheerful dissimulation of her real life

naturally the feelings of the mother at the birth of a female child resemble those of the paraguay woman described by southey as lamenting in such heartbreaking tones that her mother did not kill her the hour she was born—”her mother who knew what this life of a woman must be”—or of those women seen at the north by sir a mackenzie who performed this pious duty towards female infants whenever they had an opportunity

“after the first delight the young mother experiences feelings a little different according as the birth of a son or a daughter has been announced

“is it a son a sort of glory swells at this thought the heart of the mother she seems to feel that she is entitled to gratitude she has given a citizen a defender to her country to her husband an heir of his name to herself a protector and yet the contrast of all these fine titles with this being so humble soon strikes her at the aspect of this frail treasure opposite feelings agitate her heart she seems to recognise in him a nature superior to her own but subjected to a low condition and she honors a future greatness in the object of extreme compassion somewhat of that respect and adoration for a feeble child of which some fine pictures offer the expression in the features of the happy mary seem reproduced with the young mother who has given birth to a son

“is it a daughter there is usually a slight degree of regret so deeply rooted is the idea of the superiority of man in happiness and dignity and yet as she looks upon this child she is more and more softened towards it a deep sympathy—a sentiment of identity with this delicate being—takes possession of her an extreme pity for so much weakness a more pressing need of prayer stirs her heart whatever sorrows she may have felt she dreads for her daughter but she will guide her to become much wiser much better than herself and then the gayety the frivolity of the young woman have their turn this little creature is a flower to cultivate a doll to decorate”

similar sadness at the birth of a daughter i have heard mothers express not unfrequently

as to this living so entirely for men i should think when it was proposed to women they would feel at least some spark of the old spirit of races allied to our own “if he is to be my bridegroom and lord” cries brunhilda footnote see the nibelungen lays “he must first be able to pass through fire and water” “i will serve at the banquet” says the walkyrie “but only him who in the trial of deadly combat has shown himself a hero”

if women are to be bondmaids let it be to men superior to women in fortitude in aspiration in moral power in refined sense of beauty you who give yourselves “to be supported” or because “one must love something” are they who make the lot of the sex such that mothers are sad when daughters are born

it marks the state of feeling on this subject that it was mentioned as a bitter censure on a woman who had influence over those younger than herself—”she makes those girls want to see heroes”

“and will that hurt them”

“certainly how can you ask they will find none and so they will never be married”

“get married” is the usual phrase and the one that correctly indicates the thought but the speakers on this occasion were persons too outwardly refined to use it they were ashamed of the word but not of the thing madame necker however sees good possible in celibacy

indeed i know not how the subject could be better illustrated than by separating the wheat from the chaff in madame neckers book place them in two heaps and then summon the reader to choose giving him first a nearsighted glass to examine the two—it might be a christian an astronomical or an artistic glass—any kind of good glass to obviate acquired defects in the eye i would lay any wager on the result

but time permits not here a prolonged analysis i have given the clues for faultfinding

as a specimen of the good take the following passage on the phenomena of what i have spoken of as the lyrical or electric element in woman

“women have been seen to show themselves poets in the most pathetic pantomimic scenes where all the passions were depicted full of beauty and these poets used a language unknown to themselves and the performance once over their inspiration was a forgotten dream without doubt there is an interior development to beings so gifted but their sole mode of communication with us is their talent they are ill all besides the inhabitants of another planet”

similar observations have been made by those who have seen the women at irish wakes or the funeral ceremonies of modern greece or brittany at times when excitement gave the impulse to genius but apparently without a thought that these rare powers belonged to no other planet but were a high development of the growth of this and might by wise and reverent treatment be made to inform and embellish the scenes of every day but when woman has her fair chance she will do so and the poem of the hour will vie with that of the ages

i come now with satisfaction to my own country and to a writer a female writer whom i have selected as the clearest wisest and kindliest who has as yet used pen here on these subjects this is miss sedgwick

miss sedgwick though she inclines to the private path and wishes that by the cultivation of character might should vindicate right sets limits nowhere and her objects and inducements are pure they are the free and careful cultivation of the powers that have been given with an aim at moral and intellectual perfection her speech is moderate and sane but never palsied by fear or sceptical caution

herself a fine example of the independent and beneficent existence that intellect and character can give to woman no less than man if she know how to seek and prize it—also that the intellect need not absorb or weaken but rather will refine and invigorate the affections—the teachings of her practical good sense come with great force and cannot fail to avail much every way her writings please me both as to the means and the ends i am pleased at the stress she lays on observance of the physical laws because the true reason is given only in a strong and clean body can the soul do its message fitly

she shows the meaning of the respect paid to personal neatness both in the indispensable form of cleanliness and of that love of order and arrangement that must issue from a true harmony of feeling

the praises of cold water seem to me an excellent sign in the age they denote a tendency to the true life we are now to have as a remedy for ills not orvietan or opium or any quack medicine but plenty of air and water with due attention to warmth and freedom in dress and simplicity of diet

every day we observe signs that the natural feelings on these subjects are about to be reïnstated and the body to claim care as the abode and organ of the soul not as the tool of servile labor or the object of voluptuous indulgence

a poor woman who had passed through the lowest grades of ignominy seemed to think she had never been wholly lost “for” said she “i would always have good underclothes” and indeed who could doubt that this denoted the remains of private selfrespect in the mind

a woman of excellent sense said “it might seem childish but to her one of the most favorable signs of the times was that the ladies had been persuaded to give up corsets”

yes let us give up all artificial means of distortion let life be healthy pure all of a piece miss sedgwick in teaching that domestics must have the means of bathing us much as their mistresses and time too to bathe has symbolized one of the most important of human rights

another interesting sign of the time is the influence exercised by two women miss martineau and miss barrett from their sickrooms the lamp of life which if it had been fed only by the affections depended on precarious human relations would scarce have been able to maintain a feeble glare in the lonely prison now shines far and wide over the nations cheering fellowsufferers and hallowing the joy of the healthful

these persons need not health or youth or the charms of personal presence to make their thoughts available a few more such and “old woman” footnote an apposite passage is quoted in appendix f shall not be the synonyme for imbecility nor “old maid” a term of contempt nor woman be spoken of as a reed shaken by the wind

it is time indeed that men and women both should cease to grow old in any other way than as the tree does full of grace and honor the hair of the artist turns white but his eye shines clearer than ever and we feel that age brings him maturity not decay so would it be with all were the springs of immortal refreshment but unsealed within the soul then like these women they would see from the lonely chamber window the glories of the universe or shut in darkness be visited by angels

i now touch on my own place and day and as i write events are occurring that threaten the fair fabric approached by so long an avenue week before last the gentile was requested to aid the jew to return to palestine for the millennium the reign of the son of mary was near just now at high and solemn mass thanks were returned to the virgin for having delivered oconnell from unjust imprisonment in requital of his having consecrated to her the league formed in behalf of liberty on taras hill but last week brought news which threatens that a cause identical with the enfranchisement of jews irish women ay and of americans in general too is in danger for the choice of the people threatens to rivet the chains of slavery and the leprosy of sin permanently on this nation through the annexation of texas

ah if this should take place who will dare again to feel the throb of heavenly hope as to the destiny of this country the noble thought that gave unity to all our knowledge harmony to all our designs—the thought that the progress of history had brought on the era the tissue of prophecies pointed out the spot where humanity was at last to have a fair chance to know itself and all men be born free and equal for the eagles flight—flutters as if about to leave the breast which deprived of it will have no more a nation no more a home on earth

women of my country—exaltadas if such there be—women of english old english nobleness who understand the courage of boadicea the sacrifice of godiva the power of queen emma to tread the redhot iron unharmed—women who share the nature of mrs hutchinson lady russell and the mothers of our own revolution—have you nothing to do with this you see the men how they are willing to sell shamelessly the happiness of countless generations of fellowcreatures the honor of their country and their immortal souls for a money market and political power do you not feel within you that which can reprove them which can check which can convince them you would not speak in vain whether each in her own home or banded in unison

tell these men that you will not accept the glittering baubles spacious dwellings and plentiful service they mean to offer you through those means tell them that the heart of woman demands nobleness and honor in man and that if they have not purity have not mercy they are no longer fathers lovers husbands sons of yours

this cause is your own for as i have before said there is a reason why the foes of african slavery seek more freedom for women but put it not upon that ground but on the ground of right

if you have a power it is a moral power the films of interest are not so close around you as around the men if you will but think you cannot fail to wish to save the country from this disgrace let not slip the occasion but do something to lift off the curse incurred by eve

you have heard the women engaged in the abolition movement accused of boldness because they lifted the voice in public and lifted the latch of the stranger but were these acts whether performed judiciously or no so bold as to dare before god and man to partake the fruits of such offence as this

you hear much of the modesty of your sex preserve it by filling the mind with noble desires that shall ward off the corruptions of vanity and idleness a profligate woman who left her accustomed haunts and took service in a new york boardinghouse said “she had never heard talk so vile at the five points as from the ladies at the boardinghouse” and why because they were idle because having nothing worthy to engage them they dwelt with unnatural curiosity on the ill they dared not go to see

it will not so much injure your modesty to have your name by the unthinking coupled with idle blame as to have upon your soul the weight of not trying to save a whole race of women from the scorn that is put upon their modesty

think of this well i entreat i conjure you before it is too late it is my belief that something effectual might be done by women if they would only consider the subject and enter upon it in the true spirit—a spirit gentle but firm and which feared the offence of none save one who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity

and now i have designated in outline if not in fulness the stream which is ever flowing from the heights of my thought

in the earlier tract i was told i did not make my meaning sufficiently clear in this i have consequently tried to illustrate it in various ways and may have been guilty of much repetition yet as i am anxious to leave no room for doubt i shall venture to retrace once more the scope of my design in points as wad done in oldfashioned sermons

man is a being of twofold relations to nature beneath and intelligences above him the earth is his school if not his birthplace god his object life and thought his means of interpreting nature and aspiring to god

only a fraction of this purpose is accomplished in the life of any one man its entire accomplishment is to be hoped only from the sum of the lives of men or man considered as a whole

as this whole has one soul and one body any injury or obstruction to a part or to the meanest member affects the whole man can never be perfectly happy or virtuous till all men are so

to address man wisely you must not forget that his life is partly animal subject to the same laws with nature

but you cannot address him wisely unless you consider him still more as soul and appreciate the conditions and destiny of soul

        the growth of man is twofold masculine and feminine

        so far as these two methods can be distinguished they are so as

        energy and harmony

        power and beauty

        intellect and love

or by some such rude classification for we have not language primitive and pure enough to express such ideas with precision

these two sides are supposed to be expressed in man and woman that is as the more and the less for the faculties have not been given pure to either but only in preponderance there are also exceptions in great number such as men of far more beauty than power and the reverse but as a general rule it seems to have been the intention to give a preponderance on the one side that is called masculine and on the other one that is called feminine

there cannot be a doubt that if these two developments were in perfect harmony they would correspond to and fulfil one another like hemispheres or the tenor and bass in music

but there is no perfect harmony in human nature and the two parts answer one another only now and then or if there be a persistent consonance it can only be traced at long intervals instead of discoursing an obvious melody

what is the cause of this

man in the order of time was developed first as energy comes before harmony power before beauty

woman was therefore under his care as an elder he might have been her guardian and teacher

but as human nature goes not straight forward but by excessive action and then reaction in an undulated course he misunderstood and abused his advantages and became her temporal master instead of her spiritual sire

on himself came the punishment he educated woman more as a servant than a daughter and found himself a king without a queen

the children of this unequal union showed unequal natures and more and more men seemed sons of the handmaid rather than princess

at last there were so many ishmaelites that the rest grew frightened and indignant they laid the blame on hagar and drove her forth into the wilderness

but there were none the fewer ishmaelites for that

at last men became a little wiser and saw that the infant moses was in every case saved by the pure instincts of womans breast for as too much adversity is better for the moral nature than too much prosperity woman in this respect dwindled less than man though in other respects still a child in leadingstrings

so man did her more and more justice and grew more and more kind

but yet—his habits and his will corrupted by the past—he did not clearly see that woman was half himself that her interests were identical with his and that by the law of their common being he could never reach his true proportions while she remained in any wise shorn of hers

and so it has gone on to our day both ideas developing but more slowly than they would under a clearer recognition of truth and justice which would have permitted the sexes their due influence on one another and mutual improvement from more dignified relations

wherever there was pure love the natural influences were for the time restored

wherever the poet or artist gave free course to his genius he saw the truth and expressed it in worthy forms for these men especially share and need the feminine principle the divine birds need to be brooded into life and song by mothers

wherever religion i mean the thirst for truth and good not the love of sect and dogma had its course the original design was apprehended in its simplicity and the dove presaged sweetly from dodonas oak

i have aimed to show that no age was left entirely without a witness of the equality of the sexes in function duty and hope

also that when there was unwillingness or ignorance which prevented this being acted upon women had not the less power for their want of light and noble freedom but it was power which hurt alike them and those against whom they made use of the arms of the servile—cunning blandishment and unreasonable emotion

that now the time has come when a clearer vision and better action are possible—when man and woman may regard one another as brother and sister the pillars of one porch the priests of one worship

i have believed and intimated that this hope would receive an ampler fruition than ever before in our own land

and it will do so if this land carry out the principles from which sprang our national life

i believe that at present women are the best helpers of one another

let them think let them act till they know what they need

we only ask of men to remove arbitrary barriers some would like to do more but i believe it needs that woman show herself in her native dignity to teach them how to aid her their minds are so encumbered by tradition

when lord edward fitzgerald travelled with the indians his manly heart obliged him at once to take the packs from the squaws and carry them but we do not read that the red men followed his example though they are ready enough to carry the pack of the white woman because she seems to them a superior being

let woman appear in the mild majesty of ceres and rudest churls will be willing to learn from her

you ask what use will she make of liberty when she has so long been sustained and restrained

i answer in the first place this will not be suddenly given i read yesterday a debate of this year on the subject of enlarging womens rights over property it was a leaf from the classbook that is preparing for the needed instruction the men learned visibly as they spoke the champions of woman saw the fallacy of arguments on the opposite side and were startled by their own convictions with their wives at home and the readers of the paper it was the same and so the stream flows on thought urging action and action leading to the evolution of still better thought

but were this freedom to come suddenly i have no fear of the consequences individuals might commit excesses but there is not only in the sex a reverence for decorums and limits inherited and enhanced from generation to generation which many years of other life could not efface but a native love in woman as woman of proportion of “the simple art of not too much”—a greek moderation which would create immediately a restraining party the natural legislators and instructors of the rest and would gradually establish such rules as are needed to guard without impeding life

the graces would lead the choral dance and teach the rest to regulate their steps to the measure of beauty

but if you ask me what offices they may fill i reply—any i do not care what case you put let them be seacaptains if you will i do not doubt there are women well fitted for such an office and if so i should be as glad to see them in it as to welcome the maid of saragossa or the maid of missolonghi or the suliote heroine or emily plater

i think women need especially at this juncture a much greater range of occupation than they have to rouse their latent powers a party of travellers lately visited a lonely hut on a mountain there they found an old woman who told them she and her husband had lived there forty years “why” they said “did you choose so barren a spot” she “did not know it was the mans notion”

and during forty years she had been content to act without knowing why upon “the mans notion” i would not have it so

in families that i know some little girls like to saw wood others to use carpenters tools where these tastes are indulged cheerfulness and goodhumor are promoted where they are forbidden because “such things are not proper for girls” they grow sullen and mischievous

fourier had observed these wants of women as no one can fail to do who watches the desires of little girls or knows the ennui that haunts grown women except where they make to themselves a serene little world by art of some kind he therefore in proposing a great variety of employments in manufactures or the care of plants and animals allows for one third of women as likely to have a taste for masculine pursuits one third of men for feminine

who does not observe the immediate glow and serenity that is diffused over the life of women before restless or fretful by engaging in gardening building or the lowest department of art here is something that is not routine something that draws forth life towards the infinite

i have no doubt however that a large proportion of women would give themselves to the same employments as now because there are circumstances that must lead them mothers will delight to make the nest soft and warm nature would take care of that no need to clip the wings of any bird that wants to soar and sing or finds in itself the strength of pinion for a migratory flight unusual to its kind the difference would be that all need not be constrained to employments for which some are unfit

i have urged upon the sex selfsubsistence in its two forms of selfreliance and selfimpulse because i believe them to be the needed means of the present juncture

i have urged on woman independence of man not that i do not think the sexes mutually needed by one another but because in woman this fact has led to an excessive devotion which has cooled love degraded marriage and prevented either sex from being what it should be to itself or the other

i wish woman to live first for gods sake then she will not make an imperfect man her god and thus sink to idolatry then she will not take what is not fit for her from a sense of weakness and poverty then if she finds what she needs in man embodied she will know how to love and be worthy of being loved

by being more a soul she will not be less woman for nature is perfected through spirit

now there is no woman only an overgrown child

that her hand may be given with dignity she must be able to stand alone i wish to see men and women capable of such relations as are depicted by landor in his pericles and aspasia where grace is the natural garb of strength and the affections are calm because deep the softness is that of a firm tissue as when

         “the gods approve
        the depth but not the tumult of the soul
        a fervent not ungovernable love”

a profound thinker has said “no married woman can represent the female world for she belongs to her husband the idea of woman must be represented by a virgin”

but that is the very fault of marriage and of the present relation between the sexes that the woman does belong to the man instead of forming a whole with him were it otherwise there would be no such limitation to the thought

woman selfcentred would never be absorbed by any relation it would be only an experience to her as to man it is a vulgar error that love a love to woman is her whole existence she also is born for truth and love in their universal energy would she but assume her inheritance mary would not be the only virgin mother not manzoni alone would celebrate in his wife the virgin mind with the maternal wisdom and conjugal affections the soul is ever young ever virgin

and will not she soon appear—the woman who shall vindicate their birthright for all women who shall teach them what to claim and how to use what they obtain shall not her name be for her era victoria for her country and life virginia yet predictions are rash she herself must teach us to give her the fitting name

an idea not unknown to ancient times has of late been revived that in the metamorphoses of life the soul assumes the form first of man then of woman and takes the chances and reaps the benefits of either lot why then say some lay such emphasis on the rights or needs of woman what she wins not as woman will come to her as man

that makes no difference it is not woman but the law of right the law of growth that speaks in us and demands the perfection of each being in its kind—apple as apple woman as woman without adopting your theory i know that i a daughter live through the life of man but what concerns me now is that my life be a beautiful powerful in a word a complete life in its kind had i but one more moment to live i must wish the same

suppose at the end of your cycle your great worldyear all will be completed whether i exert myself or not and the supposition is false—but suppose it true am i to be indifferent about it not so i must beat my own pulse true in the heart of the world for that is virtue excellence health

thou lord of day didst leave us tonight so calmly glorious not dismayed that cold winter is coming not postponing thy beneficence to the fruitful summer thou didst smile on thy days work when it was done and adorn thy downgoing as thy uprising for thou art loyal and it is thy nature to give life if thou canst and shine at all events

i stand in the sunny noon of life objects no longer glitter in the dews of morning neither are yet softened by the shadows of evening every spot is seen every chasm revealed climbing the dusty hill some fair effigies that once stood for symbols of human destiny have been broken those i still have with me show defects in this broad light yet enough is left even by experience to point distinctly to the glories of that destiny faint but not to be mistaken streaks of the future day i can say with the bard

“though many have suffered shipwreck still beat noble hearts”
always the soul says to us all cherish your best hopes as a faith and abide by them in action such shall be the effectual fervent means to their fulfilment

        for the power to whom we bow
        has given its pledge that if not now
        they of pure and steadfast mind
        by faith exalted truth refined
        shall hear all music loud and clear
        whose first notes they ventured here
        then fear not thou to wind the horn
        though elf and gnome thy courage scorn
        ask for the castles king and queen
        though rabble rout may rush between
        beat thee senseless to the ground
        in the dark beset thee round
        persist to ask and it will come
        seek not for rest in humbler home
        so shalt thou see what few have seen
        the palace home of king and queen
