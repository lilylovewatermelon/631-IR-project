im done wondering where youve been
all night long when youre out with your friends
all you say that the matters over
but now that chapters over
im done trusting you its ended
even after i catch you redhanded
you couldve been my only one
but now your chance is gone

chorus
you shouldve
when you couldve
youre going to miss my love girl
you should it wouldve been so good
you shouldve
when i wouldve
now i know ive had enough
better luck next time girl
you should it wouldve been so good

verse 2
im done chasing you all over
may as well be chasing after thunder
play hard to get if it makes you happy
for a change now you can start chasing me
dont cry cause i aint your sure thing
it aint my fault you dont know a good thing
you couldve been my only one
but now your chance is gone

youre going to miss my love girl
you should it wouldve been so good
you shouldve
when i wouldve
now i know ive had enough

bridge
don’t you understand
don’t wanna be your backup plan
now i won’t be here to clean up when it hits the fan
you tried to keep me on your leash
it’s time you started chasing me

breakdown
i’m done acting like i won’t be
sitting here still wishing you wanted me
don’t say that i never told you
take some advice from somebody who knows

chorus
you shouldve
when you couldve
youre going to miss my love girl
you should it wouldve been so good
you shouldve
when i wouldve
now i know ive had enough
better luck next time girl
you should it wouldve been so good
you shouldve
when you couldve
youre going to miss my love girl
