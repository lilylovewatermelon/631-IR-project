the hole in the wall
now you got me by my heartstrings
and youre pulling me around with them all

youre not lost
your thoughts are just undercover
how can you love one drug and hate all the others
when you get so high get so high
its hard to look back down
and you cant hear a sound

whatâ€™s pain but a couple of fools
up in orbit drunken on the moment
when the fog starts rolling in patience grows thin
back to where it all began

youre not lost
your thoughts are just undercover
how can you love one drug and hate all the others
when you get so high get so high
its hard to look back down
and you cant hear a sound

youre not lost
your thoughts are just undercover
how can you love one drug and hate all the others
when you get so high get so high
its hard to look back down
and you cant hear a soundsee wild rivers liveget tickets as low as 103you might also likeembed"
