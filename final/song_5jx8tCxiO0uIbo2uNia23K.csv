summer after high school when we first met
wed make out in your mustang to radiohead
and on my eighteenth birthday we got matching tattoos
used to steal your parents liquor and climb to the roof
talked about our future like we had a clue
never planned that one day
id be losing you

chorus
in another life i would be your girl
wed keep all our promises be us against the world
in another life i would make you stay
so i dont have to say you were the one that got away
the one that got away

verse 2
i was june and you were my johnny cash
never one without the other we made a pact
sometimes when i miss you
i put those records on whoa oh
someone said you had your tattoo removed
saw you downtown singing the blues
its time to face the music
im no longer your muse
you might also likechorus
in another life i would be your girl
wed keep all our promises be us against the world
in another life i would make you stay
so i dont have to say you were the one that got away
the one that got away

postchorus
the one the one the one the one
the one the one the one the one the one

bridge
all this money cant buy me a time machine no
cant replace you with a million rings no
i should have told you what you meant to me whoa whoa oh
cause now i pay the price

chorus
in another life i would be your girl
wed keep all our promises be us against the world
in another life i would make you stay
so i dont have to say you were the one that got away
the one that got away whoa
the one

outro
in another life i would make you stay
so i dont have to say you were the one that got away
the one that got away1embed"
