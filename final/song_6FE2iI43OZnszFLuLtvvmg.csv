verse 1 tony oller
ooh girl youre shining like a 5th avenue diamond
and they dont make you like they used to
youre never going out of style
ooh pretty baby this world might have gone crazy
the way you saved me who could blame me
when i just wanna make you smile

prechorus tony oller
i wanna thrill you like michael
i wanna kiss you like prince
lets get it on like marvin gaye like hathaway

thinking i was born in the wrong time
one of a kind living in a world gone plastic
