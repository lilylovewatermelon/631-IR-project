well i took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind
i left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time
but i watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
i feel theres nothing i can do yeah

verse 2
i watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
after all i knew it had to be something to do with you
i really dont mind what happens now and then
as long as youll be my friend at the end

chorus
if i go crazy then will you still call me superman
if im alive and well will you be there a holding my hand
ill keep you by my side with my superhuman might

verse 3
you called me strong you called me weak
but still your secrets i will keep
you took for granted all the times i never let you down
you stumbled in and bumped your head
if not for me then youd be dead
i picked you up and put you back on solid ground
