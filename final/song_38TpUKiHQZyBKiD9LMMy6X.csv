verse 1
beautiful stranger sitting right there
looked up at me and my dark curly hair
looked back for a second didnt want to be rude
i tend to fall in love on the tube
mm

verse 2
beautiful stranger sitting right there
reading the newspaper stuck to his chair
i swore that he smiled and i felt my heart drop
heard the doors open came to my stop
mm

chorus
what if i hadnt left the train
at ladbroke grove would i know his name
maybe we would have exchanged a few words
a fairytalе moment could have occurred
but my bеautiful stranger will have to remain
a stranger until i see him again
see him again
mmmm

beautiful stranger catching my stare
its fate we collided right then back there
i wonder if he felt the same thing too
innocent crush on the morning commute
mm

chorus
what if i wouldve stayed on the train
dared to stand up and ask for his name
maybe we would have exchanged a few words
a fairytale moment could have occurred
but my beautiful stranger will have to remain
a stranger until i see him again
see him again
mmmm

outro
my beautiful stranger will have to remain
a love that came and left with this train
my beautiful strangerembed"
