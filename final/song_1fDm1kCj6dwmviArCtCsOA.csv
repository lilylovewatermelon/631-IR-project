this song is dedicated to all the lovers who cant be together
separated by distance and time

verse 1
you are always on my mind
all i do is count the days
where are you now
i know ill never let you down
i will never go away

prechorus
i really wish that you would stay
but what would we do
all the days that youve been gone
i dream about you
and i anticipate the day
that you will come home home home

chorus
no matter how far you are
no matter how long it takes him
through distance and time
ill be waiting
and if you have to walk a million miles
ill wait a million days to see you smile
distance and time ill be waiting mmhmm
distance and time ill be waiting
