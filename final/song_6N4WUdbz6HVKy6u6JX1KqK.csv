passin around your blood and your body
no conversation to ease up your mind
and nobody seems to see the outside of it
preoccupied and nobodys hiding it

chorus
preoccupied nobodys hiding it
preoccupied nobodys hiding it

verse 2
opened your mind filled it with bullshit
locked up your heart without even knowing it
it must be a sign the days that were living in
preoccupied and nobodys hiding it

chorus
preoccupied and nobodys hiding it
preoccupied nobodys hiding it
preoccupied yeah and nobodys hiding it
