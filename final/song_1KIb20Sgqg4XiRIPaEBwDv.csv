shed be shed be on the sun
love could always may come and go
do you wanna say oh
guys do not wanna say
anything in front of me
love do you wanna say oh
guys do not wanna say
everything i wanna say
i dont wanna say i dont wanna say
shed be shed be on the sun
love could always may come and go
to the night oh

refrain
i’ve been hard to run up in the snow
you’ve been lied to anywhere to go

they sing in the dark
theyre talking to me
and sing in the night
enlighten the phase
they sing in the dark
theyre talking to me
and sing in the night
enlighten the phase
they sing in the dark
theyre talking to me
and sing in the night
enlighten the phase

and i will say it’s fair
so it’s underwater
and you got her
you would never let her go
