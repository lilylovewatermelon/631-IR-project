verse 1 isaiah rashad
my shit go good with your mouth dont it feel good
its a number 3 buckle up
got to the scene it was bonafide pocket book
and cause you hide all my secrets from that bitch
they keep callin your phone i know he hate it
but the comet go
keep us in tune and my hooker got another show
im on the road just to see if i can make it back
with just a scar and a carcass and a flaw
like god and his kids
i know you hate us but its nothin else
they told me that i had to see it for my fuckin self
and if i make to the gates and he dont recognize
that i had all them traits of greatness and the starlight at my feet
so dont you take me to the preacher

verse 2 isaiah rashad
and i aint done with your mouth
say that its good as a number 3
want some more you got away with the tongueincheek
never seen i know the code to your body
and the road to division is all communication
and we bust a nut
i left a stain in your innard dont you let it grow
i know the words to your favorite and your everything
but i dont tithe for you baby
i am all for the profit im past my selfdestruction
but you bring it back
i got a line for you waitin in my cadillac
cause you describe all the symptoms of a common fiend
you said you read to the fire
it was good with the preacher and all the congregation
would you testify
