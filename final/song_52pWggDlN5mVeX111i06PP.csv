one thing left to try see if you can make it
before you choose the night and the silence overtakes you
if you looked into the fire and you had that conversation
then theres one thing left to try if you want to save your life

refrain 1
fear is his name but his friends still call him god
again and again the thought remains

interlude
the only way to get rid of the feeling

verse 2
i dont wanna die wishing id done something
more than whats required to last until the sunset
no i dont wanna die thinking that im dreaming
theres one thing left to try if you want to change your life

refrain 2
today i left those thoughts behind behind
over and over you die just to feel alive

bridge
the only way to get rid of the feeling you have to draw the line
and remember theres more than youre seeing decide
do you want to keep us alive
do you want to feel alive
do you want to keep us alive
do you want to feel alive
fun is over tonight do you want to keep us alive
fun is over tonight do you want to feel alive
fun is over tonight do you want to keep us alive
fun is over tonight do you want to feel alive
