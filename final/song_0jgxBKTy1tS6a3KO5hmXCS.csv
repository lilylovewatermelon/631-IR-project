chorus ceelo green
just keep going and don’t look back
and look forward from where youre at

wave hello hello hello…
push that pedal to the max
count that money that’s in your lap
there’s some jealousy in your rearview
hello hello hello…

verse 1 ti
mashing in the fast lane envy in my rearview
mils in my windshield keep ‘em in a clear view
cheers to my partners who got it we finally did it
and here’s to the ones with potential to go and get it
we survived yesterday foreign ride connoisseurs
popping fly today tomorrow ain’t promised to us
grind hard for dirty money but our heart’s pure
steady mobbing on these suckers man they’re so funny to us
broke niggas all smiles when they run into us
get by theyself they talking tough but don’t do nothing to us
call themselves paper chasing when wealth be running to us
you violate the puppet master get your string pulled
hustle gang king team label me the ring leader
just showing haters the tail lights of my twoseaters
two heaters with me in the ride but i don’t need ‘em though
left evil behind me that’s where i plan to keep it go
see ti liveget tickets as low as 97you might also likechorus ceelo green

and look forward from where youre at
there’s some jealousy in your rearview
wave hello hello hello

verse 2 ti
i hustle hard forever shine pay haters no never mind
won’t stop until we popping bottles at the finish line
never been the quitting kind spirit ain’t no killing mine
i’m getting mine you don’t like it nigga get in line
so many times i’ve shown dudes i won’t lose
time’s precious but waste yours if you want to
hey i made it and you didn’t for that i ain’t to blame
won’t change a thing the circumstance’ll remain the same
can’t complain i’m highly favored my flavor’s god given
so used to hate appreciation is a odd feeling
still i stay focused on the millions trying to dodge prison
praying asking for forgiveness hoping god listen
as far as dissing me pimping go ahead and have a ball
meanwhile i’m getting’ bread determined to have it all
i’m talking money sonny if ain’t none of that involved
why is we conversing this vehicle ain’t reversing go
chorus ceelo green
just keep going and don’t look back
and look forward from where youre at
there’s some jealousy in your rearview
wave hello hello hello…
push that pedal to the max
count that money that’s in your lap
there’s some jealousy in your rearview
