i said my last battle was versus kshine
now a lot of people might have thought that he got it easy
i just feel like if that nigga won he had to use a prop to beat me
but now im back on my shit with a vengeance straight melting niggas
and since i think we friends
imma use this whole first round being helpful nigga
so before i start some shit and tell yall all how i spark my fif
let me guess you gon say that my fathers charlie clips
well let me help you cause we more like brothers
cause if its beef and he squeezing the nine
usually bullets in the clip leave the dna at the scene of the crime
but he might be your father cause when you letting bullets out the fif
what good is your arsenal if your weapons are without the clips
so whats next you gon spit about
you gon tell em that i got a denture and this tooth can come in and out
well let me help you
since i got my tooth back these fans been in love with it now
so these caps will have you riding off if you try to come for the crown
one punch will leave him knocked out if he fought his well
so once i give ya mouth pain they gon have to put me in prison or a jail
now i came here for straight business i aint come to waste time
what else he gon say how i rhymed on beat vers kshine
well let me help you if its beef its no need to squirt pounds
if we fighting youll be the first down
cuz these punches will leave you beat on stage like my third round
since you predictable ars i gotta tell em what you gon do first
you know he gon tell the crowd how i threw up versus sensa and tsu surf
well let me help you i guess you dont vomit cause you the shit
oh i forgot you cant throw up blood cuz you a crip
now everybody in the building gonna say its looking awfully bad
but he cant go to battle without saying my moms disabled and how i lost my dad
well she gave me this ability thats why i do shit so well
so if shes retarded it might explain why i spit so well
and my pops shouldnt have died it was you that deserved that box
and even if you had his ashes you couldnt earn his spot
thats the big difference between you and me
what else you gonna say that in this battle you got more views than me
well let me help you
cause see outta all them battles you had what have you made from it
besides the ones you had from uw what have you got paid from it
so talking all that big view shit is not cool
the leagues benefit from the views not you
so now we can ask em bar for bar theres no way that he seeing me
what else he gonna tell this crowd that hes more street than me
see that gangsta image been getting you by son
cuz you dont work with tools
we know you not about it brother
cuz ya kin ken put in more work than you
if you was dhalsim you wouldnt keep fire
that last scheme showed yall all he not a street fighter
now the way i spit the script of the first round i swear to god its biblical
three things are gonna happen
1 you gon mention what i say show us you lyrical
2 you switch your rounds around so you dont look unoriginal
or 3 you mix one of them topics up so you dont look predictable
round 1 its getting hot in here
but you know my slogan get em the fuck out of here
no get ored the fuck out of here
get surf suge and get them dreads the fuck out of here
get those predictable raps the fuck out of here
but i aint like arsonal anyway thats why i got that hat the fuck out of here
you might also likeround 1 arsonal
is this the ars that you desire
the one that like to keep his dreads nappy
i heard you and con went back to surf
and told him some lies that i supposedly had said
actually i knew you was a snitch but a liar to and ya head nappy
funny thing is if it aint no other evidence for a case
dna always seem to keep the feds happy
see i was gonna take the pop route dna
i was gon’ revive em’ from the dead scrappy
but since clips and you supposed to be my man
i promise you in this battle i aint gon’ mention shit about yo’ dead daddy
now yo’ dead daddy pcp is what that nigga was smoking
i just lied to yo’ motherfucking face cause promises were meant to be broken
me surf and shotgun remember we locin
ya mom crip too
that bitch been crippled since moses put a slit in the ocean
with a sixshooter i clap five
i got a ruger thats shaqs size
i sell weed right now i got a seven and five eights
im tryin to hustle that arsonal hat size
nigga you aint been the same dna since yo dad died
i bet now you wish you couldve saved his lifeon a flashdrive
ya mommy and sister at the dinner table they mourning him
they loving em you go in there to comfort him
you kissing ‘em you huggin em
i bust through the door and yell hooooooo
with nothing but boots and drawers on to give em long wood i hacksaw jim duggan em
nigga thats how you control the fucking crowd
i cut the lights off the fuse box foes im unplugging em
give em shots with no chaser kick the bar stool from under em
i treat em like prisoners no names i just number em
clap blocks give em both back shots from right in front of him
now you lil’ niggas kill me
thinking youre farrakhan with all these righteous thoughts
nigga you might get caught cause you gotta strike a match before you light this torch
but when i see that spark imma knock oxygen out yo windpipe
then fly you right to newark and show yall how to deconstruct dna without taking a nigga off of life support
when you battled tsunami the choices was either a or b
you either drown or surf
you a rolling stone nigga we both battled all over
but you still havent found yo turf
see i dig a fortyfoot hole hopefully drown ya hearse
and put you in that ground
and tell everybody his personalitys down to earth
now sensa made it clear
you contradict yourself when it come to the gun lines
a wise man named shorty horroh once told me
this dont flop and we dont talk about guns here sunshine
this supposed to be metaphors creativity rhyme schemes punchlines
you in a triple threat you cant eat so get the fuck outta my lunchline
aye clips he cant be the freestyle champion sometimes
battling mainstream artists like me when he unsigned
stick to battle rappers around ya age alright
you probably wouldve turnt to a vampire versus daylyt daylight
‘cuz it was hard for you to son shine sunshine
now professor shine forgot to say
dna consists of hydrogen oxygen nitrogen carbon and phosphorus
see i doctored this im a college grad no masters nor doctrine
but i got a fouryear bachelor in communication
yall know damn well i fathered this
todays the end of your world as we see it
dna is all over this the apocalypse
that was my purpose on earth eric i was born to finish you
show up to ya funeral just to mourn remember you
ya daddy aint die he never existed
charlie cut yo’ umbilical cord and on your birth certificate he forged the signature
im just telling you the true facts
that that bitch who pushed you out her pussy was afraid to do
eurgh when we signed this contract in december
you had four months for this battle
and this what you get on stage and do
you out here begging niggas like meek for battles
and begging these labels to come label you
well my middle finger to the mainstream im a battle rapper
fuck all of the labels too
i do this for dont flop the industry my enemy
i aint the type to soulsell nigga
they put a million in ars face and im like oh well nigga
i put loyalty over everything so go tell niggas
you want ars’ you gotta pay for me and uw
this package come in wholesale nigga
my shit is real my shit is raw my shit is authentic
you cant spell bars without putting that ars in it
fuck outta here nigga
round 2 dna
i had a nigga do a break down on arsonal and he said he a legend
i said based off what
he said his views his resume and after checking the records
i told that nigga you deaf dumb blind stupid or very dyslexic
‘cuz last time i broke down arsenal it was a collection of weapons
so you mean to tell me
you started off loaded with some of ya best rhymes
ran outta bullets and used that hollow to reload that tech 9
you was riding shottys with shotguns from a while ago
and use charlies clips to reload that chrome crome in calicoe
that means you been getting helped all ya career they put arsonal on
‘cuz you got ya ammunition from those weapons to make ya arsonal
strong
now after doing that i got no respect ‘cuz thats damn near pitiful
but besides clips ill be honest theres only one nigga that got rid of you
see at first i was confused then i came up with a big plan
i say you know that calicoe and tech was spitting
both of them shits jammed
that hollow got cheated that crome had no bullets that was something he could withstand
charlie gave him every clip had him looking like quick sand
but beasley from url came up with a quick plan
they realized the only way you can kill an arsonal is if you hire a hitman
and speaking of hitman you said that squidwards clarinet bar
that was mad wack
but you can have that that aint even what im mad at
its the fact you wasnt creative with those cartoon bars
that shit was trash
i wouldve said i put more holes in em than spongebob
when i rip the mag
and since he crip i bet when i shoot i wont miss the crab mr krab g and off them last words i bet you can learn from that but new york niggas been killin’ jersey niggas
yall done got built off smack
we emerged you all con even showed us that surf is wack
so you like oj simpson getting put behind bars
to try and get his jersey back
but you from newark right
so ill be here to fight ‘cuz we dont like cowards
and behind the foul line ill be shooting the bricks like dwight howard
so its nothing like kevin durant to come to his block with wild thunder
and even if you get the beam and try to mark us all
youll get a pow brother
and yall might think thats hot
when yall realize mark gasol is paus brother
now lets talk about weapons ‘cuz ya’ shotgun got suge in it
so we know you aint poppin shit
i bet this man chest will manchester drop once my shotty spit
which means ill catch a mean body
when i get his team homi when that lead is drawn
and show yall i dont need swave sevah to get the rebel off
now ray swag you my nigga but when i let that tech spray
a you cats can catscan get ya bones shown when i x ray 41k and this nigga name is d from the w
i just said that so these fans can get this
you and arsonal doing good in uw ill be honest yall doing some big shit
but this nigga keep claiming that he tough and he this big crip
so whys this the closest you came to the d since trick trick
now that shit is ill that shit is real that shit is authentic
i like when he told charlie clips
you cant spell bars without putting the ars in it
its just one problem in my rounds i been had bars in it
nigga while you was on earth i was on mars with it
copping my fans thru blood sweat and tears
in these battles i went to wars with it
over the years i opened some ears made a few stars in it
them last words i used all ended with ars in it
round 2 arsonal
you begged to have a battle against arsonal da rebel
but i told you you cant spell bars without putting that ‘ars in it
so second round you gon’ get barsonal the devil
im on fire i sound like a pot thats talking to the kettle
but when the flame rises i aim nines so now you talking to the metal
listen to the word play a wise man once tweeted they love to hate on ars
i said you aint never lie either they petrified or they know im the best
but the facts left set aside you get two options
i could get the clicking and cocking and then that weapon rise
or i could treat you like a 3rd base coach nigga and let him slide
nah never mind
im here to snatch every bit of confidence from yo’ conscience
since you trying to convince the world yo’ accomplishments
im yo consequence
use common sense i came to embarrass not give you compliments
let this glock be ya muscle relaxer you feeling kind of tense
im a paid nigga you a slave nigga still trapped behind the fence
you played nigga
‘cuz what you got paid equals my dollars spent on red bottoms
i swear to god they three times ya rent
i remove the furniture out yo’ mouth disabling you to rhyme again
now fuck rappin’ after yo’ next verse i dont wanna rhyme back
eurgh what’s up with contact lets go over the particulars in our contract
in a few bars yo’ real name and yo’ nickname
im a define that see where yo’ mind at
nigga yo’ death clock ticking wont get this time back
now dna is a molecule in following the genetic instructions used in the
development and functions of all known and living organisms correct
and you choose to name yourself that
im a have to put you in an er i see c
where the doctors cant help that
when ya mother named you
at this point she foresaw she mustve felt that
thats why i said im a have to put him in an eric
for the slow brains i know his names eric thats how you spell that
but dna dna that there is an unusual name
‘cuz now dna is officially a part of a beautiful game
since im a bus driver i know a pilot that fucks a flight attendant
thats related to the airport manager
that hires the niggas that be fueling his plane
now do you wanna live or die
you dont want yo’ oxygen mask to fall while you in the sky
you a living lie you a walking contradiction you barely just getting by
you got a few passport stamps you be on a plane but im a different fly
i pull out a sk why y so yo’ soul can sit in the sky
see i rewrite the script this rap will be vital shit with a tyson grip
ill dhalsim and have him attack yo’ ass with a bison kick
i told clips im in an e honda with the same schemes that he like to spit
thats ‘cuz any real street fighter know with common sense
what fights to pick
but look you barking up the wrong tree these niggas was gassing you up
you on e so before you throw up think about when you grow up
what you gon’ be
think deep about how good yo’ life was before me
now lets play a game amongst the same guidelines from saw 3
i said hold up sike you was souped up wasnt you
you thought i lost words ‘cuz i crossed words
it was that easy to puzzle you
dna and dan no other substitute
i just flipped them three letters as much as i can nigga i ruzzled you
first round i let you feel it was close meaning i hustled you
second round i bullied this pussy nigga i muscled you
third round get comfortable i killed this fiend fulfilled yo’ dream
put you in heaven so every rapper on earth gotta look up to you
and if heaven got a ghetto
nigga yo pops spirit a fiend still trying to cop rocks
but not rocks that you find on side blocks for playing hop scotch
sad shit right now he looking down sucking that glass dick
trying to high box
but like father like son yall two fiends both addicted to smack
thats why yo’ stock dropped
nigga you shouldve signed to dont flop or uw c’uz we dont cock block
i been the realist nigga in newark since a hole poked thru my high top
winter time below zero degrees im in the drop top
with daylyts ski mask and a stolen car from the chop shop
the witness saw a nigga with dreads called him a mop top
second witness shot in the head he got his top popped
third saw me shoot it from deep so i couldnt get my shot blocked
nigga im a better shooter than lebron
with two seconds left on the shot clock
now what you know about quarantine being stripped for your powers
thats 23 hour lock down dna i let 24 of you get an hour
30 minutes to shower 15 on ya calls the other 15 you on the yard
staring up at the wall he a fraud should i remind yall
this scared straight im only spitting jail shit to a juvenile
so he know what it feel like to be behind bars
pardon my back pussy now you behind bars
my shit is real my shit is raw my shit is authentic
you cant spell bars without putting that ars in it
time
round 3 dna
kshine said i spit arrogant too like eurgh
so here you go again blamming without the triggers
i said it in the second round
you still being an arsenal ‘cuz you got ya ammo from other niggas
now in this round i could spaz out and be disrespectful
and just shit on you
but for some odd reason i just feel the urge that i should just wig on you
my name is arsonal da rebel
my performance is good but all my bars wack
i look like keenan from good burger so i think im all that
i fucked four bitches in my life and they all fat
enough with them jokes nigga let’s get off that
what vail thought i came to dont flop just to bring jokes on a nigga
hell fucking no this third round is about me exposing this nigga
for example you tell niggas that you roll with a lot of them gs
so explain to me in a room full of men against dizaster
you felt it was cool to drop to ya knees
now some niggas may say arsonal was performing
he wasnt on some other shit
but what the fuck where you performing
how to get on ya knees and learn how to suck a dick
now if yall niggas supposed to be his squad
i dont know what to say to yall
‘cuz that shit seem homo to me yall dont find it gay to y’all
but i aint trying to break up a happy home and start no shit
now im a point out something else when he did something gay verse
charlie clips
a bitch dissed him he dissed her back

i said cool i tried to give him a chance
but then again in a room full of three hundred men
you thought it was cool to unzipper ya pants
whats that about ‘ars you still grippin lines
you tony hawk on the block you got that real nigga grind
you bang every time you dont feel niggas line
and you told shotty theres not a glock in the casket
so you not on real nigga time and i agree with that ‘cuz nigga youve never been on real nigga time
i find that shit to be so true ‘cuz to promote ya battle with rex
you showed when ray swag tried to choke mook
but when math checked you about disrespecting his son and someone disrespected him bout it
ask you went and got ya editors to edit it out
so what happened gangster banging ‘ars that be ready for beef and shit
instead of telling a nigga suck ya dick and you my man
when you go and twist the shit
with me i aint gon’ front like im gangsta i aint gon’ say im a g and shit
just know if i tell you suck my dick
not eurgh or nobody in this crowd gon tell me to delete the shit
but lets get on real nigga time ‘cuz thats something you gotta do first
since we on real nigga time
tell the niggas in the crowd how come you aint bail out tsu surf
dont worry about it yall i spoke to ‘ars
he said you know my flight was leaving early

i didnt speak to smack and i was leaving quickly nigga fuck that
if charlie clips get locked up
i aint leaving london until he make it with me
now thats real nigga time you got ya shit ass backwards

how the fuck you expect uw to prosper when all you do is book smack rappers see that aint gonna help that nigga out to get to the top ‘cuz thats like eurgh booking the dont flop event
and book nothing but rappers from king of the dot
so if you a business man you can relate to this
if you wanna build a brand an artist cannot be the face of it
‘cuz thats when you go thru problems like
what if i dont wanna discuss my price we cant speak to him
and how the fuck is he gonna book a rapper if he got beef with em
so instead of you being smart
you just a nigga trying to enlist them figures
you shouldve let d and the rest of them niggas run it and fall
look at the bigger picture
its round 3 its getting hot in here
and after exposing arsonal as a fraud get him the fuck outta here

round 3 arsonal
please before i start rapping please give a hand for dna
we clappin’ it up for dna ‘cuz young boy be getting it in
ya name is eric right well ya middle name is missing a lynn
eric lynn wright died from aids transmitted
from unprotectedly sticking it in
what im saying is the illest nigga named eric was eazy e
and we all know damn well you aint sicker than him
now this last round of bars probably aint gon’ bring ya dad back
but you dinner i see food joes crab shack
you pop that tooth out before you eat supper thats a bad cap
but you could have that that aint even what im mad at
what im mad at is how you let a nigga named kshine
a nigga who got his ass gripped breakdown dna as a professor
really like on some class shit
the last fight you had you loss a tooth
which means you really got ya ass whipped
or you was in the same spot dose was in when math pulled that fag shit
but now you in the same spot shotty was in
when i broke it down from z to a
but they like he battling americans so what angle is it gonna be today
well he had dreams of bet ciphers and winning a vma
they wouldve let you on the bet cypher if you told ‘em you was missing
that tooth for twelve years ‘cuz they wouldve felt spitting was in ya dna
now ill battle anybody except the home team
long as they talking bread my niggas can travel with me
they good and they all get fed
and  i felt like you was his height when we battled
‘cuz my bars went over charlie head
and the most disrespectful shit to ya brother in a battle
nigga i hardly said now we gon’ get into it
when you was nine we shouldve battled at ya pops funeral
right in front of his coffin bed
trigger finger give his caucus lead until gushing out an awkward red
only reason i target head kshine already kilt him
and the only way to kill a zombie is a headshot
i learned that from watching the walking dead
im the type of nigga out lurking on a late night
you nemo at heart but now encountered with a great white
you throw up every battle ‘cuz of stage fright this aint right
shotty was tough this beef tender like cutting tender with a steak knife
after all that i taught you losers wasnt learning
long range from a rooftop nigga my shooters be determined
4 i hate a cocky nigga so i nazi niggas
what that mean i let eight off adolf my rugers even german
i shut shit down like when business hours over
bus since way back when niggas wore pennies out the loafer
i run in ya trap house demand plenty out ya sofa
im like a cowboy the way the pistol shimmy out the holster
aye shotty dark liquor im on it 6 pills and im zoning
im all the way in england why is my cell phone still roaming roman
all my jewelrys golden all my cars is stolen
all my broads is foreign i do all this touring
what im trying to say is if you knew better youd do better
but here you go bluffin’ if you know like i know than dont do no stunin’
if they question you dont know nothing you tell you get ya ass beat
every other week like you joe budden
neither one of yall from jersey so find another state to land on
ya gun are sketches hand drawn my gun and my hand drawn
why belittle you they say to make the team i must be physical
come to ya home and school you i could teach you hands on
now we gon’ talk about ya bitch yall wanna hear about his bitch
alright i call her anna because she played em she all in my boys ears
she hit the l too and anna selected me man that broad thick
she started getting nasty pressing my buttons to give her all dick
ya ex kicked you out her circle ‘cuz a square you are one
so i gave ann a log analog ‘cuz she really does enjoy stick joystick
that was lite but i wrote it when i was sober
clips like i did the fucking joystick theme
yeah but mine was kinda colder
why ‘cuz even if we played where he stationed playstation
when it come to his ex box xbox
hell try to tell her what to do but i control her controller
i mean that bitch rolled up on me and im like
nah bitch i dont wanna kick it that aint how i play with a holy bitch
i leave that bitch holy and hold my dick and i yell holy shit
i said i hit bitches too she talk i sock her without a goalie kick
wait i said i hit bitches too i sock her mick foley shit
no nigga in the history of mankind could stand mind when the 40 spit
i aint used to defeat its like they cut mine off im feeling like
kunta im on some tobe shit
now whats in this gun will leave you crawling all by yourself
call it a lonely clip
‘til you meet up with ya pops
everybody i battled including ya homie clips
now ya ho spit all on my dick you like impossible
but nonono ya ho spit all on my dick like a prostitute
my ho spit all in the clip theyll have to doctor you
and put you in the er of that ho spit stall thats the hospital
emergency room intensive care for a lot of you
i just spelled his name e r i c i had to break it down for a lot of you
ya mom said im a walk in the park why that bitch lie to you
in battles im ahead
i showed you need to stay on ya toes i just bodied you
i say in battles im ahead a head
i shoulder you needs knees to stay on ya toes i just bodied you
you broke ass so trash fuck nigga with no dad
me talking ‘bout yo’ dad probably got you so mad
ya life aint worth the price on my coat tag so we gon’ clean up his act
deodorant body wash soap dental floss tooth man here
just take the whole bag
and heres all of 30 pages out of canibus notepad
you gon need that a miracle 30 house niggas a negro spiritual
and a big gun and carmelos shot when he played for syracuse
or you might need that pinocchio whats that
thats a long nose with a long range so i’m hittin’ targets in tokyo
more gun shots nigga more hits
than a lakers home game when it turn to the kobe show
that cig spark it start smoking but i aint lighting no bogie though
