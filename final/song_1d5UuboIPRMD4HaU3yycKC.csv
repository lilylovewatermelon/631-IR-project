when this began i had nothin to say
and id get lost in the nothingness inside of me
i was confused and i let it all out to find
that im not the only person with these things in mind
inside of me but all the vacancy the words revealed
is the only real thing that ive got left to feel
nothing to lose just stuck hollow and alone
and the fault is my own and the fault is my own

chorus chester bennington mike shinoda
i wanna heal i wanna feel
what i thought was never real
i wanna let go of the pain ive held so long
erase all the pain til its gone
i wanna heal i wanna feel
like im close to something real
i wanna find something ive wanted all along
somewhere i belong

verse 2 mike shinoda chester bennington
and ive got nothin to say
i cant believe i didnt fall right down on my face
i was confused lookin everywhere only to find
that its not the way i had imagined it all in my mind
so what am i what do i have but negativity
cause i cant justify the way everyone is lookin at me
nothing to lose nothin to gain hollow and alone
and the fault is my own and the fault is my own
