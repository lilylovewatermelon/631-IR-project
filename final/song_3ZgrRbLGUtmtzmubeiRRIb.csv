well the honkytonks in texas were my natural second home
where you tip your hats to the ladies and the rose of san antone
i grew up on music that we called western swing
it dont matter whos in austin bob wills is still the king

verse 2
lord i can still remember the way things were back then
in spite of all the hard times id live it all again
to hear the texas playboys and tommy duncan sing
makes me proud to be from texas where bob wills is still the king

chorus 1
you can hear the grand old opry in nashville tennessee
its the home of country music on that we all agree
but when you cross that old red river hoss that just dont mean a thing
because once youre down in texas bob wills is still the king

chorus 2
well if you aint never been there then i guess you aint been told
that you just cant live in texas unless you got a lot of soul
its the home of willie nelson the home of western swing
hell be the first to tell you bob wills is still the kingyou might also like1embed"
