these days dont end
and you lost the things that brought us closer
were spread so thin
and thats all it takes to knock you over

verse 1
findin out the hard way
forgot how good it feels to be alone you dig mm
watch a movie on your phone for real
is this how im supposed to feel
save me some she said love i felt like
you couldve called it something else
but i couldnt think of nothing else for real
cause it was hard to tell

prechorus
make it easy for me
baby take it easy on me

chorus
these days dont end
and you lost the things that brought us closer
were spread so thin
and thats all it takes to knock you over

windin down a long day
forgot how hard it was to sleep alone in here
feel like i aint folded clothes in years
i cant believe its over still over still
long way down you stay round the whole time
but it wasnt for yourself i
i still dont know how you felt for real baby
cause it was hard to tell you cant blame me
i dont put on a act for everybody
it wouldnt break your back to stand beside me
forever and a mile was tantalizin
i try to force my smile but cant deny that4embed"
