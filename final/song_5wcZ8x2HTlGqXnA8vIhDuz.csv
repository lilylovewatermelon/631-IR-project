when i wake up in the morning light
i pull on my jeans and i feel all right
i pull my blue jeans on i pull my old blue jeans on
i pull my blue jeans on i pull my old blue jeans on

its the weekend and i know that youre free
so pull on your jeans and come on out with me
i need to have you near me i need to feel you close to me
i need to have you near me i need to feel you close to me

hook
you and me well go motorbike riding in the sun
and the wind and the rain
i got money in my pocket i got a tiger in my tank
and im king of the road again

ill meet you in the usual place
you dont need a thing except your pretty face alright
i pull my blue jeans on i pull my old blue jeans on
i pull my blue jeans on i pull my old blue jeans on
aw here we go mama

hook
you and me well go motorbike riding in the sun
and the wind and the rain
i got money in my pocket i got a tiger in my tank
and im king of the road again
