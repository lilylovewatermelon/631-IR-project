i met you
somewhere
in a hell
beneath the stairs
theres someone in that room
that frightens you
when they go boom
boom boom boom
the color you say is black
is the one you might lack
in the size of your eyes
is there a
righteous prize

oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
i met you i met you

verse 2
theres something wrong
with our hearts
when they beat pure
they stand apart
in the black room the light
watch the seabird fall
real love
it finds you
somewhere with your back to it

we know we know
we belong

and to the dawn
we know we know
we belong
by the street
and to the dawn
we know we know
we belong
by the street
and to the dawn5embed"
