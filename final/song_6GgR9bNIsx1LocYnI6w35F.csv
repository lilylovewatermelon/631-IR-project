spoken natalie marsha
you know your existence has kinda been recognized
by the resistance to dream
eventually becoming a way of life to me
enough to keep contentment
through waking hours to courting shades
in those early days
math was exchanged
i kinda had to build up the courage to just say
hey hello remember me hello hello
i just felt just to say hello babe

outro marsha
how are you
how are you babe hello
how are you babe
how are you babe hello
how are you babe
how are you babe hello
how are you babe
how are you babe
