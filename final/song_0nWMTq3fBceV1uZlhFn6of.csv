verse 1 lil wayne
medicine man
medicine man taking off never to land
united we fall together we stand
i pop a whole she took a half
im feelin’ gold she lookin tan
it never gets old she never get mad
we too high to fuck i never hear that
cotton candy sweet as gold
make that pussy open close
she take her meds up her nose
lookin like she smelled a rose
it says hermès on my clothes
20 mg that’s my dose
i fucked her off one of those
she act like she saw a ghost
wake up baby comatose
wake up baby vamonos
sleeping like we on an island somewhere in galapagos
its lonely at the top we hold hands and geronimo
100 percent cotton oxymoron oxycontin
