theres plenty bout me that i dont like
most mistakes ive made i made them twice
sometimes i dont live out the words i say
and i just cant stay out my own way
but my good intentions overflow
way down deep inside my bones
though my heads been known to give me hell
this heart of mine is just something else yeah

chorus
but the best part of me part of me is you
is you is you
yeah the best part of me part of me is you
is you

verse 2
i got my old mans baby blues
and his daddys taste for whiskey too
my brothers love for rock n roll
and my mommas southern gospel soul

chorus
but the best part of me part of me
is you is you
yeah the best part of me part of me
