you were the chosen appointment to be who you are
i have been sitting and waiting and hoping apart
you are in sight in the air in the night in the airplane
i am a light in the city your flight overcame

chorus
how is it all of the people can know who you are
off in the distance emitting a glow in the dark
i see you
not too far

verse 2
maybe theres something to being the one who you are
holding the thoughts in as you pull away in your car
and i get to thinking a little too often
and all that i want is a little aloft and
maybe its all too much thinking and not enough heart

chorus
how is it all of the people can know who you are
off in the distance emitting a glow in the dark
all of it subtle and all of it very bizarre
how is it all of the people can know who you are
i see you
not too far
you might also likebridge
armed to the teeth
you will sit at the fireside
we are the ones who have chosen the other side
it was easy to see
you were ready to be
and it all falls down
you rose up
and rode away underground

outro
alone us finding our way to found
you rose up and rode away underground
how is it all of the people can know who you are
alone us finding our way to found
off in the distance emitting a glow in the dark
i see you
not too farembed"
