well ive been waiting for the rain to break
but i guess my waitings through
its been dry as a bone since 1982
and ive been trying to protect myself
with these possessions i keep on his walls
all my books and my records but they dont give me shelter at all
were both smart enough to know better

chorus
come on come on come on
take me into townx2

verse 2
oh did you see my boots when you walked in
yknow i guess this shirtll do
im broke as a monkey and i could use a drop or two
well i know just what ill do when i get there
you know i saw it in a magazine
i can get so low youll have to peel me from off of the street
were both smart enough to know better

chorus
come on come on come on
take me into townx9

well ive been talking to the dog for days
but you know its just no use
shes sitting like a sphinx and i cant get to the truth
and ive been staring at the floor for days
trying to figure out what it all means
but i know when im awake and im dumber in my dreams
were both smart enough to know better

come on come on come on
take me into townx4embed"
