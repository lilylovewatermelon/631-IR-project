so i never really knew you
god i really tried to
blindsided addicted
thought we could really do this
but really i was foolish
hindsight its obvious

prechorus
talking with my lawyer
she said where’d you find this guy
i said young people fall in love
with the wrong people sometimes

chorus
some mistakes get made
thats alright thats okay
you can think that you’re in love
when youre really just in pain
some mistakes get made
thats alright thats okay
in the end its better for me
thats the moral of the story babe

postchorus
ohoh ohoh
ohoh ohoh

its funny how a memory
turns into a bad dream
when running wild turns volatile
remember how we painted our house
just like my grandparents did
so romantic but we fought the whole time
shouldve seen the signs yeah

prechorus
talking with my mother
she said where’d you find this guy
said some people fall in love
with the wrong people sometimes

chorus
some mistakes get made
that’s alright thats okay
you can think that you’re in love
when youre really just in pain
some mistakes get made
thats alright thats okay
in the end it’s better for me
thats the moral of the story babe

postchorus
ohoh ohoh

they say its better to have loved and lost
than never to have loved at all
that could be a load of shit
but i just need to tell you all

chorus
some mistakes get made
thats alright thats okay
you can think that youre in love
when youre really just engaged
some mistakes get made
thats alright thats okay
in the end its better for me
thats the moral of the story
some mistakes get made
thats alright thats okay
you can think that youre in love
when youre really just in pain
some mistakes get made
thats alright thats okay
in the end its better for me
thats the moral of the story babe
