this old man and me
were at the bar and we
were having us some beers and
swapping i dont cares

verse 2
talking politics
blonde and redhaired chicks
old dogs and new tricks and
habits we aint kicked

bridge
we talked about gods grace
and all the hell we raised
then i heard the ol man say

chorus
god is great
beer is good
and people are crazy

verse 3
he said i fought two wars
been married and divorced
what brings you to ohio
he said damned if i know
see billy currington liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likeverse 4
we talked an hour or two
bout every girl we knew
what all we put them through
like two old boys will do

bridge
we pondered life and death
he lit a cigarette
said these damn things will kill me yet

chorus
but god is great
beer is good
and people are crazy

break
last call is 2 am
i said goodbye to him
i never talked to him again

verse 3
then one sunny day
i saw the old mans face
front page obituary
he was a millionairey
verse 4
he left his fortune to
some guy he barely knew
his kids were mad as hell
huh but me
im doing well

bridge
and i drop by today
to just say thanks and pray
i left a sixpack
right there on his grave
and i said

chorus
god is great
beer is good
and people are crazy

chorus
god is great
beer is good
and people are crazy

chorus
god is great
beer is good
and people are crazy6embed"
