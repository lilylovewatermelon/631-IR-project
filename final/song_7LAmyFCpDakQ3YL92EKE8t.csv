i was dreaming something dark
hiding body parts
a broken dog a broken leg
i left it cold i left it dead

prechorus
oh im a guilty one
and they know what i have done
yeah im a troubled one
and i wont be forgiven

chorus
guilty on the run and i know what i have done
guilty on the run and im never forgiven
i was just a kid that you could not forgive because its harder
i was just a kid and all i really wanted was my father

verse 2
killed a dog so small and rare
touched its technicoloured hair
i left it bruised and black and lame
i left it running full of shame

prechorus
oh im a guilty one
and they know what i have done
yeah im a troubled one
and i wont be forgiven

bridge
spent years singing to forget to forget
i spent years singing no regret
then suddenly it all becomes clear
ive been sorry all these years

chorus
i was just a kid that you could not forgive because its harder
i was just a kid and all i really wanted was my father
guilty on the run and i know what i have done

guilty on the run and im never forgiven11embed"
