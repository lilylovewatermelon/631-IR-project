breakdown
i cant take this
i need somewhere to go
i need you
im so restless
i dont know what to do
weve had our rough times
fighting all night
and now youre just slipping away

prechorus
give me this chance
to make the wrongs rightto say
dont dont dont walk away

chorus
i promise
i wont let you down you down
if you take my hand tonight
i promise
well be just fine this time
if you take my hand tonight
if you take my hand tonight

verse 2
without you i go through the motions
without you its just not quite the same
without you i dont wanna go out
i just wanted to say
see simple plan liveget tickets as low as 50you might also likeprechorus
that im sick of these fights
ill let you be right
if it stops you from running away
so give me this chance
to make the wrongs right to say
dont dont dont walk away

chorus
i promise
i wont let you down you down
if you take my hand tonight
i promise
well be just fine this time
if you take my hand tonight
if you take my hand tonight

bridge
take my hand
take my hand i promise
take my hand i promise

chorus
i promise
i wont let you down you down
if you take my hand tonight
i promise
well be just fine this time
if you take my hand tonight
if you take my hand tonight
if you take my hand tonight
i wont let you down you down
