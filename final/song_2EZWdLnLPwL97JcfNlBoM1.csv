we got winners we got losers
chain smokers and boozers
and we got yuppies we got bikers
we got thirsty hitchhikers
and the girls next door dress up like movie stars

hook
hmm hmm hmm i love this bar

verse 2
we got cowboys we got truckers
brokenhearted fools and suckers
and we got hustlers we got fighters
early birds and allnighters
and the veterans talk about their battle scars

hook
hmm hmm hmm i love this bar
