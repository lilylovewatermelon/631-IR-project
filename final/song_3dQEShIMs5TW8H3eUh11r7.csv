this house is not a home to you
but you decide to go ahead and lay down lay down
there are no words to describe the depth of your indifference
’cause i see you’re here to stay
should’ve known to pick my fate oh no

chorus
i’m so wrong i’m so wrong
to let you in my
to let you in my home
now you know where i sleep
now you know where i sleep
never felt so damn weak

verse 2
hey there lonely girl
did you have to tell your friends
about  the way i got you screaming my name
did you have to tell the world
now your girls all wanna fuck
girl you could’ve been the one
gotta change my number twice a month
when you could have simply kept it on the down low

chorus
i’m so wrong i’m so wrong
to let you in my
to let you in my home
now you know where i sleep
now you know where i sleep
never felt so damn weak

baby if i knew you’d be living in my sheets
i wouldn’t have shown you any love
i would have left you in the club
you said you don’t belong
you keep saying there’s no one
and there’s no where to go
but who keeps calling on your phone
i’m so wrong i’m so wrong i’m so wrong

chorus
i’m so wrong i’m so wrong
to let you in my
to let you in my home
now you know where i sleep
now you know where i sleep
never felt so damn weak
i’m so wrong i’m so wrong
to let you in my
to let you in my home
now you know where i sleep
now you know where i sleep
never felt so damn weak

outro
girl if your man call your phone again
girl if your man call your phone again169embed"
