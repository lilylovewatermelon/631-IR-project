you say i should be on top of the world but im not feeling much
you know i used to think i could fly now im just holding on
yeah im laughing in a room full of strangers on the verge of tears
yeah i should be on top of the world but yet im right here

prechorus
oh cause every time every time
you look at me its never enough for you
it cant be fair to me
cause boy you know im so damn in love with you

chorus
oh oohooh
ive been stuck seeing your face in everyone
shouldnt have played in your game of fun
now i dont think im okay you never go away
oh enjoy the show you seem to love whеn im alone
you like to care until you dont
now i dont think im okay you nеver go away
oh oohooh oh oohooh ooh

verse 2
i should be on top of the world but ive been falling down
and each day gets a little bit worse when youre not around oh oh
was driving and i thought that i saw you and i almost crashed
the sad part is if the roles were reversed you wouldve drove right past
