its all a game of this or that now versus then
better off against worse for wear
and youre someone who knows someone who knows someone i once knew
and i just want to be a part of this
the road outside my house is paved with good intentions
hired a construction crew cause its hell on the engine

prechorus 1
and you are the dreamer and we are the dream
i could write it better than you ever felt it

chorus
so hum hallelujah just off the key of reason
i thought i loved you but it was just how you looked in the light
a teenage vow in a parking lot til tonight do us part
i sing the blues and swallow them too

verse 2
my words are my faith to hell with our good name
a remix of your guts your insides xrayed
and one day well get nostalgic for disaster
were a bull your ears are just a china shop
i love you in the same way theres a chapel in a hospital
one foot in your bedroom and one foot out the door
see fall out boy liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likeprechorus 2
sometimes we take chances sometimes we take pills
i could write it better than you ever felt it

chorus
so hum hallelujah just off the key of reason
i thought i loved you but it was just how you looked in the light
a teenage vow in a parking lot til tonight do us part
i sing the blues and swallow them too

bridge
hallelujah hallelujah

hallelujah hallelujah hum hallelujah hum hallelujah
hallelujah hallelu hum hallelujah hum hallelujah
a teenage vow in a parking lot til tonight do us part
i sing the blues and swallow them too

chorus
so hum hallelujah just off the key of reason
i thought i loved you but it was just how you looked in the light
a teenage vow in a parking lot til tonight do us part
vow in a parking lot til tonight do us part
a teenage vow in a parking lot til tonight do us part
i sing the blues and swallow them too23embed"
