verse 1
cause you got to be bigger be faster be stronger
if youre gonna survive any longer
in this lifetime it better be the right time
the first time might be your last time
am i a failure if i got nothing to lose
no im not a failure i got something to prove

verse 2
cause ive lost my innocence
and im a stranger a life changer
im a man thats not afraid of danger
i walk my own path and blaze my own trail
cause im not afraid to derail
i wont get in line or be a middleman
so fuck you ill make my own plan
and i got respect and i dont neglect
the people that i really care to protect
am i a failure if i got nothing to lose
no im not a failure i got something to prove
