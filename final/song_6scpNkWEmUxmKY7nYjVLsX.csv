huh que será será so the story goes
on and on and back and forth the evolutions absolute
tours and shows and groupie whores

that sponsors the revolution that will not be televised
decide to cross those lil guys youve obviously been illadvised
yet and still the question that arises to the mind
will he make it was it worth it
did he win will he survive the rodeo99embed"
