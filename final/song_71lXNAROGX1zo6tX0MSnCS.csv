this aint no temporary typical tearful goodbye
this aint no breakin up then wakin up and makin up one more time
this is gone gone gone gone gone gone gone

chorus
gone like a freight train
gone like yesterday
gone like a soldier in the civil war

gone like a 59 cadillac
like all the good things that aint never comin back
shes gone gone gone gone gone gone gone

gone like a 59 cadillac
like all the good things that aint never comin back
