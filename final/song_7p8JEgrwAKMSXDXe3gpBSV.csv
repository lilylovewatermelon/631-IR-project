i know you know just how it goes when it goes
and how it feels to be lost and left alone on your own
and what its like to give all you got and have to stand and watch it
as it walks away
so everyone deserves a chance to live and learn
from mistakes that we make and hearts that break and bridges burn
starting now from this moment on nothings gonna go wrong
love is here to stay

chorus
youll never be without
youll always have enough
when youre in my arms
youll never go unloved
as long as there is time
and for all of it to come
no matter where you go
i want you to know
youll never be unloved

verse 2
so in this life we lead some things are guaranteed
you can count on the fact that hearts wont act responsibly
now and then comes a love thats heaven sent and meant to be
so baby look at me

oh when youre in my arms
youll never go unloved
as long as there is time
and for all of it to come

chorus
youll never be without
youll always have enough
oh when youre in my arms
youll never go unloved
as long as there is time
and for all of it to come
no matter where you go
i want you to know
youll never be unloved ohembed"
