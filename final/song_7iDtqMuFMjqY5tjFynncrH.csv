alright buddy
time for your end buddy
alright lets play a little card game arcane
lets see if you can call my bluff on the spot
im gonna give you a chance to clear this shit up you can answer and talk
do i or do i not have these paypal statements where you paid caustic in my back pocket or not
oh i dont have them
is that what you gon say bitch
you gon say that that is some forged document and that i made this
well if thats true then how do you explain this
if the facebook messages were a bunch of fake shit
then what about the fucking paypal statement
what do you mean what do you mean
ayo welcome daniel stefani
december 1 payment from alex drake sent 225 canadian
you are fucking garbage
you will never ever release a hit
your music is trash and thats the reason cause youre a piece of shit
after this battle you dont even redeem yourself you need to quit
cause you a cheating snitch
you codepended on other peoples dicks you licked their penis tip
for every single scheme you spit
and every scheme you spit is made up of someone elses 16 you bit
okay this guy is really good at playing it off and acting like the fact aint true
but then you went and told chedda that your girlfriend is a stripper that works on wednesday afternoon
where on your mom and sister that that was you
what what
go ahead what about the cracker barrel line
and how you told em you gon clap the tool
swear on your father that that was you
you might also likearcane
that was actually me

dizaster
thats really funny cause i actually got the file that caustic sent him too
its like no one wants to hear me anymore even though you already lost
stupid motherfuckers are making me feel like im weird now cause i use this to get my point across
but i never lose everywhere i go you know im a boss
but to think about it im on the same on the same card as uno lavos so that automatically means that i lost
what you gonna say bitch
at least rebuttal what i said to you
say something back that they can relate with
or are you just gonna dick ride drake like dna did
i mean what did you do
alex drake
what the fuck are you even rhyming for
if this guy got any older and he couldnt stand up right no more
hed probably call up caustic like yo let me borrow your spinal cord
this dude has arthritis he cant even write no more
he has writers block which ill give him the title for
im thinking minus scores for every time he spit a line before and lied before
our very own eyes and said the line was yours
can you imagine this motherfucker trying to fight a war
hed stop in the middle of the battle like yo homie let me borrow your rifle cause i ran out of ammo and need to buy some more
i dont give a fuck if you guys think arcane is killing it
you know why cause i woke up today and wrote my own shit
i know that shit is amazing isnt it
putting your own pen to the page and inking it
that look on your face as you come up with the phrase and think of it
like oh my god i cant believe my brain just did this shit
i know arcane that feeling is amazing isnt it
see theres a major difference when someone gives you a basic reference
then you take it and use it in your own way to recreate the sentence
then when you blatantly take someone elses shit spit it in the same shape it was given
i mean you didnt even rephrase it a little bit
with the same style same cadence i heard it before
the way arcane just admit the shit
caustic spit it the same way you spit it
you didnt even change the way he delivered it
then this fucking fraud went on facebook and told his fans it was straight up coincidence
two hours later hes on the phone with caustic like how could you make the england trip
and not tell me the same day you did the shit
all of a sudden out of nowhere against chedda his bars where crazy sophisticated and intricate
but thats not thanks to your penmanship
thats thanks to caustic cause he wrote like 80 of it
im sorry but your fucking friendship ima have to put an end to it
you guys had a perfect situation you were like friends with benefits
and im the one thats ending them
so im sorry caustic after this you and cane will never be ableable to be friends again
round 1 arcane
i said yo
ill leave this motherfucker dumbfoundead
when i drop you out the battle scene with a single spinning drop kick
youre a fucking idiot diz i dont care how you spin your logic
you try to say i stole some bars bitch you stole a win from caustic
i dont even have to mention that bullshit you pulled with jin and locksmith
yo thats why last month i became the undisputed two time champ
im outstanding in my field
last month what was dizaster doing
making his own crop circles literally out standing in a field
i guess this motherfucker was waiting for the aliens to come and get him for his rapping
well its funny we all expected a big disaster december 2012 but armageddon never happened
see heres the thing pussy
first time you went to new york you battled swave i heard you was treated quite foul
but the last time you were there you tweeted math and holla are my favorite people right now
hold up you told me when you seen math you was gonna fuck him up
like you would reach for the cal
but you went from beef to bff i guess you dont keep it halal
yo thats how i know this la kings an impostor
just check the la roster
i called him out two years ago you more like an la dodger
so now ima eat yo dinner
i know the lakers is your team but judging by those eyebrows you gon need those clippers
so im saying what do yall really believe in
fact or fraud
see im a natural disaster you aint no act of god
you think about where he actually establishes his fame from
its like the 911 conspiracy theory this disaster was manufactured from day one
listen listen let me explain let me explain
see theres a reason some battle rappers get more exposure than the rest
just look at the template his homie lush promoted in the west
diz cried till he got battles with canibus arsonal and rex
hes views went up too bad i cant credit your bars for the success
i know you got a lot of twitter fans well i give a fuck if some hate me
im just saying this spoiled brats had a little too much fun lately
you dont bust guns daily you a trust fund baby
matter of fact you should be wearing a custom tshirt that says lush one made me
yo check this out check this out check this out
yo plus we all know dizasters dad is wealthy and influential
hes a pillar back in the community
but that dont mean when you come back to canada you got some kind of diplomatic immunity
you think you gon lift a matic and shoot at me
i hope you brought enough clips to clap at the crew with me
im from the university of hard knocks its time to take him to school with me
thats why i dont give a fuck if you bring your set
i should ring your neck for driving around malibu in your little pink corvette
i bet this diva feels too flashy in the cadillac
well all that cash he has to travel maps
matter of fact you might be the kim kardashian of battle rap
yo this fucking diva wanted to live closer to drake so his dad bought him a house
mail order bride his dad copped him a spouse
no furniture in his place so his dad got him a house so he could sit on twitter all day and rap off at the mouth
but diz was never that hot
he just pretend he the nicest
well im a cold blooded killer i leave my enemies lifeless
this verse is just a testiment to how pathetic your life is
youre just a spoiled rotten arabamerican going through an identity crisis
im saying you have such delusions of grandeur how can your therapist stomach it
your shit on your roots with stereotypes and embarrass your parents in public
hes always playing the role of crazy arabic terrorist and loving it
perpetuating the same false narrative as the american government
so i guess you must be conflicted between your two sides fam
cause you demonize your people like the media do iran
so is it king of the dot or url
how many times is diz switching
you aint no bin laden more like been whining and been bitching
yo fuck that i brought a machete to hack his limbs off
​​​​​​​​time gets called and the crowd starts booing organik dizaster and arcane start arguing about the time limits​​​​​​​​
round 2 dizaster
ayo that was the biggest garbage ever
oh but you said i was a disaster since day one
see that was my fucking point
now he gon think every thing youve ever done is fake son
because that line was really great son
but now how the fuck do we actually know where it came from
yo you should go hang out with drake instead of me
you guys together would ball out
i mean yall some bosses in the club yall could see each other floss out
but drake itd be hard for you to compete with a boss like arcane cause you know soon as he steps up in the spot he gon buy all the bars out
ayo before this battle one of arcanes faggot ass fans walked up to me told me diz i hate you
and i was like why
hes like arcane is gonna scrape you
and i was like how name one line you could relate to
and he was like what that square cheese kraft singles on his own that line was great dude
and i was like for sure homie ill tell caustic you said thank you
you dont roll around with no packers
you aint whipping around in the whip with the green bays
you dont spit what you live about
everything is scripted out like a screenplay
so now you think hes gonna kill me now
cause his verses are delivered out in a clean way
but what yall didnt figure out is that hes quick to steal around like green day
i said i shoot out his lower back and have both of his discs spinning around like i was getting down with the dj
when we bust our matic its like rush hour traffic you see his brains just sitting around on the freeway
ill roll up to the house to his door and kick it down in a g way
seen him sitting down seen this clown fishing around shopping for lyricsfor schemes off of ebay
thats when i let the heat spray
when the pistols out you will get a roundaround quicker than he say she say
​​​​​​the crowd starts booing​​​​​​
wooooow
i accept it i accept it
i already know im a real motherfucker so i accept that fact that you boo me
if yall want your champion from canada to be a faggot that ghost writes outta casper the movie then be glad to do it
you stupid fucks you be acting all spooky
the last ghost writing session you had got broken up by shaggy and scooby
​​​​​​some of the crowd continues to boo​​​​​​
really yall gon fuckingyall gon disrespect me when i always defend you
really back in america when anyone says something about king of the dot i respect you
im the one that defends you
they wanna let you hold the belt too
​​​​​​crowd starts booing again​​​​​​
i said its all good i guess this is the person you want to come to the rescue
so i guess thats why i left you
but its funny how canadian can you be to get to the same place as me you needed an american to help you
let me tell you something bitch
you dont even do the things that average canadians do
you let an american read your writesrights how canadian are you
man seriously man fuck yall

round 2 arcane
my last name is drake so we might buy out the bar
but i aint the type just making money off of sprite commercials
still diz make no mistake i am that drake just the type to murk you
so i suggest you better sit down slim
wheres notes i might have to send notes with that bottle cut his face open like chris brown chin
that shout out to young money
my style dirty like new money
you making those old jokes diz but 30 is the new 20
and you pushing 30 yourself now so i would watch what you say buddy
the way i put dizasters head on a stakesteak is rare it stay bloody
and you keep trying to call me a fake gangster but thats a massive misconception
really youre the fake gangster just trying to add to the

​​​​​​arcane puts his arm on dizasters shoulder and a fight almost breaks out​​​​​​

yo world domination 3 you tore your shirt off in a room full of dudes so you could flash your tats
then you started an internet beef with classic pack
and called him a faggot for doing exactly that
well i watched your battle with rich i noticed another sad actual fact
diz is flexing for the camera with a motherfucking barb wire pam anderson tat
so i just gotta say what the fuck where you thinking getting a bay watch tattoo diz
were you braggin were you boastin
were you running down the beach with david hasselhoff in slow motion
most rappers might have a song on itunes or at least a bandcamp with a track
not diz he got the pam anderson barb wire tat
looks like it came with a tramp stamp in the back
now look i know a lot of people want me to show him how its supposed to be done
but i aint even trying to do that tonight i just came through to roast him for fun
i did that in the grand prix to show how easy i dispose of these chumps
but im starting to wonder if that whole scheme is getting overly done
i know some of yall want me to mimic dizasters style start decomposing this bum
on how he stretches those violent multis schemes and goes in these runs
rhyming a bunch of random filler just for rhyme sake well that aint poetry son
so matter of fact fuck it for old times sake i gotta show em how its suppose to be done

starts mimicking disasters pace and tone

yo you know how diz do first he starts walking back and forth acting like hes a deranged murderer
hell show up in your apartment and start rearranging the furniture
in a fucking in a fucking in a fucking black ski mask like hes some kind of crazy burglar
sift through your kitty litter with his bare hands until he creates a perfect turd for ya
hell fucking hell fucking hell fucking place it on your pillow while youre sleeping without disturbing ya
before he flies out the window on his magic carpet because hes the prince of persia
yo diz when you spit that shit i know you think its real clever
but to real gs that sounds like the worst fucking home invasion ever
yo this how i do it
you bought yourself an ak thats cool i brought the ar with the c mag
100 rounds per clip ready to spray off if its jihad
when that 8 spark and my trademark is to break arms and then kneecaps
you wont even see me coming on your radar when the heat blasts
cause i got schematics of your building and im coming through the air ducts
so when those big arms get to squeezing i aint talking about a bear hug
if i say i have him dropping pints nobodys shattering a beer mug
ill air slugs and have bachirs blood splattered on his prayer rug
yo so if you want that home invasion shit homie i was made for this
im launching tear gas you aint in my tier class stop debating it
you aint a muslim extremist you a docile atheist
quit fronting home you softer than a hot pile of baby shit
thought you had a hot style my style craziest
in the grand prix i got wild but i stock piled grenades for this
ill show up on your block with a pack of hostile canadians
and blow up every building within a five mile radius
cause the way you recycle bars thats a cop out laziness
your shit sound incomplete like the lox without jadakiss
lately fucking with cane you better watch out its dangerous
this is like putting a rottweiler with rabies in a babies crib
so yall can tell dizaster felt the wrath before he fell to ashes
the way i bring that heat to your kitchen im fit to melt the plaster
your punches telegraph im well adapted before you even smell the gas
youll see me in a welding mask and a balaclava
this battles mine at least you can say you were a participant
ill give his ligaments scar tissue for thinking his stars infinite
catch him slipping while sipping hard liquor and barbiturates
im carnivorous ill carve into him with sharp instruments

i put diz in a hospital bed with the bed pan option
for avacado and everybody behind the red cam watching
yall already know my slogan
thats a dead man walking

round 3 dizaster
i was gonna start flipping back at his lines
but then the verse was over really fast and i didnt have enough time
i was gonna put it in a rebuttal you know wrapped in one rhyme
but you look like such a fraud i dont even need to rebuttal you standing there is just fine

​crowd starts booing again​

whos booing come over here and boo me
come over here and boo me motherfucker

​i believe this is where the footage of dizaster hitting a woman in crowd with a beer can gets cuts​

you suck on rappers salami
faster than gandhi
you have a tattoo on you that says this ass here belongs to daniel stefani
you be acting all cocky like you mastered karate
but you just daniel son and hes your grand daddy miyagi
so quit telling me youre gonna clap with the shotty
you aint blasting nobody
not when you got caustic playing both daddy and mommy
bro please appear before the king as a spineless rat
this is judgement day for every single fucking line you jack
for acting like youre that guy but im not surprised from that
cause even in wrestling cane used to hide behind a mask
this guy is a con artist hes a lying beaver
caustic breaks down compounds and compositions for him like a science teacher
he takes orders from him over the phone like some type of leader
behind the scenes hes the one that writes your speeches
this is like an episode of oz a lot of dick sucking going on behind your bars youre tobias beecher
and i dare you to try to say that youre lying either
ill play the phone call back that i had with caustic over these giant speakers
ayo bitch if we were both shoes
i would be a louie and you would be the fakest nike sneaker
cause everything i do is hand made and you got made in china features
listen bitch you a fucking lying cheater
and the biting of other peoples lines gets deeper
i wouldnt trust this guy rhyming around you either
youll leave a rhyme laying around and then hell take it and say it
and when you ask him why hell be like finders keepers
he says i dont take the title shot in king of the dot serious cause i didnt write for it
yall know me not writing is part of my writing procedure
the fuck would he be mad for me that i didnt write for him anyways
its not like he had to sit down and write for me either
you are not a man you a hologram you are not for real
all the caustic bars you jammed yeah they had a caustic feel
you must be a welder arc that gotta be your job for real
thats why they call an arc welder because you hide behind a mask
and the only reason you got spark is because of the bars you stealsteel
i had a lot of lines like that but thank you for fucking it up for me
anyway i can spit metaphors like that all day and make the crowd go wild
but excuse me if i dont like being a faggot and i prefer to keep my own style
the man over here wouldnt know nothing about his own style
you know how i know how
look at his flow then and look at his flow now
its obvious ill never let you hold the dot chain
you will catch a miracle cold cock cold chop to your jaw cane
defeating me gon be harder than trying to box bing with both of your arms sprained
the scene is overstocked
with a lot of your phony local spot lames
rapping about your 40 glocc
until i show up and the bolt action 30  bang
sending bullets the size of coke bottles the cross hairs will cross your whole lane
then i reload it back with both of my arms crossed
shooting over my own shoulders i got robot aim
that 44 revolver would chip the side of you skull and cut the corners off
like i sent it to a photo shop frame
watching his body drop was like being in an audio shop cause you looked on the walls and saw his organs all hang
i will drag his body up and down the hill like im part of motor cross gang
dangling from the side of the motor while hes tied to a rope by his ankles til hes lacerated and maimed
i will drag him so i expose his top and expose his raw brain
if you wouldve seen his autopsy from long range you wouldve been the ninja turtles and swore to god that you saw crane
you went from scarborough youre from victoria park cane
just know your position and know your part cane
stop saying you got animals with the 40s on deck with you and thats not who we know as arcane
go to war with me and you get torn apart
ill leave you with a broken heart youd have to replace the ish with motor parts like tony starks cane
keep it going to four minutes like he didnt give me the same
arcane even if you open up a fucking arcade you couldnt open a box and insert another token
this is where the games over im not playing
see from date see most of yall never bothered to look up the definition of arcane
it means hidden secret
so from day one i knew there was something hes not saying
but you know that that all changed when i found out the amount of bars this fraud claims
so in the long run youre know that he never chose a smart name
because judging by all the shit he rocked you clearly dont know who you are canearcane

round 3 arcane
alright look every time i hear one of your verses
i feel like ill never get that hour back
the way you always stretching out the round times thats a coward act
so if i say ima put those flashers to his wig no shower cap
i know the whole scene mustve been sleeping on the kid but that was a power nap
see i heard diz got a photographic memory
that means he sees things in flashes of black and white like a pessimist
spends a lot of time in a dark room always looking at the negatives
your lack of focus makes me shutter though
cause most of us know your memory might be photographic
but your style is underdeveloped and overexposed
listen thats why nothing you ever do is symbolic or ground breaking
i started underground cemented my spot with a solid foundation
i built the framework
your shit will collapse like a house of giant cards
my structure is concrete and thats reinforced with these iron bars
see im an architect with lines and angles
so flip a quarter pick your torture get your shit in order before these diz supporters skip the border
with that piss poor structure i dont consider you a big enforcer
you built your house with twigs i built my shit with bricks and mortar
so listen when you took that chain you promised organik a gleam of some hope
said you really wanted to rep the brand but did you mean what you spoke
cause since you became champ
all you done is treated this league like a joke
now smack is the only label you seem to promote
but what goes up must come down
if you studied this equation its clear
i dont think you understand the gravity of the situation bachir
you got your head stuck up in a clouds he thinks hes in a different stratosphere
until i bring him crashing back down to earth and watch him burn up in my atmosphere
yo see yall awakened a sleeping giant
ima send this diva flying
i beat loe pesci and the saurus back when i wasnt even trying
that was the beta version cane he was just trying to get his feet wet
now i climb to an elite vet and i aint even peaked yet
thats why i could already tell at flatline when i called him out that diz was shook
until me and my crew showed up in his kitchen thats when his sister took shish tawook
i didnt ask if the bitch could cook
but i falafel felt awful for her morbid face
cause the way your lil sis could bob kebab when she hum ushummus
she got that extra white sauce when we shawarmd the swarmed the place
whos wack i earned my stripes on this battle field
im a five star general
you couldnt even write your verses unless you high off chemicals
so just keep pretending you freestyling diz thats why your lines arent credible
but for these chains i put in pen time like my bars federal
thats why next to all your bullshit filler i spit that first rate material
i sent the last seven bodies in a hearse straight for burial
and now you think you king of the dot unless your birth place ontario you faking b
so facing me was your worst case scenario
cause after this his price is dropping
aint nobody buying stock in you
you got some psychological issues im trying to talk to you
i should run electricity through his body like fiber optical
get to shocking you before i gotta drop him buy a hospital
im unstoppable you can say the flow is highly volatile
like a single electron loose inside of a molecule
im a biological weapon just try and follow my style is diabolical
im a giant to all of you
wow so yall already know who won this battle
just listen to these rounds back
this is dizasters execution i was just here to play the soundtrack
when you battled dna you called him the american arcane as part of your little clown act
but the funny part is you like dnas dentist thanks to you im finally getting my crown back
so deja vu when i step in this ring thats the feeling i felt
cause the last time a fresh coast vet had the chain the league needed my help
they said im the one canadian capable of retrieving the belt
so i guess its funny what they say history has a strange way of repeating itselfembed"
