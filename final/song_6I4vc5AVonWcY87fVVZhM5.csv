fuck anybody that want me to change what
no one changes ever thats why my glocks on the dresser

motherfuckers know lick aint neverever slackin try me
whether the shotgun or the 9 millimeter

worried ima blow my brains on the glass ui–
i smoke a cigarette and laugh kettles callin pots black hahaha
but sometimes i get violent silent shh

thats why cut throat cuts throats with the sharp blade though
