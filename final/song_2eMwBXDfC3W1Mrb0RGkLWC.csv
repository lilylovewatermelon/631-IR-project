route 14 box 308
she said goodbye at the cattleguard gate
hoping she would find her a place in the world
with her mind made up and tears in her eyes
it almost made her daddy cry
he said dont forget to call when you get there girl

chorus
driving on that two lane road hoping she might find
a whole lot more waiting up ahead than what she left behind
moving upstairs downtown
lifes too short to be hanging around
shes eighteen and its time she got out of the wood
shes getting out while the gettings good

verse 2
all bills paid and a room with a view
shes unpacked a dish or two
she just got her phone turned on today
theres a big old world waiting just outside
as shes thumbing through the classifieds
looking for work and any old jobs okay

chorus
driving on that crosstown freeway hoping she might find
a whole lot more waiting up ahead than what she left behind
living upstairs downtown
lifes too short to be hanging around
shes eighteen and its time she got out of the wood
shes getting out while the gettings good

then she lost her job at the grocery store
and the wolf came knocking at the door
the red notice said they turned off her telephone
theres nothing left for her to do so shes packed up a thing or two
loaded her car down now shes headed home

chorus
driving on that two lane road hoping she might find
a whole lot more waiting up ahead than what she left behind
living upstairs downtown
lifes too short to be hanging around
shes eighteen and its time she got back to the wood
shes getting out while the gettings goodembed"
