the sweet taste was stolen
that’s the story of the south
part of me was home and the other half was gone
and i can’t feel the pain when i’m lying all along

cuz i was breaking down and she was snorting cocaine in my bed
i was making money
somehow i know it’s gonna be all alright
something came to me in the wind last night
and now it’s coming down
oh it’s all coming out
and i can’t stop it now no

get out your bulletproof vest
they can send them shots to your chest
we’re gonna make it now
we’re gonna make it out
get out your bulletproof vest
they can send them shots to your chest
we’re gonna make it now
we’re gonna make it

so take it in tonight
girl your head ain’t right
we could have a date
so we could share this life
there’s something that i know
in the wind as it blows
it’s better to believe
than to lie to everyone you know
see the revivalists liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likei’m breaking down and she was snorting cocaine in my bed
i was making money
somehow i know its gonna be all alright
something came to me in the wind last night
i got a heart
you got a heart
well that dont tell me just who you are
i got to know
i got to know
i got to know
i got to know
we got to go

get out your bulletproof vest
they can send them shots to your chest
we’re gonna make it now
we’re gonna make it out
get out your bulletproof vest
they can send them shots to your chest
we’re gonna make it now
we’re gonna make it out

oooooohs

patience is still bitter in your mouth
the sweet taste was stolen
that’s the story of the south
part of me was home
the other half was gone
and i can’t feel the pain when i’m lying all alone
cuz i was breaking down and she was snorting cocaine in my bed
i was making money
somehow i know its gonna be all alright
something came to me in the wind last night

get out your bulletproof vest
they can send them shots to your chest
we’re gonna make it now
we’re gonna make it out
get out your bulletproof vest
they can send them shots to your chest
we’re gonna make it now
we’re gonna make itembed"
