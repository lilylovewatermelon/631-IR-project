every day i feel the same
stuck and i can never change
sucked into a black balloon
spat into an empty room

prechorus 1
was it really worth it
did i really deserve it
it happens when youre hurting
and cut me at the surface of my heart
of my heartheartheart

chorus
im living dead dead dead dead
only alivelivelivelive
when i pretendtendtendtend
that i have died died died died died died
i havent lived life i havent lived love
just birds eye view from the sky above
im dead dead dead dead
im living dead dead dead dead
dead

verse 2
got bubble wrap around my heart
waiting for my life to start
but every day it never comes
permanently at square one

im so dissatisfied
the weight of an empty life
will lessen in the moonlight
in the light
