im all used up pretty boy
over and over again my nail colors are wearing off
see my hands pretty boy
what do they tell you
cause ive looked down at them not knowing why
and after everythings done and im all undone
you can hear my high heels walking on
clicketyclacking through the night
im carrying my bag of bones

chorus
fluorescent store lights you shine through the night
illuminate my pores and you tear me apart
mercy on me would you please spare me tonight
im tired of this searching would you let me let go

verse 2
i know my room is a mess
over and over again i tell myself ill clean tomorrow
just move the stuff up off the bed
and do what you came here to do
but first open up a window for me
and let the cool air in feel the night slip in
as it softly glides along your back
and i hope you leave right before the sun comes up
so i can watch it alone

fluorescent store lights you shine through the night
illuminate my pores and you tear me apart
mercy on me would you please spare me tonight
im tired of this searching would you let me let go

and i can take a little bit more
