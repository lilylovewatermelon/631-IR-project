im going to build a fire in the middle of july
burn your pictures and go for a drive
down to the river watch the ink from your love letters fade
come back home and turn that old mattress over
pour out the whiskey try waking up sober
gonna change it all tonight gonna do whatever it takes

chorus
yeah cause ive lost weight and ive lost hair
and i dont intend to ever go back there
drinking and a thinking about a love that just wasnt true
theres a good chance ill end up insane
without enough sense to come in from the rain
my mind might be the last thing you make me loose
but ill forget about you

verse 2
i heard that old jones song just the other day
about a man who took a broken heart to his grave
but ill be damned if a memorys going to lay me down
i might be walking around with a head full of air
acting kinda crazy but i dont care
a heart barely beating but ill still be above the ground

chorus
see dierks bentley liveget tickets as low as 25you might also likeoutro
cause ive lost sleep and ive lost years
and there aint no telling how many tears
my minds gonna be the last thing you make me loose
but ill forget about ill forget about you
ill forget about youembed"
