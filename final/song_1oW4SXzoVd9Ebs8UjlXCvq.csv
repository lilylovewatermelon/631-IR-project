its the beat that never stops
in my blood that never flows
theres no substance in my life
its that rush that never dies

verse 2
blood red be cool
ill catch the tears that you fall
distance im feeling
your embrace im needing
baby blue ill miss you
ill count the days till i kiss you
so far and so gone
be the right in my wrong
my wrong

chorus
theres a fire in the sky oh
theres a fire in the sky yeah
theres a fire in the sky oh
theres a fire in the sky yeah

verse 3
something has to change for us to work
cause im inking off your name under my shirt
im in this for the long haul but its dragging me down
i trust youll reconsider coming back to this town
