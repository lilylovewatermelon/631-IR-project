i miss the time you loved me when you actually did
when i was just a wild haired messed up kid
you told me that i smell like pabst and spirits
youd give anything at all to be anywhere near it
you grow so fond of things meant to be free
what if letting go is whats killin me
ive never felt this beat down before
soon as im back up im comin back for more

chorus
and i hope you find whatever it is you need
leave it behind the wreckage of you and me
and i pray you go back to oklahoma
so i can head back home and be the
man thats never known ya

verse 2
well ida moved the mountains roped every damn star
to have the slightest idea who you actually are
one more moment of you layin right here
i wrote you songs that youll never hear
started out feeling like a damn rebirth
til the laughing stops and you lose your worth
you question it all when you lie in your bed
cause you cant take back any love you give
see zach bryan liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likechorus
and i hope you find whatever it is you need
leave it behind the wreckage of you and me
and i pray you go back to oklahoma
so i can head back home and be the
man thats never known ya

well i hope you find whatever it is you need
leave it behind the wreckage of you and me
and i pray you go back to oklahoma
so i can head back home and be the
man thats never known yaembed"
