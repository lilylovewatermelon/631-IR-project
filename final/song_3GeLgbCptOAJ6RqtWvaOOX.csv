i am not a whore
i am not a whore
i am not a whore
i am not a whore
i am not a whore
i am not a whore
but i like to do it
verse 1
most girls i meet are quite savage
always tryin to grab up on my package
they say i look yummy and they want a taste
but im a human not a sandwich
sometimes i feel like ll cool j
i need love not random booty
but every girl i try to get to know
ends up tryin to do me

chorus
i said
i am not a whore
i am not a whore
but i like to do it

verse 2
sometimes i just wanna dance
girl i know you like my style
but get your hand out my pants
you might also likebridge
i am not a whore
no no no
i am not a whore
im not your hoe
i am not a whore
i just love the music
i am not a whore
but i like to do it

chorus
i am not a whore
i am not a whore
i am not a whore
i am not a whore
i am not a whore
i am not a whore
i am not a whore
i am not a whoreembed"
