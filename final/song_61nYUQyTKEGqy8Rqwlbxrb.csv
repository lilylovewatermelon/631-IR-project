my chances werent good she was way out of my reach
how could she ever fall for some ol boy like me
but here she lies asleep tonight in these arms of mine
and that goes to show angels fall sometimes
shes been here long enough to see that im no saint by now
every mornin i wake surprised to find her still around
the love that she give to me could be no truer sign
every now and then angels fall sometimes
she brings pieces of heaven every day into my life
shes been my inspiration with her by my side
im not afraid to dream high
the love that she gives to me could be no truer sign
every now and then angels fall sometimes
yeah i thank the lord angels fall sometimessee josh turner liveget tickets as low as 45you might also likeembed"
