perfect hair to the second power of forever
ask him do he need it hells yeah now or never
on a mission with friends of fair weather
sooner the better off to mt tuna wear your leather prepared sweater
and watch out for catman my brothers
he keep his strand slicked back like scatman crothers
a balding boy sound like janeane garofalo
fiend for a sloppy fro who seen the evil coiffio
not me yo im leavin gone
even if him got them bomb weavin kanekalon
no more or less stress than your old boss
the tears burn your eyes less than fresh scurls sores
and brenda the best girl lost
uncle grandfather bare chest was pearl gloss
earl tossed there goes a whole tray of hamburgers
villain til he old and grey like olden day scam workers
circa one nine seventyone
on the mic machine it seems his work will never be done
he seeks the ninth level of power
but weak geek might freak it in another hour
or so they call the fool retarded hair guy
in school you could spot it when he nodded here why
i think his true name was gerald
the toupee the male pattern anime herald
a good laugh like the walk to the bank
not the plank talk to the hand and the hot frank dog
you might also likeoutro master shake
danger doom its master shake hey buddy
ah did you get those emails i sent
umm im still waitin to hear from you
ii think maybe youre maybe youre in the shower
do you are you in the shower okay
but im still totally i got some other stuff
uhh but im i am committed more to doing yours
so if you can let me know today

for to do the rap pizzle
and again im really sorry about that other one
the call meatwad sucks
