im a bldoubleod
been on songs with sndoubleop
inside a ferrari with the dre
run up i let it sing like nate dodoubleg
walk through 8 mile gunits on my feet
got a cherry lowrider in the nyc
eve took me to philly never been to the pen
been to uptown with 50 seen niggas in timbs
i done seen young buck scuff air force ones
in cashville but compton is where im from
where its just me my son and my bitch
she graduated when notorious big dropped me  my bitch
she get them birds past i put her in first class
and tell her to carry on that dooney  burke bag
she from grape street she know how to work the mag
and only buy white tees tell em to keep the purple tags
cause the laces in my chucks keep the beef crackin
i lay niggas out like creased khakis
in that gwagon lean like the 23s draggin
i got the whole nyc saggin

chorus nate dogg
