when i get

when i get close to something beautiful
then i feel low because i know ill never have it for too long
ive been every where
im like an institution
i fell down upon myself
just to pray for sweet solution
if i fall
fall

when i get home i swear im going to change my ways
and ill stop dancing and never let it living up these days
i say all the words but lack a real solution
i tell all of my friends to stick around and see whos right
and if i fall
fall
help me if i fall

help me if i fall
dont let me go
you got to give me the strength that got me
to get me by to get me high
to help me take over this city
well let it go
darling let it go
dont let it go
oh no dont let it
