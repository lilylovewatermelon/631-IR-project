12SrxWPMtpQad1TO36hfRF,Under Suspicion - Single Edit,Bonnie Tyler,0VJI3wpebzRyVHq0eZQidb,"1 contributorthe good soldier chap 14 lyricsso began those nine years of uninterrupted tranquillity they were characterized by an extraordinary want of any communicativeness on the part of the ashburnhams to which we on our part replied by leaving out quite as extraordinarily and nearly as completely the personal note indeed you may take it that what characterized our relationship was an atmosphere of taking everything for granted the given proposition was that we were all “good people” we took for granted that we all liked beef underdone but not too underdone that both men preferred a good liqueur brandy after lunch that both women drank a very light rhine wine qualified with fachingen water—that sort of thing it was also taken for granted that we were both sufficiently well off to afford anything that we could reasonably want in the way of amusements fitting to our station—that we could take motor cars and carriages by the day that we could give each other dinners and dine our friends and we could indulge if we liked in economy thus florence was in the habit of having the daily telegraph sent to her every day from london she was always an anglomaniac was florence the paris edition of the new york herald was always good enough for me but when we discovered that the ashburnhams copy of the london paper followed them from england leonora and florence decided between them to suppress one subscription one year and the other the next similarly it was the habit of the grand duke of nassau schwerin who came yearly to the baths to dine once with about eighteen families of regular kur guests in return he would give a dinner of all the eighteen at once and since these dinners were rather expensive you had to take the grand duke and a good many of his suite and any members of the diplomatic bodies that might be there—florence and leonora putting their heads together didnt see why we shouldnt give the grand duke his dinner together and so we did i dont suppose the serenity minded that economy or even noticed it at any rate our joint dinner to the royal personage gradually assumed the aspect of a yearly function indeed it grew larger and larger until it became a sort of closing function for the season at any rate as far as we were concerned i dont in the least mean to say that we were the sort of persons who aspired to mix “with royalty” we didnt we hadnt any claims we were just “good people” but the grand duke was a pleasant affable sort of royalty like the late king edward vii and it was pleasant to hear him talk about the races and very occasionally as a bonne bouche about his nephew the emperor or to have him pause for a moment in his walk to ask after the progress of our cures or to be benignantly interested in the amount of money we had put on lelöffels hunter for the frankfurt welter stakes

but upon my word i dont know how we put in our time how does one put in ones time how is it possible to have achieved nine years and to have nothing whatever to show for it nothing whatever you understand not so much as a bone penholder carved to resemble a chessman and with a hole in the top through which you could see four views of nauheim and as for experience as for knowledge of ones fellow beings—nothing either upon my word i couldnt tell you offhand whether the lady who sold the so expensive violets at the bottom of the road that leads to the station was cheating me or no i cant say whether the porter who carried our traps across the station at leghorn was a thief or no when he said that the regular tariff was a lira a parcel the instances of honesty that one comes across in this world are just as amazing as the instances of dishonesty after fortyfive years of mixing with ones kind one ought to have acquired the habit of being able to know something about ones fellow beings but one doesnt

i think the modern civilized habit—the modern english habit of taking every one for granted—is a good deal to blame for this i have observed this matter long enough to know the queer subtle thing that it is to know how the faculty for what it is worth never lets you down

mind i am not saying that this is not the most desirable type of life in the world that it is not an almost unreasonably high standard for it is really nauseating when you detest it to have to eat every day several slices of thin tepid pink india rubber and it is disagreeable to have to drink brandy when you would prefer to be cheered up by warm sweet kümmel and it is nasty to have to take a cold bath in the morning when what you want is really a hot one at night and it stirs a little of the faith of your fathers that is deep down within you to have to have it taken for granted that you are an episcopalian when really you are an oldfashioned philadelphia quaker

but these things have to be done it is the cock that the whole of this society owes to æsculapius

and the odd queer thing is that the whole collection of rules applies to anybody—to the anybodies that you meet in hotels in railway trains to a less degree perhaps in steamers but even in the end upon steamers you meet a man or a woman and from tiny and intimate sounds from the slightest of movements you know at once whether you are concerned with good people or with those who wont do you know this is to say whether they will go rigidly through with the whole programme from the underdone beef to the anglicanism it wont matter whether they be short or tall whether the voice squeak like a marionette or rumble like a town bulls it wont matter whether they are germans austrians french spanish or even brazilians—they will be the germans or brazilians who take a cold bath every morning and who move roughly speaking in diplomatic circles

but the inconvenient—well hang it all i will say it—the damnable nuisance of the whole thing is that with all the taking for granted you never really get an inch deeper than the things i have catalogued

i can give you a rather extraordinary instance of this i cant remember whether it was in our first year—the first year of us four at nauheim because of course it would have been the fourth year of florence and myself—but it must have been in the first or second year and that gives the measure at once of the extraordinariness of our discussion and of the swiftness with which intimacy had grown up between us on the one hand we seemed to start out on the expedition so naturally and with so little preparation that it was as if we must have made many such excursions before and our intimacy seemed so deep

yet the place to which we went was obviously one to which florence at least would have wanted to take us quite early so that you would almost think we should have gone there together at the beginning of our intimacy florence was singularly expert as a guide to archaeological expeditions and there was nothing she liked so much as taking people round ruins and showing you the window from which some one looked down upon the murder of some one else she only did it once but she did it quite magnificently she could find her way with the sole help of baedeker as easily about any old monument as she could about any american city where the blocks are all square and the streets all numbered so that you can go perfectly easily from twentyfourth to thirtieth

now it happens that fifty minutes away from nauheim by a good train is the ancient city of m—— upon a great pinnacle of basalt girt with a triple road running sideways up its shoulder like a scarf and at the top there is a castle—not a square castle like windsor but a castle all slate gables and high peaks with gilt weathercocks flashing bravely—the castle of st elizabeth of hungary it has the disadvantage of being in prussia and it is always disagreeable to go into that country but it is very old and there are many doublespired churches and it stands up like a pyramid out of the green valley of the lahn i dont suppose the ashburnhams wanted especially to go there and i didnt especially want to go there myself but you understand there was no objection it was part of the cure to make an excursion three or four times a week so that we were all quite unanimous in being grateful to florence for providing the motive power florence of course had a motive of her own she was at that time engaged in educating captain ashburnham—oh of course quite pour le bon motif she used to say to leonora “i simply cant understand how you can let him live by your side and be so ignorant” leonora herself always struck me as being remarkably well educated at any rate she knew beforehand all that florence had to tell her perhaps she got it up out of baedeker before florence was up in the morning i dont mean to say that you would ever have known that leonora knew anything but if florence started to tell us how ludwig the courageous wanted to have three wives at once—in which he differed from henry viii who wanted them one after the other and this caused a good deal of trouble—if florence started to tell us this leonora would just nod her head in a way that quite pleasantly rattled my poor wife

she used to exclaim “well if you knew it why havent you told it all already to captain ashburnham im sure he finds it interesting” and leonora would look reflectively at her husband and say “i have an idea that it might injure his hand—the hand you know used in connection with horses mouths” and poor ashburnham would blush and mutter and would say “thats all right dont you bother about me”

i fancy his wifes irony did quite alarm poor teddy because one evening he asked me seriously in the smokingroom if i thought that having too much in ones head would really interfere with ones quickness in polo it struck him he said that brainy johnnies generally were rather muffs when they got on to four legs i reassured him as best i could i told him that he wasnt likely to take in enough to upset his balance at that time the captain was quite evidently enjoying being educated by florence she used to do it about three or four times a week under the approving eyes of leonora and myself it wasnt you understand systematic it came in bursts it was florence clearing up one of the dark places of the earth leaving the world a little lighter than she had found it she would tell him the story of hamlet explain the form of a symphony humming the first and second subjects to him and so on she would explain to him the difference between arminians and erastians or she would give him a short lecture on the early history of the united states and it was done in a way well calculated to arrest a young attention did you ever read mrs markham well it was like that 

but our excursion to m—— was a much larger a much more full dress affair you see in the archives of the schloss in that city there was a document which florence thought would finally give her the chance to educate the whole lot of us together it really worried poor florence that she couldnt in matters of culture ever get the better of leonora i dont know what leonora knew or what she didnt know but certainly she was always there whenever florence brought out any information and she gave somehow the impression of really knowing what poor florence gave the impression of having only picked up i cant exactly define it it was almost something physical have you ever seen a retriever dashing in play after a greyhound you see the two running over a green field almost side by side and suddenly the retriever makes a friendly snap at the other and the greyhound simply isnt there you havent observed it quicken its speed or strain a limb but there it is just two yards in front of the retrievers outstretched muzzle so it was with florence and leonora in matters of culture
but on this occasion i knew that something was up i found florence some days before reading books like rankes history of the popes symonds renaissance motleys rise of the dutch republic and luthers table talk

i must say that until the astonishment came i got nothing but pleasure out of the little expedition i like catching the twoforty i like the slow smooth roll of the great big trains—and they are the best trains in the world i like being drawn through the green country and looking at it through the clear glass of the great windows though of course the country isnt really green the sun shines the earth is blood red and purple and red and green and red and the oxen in the ploughlands are bright varnished brown and black and blackish purple and the peasants are dressed in the black and white of magpies and there are great rocks of magpies too or the peasants dresses in another field where there are little mounds of hay that will be greygreen on the sunny side and purple in the shadows—the peasants dresses are vermilion with emerald green ribbons and purple skirts and white shirts and black velvet stomachers still the impression is that you are drawn through brilliant green meadows that run away on each side to the dark purple firwoods the basalt pinnacles the immense forests and there is meadowsweet at the edge of the streams and cattle why i remember on that afternoon i saw a brown cow hitch its horns under the stomach of a black and white animal and the black and white one was thrown right into the middle of a narrow stream i burst out laughing but florence was imparting information so hard and leonora was listening so intently that no one noticed me as for me i was pleased to be off duty i was pleased to think that florence for the moment was indubitably out of mischief—because she was talking about ludwig the courageous i think it was ludwig the courageous but i am not an historian about ludwig the courageous of hessen who wanted to have three wives at once and patronized luther—something like that—i was so relieved to be off duty because she couldnt possibly be doing anything to excite herself or set her poor heart afluttering—that the incident of the cow was a real joy to me i chuckled over it from time to time for the whole rest of the day because it does look very funny you know to see a black and white cow land on its back in the middle of a stream it is so just exactly what one doesnt expect of a cow

i suppose i ought to have pitied the poor animal but i just didnt i was out for enjoyment and i just enjoyed myself it is so pleasant to be drawn along in front of the spectacular towns with the peaked castles and the many double spires in the sunlight gleams come from the city—gleams from the glass of windows from the gilt signs of apothecaries from the ensigns of the student corps high up in the mountains from the helmets of the funny little soldiers moving their stiff little legs in white linen trousers and it was pleasant to get out in the great big spectacular prussian station with the hammered bronze ornaments and the paintings of peasants and flowers and cows and to hear florence bargain energetically with the driver of an ancient droschka drawn by two lean horses of course i spoke german much more correctly than florence though i never could rid myself quite of the accent of the pennsylvania duitsch of my childhood anyhow we were drawn in a sort of triumph for five marks without any trinkgeld right up to the castle and we were taken through the museum and saw the firebacks the old glass the old swords and the antique contraptions and we went up winding corkscrew staircases and through the rittersaal the great painted hall where the reformer and his friends met for the first time under the protection of the gentleman that had three wives at once and formed an alliance with the gentleman that had six wives one after the other im not really interested in these facts but they have a bearing on my story and we went through chapels and music rooms right up immensely high in the air to a large old chamber full of presses with heavilyshuttered windows all round and florence became positively electric she told the tired bored custodian what shutters to open so that the bright sunlight streamed in palpable shafts into the dim old chamber she explained that this was luthers bedroom and that just where the sunlight fell had stood his bed as a matter of fact i believe that she was wrong and that luther only stopped as it were for lunch in order to evade pursuit but no doubt it would have been his bedroom if he could have been persuaded to stop the night and then in spite of the protest of the custodian she threw open another shutter and came tripping back to a large glass case

“and there” she exclaimed with an accent of gaiety of triumph and of audacity she was pointing at a piece of paper like the halfsheet of a letter with some faint pencil scrawls that might have been a jotting of the amounts we were spending during the day and i was extremely happy at her gaiety in her triumph in her audacity captain ashburnham had his hands upon the glass case “there it is—the protest” and then as we all properly stagemanaged our bewilderment she continued “dont you know that is why we were all called protestants that is the pencil draft of the protest they drew up you can see the signatures of martin luther and martin bucer and zwingli and ludwig the courageous”

i may have got some of the names wrong but i know that luther and bucer were there and her animation continued and i was glad she was better and she was out of mischief she continued looking up into captain ashburnhams eyes “its because of that piece of paper that youre honest sober industrious provident and cleanlived if it werent for that piece of paper youd be like the irish or the italians or the poles but particularly the irish”

and she laid one finger upon captain ashburnhams wrist

i was aware of something treacherous something frightful something evil in the day i cant define it and cant find a simile for it it wasnt as if a snake had looked out of a hole no it was as if my heart had missed a beat it was as if we were going to run and cry out all four of us in separate directions averting our heads in ashburnhams face i know that there was absolute panic i was horribly frightened and then i discovered that the pain in my left wrist was caused by leonoras clutching it

“i cant stand this” she said with a most extraordinary passion “i must get out of this” i was horribly frightened it came to me for a moment though i hadnt time to think it that she must be a madly jealous woman—jealous of florence and captain ashburnham of all people in the world and it was a panic in which we fled we went right down the winding stairs across the immense rittersaal to a little terrace that overlooks the lahn the broad valley and the immense plain into which it opens out

“dont you see” she said “dont you see whats going on” the panic again stopped my heart i muttered i stuttered—i dont know how i got the words out

“no whats the matter whatevers the matter”

she looked me straight in the eyes and for a moment i had the feeling that those two blue discs were immense were overwhelming were like a wall of blue that shut me off from the rest of the world i know it sounds absurd but that is what it did feel like

“dont you see” she said with a really horrible bitterness with a really horrible lamentation in her voice “dont you see that thats the cause of the whole miserable affair of the whole sorrow of the world and of the eternal damnation of you and me and them ”

i dont remember how she went on i was too frightened i was too amazed i think i was thinking of running to fetch assistance—a doctor perhaps or captain ashburnham or possibly she needed florences tender care though of course it would have been very bad for florences heart but i know that when i came out of it she was saying “oh where are all the bright happy innocent beings in the world wheres happiness one reads of it in books”
she ran her hand with a singular clawing motion upwards over her forehead her eyes were enormously distended her face was exactly that of a person looking into the pit of hell and seeing horrors there and then suddenly she stopped she was most amazingly just mrs ashburnham again her face was perfectly clear sharp and defined her hair was glorious in its golden coils her nostrils twitched with a sort of contempt she appeared to look with interest at a gypsy caravan that was coming over a little bridge far below us

“dont you know” she said in her clear hard voice “dont you know that im an irish catholic”

v those words gave me the greatest relief that i have ever had in my life they told me i think almost more than i have ever gathered at any one moment—about myself i dont think that before that day i had ever wanted anything very much except florence i have of course had appetites impatiences why sometimes at a table dhôte when there would be say caviare handed round i have been absolutely full of impatience for fear that when the dish came to me there should not be a satisfying portion left over by the other guests i have been exceedingly impatient at missing trains the belgian state railway has a trick of letting the french trains miss their connections at brussels that has always infuriated me i have written about it letters to the times that the times never printed those that i wrote to the paris edition of the new york herald were always printed but they never seemed to satisfy me when i saw them well that was a sort of frenzy with me

it was a frenzy that now i can hardly realize i can understand it intellectually you see in those days i was interested in people with “hearts” there was florence there was edward ashburnham—or perhaps it was leonora that i was more interested in i dont mean in the way of love but you see we were both of the same profession—at any rate as i saw it and the profession was that of keeping heart patients alive

you have no idea how engrossing such a profession may become just as the blacksmith says “by hammer and hand all art doth stand” just as the baker thinks that all the solar system revolves around his morning delivery of rolls as the postmastergeneral believes that he alone is the preserver of society—and surely surely these delusions are necessary to keep us going—so did i and as i believed leonora imagine that the whole world ought to be arranged so as to ensure the keeping alive of heart patients you have no idea how engrossing such a profession may become—how imbecile in view of that engrossment appear the ways of princes of republics of municipalities a rough bit of road beneath the motor tyres a couple of succeeding “thankeemarms” with their quick jolts would be enough to set me grumbling to leonora against the prince or the grand duke or the free city through whose territory we might be passing i would grumble like a stockbroker whose conversations over the telephone are incommoded by the ringing of bells from a city church i would talk about medieval survivals about the taxes being surely high enough the point by the way about the missing of the connections of the calais boat trains at brussels was that the shortest possible sea journey is frequently of great importance to sufferers from the heart now on the continent there are two special heart cure places nauheim and spa and to reach both of these baths from england if in order to ensure a short sea passage you come by calais—you have to make the connection at brussels and the belgian train never waits by so much the shade of a second for the one coming from calais or from paris and even if the french train are just on time you have to run—imagine a heart patient running—along the unfamiliar ways of the brussels station and to scramble up the high steps of the moving train or if you miss connection you have to wait five or six hours i used to keep awake whole nights cursing that abuse my wife used to run—she never in whatever else she may have misled me tried to give me the impression that she was not a gallant soul but once in the german express she would lean back with one hand to her side and her eyes closed well she was a good actress and i would be in hell in hell i tell you for in florence i had at once a wife and an unattained mistress—that is what it comes to—and in the retaining of her in this world i had my occupation my career my ambition it is not often that these things are united in one body leonora was a good actress too by jove she was good i tell you she would listen to me by the hour evolving my plans for a shockproof world it is true that at times i used to notice about her an air of inattention as if she were listening a mother to the child at her knee or as if precisely i were myself the patient

you understand that there was nothing the matter with edward ashburnhams heart—that he had thrown up his commission and had left india and come half the world over in order to follow a woman who had really had a “heart” to nauheim that was the sort of sentimental ass he was for you understand too that they really needed to live in india to economize to let the house at branshaw teleragh

of course at that date i had never heard of the kilsyte case ashburnham had you know kissed a servant girl in a railway train and it was only the grace of god the prompt functioning of the communication cord and the ready sympathy of what i believe you call the hampshire bench that kept the poor devil out of winchester gaol for years and years i never heard of that case until the final stages of leonoras revelations

but just think of that poor wretch i who have surely the right beg you to think of that poor wretch is it possible that such a luckless devil should be so tormented by blind and inscrutable destiny for there is no other way to think of it none i have the right to say it since for years he was my wifes lover since he killed her since he broke up all the pleasantnesses that there were in my life there is no priest that has the right to tell me that i must not ask pity for him from you silent listener beyond the hearthstone from the world or from the god who created in him those desires those madnesses

of course i should not hear of the kilsyte case i knew none of their friends they were for me just good people—fortunate people with broad and sunny acres in a southern county just good people by heavens i sometimes think that it would have been better for him poor dear if the case had been such a one that i must needs have heard of it—such a one as maids and couriers and other kur guests whisper about for years after until gradually it dies away in the pity that there is knocking about here and there in the world supposing he had spent his seven years in winchester gaol or whatever it is that inscrutable and blind justice allots to you for following your natural but illtimed inclinations—there would have arrived a stage when nodding gossips on the kursaal terrace would have said “poor fellow” thinking of his ruined career he would have been the fine soldier with his back now bent better for him poor devil if his back had been prematurely bent

why it would have been a thousand times better for of course the kilsyte case which came at the very beginning of his finding leonora cold and unsympathetic gave him a nasty jar he left servants alone after that

it turned him naturally all the more loose amongst women of his own class why leonora told me that mrs maidan—the woman he followed from burma to nauheim—assured her he awakened her attention by swearing that when he kissed the servant in the train he was driven to it i daresay he was driven to it by the mad passion to find an ultimately satisfying woman i daresay he was sincere enough heaven help me i daresay he was sincere enough in his love for mrs maidan she was a nice little thing a dear little dark woman with long lashes of whom florence grew quite fond she had a lisp and a happy smile we saw plenty of her for the first month of our acquaintance then she died quite quietly—of heart trouble

but you know poor little mrs maidan—she was so gentle so young she cannot have been more than twentythree and she had a boy husband out in chitral not more than twentyfour i believe such young things ought to have been left alone of course ashburnham could not leave her alone i do not believe that he could why even i at this distance of time am aware that i am a little in love with her memory i cant help smiling when i think suddenly of her—as you might at the thought of something wrapped carefully away in lavender in some drawer in some old house that you have long left she was so—so submissive why even to me she had the air of being submissive—to me that not the youngest child will ever pay heed to yes this is the saddest story

no i cannot help wishing that florence had left her alone—with her playing with adultery i suppose it was though she was such a child that one has the impression that she would hardly have known how to spell such a word no it was just submissiveness—to the importunities to the tempestuous forces that pushed that miserable fellow on to ruin and i do not suppose that florence really made much difference if it had not been for her that ashburnham left his allegiance for mrs maidan then it would have been some other woman but still i do not know perhaps the poor young thing would have died—she was bound to die anyhow quite soon—but she would have died without having to soak her noonday pillow with tears whilst florence below the window talked to captain ashburnham about the constitution of the united states yes it would have left a better taste in the mouth if florence had let her die in peace
leonora behaved better in a sense she just boxed mrs maidans ears—yes she hit her in an uncontrollable access of rage a hard blow on the side of the cheek in the corridor of the hotel outside edwards rooms it was that you know that accounted for the sudden odd intimacy that sprang up between florence and mrs ashburnham because it was of course an odd intimacy if you look at it from the outside nothing could have been more unlikely than that leonora who is the proudest creature on gods earth would have struck up an acquaintanceship with two casual yankees whom she could not really have regarded as being much more than a carpet beneath her feet you may ask what she had to be proud of well she was a powys married to an ashburnham—i suppose that gave her the right to despise casual americans as long as she did it unostentatiously i dont know what anyone has to be proud of she might have taken pride in her patience in her keeping her husband out of the bankruptcy court perhaps she did

at any rate that was how florence got to know her she came round a screen at the corner of the hotel corridor and found leonora with the gold key that hung from her wrist caught in mrs maidans hair just before dinner there was not a single word spoken little mrs maidan was very pale with a red mark down her left cheek and the key would not come out of her black hair it was florence who had to disentangle it for leonora was in such a state that she could not have brought herself to touch mrs maidan without growing sick

and there was not a word spoken you see under those four eyes—her own and mrs maidans—leonora could just let herself go as far as to box mrs maidans ears but the moment a stranger came along she pulled herself wonderfully up she was at first silent and then the moment the key was disengaged by florence she was in a state to say “so awkward of me i was just trying to put the comb straight in mrs maidans hair”

mrs maidan however was not a powys married to an ashburnham she was a poor little oflaherty whose husband was a boy of country parsonage origin so there was no mistaking the sob she let go as she went desolately away along the corridor but leonora was still going to play up she opened the door of ashburnhams room quite ostentatiously so that florence should hear her address edward in terms of intimacy and liking “edward” she called but there was no edward there

you understand that there was no edward there it was then for the only time of her career that leonora really compromised herself—she exclaimed “how frightful poor little maisie”

she caught herself up at that but of course it was too late it was a queer sort of affair

i want to do leonora every justice i love her very dearly for one thing and in this matter which was certainly the ruin of my small household cockleshell she certainly tripped up i do not believe—and leonora herself does not believe—that poor little maisie maidan was ever edwards mistress her heart was really so bad that she would have succumbed to anything like an impassioned embrace that is the plain english of it and i suppose plain english is best she was really what the other two for reasons of their own just pretended to be queer isnt it like one of those sinister jokes that providence plays upon one add to this that i do not suppose that leonora would much have minded at any other moment if mrs maidan had been her husbands mistress it might have been a relief from edwards sentimental gurglings over the lady and from the ladys submissive acceptance of those sounds no she would not have minded

but in boxing mrs maidans ears leonora was just striking the face of an intolerable universe for that afternoon she had had a frightfully painful scene with edward

as far as his letters went she claimed the right to open them when she chose she arrogated to herself the right because edwards affairs were in such a frightful state and he lied so about them that she claimed the privilege of having his secrets at her disposal there was not indeed any other way for the poor fool was too ashamed of his lapses ever to make a clean breast of anything she had to drag these things out of him

it must have been a pretty elevating job for her but that afternoon edward being on his bed for the hour and a half prescribed by the kur authorities she had opened a letter that she took to come from a colonel hervey they were going to stay with him in linlithgowshire for the month of september and she did not know whether the date fixed would be the eleventh or the eighteenth the address on this letter was in handwriting as like colonel herveys as one blade of corn is like another so she had at the moment no idea of spying on him

but she certainly was for she discovered that edward ashburnham was paying a blackmailer of whom she had never heard something like three hundred pounds a year it was a devil of a blow it was like death for she imagined that by that time she had really got to the bottom of her husbands liabilities you see they were pretty heavy what had really smashed them up had been a perfectly commonplace affair at monte carlo—an affair with a cosmopolitan harpy who passed for the mistress of a russian grand duke she exacted a twenty thousand pound pearl tiara from him as the price of her favours for a week or so it would have pipped him a good deal to have found so much and he was not in the ordinary way a gambler he might indeed just have found the twenty thousand and the not slight charges of a week at an hotel with the fair creature he must have been worth at that date five hundred thousand dollars and a little over well he must needs go to the tables and lose forty thousand pounds forty thousand solid pounds borrowed from sharks and even after that he must—it was an imperative passion—enjoy the favours of the lady he got them of course when it was a matter of solid bargaining for far less than twenty thousand as he might no doubt have done from the first i daresay ten thousand dollars covered the bill anyhow there was a pretty solid hole in a fortune of a hundred thousand pounds or so and leonora had to fix things up he would have run from moneylender to moneylender and that was quite in the early days of her discovery of his infidelities—if you like to call them infidelities and she discovered that one from public sources god knows what would have happened if she had not discovered it from public sources i suppose he would have concealed it from her until they were penniless but she was able by the grace of god to get hold of the actual lenders of the money to learn the exact sums that were needed and she went off to england

yes she went right off to england to her attorney and his while he was still in the arms of his circe—at antibes to which place they had retired he got sick of the lady quite quickly but not before leonora had had such lessons in the art of business from her attorney that she had her plan as clearly drawn up as was ever that of general trochu for keeping the prussians out of paris in 1870 it was about as effectual at first or it seemed so

that would have been you know in 1895 about nine years before the date of which i am talking—the date of florences getting her hold over leonora for that was what it amounted to well mrs ashburnham had simply forced edward to settle all his property upon her she could force him to do anything in his clumsy goodnatured inarticulate way he was as frightened of her as of the devil and he admired her enormously and he was as fond of her as any man could be of any woman she took advantage of it to treat him as if he had been a person whose estates are being managed by the court of bankruptcy i suppose it was the best thing for him

anyhow she had no end of a job for the first three years or so unexpected liabilities kept on cropping up—and that afflicted fool did not make it any easier you see along with the passion of the chase went a frame of mind that made him be extraordinarily ashamed of himself you may not believe it but he really had such a sort of respect for the chastity of leonoras imagination that he hated—he was positively revolted at the thought that she should know that the sort of thing that he did existed in the world so he would stick out in an agitated way against the accusation of ever having done anything he wanted to preserve the virginity of his wifes thoughts he told me that himself during the long walks we had at the last—while the girl was on the way to brindisi

so of course for those three years or so leonora had many agitations and it was then that they really quarrelled

yes they quarrelled bitterly that seems rather extravagant you might have thought that leonora would be just calmly loathing and he lachrymosely contrite but that was not it a bit along with edwards passions and his shame for them went the violent conviction of the duties of his station—a conviction that was quite unreasonably expensive i trust i have not in talking of his liabilities given the impression that poor edward was a promiscuous libertine he was not he was a sentimentalist the servant girl in the kilsyte case had been pretty but mournful of appearance i think that when he had kissed her he had desired rather to comfort her and if she had succumbed to his blandishments i daresay he would have set her up in a little house in portsmouth or winchester and would have been faithful to her for four or five years he was quite capable of that

no the only two of his affairs of the heart that cost him money were that of the grand dukes mistress and that which was the subject of the blackmailing letter that leonora opened that had been a quite passionate affair with quite a nice woman it had succeeded the one with the grand ducal lady the lady was the wife of a brother officer and leonora had known all about the passion which had been quite a real passion and had lasted for several years you see poor edwards passions were quite logical in their progression upwards they began with a servant went on to a courtesan and then to a quite nice woman very unsuitably mated for she had a quite nasty husband who by means of letters and things went on blackmailing poor edward to the tune of three or four hundred a year—with threats of the divorce court and after this lady came maisie maidan and after poor maisie only one more affair and then—the real passion of his life his marriage with leonora had been arranged by his parents and though he always admired her immensely he had hardly ever pretended to be much more than tender to her though he desperately needed her moral support too

but his really trying liabilities were mostly in the nature of generosities proper to his station he was according to leonora always remitting his tenants rents and giving the tenants to understand that the reduction would be permanent he was always redeeming drunkards who came before his magisterial bench he was always trying to put prostitutes into respectable places—and he was a perfect maniac about children i dont know how many illused people he did not pick up and provide with careers—leonora has told me but i daresay she exaggerated and the figure seems so preposterous that i will not put it down all these things and the continuance of them seemed to him to be his duty—along with impossible subscriptions to hospitals and boy scouts and to provide prizes at cattle shows and antivivisection societies

well leonora saw to it that most of these things were not continued they could not possibly keep up branshaw manor at that rate after the money had gone to the grand dukes mistress she put the rents back at their old figures discharged the drunkards from their homes and sent all the societies notice that they were to expect no more subscriptions to the children she was more tender nearly all of them she supported till the age of apprenticeship or domestic service you see she was childless herself

she was childless herself and she considered herself to be to blame she had come of a penniless branch of the powys family and they had forced upon her poor dear edward without making the stipulation that the children should be brought up as catholics and that of course was spiritual death to leonora i have given you a wrong impression if i have not made you see that leonora was a woman of a strong cold conscience like all english catholics i cannot myself help disliking this religion there is always at the bottom of my mind in spite of leonora the feeling of shuddering at the scarlet woman that filtered in upon me in the tranquility of the little old friends meeting house in arch street philadelphia so i do set down a good deal of leonoras mismanagement of poor dear edwards case to the peculiarly english form of her religion because of course the only thing to have done for edward would have been to let him sink down until he became a tramp of gentlemanly address having maybe chance love affairs upon the highways he would have done so much less harm he would have been much less agonized too at any rate he would have had fewer chances of ruining and of remorse for edward was great at remorse but leonoras english catholic conscience her rigid principles her coldness even her very patience were i cannot help thinking all wrong in this special case she quite seriously and naïvely imagined that the church of rome disapproves of divorce she quite seriously and naïvely believed that her church could be such a monstrous and imbecile institution as to expect her to take on the impossible job of making edward ashburnham a faithful husband she had as the english would say the nonconformist temperament in the united states of north america we call it the new england conscience for of course that frame of mind has been driven in on the english catholics the centuries that they have gone through—centuries of blind and malignant oppression of ostracism from public employment of being as it were a small beleagured garrison in a hostile country and therefore having to act with great formality—all these things have combined to perform that conjuring trick and i suppose that papists in england are even technically nonconformists

continental papists are a dirty jovial and unscrupulous crew but that at least lets them be opportunists they would have fixed poor dear edward up all right forgive my writing of these monstrous things in this frivolous manner if i did not i should break down and cry in milan say or in paris leonora would have had her marriage dissolved in six months for two hundred dollars paid in the right quarter and edward would have drifted about until he became a tramp of the kind i have suggested or he would have married a barmaid who would have made him such frightful scenes in public places and would so have torn out his moustache and left visible signs upon his face that he would have been faithful to her for the rest of his days that was what he wanted to redeem him

for along with his passions and his shames there went the dread of scenes in public places of outcry of excited physical violence of publicity in short yes the barmaid would have cured him and it would have been all the better if she drank he would have been kept busy looking after her

i know that i am right in this i know it because of the kilsyte case you see the servant girl that he then kissed was nurse in the family of the nonconformist head of the county—whatever that post may be called and that gentleman was so determined to ruin edward who was the chairman of the tory caucus or whatever it is—that the poor dear sufferer had the very devil of a time they asked questions about it in the house of commons they tried to get the hampshire magistrates degraded they suggested to the war ministry that edward was not the proper person to hold the kings commission yes he got it hot and strong

the result you have heard he was completely cured of philandering amongst the lower classes and that seemed a real blessing to leonora it did not revolt her so much to be connected—it is a sort of connection—with people like mrs maidan instead of with a little kitchenmaid

in a dim sort of way leonora was almost contented when she arrived at nauheim that evening

she had got things nearly straight by the long years of scraping in little stations in chitral and burma—stations where living is cheap in comparison with the life of a county magnate and where moreover liaisons of one sort or another are normal and inexpensive too so that when mrs maidan came along—and the maidan affair might have caused trouble out there because of the youth of the husband—leonora had just resigned herself to coming home with pushing and scraping and with letting branshaw teleragh and with selling a picture and a relic of charles i or so had got—and poor dear she had never had a really decent dress to her back in all those years and years—she had got as she imagined her poor dear husband back into much the same financial position as had been his before the mistress of the grand duke had happened along and of course edward himself had helped her a little on the financial side he was a fellow that many men liked he was so presentable and quite ready to lend you his cigar puncher—that sort of thing so every now and then some financier whom he met about would give him a good sound profitable tip and leonora was never afraid of a bit of a gamble—english papists seldom are i do not know why

so nearly all her investment turned up trumps and edward was really in fit case to reopen branshaw manor and once more to assume his position in the county thus leonora had accepted maisie maidan almost with resignation—almost with a sigh of relief she really liked the poor child—she had to like somebody and at any rate she felt she could trust maisie—she could trust her not to rook edward for several thousands a week for maisie had refused to accept so much as a trinket ring from him it is true that edward gurgled and raved about the girl in a way that she had never yet experienced but that too was almost a relief i think she would really have welcomed it if he could have come across the love of his life it would have given her a rest

and there could not have been anyone better than poor little mrs maidan she was so ill she could not want to be taken on expensive jaunts it was leonora herself who paid maisies expenses to nauheim she handed over the money to the boy husband for maisie would never have allowed it but the husband was in agonies of fear poor devil

i fancy that on the voyage from india leonora was as happy as ever she had been in her life edward was wrapped up completely in his girl—he was almost like a father with a child trotting about with rugs and physic and things from deck to deck he behaved however with great circumspection so that nothing leaked through to the other passengers and leonora had almost attained to the attitude of a mother towards mrs maidan so it had looked very well—the benevolent wealthy couple of good people acting as saviours to the poor darkeyed dying young thing and that attitude of leonoras towards mrs maidan no doubt partly accounted for the smack in the face she was hitting a naughty child who had been stealing chocolates at an inopportune moment it was certainly an inopportune moment for with the opening of that blackmailing letter from that injured brother officer all the old terrors had redescended upon leonora her road had again seemed to stretch out endless she imagined that there might be hundreds and hundreds of such things that edward was concealing from her—that they might necessitate more mortgagings more pawnings of bracelets more and always more horrors she had spent an excruciating afternoon the matter was one of a divorce case of course and she wanted to avoid publicity as much as edward did so that she saw the necessity of continuing the payments and she did not so much mind that they could find three hundred a year but it was the horror of there being more such obligations

she had had no conversation with edward for many years—none that went beyond the mere arrangements for taking trains or engaging servants but that afternoon she had to let him have it and he had been just the same as ever it was like opening a book after a decade to find the words the same he had the same motives he had not wished to tell her about the case because he had not wished her to sully her mind with the idea that there was such a thing as a brother officer who could be a blackmailer—and he had wanted to protect the credit of his old light of love that lady was certainly not concerned with her husband and he swore and swore and swore that there was nothing else in the world against him she did not believe him

he had done it once too often—and she was wrong for the first time so that he acted a rather creditable part in the matter for he went right straight out to the postoffice and spent several hours in coding a telegram to his solicitor bidding that hardheaded man to threaten to take out at once a warrant against the fellow who was on his track he said afterwards that it was a bit too thick on poor old leonora to be ballyragged any more that was really the last of his outstanding accounts and he was ready to take his personal chance of the divorce court if the blackmailer turned nasty he would face it out—the publicity the papers the whole bally show those were his simple words

he had made however the mistake of not telling leonora where he was going so that having seen him go to his room to fetch the code for the telegram and seeing two hours later maisie maidan come out of his room leonora imagined that the two hours she had spent in silent agony edward had spent with maisie maidan in his arms that seemed to her to be too much as a matter of fact maisies being in edwards room had been the result partly of poverty partly of pride partly of sheer innocence she could not in the first place afford a maid she refrained as much as possible from sending the hotel servants on errands since every penny was of importance to her and she feared to have to pay high tips at the end of her stay edward had lent her one of his fascinating cases containing fifteen different sizes of scissors and having seen from her window his departure for the postoffice she had taken the opportunity of returning the case she could not see why she should not though she felt a certain remorse at the thought that she had kissed the pillows of his bed that was the way it took her

but leonora could see that without the shadow of a doubt the incident gave florence a hold over her it let florence into things and florence was the only created being who had any idea that the ashburnhams were not just good people with nothing to their tails she determined at once not so much to give florence the privilege of her intimacy—which would have been the payment of a kind of blackmail—as to keep florence under observation until she could have demonstrated to florence that she was not in the least jealous of poor maisie so that was why she had entered the diningroom arm in arm with my wife and why she had so markedly planted herself at our table she never left us indeed for a minute that night except just to run up to mrs maidans room to beg her pardon and to beg her also to let edward take her very markedly out into the gardens that night she said herself when mrs maidan came rather wistfully down into the lounge where we were all sitting “now edward get up and take maisie to the casino i want mrs dowell to tell me all about the families in connecticut who came from fordingbridge” for it had been discovered that florence came of a line that had actually owned branshaw teleragh for two centuries before the ashburnhams came there and there she sat with me in that hall long after florence had gone to bed so that i might witness her gay reception of that pair she could play up

and that enables me to fix exactly the day of our going to the town of m—— for it was the very day poor mrs maidan died we found her dead when we got back—pretty awful that when you come to figure out what it all means
at any rate the measure of my relief when leonora said that she was an irish catholic gives you the measure of my affection for that couple it was an affection so intense that even to this day i cannot think of edward without sighing i do not believe that i could have gone on any more with them i was getting too tired and i verily believe too if my suspicion that leonora was jealous of florence had been the reason she gave for her outburst i should have turned upon florence with the maddest kind of rage jealousy would have been incurable but florences mere silly jibes at the irish and at the catholics could be apologized out of existence and that i appeared to fix up in two minutes or so

she looked at me for a long time rather fixedly and queerly while i was doing it and at last i worked myself up to saying

“do accept the situation i confess that i do not like your religion but i like you so intensely i dont mind saying that i have never had anyone to be really fond of and i do not believe that anyone has ever been fond of me as i believe you really to be”
“oh im fond enough of you” she said “fond enough to say that i wish every man was like you but there are others to be considered” she was thinking as a matter of fact of poor maisie she picked a little piece of pellitory out of the breasthigh wall in front of us she chafed it for a long minute between her finger and thumb then she threw it over the coping

“oh i accept the situation” she said at last “if you can”

vi i remember laughing at the phrase “accept the situation” which she seemed to repeat with a gravity too intense i said to her something like

“its hardly as much as that i mean that i must claim the liberty of a free american citizen to think what i please about your coreligionists and i suppose that florence must have liberty to think what she pleases and to say what politeness allows her to say”
“she had better” leonora answered “not say one single word against my people or my faith” it struck me at the time that there was an unusual an almost threatening hardness in her voice it was almost as if she were trying to convey to florence through me that she would seriously harm my wife if florence went to something that was an extreme yes i remember thinking at the time that it was almost as if leonora were saying through me to florence

“you may outrage me as you will you may take all that i personally possess but do not you care to say one single thing in view of the situation that that will set up—against the faith that makes me become the doormat for your feet”

but obviously as i saw it that could not be her meaning good people be they ever so diverse in creed do not threaten each other so that i read leonoras words to mean just no more than “it would be better if florence said nothing at all against my coreligionists because it is a point that i am touchy about”

that was the hint that accordingly i conveyed to florence when shortly afterwards she and edward came down from the tower and i want you to understand that from that moment until after edward and the girl and florence were all dead together i had never the remotest glimpse not the shadow of a suspicion that there was anything wrong as the saying is for five minutes then i entertained the possibility that leonora might be jealous but there was never another flicker in that flamelike personality how in the world should i get it

for all that time i was just a male sick nurse and what chance had i against those three hardened gamblers who were all in league to conceal their hands from me what earthly chance they were three to one—and they made me happy oh god they made me so happy that i doubt if even paradise that shall smooth out all temporal wrongs shall ever give me the like and what could they have done better or what could they have done that could have been worse i dont know

i suppose that during all that time i was a deceived husband and that leonora was pimping for edward that was the cross that she had to take up during her long calvary of a life

you ask how it feels to be a deceived husband just heavens i do not know it feels just nothing at all it is not hell certainly it is not necessarily heaven so i suppose it is the intermediate stage what do they call it limbo no i feel nothing at all about that they are dead they have gone before their judge who i hope will open to them the springs of his compassion it is not my business to think about it it is simply my business to say as leonoras people say “requiem aeternam dona eis do mine et lux perpetua luceat eis in memoria aeterna erit” but what were they the just the unjust god knows i think that the pair of them were only poor wretches creeping over this earth in the shadow of an eternal wrath it is very terrible

it is almost too terrible the picture of that judgement as it appears to me sometimes at nights it is probably the suggestion of some picture that i have seen somewhere but upon an immense plain suspended in midair i seem to see three figures two of them clasped close in an intense embrace and one intolerably solitary it is in black and white my picture of that judgement an etching perhaps only i cannot tell an etching from a photographic reproduction and the immense plain is the hand of god stretching out for miles and miles with great spaces above it and below it and they are in the sight of god and it is florence that is alone and do you know at the thought of that intense solitude i feel an overwhelming desire to rush forward and comfort her you cannot you see have acted as nurse to a person for twelve years without wishing to go on nursing them even though you hate them with the hatred of the adder and even in the palm of god but in the nights with that vision of judgement before me i know that i hold myself back for i hate florence i hate florence with such a hatred that i would not spare her an eternity of loneliness she need not have done what she did she was an american a new englander she had not the hot passions of these europeans she cut out that poor imbecile of an edward—and i pray god that he is really at peace clasped close in the arms of that poor poor girl and no doubt maisie maidan will find her young husband again and leonora will burn clear and serene a northern light and one of the archangels of god and me well perhaps they will find me an elevator to run but florence 

she should not have done it she should not have done it it was playing it too low down she cut out poor dear edward from sheer vanity she meddled between him and leonora from a sheer imbecile spirit of district visiting do you understand that whilst she was edwards mistress she was perpetually trying to reunite him to his wife she would gabble on to leonora about forgiveness—treating the subject from the bright american point of view and leonora would treat her like the whore she was once she said to florence in the early morning

“you come to me straight out of his bed to tell me that that is my proper place i know it thank you”

but even that could not stop florence she went on saying that it was her ambition to leave this world a little brighter by the passage of her brief life and how thankfully she would leave edward whom she thought she had brought to a right frame of mind if leonora would only give him a chance he needed she said tenderness beyond anything

and leonora would answer—for she put up with this outrage for years—leonora as i understand would answer something like

“yes you would give him up and you would go on writing to each other in secret and committing adultery in hired rooms i know the pair of you you know no i prefer the situation as it is” half the time florence would ignore leonoras remarks she would think they were not quite ladylike the other half of the time she would try to persuade leonora that her love for edward was quite spiritual—on account of her heart once she said

“if you can believe that of maisie maidan as you say you do why cannot you believe it of me” leonora was i understand doing her hair at that time in front of the mirror in her bedroom and she looked round at florence to whom she did not usually vouchsafe a glance—she looked round coolly and calmly and said

“never do you dare to mention mrs maidans name again you murdered her you and i murdered her between us i am as much a scoundrel as you i dont like to be reminded of it”

florence went off at once into a babble of how could she have hurt a person whom she hardly knew a person whom with the best intentions in pursuance of her efforts to leave the world a little brighter she had tried to save from edward that was how she figured it out to herself she really thought that so leonora said patiently

“very well just put it that i killed her and that its a painful subject one does not like to think that one had killed someone naturally not i ought never to have brought her from india” and that indeed is exactly how leonora looked at it it is stated a little baldly but leonora was always a great one for bald statements

what had happened on the day of our jaunt to the ancient city of m—— had been this

leonora who had been even then filled with pity and contrition for the poor child on returning to our hotel had gone straight to mrs maidans room she had wanted just to pet her and she had perceived at first only on the clear round table covered with red velvet a letter addressed to her it ran something like

“oh mrs ashburnham how could you have done it i trusted you so you never talked to me about me and edward but i trusted you how could you buy me from my husband i have just heard how you have—in the hall they were talking about it edward and the american lady you paid the money for me to come here oh how could you how could you i am going straight back to bunny” bunny was mrs maidans husband

and leonora said that as she went on reading the letter she had without looking round her a sense that that hotel room was cleared that there were no papers on the table that there were no clothes on the hooks and that there was a strained silence—a silence she said as if there were something in the room that drank up such sounds as there were she had to fight against that feeling whilst she read the postscript of the letter

“i did not know you wanted me for an adulteress” the postscript began the poor child was hardly literate “it was surely not right of you and i never wanted to be one and i heard edward call me a poor little rat to the american lady he always called me a little rat in private and i did not mind but if he called me it to her i think he does not love me any more oh mrs ashburnham you knew the world and i knew nothing i thought it would be all right if you thought it could and i thought you would not have brought me if you did not too you should not have done it and we out of the same convent”

leonora said that she screamed when she read that

and then she saw that maisies boxes were all packed and she began a search for mrs maidan herself—all over the hotel the manager said that mrs maidan had paid her bill and had gone up to the station to ask the reiseverkehrsbureau to make her out a plan for her immediate return to chitral he imagined that he had seen her come back but he was not quite certain no one in the large hotel had bothered his head about the child and she wandering solitarily in the hall had no doubt sat down beside a screen that had edward and florence on the other side i never heard then or after what had passed between that precious couple i fancy florence was just about beginning her cutting out of poor dear edward by addressing to him some words of friendly warning as to the ravages he might be making in the girls heart that would be the sort of way she would begin and edward would have sentimentally assured her that there was nothing in it that maisie was just a poor little rat whose passage to nauheim his wife had paid out of her own pocket that would have been enough to do the trick

for the trick was pretty efficiently done leonora with panic growing and with contrition very large in her heart visited every one of the public rooms of the hotel—the diningroom the lounge the schreibzimmer the winter garden god knows what they wanted with a winter garden in an hotel that is only open from may till october but there it was and then leonora ran—yes she ran up the stairs—to see if maisie had not returned to her rooms she had determined to take that child right away from that hideous place it seemed to her to be all unspeakable i do not mean to say that she was not quite cool about it leonora was always leonora but the cold justice of the thing demanded that she should play the part of mother to this child who had come from the same convent she figured it out to amount to that she would leave edward to florence and to me—and she would devote all her time to providing that child with an atmosphere of love until she could be returned to her poor young husband it was naturally too late

she had not cared to look round maisies rooms at first now as soon as she came in she perceived sticking out beyond the bed a small pair of feet in highheeled shoes maisie had died in the effort to strap up a great portmanteau she had died so grotesquely that her little body had fallen forward into the trunk and it had closed upon her like the jaws of a gigantic alligator the key was in her hand her dark hair like the hair of a japanese had come down and covered her body and her face

leonora lifted her up—she was the merest featherweight—and laid her on the bed with her hair about her she was smiling as if she had just scored a goal in a hockey match you understand she had not committed suicide her heart had just stopped i saw her with the long lashes on the cheeks with the smile about the lips with the flowers all about her the stem of a white lily rested in her hand so that the spike of flowers was upon her shoulder she looked like a bride in the sunlight of the mortuary candles that were all about her and the white coifs of the two nuns that knelt at her feet with their faces hidden might have been two swans that were to bear her away to kissingkindness land or wherever it is leonora showed her to me she would not let either of the others see her she wanted you know to spare poor dear edwards feelings he never could bear the sight of a corpse and since she never gave him an idea that maisie had written to her he imagined that the death had been the most natural thing in the world he soon got over it indeed it was the one affair of his about which he never felt much remorseembed"
