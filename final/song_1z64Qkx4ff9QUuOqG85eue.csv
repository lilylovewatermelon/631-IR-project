did i
fuck around and drop the top on niggas
when them niggas thought i wouldnt

fuck your bitch or something
what i did to ya why you fronting on me
did i
hit the trap and have it jumping
turning nothing into something
peeling off the corner flexing on them niggas
shawty know a nigga came here from nothing

verse 1
i got the gas on me
being broke was the reason why all of these females would pass on me
now i pull up in that s550 and i dash on em
and you know i dont spend any cash on em

refrain
when im pulling up inside that thing you know i do my thing
and i drop the top on all these niggas in the way
and this is for the times a nigga shitted on me
you shitted on me now you see the tables turning my way

prechorus
so i gotta flex i gotta flex i gotta flex on you
for all of the times when i was a mess
and you tried to flex on me too
so i gotta flex and i gotta flex and flexing on you too
i know im wrong
