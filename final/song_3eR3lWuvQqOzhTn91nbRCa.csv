verse 1
shes a girl with the best intentions
hes a man of his own invention
she looked out the window
he walked out the door
but she followed him
and he said whatcha lookin for

chorus
she said i want something that i want
something that i tell myself i need
something that i want
and i need everything i see
something that i want
something that i tell myself i need
something that i want
and i need everything i see
yeah

verse 2
hes been livin in a pure illusion
shes gonna come to her own conclusion
right when you think you know what to say
someone comes along and shows you a brand new way
