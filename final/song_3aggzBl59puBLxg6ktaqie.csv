every hour of every day im learning more
the more i learn the less i know about before
the less i know the more i want to look around
digging deep for clues on higher ground

verse 1
moon and stars sit way up high
earth and trees beneath them lie
the wind blows fragrant lullaby
to cool the night for you and i

on the wing the birds fly free
leviathan tames angry sea
the flower waits for honeybee
the sunrise wakes new life in me

hook
every hour of every day im learning more
the more i learn the less i know about before
the less i know the more i want to look around
digging deep for clues on higher ground

verse 2
the fishes swim while rivers run
through fields to feast my eyes upon
intoxicated drinking from
the loving cup of burning sun

of whispered rain on weary face
of kisses sweet and warm embrace
another time another place

hook
every hour of every day im learning more
the more i learn the less i know about before
the less i know the more i want to look around
digging deep for clues on higher ground
