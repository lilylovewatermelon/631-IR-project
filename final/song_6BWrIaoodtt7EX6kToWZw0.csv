dead star shine
light up the sky
im all out of breath
my walls are closing in
days go by
give me a sign
come back to the end
the shepherd of the damned

chorus
i can feel you falling away
no longer the lost
no longer the same
and i can see you starting to break
ill keep you alive
if you show me the way
forever—and ever
the scars will remain
im falling apart
leave me here forever in the dark

verse 2
daylight dies
black out the sky
does anyone care
is anybody there
take this life
empty inside
im already dead
ill rise to fall again

i can feel you falling away
no longer the lost
no longer the same
and i can see you starting to break
ill keep you alive
if you show me the way
forever—and ever
the scars will remain
im falling apart
leave me here forever in the dark

bridge
god help me—ive come undone
out of the light of the sun
god help me—ive come undone
out of the light of the sun

chorus
i can feel you falling away
no longer the lost
no longer the same
and i can see you starting to break
ill keep you alive
if you show me the way
forever—and ever
the scars will remain
bridge
give me a sign
theres something buried in the words
give me a sign
your tears are adding to the flood
just give me a sign
theres something buried in the words
give me a sign
your tears are adding to the flood

forever—and ever
the scars will remain5embed"
