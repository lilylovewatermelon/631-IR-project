lord knows i know not where they went
shake my head and i wonder how
ill ever get to heaven now

an angel came one winter dawn
you shoulda seen what she had on
wind was whistlin like its rain
she left again just like she came

i know our days are heaven sent
lord knows i know not where they went
shake my head and i wonder how
ill ever get to heaven now

i move around a lot these days
honky tonks and broad freeways
the same thing that ive always done
but im older now and i get tired some

i know our days are heaven sent
lord knows i know not where they went
shake my head and i wonder how
ill ever get to heaven now

those who think they hold the cards
i send out my kind regards
those who love to those who care
ill meet you down the road somewhere
see the steeldrivers liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likei know our days are heaven sent
lord knows i know not where they went
shake my head and i wonder how
ill ever get to heaven now

i know our days are heaven sent
lord knows i know not where they went
shake my head and i wonder how
ill ever get to heaven nowembed"
