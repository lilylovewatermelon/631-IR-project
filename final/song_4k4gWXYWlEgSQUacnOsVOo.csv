gee its great after being out late
walking my baby back home
arm in arm over meadow and farm
walking my baby back home

verse 2
we go along harmonizing a song
or im reciting a poem
owls go by and they give me the eye
walking my baby back home

verse 4
hes afraid of the dark
so i had to park outside of his door till light
he says if i try to kiss him hell cry
i dry his tears all through the night

chorus
hand in hand to a barbecue stand
right from his doorway we roam
eat sampling its a pleasure again
walking my baby back home
