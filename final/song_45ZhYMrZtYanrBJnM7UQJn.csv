when i first laid eyes on you
well the night just felt so odd
you looked at me and the stars lined up
so i thought id heard from god
and i gave him my best shot

chorus
loving you was like throwing a lasso around a tornado
i tried to hold on to you
took a ride on a tiltawhirl that sits on top of the world
man i thought i could show you
ive always been afraid of flying
but you cant blame a girl for trying

verse 2
felt like a pearl when i was holding your hand
so precious i forgot
you could have any girl but i only wanted one man
and you were everything im not
still i gave it my best shot

chorus
loving you was like throwing a lasso around a tornado
i tried to hold on to you
took a turn on a high trapeze swinging over the deep
i thought i could show you
ive always been afraid of flying
but you cant blame a girl for trying
you might also likebridge
like a vine bends a tree to the ground
i wont hold you down
i tried to climb just as high
but i found all the clouds touch the ground
in this small town

chorus
took a ride on a high trapeze swinging over the deep
i thought i could show you
that ive always been afraid of flying
but you cant blame a girl for trying
no you cant blame a girl
hey heyembed"
