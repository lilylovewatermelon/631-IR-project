are you hurting the one you love
you say youve found heaven but you cant find god
are you hurting the one you love
bite your tongue until it tastes like blood
are you hurting the one you love
so many glasses on the tabletop
are you hurting the one you love
youd like to stay in heaven but the rules are too tough

chorus
tough
its just too tough
tough
its just too tough

verse 2
are you hurting the one you love
when they watched the walls and the ticking clock
are you hurting the one you love
and was it something you could not stop

chorus
could not stop
stop
could not stop
stop
could not stop
stop
could not stop
stop
could not stop

are you hurting the one you love
when you leave them sleeping on the hollow ground
are you hurting the one you love
and lost for themselves

are you hurting the one you love
and if heaven knows then who will stop
are you hurting the one you love
you said you got to heaven but it wasnt enough3embed"
