today is too late
how long do we have to wait
oh no i think she knows
thats why i cant let go
i feel this burning inside
a feeling that no one should know
this could be so good again
id wait here till then

while i walk with the dead all the lies i cant erase

verse 2
were mad with regret
memories that well both forget
so far its been so hard
to cover up these scars
i see this falling apart
its easy to just let it go
no luck between us both
so i keep waiting

verse 3
whats left to show
its so bad but i got to know
whats right dont know
how to find it out on my own

guitar solo

bridge
one by one we both fall down
but whos the first one to hit the ground now
whats worse to kick or fall or
be stuck standing alone
well ill keep your promises if you
take back everything i said
i find its got so cold now
that ive lost my heart and soul
