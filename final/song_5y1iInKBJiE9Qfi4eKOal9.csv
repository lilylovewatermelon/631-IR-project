our love was lost
but now weve found it
our love was lost oh lost
and hope was gone
our love was lost
but now weve found it
and if you flash your heart oh heart
i wont deny it

chorus
i promise
i promise

verse 2
your walls are up
too cold to touch it
your walls are up oh up
too high to climb
i know its hard
but i can still hear it beating
so if you flash your heart
i wont mistreat it

chorus
i promise
i promise
i promise
