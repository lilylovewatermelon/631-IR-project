when it started we had high hopes
now my backs on the line my backs on the ropes
when it started we were alright
but night makes a fool of us in the daylight

verse 2
there we were dyin of frustration
sayin lord lead me not into temptation
but its not easy when she turns you on
sin stay gone

chorus 1
if youd only if youd only say yes
whether you wills anybodys guess
god only god knows im tryin my best
but im just so tired of this loneliness

interlude

i was held from the rooftop then they let go
dizzily screamin let the windows down
as i crumble to the ground
