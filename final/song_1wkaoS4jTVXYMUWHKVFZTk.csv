now that we are over as the loving kind
well be dreaming ways to keep the good alive
only when we want is not a compromise
id be pouring tears into your drying eyes

chorus
friends lovers or nothing
there can only be one
friends lovers or nothing
there will never be an inbetween so give it up

verse 2
you whisper come on over
cause youre two drinks in
but in the morning i will say goodbye again
think well never fall into the jealous game
the streets are flood with blood of those who felt the same

chorus
friends lovers or nothing
there can only be one
friends lovers or nothing
there will never be an inbetween so give it up

chorus
friends lovers or nothing
we can really only ever be one
friends lovers or nothing
well never be the inbetween
so give it up
well never the inbetween
so give it up
