something just isnt right
i can feel it inside
the truth isnt far behind me
you cant deny
when i turn the lights out
when i close my eyes
reality overcomes me
im living a lie

prechorus
when im alone i
feel so much better
and when im around you
i dont feel

chorus
together it doesnt feel right at all
together together weve built a wall
together holding hands well fall
hands well fall

verse 2
this has gone on so long
i realize that i need
something good to rely on
something for me

together it doesnt feel right at all
together together weve built a wall
together holding hands well fall

feel so much better

together it doesnt feel right at all
