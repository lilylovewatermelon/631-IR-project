well i know sometimes you find it hard
to understand just what we do out here
well that bus rolls up at home
and i just disappear
and i sure dont like to leave you
couldnt stand for you to think that i dont care
so i wrote this job description
just to tell you what i do when im not there

chorus
i sleep eighty miles an hour
to the whining of a diesel down the interstate
dreamin bout my little girls
the easy chair that sits beside the fireplace
then we shut her down in another town
shower up and do just what we came to do
sing for the people
count the money and the miles back home to you

verse 2
well each night i take the stage
with a six piece band and a guitar in my hand
singin songs about my life
all the good times and the bad
then we say goodbye and we load it up
and head somewhere ive already been
then i lay down in that double bed alone
and i thank the lord again

i sleep eighty miles an hour
to the whining of a diesel down the interstate
dreamin bout my little girls
the easy chair that sits beside the fireplace
then we shut her down in another town
shower up and do just what we came to do
sing for the people
count the money and the miles back home to you

outro
well i just sing for the people
count the money and the miles back home to youembed"
