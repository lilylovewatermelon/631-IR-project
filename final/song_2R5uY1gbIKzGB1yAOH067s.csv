now that its all said and done
i cant believe you were the one
to build me up then tear me down
like an old abandoned house
and what you said when you left
just left me cold and out of breath
i fell too far was in way too deep
guess i let you get the best of me

chorus
well i never saw it coming
i shoulda started running
a long long time ago
and i never thought id doubt you
im better off without you
more than you more than you know
im slowly getting closure
i guess its really over
im finally getting better
and now im picking up the pieces
and spending all of these years
putting my heart back together
cause the day i thought id never get through
i got over you
see daughtry liveget tickets as low as 158you might also likeverse 2
you took a hammer to these walls
dragged the memories down the hall
packed your bags and walked away
there was nothing i could say
and when you slammed the front door shut
a lot of others opened up
so did my eyes so i could see
that you never were the best for me

chorus
well i never saw it coming
i shoulda started running
a long long time ago
and i never thought id doubt you
im better off without you
more than you more than you know
im slowly getting closure
i guess its really over
im finally gettin better
and now im picking up the pieces
and spending all of these years
putting my heart back together
cause the day i thought id never get through
i got over you

well i never saw it coming
