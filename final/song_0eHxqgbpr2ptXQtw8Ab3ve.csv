under your spell again
i cant say no to you
crave my heart and its bleeding in your hand
i cant say no to you
shouldnt have let you torture me so sweetly
now i cant let go of this dream
i cant breathe but i feel

chorus
good enough
i feel good enough
for you

verse 2
drink up sweet decadence
i cant say no to you
and ive completely lost myself and i dont mind
i cant say no to you
shouldnt have let you conquer me completely
now i cant let go of this dream
cant believe that i feel

chorus
good enough
i feel good enough

but i feel good
and im still waiting for the rain to fall

for you to love me too

cause i cant say no7embed"
