fasho
so ever since october
living out my dreams and got a lot closer
had to do it for my daughter before she got older
had to wake the sleepers up bitch i got folgers
im the realest nigga out remember i told ya
yes i’m derby city raised but i’m not local
now they actin like they kin i do not know them
ive been prospering ever since i dropped dont nigga
but it dont stop here i gotta keep it goin keep it goin
keep that hate coming my nigga ima keep ignoring
god tiller your flow so prehistoric
got got killer smoke yo it put me in a coma
im cassius my nigga put me in the corner
versus anybody really show me my opponent
they coming for my head not like makonnen
kill them all send em my condolences
and im back back back on my bullshit nigga
do i miss doing this shit just for fun just a little
now i do it for funds thats facts fundamentals
for a house up on the makers lawyers doctors my neighbors
everyday i say my prayers terminating betrayers
now the man is blessing me first the man was testing me
i went through the storm not knowing whether it was green on the other side or not
that shit would bring out the best of me
im so true with it who are you kidding
12 asked what i do for a living told them google it
im so rude with it and the youngest doing it
you dont know what i been through nigga
this the truth nigga oh my goodness
spittin flames in the booth nigga oh my goodness
god really came through for me oh my goodness

verse 2
you know me i gotta keep it real on this shit
my shawty mama put me out the crib nigga i was payin bills
almost got a third job she dont know the way it feels
but look look at how a nigga living
my dream just got a lot more vivid
and im starting to see a whole lot more friendlies
but i dont want too many no i dont want too many no way
city to city
never forget that phone call i got from timbo and richie
when i was in philly thats when i knew this shit wasnt given
then shit really got crazy got the kicks from drizzy
well the recognition from drizzy alone
i remember when they slept on me memory foam
cant believe timbo the king just sent me back home
but now that boy getting on my nigga give me the throne
ya dig
yup i know the people they diggin me now
the cool kids from high school cant sit with me now
my baby mamas mama cant say shit to me now
what did she do wrong she better figure it out
