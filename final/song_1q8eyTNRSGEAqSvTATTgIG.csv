cinderellas on her bedroom floor
shes got a crush on the guy at the liquor store
cause mr charming dont come home anymore
and she forgets why she came here
sleeping beautys in a foul mood for shame
she says none for you dear prince im tired today
id rather sleep my whole life away than have you keep me from dreaming

chorus
i dont care for your fairytales
youre so worried about the maiden
though you know shes only waiting on the next best thing
next best thing

verse 2
snow white is doing dishes again
cause what else can you do with seven ittybitty men
sends them to bed and she calls up a friend
says would you meet me at midnight
oh the tall blonde lets out a cry of despair
says would cut it myself if i knew men could climb hair
ill have to find another tower somewhere and keep away from the windows

chorus
i dont care for your fairytales
youre so worried about the maiden
though you know shes only waiting on the next best thing
next best thing

once upon a time in a faraway kingdom
man made up a story said that i should believe him
go and tell your white knight that hes handsome in hindsight
but i dont want the next best thing
so i sing and hold my head down and i break these walls round me
cant take no more of your fairytale love

chorus
i dont care for your fairytales
youre so worried about the maiden
though you know shes only waiting on the next best thing

outro
i dont care
i dont care
worry bout the maiden
though you know shes only waiting
spent the whole life being graded on the sanctity of patience
and a dumb appreciation
but the story needs some mending and a better happy ending
cause i dont want the next best thing
no no i dont want the next best thing4embed"
