just off of the beaten path
a little dot on a state road map
thats where i was born and where ill die
things move at a slower pace
nobodys in the rat race
and these days thats a special way of life

chorus
down home
where they know you by name and treat you like family
down home
a mans good word and a handshake are all you need
folks know
if theyre fallin on hard times they can fall back on
those of us raised up down home

verse 2
in the corner of the hardware store
gathered round a checker board
old men tellin lies and crownin kings
kids drivin round the old town square
cops roll down in the cool night air
go and see whats shakin at the dairy queen

chorus
down home
where they know you by name and treat you like family
down home
a mans good word and a handshake are all you need
folks know
if theyre fallin on hard times they can fall back on
those of us raised up down home
see alabama liveget tickets as low as 58you might also likebridge
when i was a boy i couldnt wait to leave this place
but now i wanna see my children raised
down home
down home

chorus
folks know
if there fallin on hard times they can fall back on
those of us raised up
down home
where they know you by name and treat you like family
down home
a mans good word and a handshake are all you need
folks know
if theyre fallin on hard times they can fall back on
those of us raised up down home

outro
down home
way down home
down home
down home
way down home
