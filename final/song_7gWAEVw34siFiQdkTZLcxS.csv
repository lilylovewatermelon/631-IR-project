but lately only late at night i find it hard to sleep
stay struggling with the part of me that wants to run the streets

and its almost like im caught up and living another life
man im hungry for something i need to feed this appetite

fantasies bout dimes on the side dark tint on my ride

but ever since i put that band on my hand
more and more chicks trying to get at me than i know what to do
just trying to handle my grown man bi

break her heart i do want to do
i dont want to be that fool make that move
bend them a bit but never break the rules
bend a bit but never break the rules
