we gonna roll the dice
we gonna slip and slide into paradise
we gonna grind some gears
we gonna ring some ears
we gonna drink some beers
til they disappear

turn the party up
drink the good times down
little buzz in a cup
will hit ya get ya space bound
sip a little whiskey come on baby kiss me
let me get a drip of your frisky gypsy
and when ya hit ten bump it to eleven
tonight we gonna fly with them 747s
get highhhhhhhhh hiiggghhhhh
gonna kill another 6 pack just to watch it die
turn the party up up up
turn the party up up up

hey pretty girl tell me what you think
this country boy pour you a drink
crank this party up and lets ride
miles of moonlight by my side
old dirt roads go straight to heaven
forget tomorrow tonight were living
crank this party up to eleven
forget tomorrow tonight we
see chase rice liveget tickets as low as 109you might also liketurn the party up
drink the good times down
little buzz in a cup
will hit ya get ya space bound
sip a little whiskey come on baby kiss me
let me get a drip of your frisky gypsy
and when ya hit ten bump it to eleven
tonight we gonna fly with them 747s
get highhhhhhhhh hiiggghhhhh
gonna kill another 6 pack just to watch it die
turn the party up up up
turn the party up up upembed"
