its 5 am and im on the radio
im supposed to call you
but i dont know what to say at all
and theres this girl she wants me to take her home
she dont really love me though
im just on the radio

prechorus
and im not gonna tell you that im over it
cause i think about it every night im not sober and
i know i keep these feelings to myself
