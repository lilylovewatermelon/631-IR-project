rise with the morning
you call to me
my thoughts are crawling
youre all i see

chorus
i wish i could live without you
but youre a part of me
wherever i go
youll always be next to me

verse 2
fall into the night
as i gaze into you
shine so bright
its all i do

chorus
i wish i could live without you
but youre a part of me
wherever i go
youll always be next to me

outro
youll always be next to me
youll always be next to me
youll always be next to me
youll always be next to meyou might also like9embed"
