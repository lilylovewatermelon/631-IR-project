little hands little feet
tiny heart tiny beat
oh thinkin bout the time we spent falling in love together
i dont wanna leave you i dont wanna deceive you
but oh when mama cries from daddys lies
oh my please dont take him away mama
dont take him away oh

chorus
cause ive had my time oh
dont take my baby boy
dont take my pride and joy
i hope i stay close i hope i stay close

verse 2
all the pain all the tears
many nights many years
this love for me is fading
you waited but i never came home to you
ive never lied about us
we were never supposed to be together
when you see me with some other one
and they know your son
oh please dont take him away
you say you wont but you will yes you will
you might also likechorus
cause ive had my time oh
dont take my baby boy
dont take my pride and joy
i hope i stay close i hope i stay close

outro
dont take my baby boy
there was a time before you
and there will be a time after you
dont take my pride and joy
though these bodies are not our own
walk tall little one walk tall
i hope i stay close
dont take my baby boy
dont take my pride and joy
let me hold you let me hold you
i hope i stay close
can i hold you16embed"
