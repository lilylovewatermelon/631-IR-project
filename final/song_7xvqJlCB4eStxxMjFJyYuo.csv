you with the sad eyes
dont be discouraged oh i realize
its hard to take courage
in a world full of people
you can lose sight of it all
the darkness inside you
can make you feel so small

prechorus justin timberlake both
show me a smile then dont be unhappy
cant remember when i last saw you laughing
this world makes you crazy
and youve taken all you can bear
just call me up
cause i will always be there
