i like to wait to see how things turn out
if you apply some pressure
i like to wait to see how things turn out
if you apply some pressure

verse 1 paul smith
you know that i would love to see you next year
i hope that i am still alive next year
you magnify the way i think about myself
before you came i rarely thought about myself

behind your veil i found the body underneath
inside your head were things id never thought about
you know that i would love to see you next year
i hope that i am still alive next year

whats my view well how am i supposed to know
write a review well how objective can i be
whats my view well how am i supposed to know
write a review well how objective can i be

chorus paul smith
