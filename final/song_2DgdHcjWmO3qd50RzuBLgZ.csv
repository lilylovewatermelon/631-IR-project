oh whoaohohoh ohohohohoh

verse 1
if youre a lover you should know
the lonely moments just get lonelier
the longer youre in love than if you were alone
memories turn into daydreams become a taboo
i dont want to be afraid the deeper that i go
it takes my breath away soft hearts electric souls
heart to heart and eyes to eyes is this taboo

chorus
baby we built this house on memories
take my picture now shake it til you see it
and when your fantasies become your legacy
promise me a place in your house of memories

i think of you from time to time more than i thought i would
