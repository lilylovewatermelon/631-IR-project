there were days when each hour
was a war i fought to survive
there were nights full of nightmares
and i dreaded closing my eyes
there were skies that burst open
with a downpour to drown me alive
but the world took a spark like a match in the dark
and the fire brought me to life

prechorus
so im fanning the flames to climb so high
because theres no other way we can stay alive

chorus
because were burning bright as we all unite
and when its all said and done well shine like the sun
so dont let the fire die
and well watch the sky as it fills with light
and though the embers are new whatever you do
just dont let the fire die

verse 2
and youll find therell be mornings
when the ashes and embers are cold
but youll fight with a passion
and youll never stop cause you know
yeah you know it gets better
and your story is yet to be told
every push every shove every war every love
yeah the coals are beginning to glow

chorus
because were burning bright as we all unite
and when its all said and done well shine like the sun
so dont let the fire die

just dont let the fire die

verse 3
dont let the fire die
it gets better
just dont let the fire die no

chorus
because were burning bright as we all unite
and when its all said and done well shine like the sun
