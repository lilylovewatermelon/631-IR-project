the sofa

the history of the following production is briefly thisa lady
fond of blank verse demanded a poem of that kind from the author and
gave him the sofa for a subject  he obeyed and having much leisure
connected another subject with it and pursuing the train of thought
to which his situation and turn of mind led him brought forth at
length instead of the trifle which he at first intended a serious
affaira volume


i sing the sofa  i who lately sang
truth hope and charity and touched with awe
the solemn chords and with a trembling hand
escaped with pain from that adventrous flight
now seek repose upon a humbler theme
the theme though humble yet august and proud
the occasionfor the fair commands the song

time was when clothing sumptuous or for use
save their own painted skins our sires had none
as yet black breeches were not satin smooth
or velvet soft or plush with shaggy pile
the hardy chief upon the rugged rock
washed by the sea or on the gravelly bank
thrown up by wintry torrents roaring loud
fearless of wrong reposed his weary strength
those barbarous ages past succeeded next
the birthday of invention weak at first
dull in design and clumsy to perform
jointstools were then created on three legs
upborne they stood three legs upholding firm
a massy slab in fashion square or round
on such a stool immortal alfred sat
and swayed the sceptre of his infant realms
and such in ancient halls and mansions drear
may still be seen but perforated sore
and drilled in holes the solid oak is found
by worms voracious eating through and through
at length a generation more refined
improved the simple plan made three legs four
gave them a twisted form vermicular
and oer the seat with plenteous wadding stuffed
induced a splendid cover green and blue
yellow and red of tapestry richly wrought
and woven close or needlework sublime
there might ye see the peony spread wide
the fullblown rose the shepherd and his lass
lapdog and lambkin with black staring eyes
and parrots with twin cherries in their beak

now came the cane from india smooth and bright
with natures varnish severed into stripes
that interlaced each other these supplied
of texture firm a latticework that braced
the new machine and it became a chair
but restless was the chair the back erect
distressed the weary loins that felt no ease
the slippery seat betrayed the sliding part
that pressed it and the feet hung dangling down
anxious in vain to find the distant floor
these for the rich  the rest whom fate had placed
in modest mediocrity content
with base materials sat on welltanned hides
obdurate and unyielding glassy smooth
with here and there a tuft of crimson yarn
or scarlet crewel in the cushion fixed
if cushion might be called what harder seemed
than the firm oak of which the frame was formed
no want of timber then was felt or feared
in albions happy isle  the lumber stood
ponderous and fixed by its own massy weight
but elbows still were wanting these some say
an alderman of cripplegate contrived
and some ascribe the invention to a priest
burly and big and studious of his ease
but rude at first and not with easy slope
receding wide they pressed against the ribs
and bruised the side and elevated high
taught the raised shoulders to invade the ears
long time elapsed or eer our rugged sires
complained though incommodiously pent in
and ill at ease behind  the ladies first
gan murmur as became the softer sex
ingenious fancy never better pleased
than when employed to accommodate the fair
heard the sweet moan with pity and devised
the soft settee one elbow at each end
and in the midst an elbow it received
united yet divided twain at once
so sit two kings of brentford on one throne
and so two citizens who take the air
close packed and smiling in a chaise and one
but relaxation of the languid frame
by soft recumbency of outstretched limbs
was bliss reserved for happier days so slow
the growth of what is excellent so hard
to attain perfection in this nether world
thus first necessity invented stools
convenience next suggested elbowchairs
and luxury the accomplished sofa last
the nurse sleeps sweetly hired to watch the sick
whom snoring she disturbs  as sweetly he
who quits the coachbox at the midnight hour
to sleep within the carriage more secure
his legs depending at the open door
sweet sleep enjoys the curate in his desk
the tedious rector drawling oer his head
and sweet the clerk below but neither sleep
of lazy nurse who snores the sick man dead
nor his who quits the box at midnight hour
to slumber in the carriage more secure
nor sleep enjoyed by curate in his desk
nor yet the dozings of the clerk are sweet
compared with the repose the sofa yields

oh may i live exempted while i live
guiltless of pampered appetite obscene
from pangs arthritic that infest the toe
of libertine excess  the sofa suits
the gouty limb tis true but gouty limb
though on a sofa may i never feel
for i have loved the rural walk through lanes
of grassy swarth close cropped by nibbling sheep
and skirted thick with intertexture firm
of thorny boughs  have loved the rural walk
oer hills through valleys and by rivers brink
eer since a truant boy i passed my bounds
to enjoy a ramble on the banks of thames
and still remember nor without regret
of hours that sorrow since has much endeared
how oft my slice of pocket store consumed
still hungering penniless and far from home
i fed on scarlet hips and stony haws
or blushing crabs or berries that emboss
the bramble black as jet or sloes austere
hard fare but such as boyish appetite
disdains not nor the palate undepraved
by culinary arts unsavoury deems
no sofa then awaited my return
no sofa then i needed  youth repairs
his wasted spirits quickly by long toil
incurring short fatigue and though our years
as life declines speed rapidly away
and not a year but pilfers as he goes
some youthful grace that age would gladly keep
a tooth or auburn lock and by degrees
their length and colour from the locks they spare
the elastic spring of an unwearied foot
that mounts the stile with ease or leaps the fence
that play of lungs inhaling and again
respiring freely the fresh air that makes
swift pace or steep ascent no toil to me
mine have not pilfered yet nor yet impaired
my relish of fair prospect scenes that soothed
or charmed me young no longer young i find
still soothing and of power to charm me still
and witness dear companion of my walks
whose arm this twentieth winter i perceive
fast locked in mine with pleasure such as love
confirmed by long experience of thy worth
and welltried virtues could alone inspire
witness a joy that thou hast doubled long
thou knowst my praise of nature most sincere
and that my raptures are not conjured up
to serve occasions of poetic pomp
but genuine and art partner of them all
how oft upon yon eminence our pace
has slackened to a pause and we have borne
the ruffling wind scarce conscious that it blew
while admiration feeding at the eye
and still unsated dwelt upon the scene
thence with what pleasure have we just discerned
the distant plough slowmoving and beside
his labouring team that swerved not from the track
the sturdy swain diminished to a boy
here ouse slow winding through a level plain
of spacious meads with cattle sprinkled oer
conducts the eye along his sinuous course
delighted  there fast rooted in his bank
stand never overlooked our favourite elms
that screen the herdsmans solitary hut
while far beyond and overthwart the stream
that as with molten glass inlays the vale
the sloping land recedes into the clouds
displaying on its varied side the grace
of hedgerow beauties numberless square tower
tall spire from which the sound of cheerful bells
just undulates upon the listening ear
groves heaths and smoking villages remote
scenes must be beautiful which daily viewed
please daily and whose novelty survives
long knowledge and the scrutiny of years
praise justly due to those that i describe
nor rural sights alone but rural sounds
exhilarate the spirit and restore
the tone of languid nature  mighty winds
that sweep the skirt of some farspreading wood
of ancient growth make music not unlike
the dash of ocean on his winding shore
and lull the spirit while they fill the mind
unnumbered branches waving in the blast
and all their leaves fast fluttering all at once
nor less composure waits upon the roar
of distant floods or on the softer voice
of neighbouring fountain or of rills that slip
through the cleft rock and chiming as they fall
upon loose pebbles lose themselves at length
in matted grass that with a livelier green
betrays the secret of their silent course
nature inanimate employs sweet sounds
but animated nature sweeter still
to soothe and satisfy the human ear
ten thousand warblers cheer the day and one
the livelong night  nor these alone whose notes
nicefingered art must emulate in vain
but cawing rooks and kites that swim sublime
in still repeated circles screaming loud
the jay the pie and even the boding owl
that hails the rising moon have charms for me
sounds inharmonious in themselves and harsh
yet heard in scenes where peace for ever reigns
and only there please highly for their sake

peace to the artist whose ingenious thought
devised the weatherhouse that useful toy
fearless of humid air and gathering rains
forth steps the manan emblem of myself
more delicate his timorous mate retires
when winter soaks the fields and female feet
too weak to struggle with tenacious clay
or ford the rivulets are best at home
the task of new discoveries falls on me
at such a season and with such a charge
once went i forth and found till then unknown
a cottage whither oft we since repair
tis perched upon the green hilltop but close
environed with a ring of branching elms
that overhang the thatch itself unseen
peeps at the vale below so thick beset
with foliage of such dark redundant growth
i called the lowroofed lodge the peasants nest
and hidden as it is and far remote
from such unpleasing sounds as haunt the ear
in village or in town the bay of curs
incessant clinking hammers grinding wheels
and infants clamorous whether pleased or pained
oft have i wished the peaceful covert mine
here i have said at least i should possess
the poets treasure silence and indulge
the dreams of fancy tranquil and secure
vain thought the dweller in that still retreat
dearly obtains the refuge it affords
its elevated site forbids the wretch
to drink sweet waters of the crystal well
he dips his bowl into the weedy ditch
and heavyladen brings his beverage home
farfetched and little worth  nor seldom waits
dependent on the bakers punctual call
to hear his creaking panniers at the door
angry and sad and his last crust consumed
so farewell envy of the peasants nest
if solitude make scant the means of life
society for me  thou seeming sweet
be still a pleasing object in my view
my visit still but never mine abode

not distant far a length of colonnade
invites us monument of ancient taste
now scorned but worthy of a better fate
our fathers knew the value of a screen
from sultry suns and in their shaded walks
and longprotracted bowers enjoyed at noon
the gloom and coolness of declining day
we bear our shades about us selfdeprived
of other screen the thin umbrella spread
and range an indian waste without a tree
thanks to benevolushe spares me yet
these chestnuts ranged in corresponding lines
and though himself so polished still reprieves
the obsolete prolixity of shade

descending now but cautious lest too fast
a sudden steep upon a rustic bridge
we pass a gulf in which the willows dip
their pendent boughs stooping as if to drink
hence ankledeep in moss and flowery thyme
we mount again and feel at every step
our foot half sunk in hillocks green and soft
raised by the mole the miner of the soil
he not unlike the great ones of mankind
disfigures earth and plotting in the dark
toils much to earn a monumental pile
that may record the mischiefs he has done

the summit gained behold the proud alcove
that crowns it yet not all its pride secures
the grand retreat from injuries impressed
by rural carvers who with knives deface
the panels leaving an obscure rude name
in characters uncouth and spelt amiss
so strong the zeal to immortalise himself
beats in the breast of man that even a few
few transient years won from the abyss abhorred
of blank oblivion seem a glorious prize
and even to a clown  now roves the eye
and posted on this speculative height
exults in its command  the sheepfold here
pours out its fleecy tenants oer the glebe
at first progressive as a stream they seek
the middle field but scattered by degrees
each to his choice soon whiten all the land
there from the sunburnt hayfield homeward creeps
the loaded wain while lightened of its charge
the wain that meets it passes swiftly by
the boorish driver leaning oer his team
vociferous and impatient of delay
nor less attractive is the woodland scene
diversified with trees of every growth
alike yet various  here the gray smooth trunks
of ash or lime or beech distinctly shine
within the twilight of their distant shades
there lost behind a rising ground the wood
seems sunk and shortened to its topmost boughs
no tree in all the grove but has its charms
though each its hue peculiar paler some
and of a wannish gray the willow such
and poplar that with silver lines his leaf
and ash farstretching his umbrageous arm
of deeper green the elm and deeper still
lord of the woods the longsurviving oak
some glossyleaved and shining in the sun
the maple and the beech of oily nuts
prolific and the lime at dewy eve
diffusing odours nor unnoted pass
the sycamore capricious in attire
now green now tawny and ere autumn yet
have changed the woods in scarlet honours bright
oer these but far beyond a spacious map
of hill and valley interposed between
the ouse dividing the wellwatered land
now glitters in the sun and now retires
as bashful yet impatient to be seen

hence the declivity is sharp and short
and such the reascent between them weeps
a little naiad her impoverished urn
all summer long which winter fills again
the folded gates would bar my progress now
but that the lord of this enclosed demesne
communicative of the good he owns
admits me to a share  the guiltless eye
commits no wrong nor wastes what it enjoys
refreshing change where now the blazing sun
by short transition we have lost his glare
and stepped at once into a cooler clime
ye fallen avenues once more i mourn
your fate unmerited once more rejoice
that yet a remnant of your race survives
how airy and how light the graceful arch
yet awful as the consecrated roof
reechoing pious anthems while beneath
the chequered earth seems restless as a flood
brushed by the wind  so sportive is the light
shot through the boughs it dances as they dance
shadow and sunshine intermingling quick
and darkening and enlightening as the leaves
play wanton every moment every spot

and now with nerves newbraced and spirits cheered
we tread the wilderness whose wellrolled walks
with curvature of slow and easy sweep
deception innocentgive ample space
to narrow bounds  the grove receives us next
between the upright shafts of whose tall elms
we may discern the thresher at his task
thump after thump resounds the constant flail
that seems to swing uncertain and yet falls
full on the destined ear  wide flies the chaff
the rustling straw sends up a frequent mist
of atoms sparkling in the noonday beam
come hither ye that press your beds of down
and sleep not  see him sweating oer his bread
before he eats ittis the primal curse
but softened into mercy made the pledge
of cheerful days and nights without a groan

by ceaseless action all that is subsists
constant rotation of the unwearied wheel
that nature rides upon maintains her health
her beauty her fertility  she dreads
an instants pause and lives but while she moves
its own revolvency upholds the world
winds from all quarters agitate the air
and fit the limpid element for use
else noxious  oceans rivers lakes and streams
all feel the freshening impulse and are cleansed
by restless undulation  even the oak
thrives by the rude concussion of the storm
he seems indeed indignant and to feel
the impression of the blast with proud disdain
frowning as if in his unconscious arm
he held the thunder  but the monarch owes
his firm stability to what he scorns
more fixed below the more disturbed above
the law by which all creatures else are bound
binds man the lord of all  himself derives
no mean advantage from a kindred cause
from strenuous toil his hours of sweetest ease
the sedentary stretch their lazy length
when custom bids but no refreshment find
for none they need  the languid eye the cheek
deserted of its bloom the flaccid shrunk
and withered muscle and the vapid soul
reproach their owner with that love of rest
to which he forfeits even the rest he loves
not such the alert and active  measure life
by its true worth the comforts it affords
and theirs alone seems worthy of the name
good health and its associate in the most
good temper spirits prompt to undertake
and not soon spent though in an arduous task
the powers of fancy and strong thought are theirs
even age itself seems privileged in them
with clear exemption from its own defects
a sparkling eye beneath a wrinkled front
the veteran shows and gracing a gray beard
with youthful smiles descends towards the grave
sprightly and old almost without decay

like a coy maiden ease when courted most
farthest retiresan idol at whose shrine
who oftenest sacrifice are favoured least
the love of nature and the scene she draws
is natures dictate  strange there should be found
who selfimprisoned in their proud saloons
renounce the odours of the open field
for the unscented fictions of the loom
who satisfied with only pencilled scenes
prefer to the performance of a god
the inferior wonders of an artists hand
lovely indeed the mimic works of art
but natures works far lovelier  i admire
none more admires the painters magic skill
who shows me that which i shall never see
conveys a distant country into mine
and throws italian light on english walls
but imitative strokes can do no more
than please the eye sweet nature every sense
the air salubrious of her lofty hills
the cheering fragrance of her dewy vales
and music of her woodsno works of man
may rival these these all bespeak a power
peculiar and exclusively her own
beneath the open sky she spreads the feast
tis free to alltis evry day renewed
who scorns it starves deservedly at home
he does not scorn it who imprisoned long
in some unwholesome dungeon and a prey
to sallow sickness which the vapours dank
and clammy of his dark abode have bred
escapes at last to liberty and light
his cheek recovers soon its healthful hue
his eye relumines its extinguished fires
he walks he leaps he runsis winged with joy
and riots in the sweets of every breeze
he does not scorn it who has long endured
a fevers agonies and fed on drugs
nor yet the mariner his blood inflamed
with acrid salts his very heart athirst
to gaze at nature in her green array
upon the ships tall side he stands possessed
with visions prompted by intense desire
fair fields appear below such as he left
far distant such as he would die to find
he seeks them headlong and is seen no more

the spleen is seldom felt where flora reigns
the lowering eye the petulance the frown
and sullen sadness that oershade distort
and mar the face of beauty when no cause
for such immeasurable woe appears
these flora banishes and gives the fair
sweet smiles and bloom less transient than her own
it is the constant revolution stale
and tasteless of the same repeated joys
that palls and satiates and makes languid life
a pedlars pack that bows the bearer down
health suffers and the spirits ebb the heart
recoils from its own choiceat the full feast
is famishedfinds no music in the song
no smartness in the jest and wonders why
yet thousands still desire to journey on
though halt and weary of the path they tread
the paralytic who can hold her cards
but cannot play them borrows a friends hand
to deal and shuffle to divide and sort
her mingled suits and sequences and sits
spectatress both and spectacle a sad
and silent cipher while her proxy plays
others are dragged into the crowded room
between supporters and once seated sit
through downright inability to rise
till the stout bearers lift the corpse again
these speak a loud memento  yet even these
themselves love life and cling to it as he
that overhangs a torrent to a twig
they love it and yet loathe it fear to die
yet scorn the purposes for which they live
then wherefore not renounce them  nothe dread
the slavish dread of solitude that breeds
reflection and remorse the fear of shame
and their inveterate habits all forbid

whom call we gay  that honour has been long
the boast of mere pretenders to the name
the innocent are gaythe lark is gay
that dries his feathers saturate with dew
beneath the rosy cloud while yet the beams
of dayspring overshoot his humble nest
the peasant too a witness of his song
himself a songster is as gay as he
but save me from the gaiety of those
whose headaches nail them to a noonday bed
and save me too from theirs whose haggard eyes
flash desperation and betray their pangs
for property stripped off by cruel chance
from gaiety that fills the bones with pain
the mouth with blasphemy the heart with woe

the earth was made so various that the mind
of desultory man studious of change
and pleased with novelty might be indulged
prospects however lovely may be seen
till half their beauties fade the weary sight
too well acquainted with their smiles slides off
fastidious seeking less familiar scenes
then snug enclosures in the sheltered vale
where frequent hedges intercept the eye
delight us happy to renounce a while
not senseless of its charms what still we love
that such short absence may endear it more
then forests or the savage rock may please
that hides the seamew in his hollow clefts
above the reach of man  his hoary head
conspicuous many a league the mariner
bound homeward and in hope already there
greets with three cheers exulting  at his waist
a girdle of halfwithered shrubs he shows
and at his feet the baffled billows die
the common overgrown with fern and rough
with prickly gorse that shapeless and deformed
and dangerous to the touch has yet its bloom
and decks itself with ornaments of gold
yields no unpleasing ramble there the turf
smells fresh and rich in odoriferous herbs
and fungous fruits of earth regales the sense
with luxury of unexpected sweets

there often wanders one whom better days
saw better clad in cloak of satin trimmed
with lace and hat with splendid ribbon bound
a servingmaid was she and fell in love
with one who left her went to sea and died
her fancy followed him through foaming waves
to distant shores and she would sit and weep
at what a sailor suffers fancy too
delusive most where warmest wishes are
would oft anticipate his glad return
and dream of transports she was not to know
she heard the doleful tidings of his death
and never smiled again  and now she roams
the dreary waste there spends the livelong day
and there unless when charity forbids
the livelong night  a tattered apron hides
worn as a cloak and hardly hides a gown
more tattered still and both but ill conceal
a bosom heaved with neverceasing sighs
she begs an idle pin of all she meets
and hoards them in her sleeve but needful food
though pressed with hunger oft or comelier clothes
though pinched with cold asks neverkate is crazed

i see a column of slowrising smoke
oertop the lofty wood that skirts the wild
a vagabond and useless tribe there eat
their miserable meal  a kettle slung
between two poles upon a stick transverse
receives the morsel flesh obscene of dog
or vermin or at best of cock purloined
from his accustomed perch  hardfaring race
they pick their fuel out of every hedge
which kindled with dry leaves just saves unquenched
the spark of life  the sportive wind blows wide
their fluttering rags and shows a tawny skin
the vellum of the pedigree they claim
great skill have they in palmistry and more
to conjure clean away the gold they touch
conveying worthless dross into its place
loud when they beg dumb only when they steal
strange that a creature rational and cast
in human mould should brutalise by choice
his nature and though capable of arts
by which the world might profit and himself
selfbanished from society prefer
such squalid sloth to honourable toil
yet even these though feigning sickness oft
they swathe the forehead drag the limping limb
and vex their flesh with artificial sores
can change their whine into a mirthful note
when safe occasion offers and with dance
and music of the bladder and the bag
beguile their woes and make the woods resound
such health and gaiety of heart enjoy
the houseless rovers of the sylvan world
and breathing wholesome air and wandering much
need other physic none to heal the effects
of loathsome diet penury and cold

blest he though undistinguished from the crowd
by wealth or dignity who dwells secure
where man by nature fierce has laid aside
his fierceness having learnt though slow to learn
the manners and the arts of civil life
his wants indeed are many but supply
is obvious placed within the easy reach
of temperate wishes and industrious hands
here virtue thrives as in her proper soil
not rude and surly and beset with thorns
and terrible to sight as when she springs
if eer she spring spontaneous in remote
and barbarous climes where violence prevails
and strength is lord of all but gentle kind
by culture tamed by liberty refreshed
and all her fruits by radiant truth matured
war and the chase engross the savage whole
war followed for revenge or to supplant
the envied tenants of some happier spot
the chase for sustenance precarious trust
his hard condition with severe constraint
binds all his faculties forbids all growth
of wisdom proves a school in which he learns
sly circumvention unrelenting hate
mean selfattachment and scarce aught beside
thus fare the shivering natives of the north
and thus the rangers of the western world
where it advances far into the deep
towards the antarctic  even the favoured isles
so lately found although the constant sun
cheer all their seasons with a grateful smile
can boast but little virtue and inert
through plenty lose in morals what they gain
in manners victims of luxurious ease
these therefore i can pity placed remote
from all that science traces art invents
or inspiration teaches and enclosed
in boundless oceans never to be passed
by navigators uninformed as they
or ploughed perhaps by british bark again
but far beyond the rest and with most cause
thee gentle savage whom no love of thee
or thine but curiosity perhaps
or else vainglory prompted us to draw
forth from thy native bowers to show thee here
with what superior skill we can abuse
the gifts of providence and squander life
the dream is past  and thou hast found again
thy cocoas and bananas palms and yams
and homestall thatched with leaves  but hast thou found
their former charms  and having seen our state
our palaces our ladies and our pomp
of equipage our gardens and our sports
and heard our music are thy simple friends
thy simple fare and all thy plain delights
as dear to thee as once  and have thy joys
lost nothing by comparison with ours
rude as thou art for we returned thee rude
and ignorant except of outward show
i cannot think thee yet so dull of heart
and spiritless as never to regret
sweets tasted here and left as soon as known
methinks i see thee straying on the beach
and asking of the surge that bathes the foot
if ever it has washed our distant shore
i see thee weep and thine are honest tears
a patriots for his country  thou art sad
at thought of her forlorn and abject state
from which no power of thine can raise her up
thus fancy paints thee and though apt to err
perhaps errs little when she paints thee thus
she tells me too that duly every morn
thou climbst the mountaintop with eager eye
exploring far and wide the watery waste
for sight of ship from england  every speck
seen in the dim horizon turns thee pale
with conflict of contending hopes and fears
but comes at last the dull and dusky eve
and sends thee to thy cabin well prepared
to dream all night of what the day denied
alas expect it not  we found no bait
to tempt us in thy country  doing good
disinterested good is not our trade
we travel far tis true but not for naught
and must be bribed to compass earth again
by other hopes and richer fruits than yours

but though true worth and virtue in the mild
and genial soil of cultivated life
thrive most and may perhaps thrive only there
yet not in cities oft  in proud and gay
and gaindevoted cities thither flow
as to a common and most noisome sewer
the dregs and feculence of every land
in cities foul example on most minds
begets its likeness  rank abundance breeds
in gross and pampered cities sloth and lust
and wantonness and gluttonous excess
in cities vice is hidden with most ease
or seen with least reproach and virtue taught
by frequent lapse can hope no triumph there
beyond the achievement of successful flight
i do confess them nurseries of the arts
in which they flourish most where in the beams
of warm encouragement and in the eye
of public note they reach their perfect size
such london is by taste and wealth proclaimed
the fairest capital in all the world
by riot and incontinence the worst
there touched by reynolds a dull blank becomes
a lucid mirror in which nature sees
all her reflected features  bacon there
gives more than female beauty to a stone
and chathams eloquence to marble lips
nor does the chisel occupy alone
the powers of sculpture but the style as much
each province of her art her equal care
with nice incision of her guided steel
she ploughs a brazen field and clothes a soil
so sterile with what charms soeer she will
the richest scenery and the loveliest forms
where finds philosophy her eagle eye
with which she gazes at yon burning disk
undazzled and detects and counts his spots
in london  where her implements exact
with which she calculates computes and scans
all distance motion magnitude and now
measures an atom and now girds a world
in london  where has commerce such a mart
so rich so thronged so drained and so supplied
as london opulent enlarged and still
increasing london  babylon of old
not more the glory of the earth than she
a more accomplished worlds chief glory now

she has her praise  now mark a spot or two
that so much beauty would do well to purge
and show this queen of cities that so fair
may yet be foul so witty yet not wise
it is not seemly nor of good report
that she is slack in discipline more prompt
to avenge than to prevent the breach of law
that she is rigid in denouncing death
on petty robbers and indulges life
and liberty and ofttimes honour too
to peculators of the public gold
that thieves at home must hang but he that puts
into his overgorged and bloated purse
the wealth of indian provinces escapes
nor is it well nor can it come to good
that through profane and infidel contempt
of holy writ she has presumed to annul
and abrogate as roundly as she may
the total ordinance and will of god
advancing fashion to the post of truth
and centring all authority in modes
and customs of her own till sabbath rites
have dwindled into unrespected forms
and knees and hassocks are wellnigh divorced

god made the country and man made the town
what wonder then that health and virtue gifts
that can alone make sweet the bitter draught
that life holds out to all should most abound
and least be threatened in the fields and groves
possess ye therefore ye who borne about
in chariots and sedans know no fatigue
but that of idleness and taste no scenes
but such as art contrives possess ye still
your element there only ye can shine
there only minds like yours can do no harm
our groves were planted to console at noon
the pensive wanderer in their shades  at eve
the moonbeam sliding softly in between
the sleeping leaves is all the light they wish
birds warbling all the music  we can spare
the splendour of your lamps they but eclipse
our softer satellite  your songs confound
our more harmonious notes  the thrush departs
scared and the offended nightingale is mute
there is a public mischief in your mirth
it plagues your country  folly such as yours
graced with a sword and worthier of a fan
has made which enemies could neer have done
our arch of empire steadfast but for you
a mutilated structure soon to fall



book ii

the timepiece

oh for a lodge in some vast wilderness
some boundless contiguity of shade
where rumour of oppression and deceit
of unsuccessful or successful war
might never reach me more  my ear is pained
my soul is sick with every days report
of wrong and outrage with which earth is filled
there is no flesh in mans obdurate heart
it does not feel for man  the natural bond
of brotherhood is severed as the flax
that falls asunder at the touch of fire
he finds his fellow guilty of a skin
not coloured like his own and having power
to enforce the wrong for such a worthy cause
dooms and devotes him as his lawful prey
lands intersected by a narrow frith
abhor each other  mountains interposed
make enemies of nations who had else
like kindred drops been mingled into one
thus man devotes his brother and destroys
and worse than all and most to be deplored
as human natures broadest foulest blot
chains him and tasks him and exacts his sweat
with stripes that mercy with a bleeding heart
weeps when she sees inflicted on a beast
then what is man  and what man seeing this
and having human feelings does not blush
and hang his head to think himself a man
i would not have a slave to till my ground
to carry me to fan me while i sleep
and tremble when i wake for all the wealth
that sinews bought and sold have ever earned
no  dear as freedom is and in my hearts
just estimation prized above all price
i had much rather be myself the slave
and wear the bonds than fasten them on him
we have no slaves at homethen why abroad
and they themselves once ferried oer the wave
that parts us are emancipate and loosed
slaves cannot breathe in england if their lungs
receive our air that moment they are free
they touch our country and their shackles fall
thats noble and bespeaks a nation proud
and jealous of the blessing  spread it then
and let it circulate through every vein
of all your empire that where britains power
is felt mankind may feel her mercy too

sure there is need of social intercourse
benevolence and peace and mutual aid
between the nations in a world that seems
to toll the deathbell to its own decease
and by the voice of all its elements
to preach the general doom  when were the winds
let slip with such a warrant to destroy
when did the waves so haughtily oerleap
their ancient barriers deluging the dry
fires from beneath and meteors from above
portentous unexampled unexplained
have kindled beacons in the skies and the old
and crazy earth has had her shaking fits
more frequent and foregone her usual rest
is it a time to wrangle when the props
and pillars of our planet seem to fail
and nature with a dim and sickly eye
to wait the close of all  but grant her end
more distant and that prophecy demands
a longer respite unaccomplished yet
still they are frowning signals and bespeak
displeasure in his breast who smites the earth
or heals it makes it languish or rejoice
and tis but seemly that where all deserve
and stand exposed by common peccancy
to what no few have felt there should be peace
and brethren in calamity should love

alas for sicily rude fragments now
lie scattered where the shapely column stood
her palaces are dust  in all her streets
the voice of singing and the sprightly chord
are silent  revelry and dance and show
suffer a syncope and solemn pause
while god performs upon the trembling stage
of his own works his dreadful part alone
how does the earth receive himwith what signs
of gratulation and delight her king
pours she not all her choicest fruits abroad
her sweetest flowers her aromatic gums
disclosing paradise whereer he treads
she quakes at his approach  her hollow womb
conceiving thunders through a thousand deeps
and fiery caverns roars beneath his foot
the hills move lightly and the mountains smoke
for he has touched them  from the extremest point
of elevation down into the abyss
his wrath is busy and his frown is felt
the rocks fall headlong and the valleys rise
the rivers die into offensive pools
and charged with putrid verdure breathe a gross
and mortal nuisance into all the air
what solid was by transformation strange
grows fluid and the fixed and rooted earth
tormented into billows heaves and swells
or with vortiginous and hideous whirl
sucks down its prey insatiable  immense
the tumult and the overthrow the pangs
and agonies of human and of brute
multitudes fugitive on every side
and fugitive in vain  the sylvan scene
migrates uplifted and with all its soil
alighting in fardistant fields finds out
a new possessor and survives the change
ocean has caught the frenzy and upwrought
to an enormous and oerbearing height
not by a mighty wind but by that voice
which winds and waves obey invades the shore
resistless  never such a sudden flood
upridged so high and sent on such a charge
possessed an inland scene  where now the throng
that pressed the beach and hasty to depart
looked to the sea for safety  they are gone
gone with the refluent wave into the deep
a prince with half his people  ancient towers
and roofs embattled high the gloomy scenes
where beauty oft and lettered worth consume
life in the unproductive shades of death
fall prone  the pale inhabitants come forth
and happy in their unforeseen release
from all the rigours of restraint enjoy
the terrors of the day that sets them free
who then that has thee would not hold thee fast
freedom whom they that lose thee so regret
that even a judgment making way for thee
seems in their eyes a mercy for thy sake

such evil sin hath wrought and such a flame
kindled in heaven that it burns down to earth
and in the furious inquest that it makes
on gods behalf lays waste his fairest works
the very elements though each be meant
the minister of man to serve his wants
conspire against him  with his breath he draws
a plague into his blood and cannot use
lifes necessary means but he must die
storms rise to oerwhelm him  or if stormy winds
rise not the waters of the deep shall rise
and needing none assistance of the storm
shall roll themselves ashore and reach him there
the earth shall shake him out of all his holds
or make his house his grave nor so content
shall counterfeit the motions of the flood
and drown him in her dry and dusty gulfs
what thenwere they the wicked above all
and we the righteous whose fastanchored isle
moved not while theirs was rocked like a light skiff
the sport of every wave  no  none are clear
and none than we more guilty  but where all
stand chargeable with guilt and to the shafts
of wrath obnoxious god may choose his mark
may punish if he please the less to warn
the more malignant  if he spared not them
tremble and be amazed at thine escape
far guiltier england lest he spare not thee

happy the man who sees a god employed
in all the good and ill that chequer life
resolving all events with their effects
and manifold results into the will
and arbitration wise of the supreme
did not his eye rule all things and intend
the least of our concerns since from the least
the greatest oft originate could chance
find place in his dominion or dispose
one lawless particle to thwart his plan
then god might be surprised and unforeseen
contingence might alarm him and disturb
the smooth and equal course of his affairs
this truth philosophy though eagleeyed
in natures tendencies oft overlooks
and having found his instrument forgets
or disregards or more presumptuous still
denies the power that wields it  god proclaims
his hot displeasure against foolish men
that live an atheist life  involves the heaven
in tempests quits his grasp upon the winds
and gives them all their fury bids a plague
kindle a fiery boil upon the skin
and putrefy the breath of blooming health
he calls for famine and the meagre fiend
blows mildew from between his shrivelled lips
and taints the golden ear  he springs his mines
and desolates a nation at a blast
forth steps the spruce philosopher and tells
of homogeneal and discordant springs
and principles of causes how they work
by necessary laws their sure effects
of action and reaction  he has found
the source of the disease that nature feels
and bids the world take heart and banish fear
thou fool will thy discovery of the cause
suspend the effect or heal it  has not god
still wrought by means since first he made the world
and did he not of old employ his means
to drown it  what is his creation less
than a capacious reservoir of means
formed for his use and ready at his will
go dress thine eyes with eyesalve ask of him
or ask of whomsoever he has taught
and learn though late the genuine cause of all

england with all thy faults i love thee still
my country and while yet a nook is left
where english minds and manners may be found
shall be constrained to love thee  though thy clime
be fickle and thy year most part deformed
with dripping rains or withered by a frost
i would not yet exchange thy sullen skies
and fields without a flower for warmer france
with all her vines nor for ausonias groves
of golden fruitage and her myrtle bowers
to shake thy senate and from heights sublime
of patriot eloquence to flash down fire
upon thy foes was never meant my task
but i can feel thy fortune and partake
thy joys and sorrows with as true a heart
as any thunderer there  and i can feel
thy follies too and with a just disdain
frown at effeminates whose very looks
reflect dishonour on the land i love
how in the name of soldiership and sense
should england prosper when such things as smooth
and tender as a girl all essenced oer
with odours and as profligate as sweet
who sell their laurel for a myrtle wreath
and love when they should fight when such as these
presume to lay their hand upon the ark
of her magnificent and awful cause
time was when it was praise and boast enough
in every clime and travel where we might
that we were born her children  praise enough
to fill the ambition of a private man
that chathams language was his mother tongue
and wolfes great name compatriot with his own
farewell those honours and farewell with them
the hope of such hereafter  they have fallen
each in his field of glory one in arms
and one in councilwolfe upon the lap
of smiling victory that moment won
and chatham heartsick of his countrys shame
they made us many soldiers  chatham still
consulting englands happiness at home
secured it by an unforgiving frown
if any wronged her  wolfe whereer he fought
put so much of his heart into his act
that his example had a magnets force
and all were swift to follow whom all loved
those suns are set  oh rise some other such
or all that we have left is empty talk
of old achievements and despair of new

now hoist the sail and let the streamers float
upon the wanton breezes  strew the deck
with lavender and sprinkle liquid sweets
that no rude savour maritime invade
the nose of nice nobility  breathe soft
ye clarionets and softer still ye flutes
that winds and waters lulled by magic sounds
may bear us smoothly to the gallic shore
true we have lost an empirelet it pass
true we may thank the perfidy of france
that picked the jewel out of englands crown
with all the cunning of an envious shrew
and let that passtwas but a trick of state
a brave man knows no malice but at once
forgets in peace the injuries of war
and gives his direst foe a friends embrace
and shamed as we have been to the very beard
braved and defied and in our own sea proved
too weak for those decisive blows that once
insured us mastery there we yet retain
some small preeminence we justly boast
at least superior jockeyship and claim
the honours of the turf as all our own
go then well worthy of the praise ye seek
and show the shame ye might conceal at home
in foreign eyesbe grooms and win the plate
where once your nobler fathers won a crown
tis generous to communicate your skill
to those that need it  folly is soon learned
and under such preceptors who can fail

there is a pleasure in poetic pains
which only poets know  the shifts and turns
the expedients and inventions multiform
to which the mind resorts in chase of terms
though apt yet coy and difficult to win
to arrest the fleeting images that fill
the mirror of the mind and hold them fast
and force them sit till he has pencilled off
a faithful likeness of the forms he views
then to dispose his copies with such art
that each may find its most propitious light
and shine by situation hardly less
than by the labour and the skill it cost
are occupations of the poets mind
so pleasing and that steal away the thought
with such address from themes of sad import
that lost in his own musings happy man
he feels the anxieties of life denied
their wonted entertainment all retire
such joys has he that sings  but ah not such
or seldom such the hearers of his song
fastidious or else listless or perhaps
aware of nothing arduous in a task
they never undertook they little note
his dangers or escapes and haply find
there least amusement where he found the most
but is amusement all studious of song
and yet ambitious not to sing in vain
i would not trifle merely though the world
be loudest in their praise who do no more
yet what can satire whether grave or gay
it may correct a foible may chastise
the freaks of fashion regulate the dress
retrench a swordblade or displace a patch
but where are its sublimer trophies found
what vice has it subdued whose heart reclaimed
by rigour or whom laughed into reform
alas leviathan is not so tamed
laughed at he laughs again and stricken hard
turns to the stroke his adamantine scales
that fear no discipline of human hands

the pulpit thereforeand i name it filled
with solemn awe that bids me well beware
with what intent i touch that holy thing
the pulpit when the satirist has at last
strutting and vapouring in an empty school
spent all his force and made no proselyte
i say the pulpit in the sober use
of its legitimate peculiar powers
must stand acknowledged while the world shall stand
the most important and effectual guard
support and ornament of virtues cause
there stands the messenger of truth there stands
the legate of the skies his theme divine
his office sacred his credentials clear
by him the violated law speaks out
its thunders and by him in strains as sweet
as angels use the gospel whispers peace
he stablishes the strong restores the weak
reclaims the wanderer binds the broken heart
and armed himself in panoply complete
of heavenly temper furnishes with arms
bright as his own and trains by every rule
of holy discipline to glorious war
the sacramental host of gods elect
are all such teachers would to heaven all were
but harkthe doctors voicefast wedged between
two empirics he stands and with swollen cheeks
inspires the news his trumpet  keener far
than all invective is his bold harangue
while through that public organ of report
he hails the clergy and defying shame
announces to the world his own and theirs
he teaches those to read whom schools dismissed
and colleges untaught sells accents tone
and emphasis in score and gives to prayer
the adagio and andante it demands
he grinds divinity of other days
down into modern use transforms old print
to zigzag manuscript and cheats the eyes
of gallery critics by a thousand arts
are there who purchase of the doctors ware
oh name it not in gathit cannot be
that grave and learned clerks should need such aid
he doubtless is in sport and does but droll
assuming thus a rank unknown before
grand caterer and drynurse of the church

i venerate the man whose heart is warm
whose hands are pure whose doctrine and whose life
coincident exhibit lucid proof
that he is honest in the sacred cause
to such i render more than mere respect
whose actions say that they respect themselves
but loose in morals and in manners vain
in conversation frivolous in dress
extreme at once rapacious and profuse
frequent in park with lady at his side
ambling and prattling scandal as he goes
but rare at home and never at his books
or with his pen save when he scrawls a card
constant at routs familiar with a round
of ladyships a stranger to the poor
ambitions of preferment for its gold
and well prepared by ignorance and sloth
by infidelity and love o the world
to make gods work a sinecure a slave
to his own pleasures and his patrons pride
from such apostles o ye mitred heads
preserve the church and lay not careless hands
on skulls that cannot teach and will not learn

would i describe a preacher such as paul
were he on earth would hear approve and own
paul should himself direct me  i would trace
his masterstrokes and draw from his design
i would express him simple grave sincere
in doctrine uncorrupt in language plain
and plain in manner decent solemn chaste
and natural in gesture much impressed
himself as conscious of his awful charge
and anxious mainly that the flock he feeds
may feel it too affectionate in look
and tender in address as well becomes
a messenger of grace to guilty men
behold the pictureis it likelike whom
the things that mount the rostrum with a skip
and then skip down again pronounce a text
cryhem and reading what they never wrote
just fifteen minutes huddle up their work
and with a wellbred whisper close the scene

in man or woman but far most in man
and most of all in man that ministers
and serves the altar in my soul i loathe
all affectation  tis my perfect scorn
object of my implacable disgust
whatwill a man play tricks will he indulge
a silly fond conceit of his fair form
and just proportion fashionable mien
and pretty face in presence of his god
or will he seek to dazzle me with tropes
as with the diamond on his lily hand
and play his brilliant parts before my eyes
when i am hungry for the bread of life
he mocks his maker prostitutes and shames
his noble office and instead of truth
displaying his own beauty starves his flock
therefore avaunt all attitude and stare
and start theatric practised at the glass
i seek divine simplicity in him
who handles things divine and all beside
though learned with labour and though much admired
by curious eyes and judgments illinformed
to me is odious as the nasal twang
heard at conventicle where worthy men
misled by custom strain celestial themes
through the prest nostril spectaclebestrid
some decent in demeanour while they preach
that task performed relapse into themselves
and having spoken wisely at the close
grow wanton and give proof to every eye
whoeer was edified themselves were not
forth comes the pocket mirror  first we stroke
an eyebrow next compose a straggling lock
then with an air most gracefully performed
fall back into our seat extend an arm
and lay it at its ease with gentle care
with handkerchief in hand depending low
the better hand more busy gives the nose
its bergamot or aids the indebted eye
with opera glass to watch the moving scene
and recognise the slowretiring fair
now this is fulsome and offends me more
than in a churchman slovenly neglect
and rustic coarseness would  a heavenly mind
may be indifferent to her house of clay
and slight the hovel as beneath her care
but how a body so fantastic trim
and quaint in its deportment and attire
can lodge a heavenly minddemands a doubt

he that negotiates between god and man
as gods ambassador the grand concerns
of judgment and of mercy should beware
of lightness in his speech  tis pitiful
to court a grin when you should woo a soul
to break a jest when pity would inspire
pathetic exhortation and to address
the skittish fancy with facetious tales
when sent with gods commission to the heart
so did not paul  direct me to a quip
or merry turn in all he ever wrote
and i consent you take it for your text
your only one till sides and benches fail
no  he was serious in a serious cause
and understood too well the weighty terms
that he had taen in charge  he would not stoop
to conquer those by jocular exploits
whom truth and soberness assailed in vain

oh popular applause what heart of man
is proof against thy sweet seducing charms
the wisest and the best feel urgent need
of all their caution in thy gentlest gales
but swelled into a gustwho then alas
with all his canvas set and inexpert
and therefore heedless can withstand thy power
praise from the riveled lips of toothless bald
decrepitude and in the looks of lean
and craving poverty and in the bow
respectful of the smutched artificer
is oft too welcome and may much disturb
the bias of the purpose  how much more
poured forth by beauty splendid and polite
in language soft as adoration breathes
ah spare your idol think him human still
charms he may have but he has frailties too
dote not too much nor spoil what ye admire

all truth is from the sempiternal source
of light divine  but egypt greece and rome
drew from the stream below  more favoured we
drink when we choose it at the fountain head
to them it flowed much mingled and defiled
with hurtful error prejudice and dreams
illusive of philosophy so called
but falsely  sages after sages strove
in vain to filter off a crystal draught
pure from the lees which often more enhanced
the thirst than slaked it and not seldom bred
intoxication and delirium wild
in vain they pushed inquiry to the birth
and springtime of the world asked whence is man
why formed at all and wherefore as he is
where must he find his maker  with what rites
adore him  will he hear accept and bless
or does he sit regardless of his works
has man within him an immortal seed
or does the tomb take all  if he survive
his ashes where and in what weal or woe
knots worthy of solution which alone
a deity could solve  their answers vague
and all at random fabulous and dark
left them as dark themselves  their rules of life
defective and unsanctioned proved too weak
to bind the roving appetite and lead
blind nature to a god not yet revealed
tis revelation satisfies all doubts
explains all mysteries except her own
and so illuminates the path of life
that fools discover it and stray no more
now tell me dignified and sapient sir
my man of morals nurtured in the shades
of academus is this false or true
is christ the abler teacher or the schools
if christ then why resort at every turn
to athens or to rome for wisdom short
of mans occasions when in him reside
grace knowledge comfort an unfathomed store
how oft when paul has served us with a text
has epictetus plato tully preached
men that if now alive would sit content
and humble learners of a saviours worth
preach it who might  such was their love of truth
their thirst of knowledge and their candour too

and thus it is  the pastor either vain
by nature or by flattery made so taught
to gaze at his own splendour and to exalt
absurdly not his office but himself
or unenlightened and too proud to learn
or vicious and not therefore apt to teach
perverting often by the stress of lewd
and loose example whom he should instruct
exposes and holds up to broad disgrace
the noblest function and discredits much
the brightest truths that man has ever seen
for ghostly counsel if it either fall
below the exigence or be not backed
with show of love at least with hopeful proof
of some sincerity on the givers part
or be dishonoured in the exterior form
and mode of its conveyance by such tricks
as move derision or by foppish airs
and histrionic mummery that let down
the pulpit to the level of the stage
drops from the lips a disregarded thing
the weak perhaps are moved but are not taught
while prejudice in men of stronger minds
takes deeper root confirmed by what they see
a relaxation of religions hold
upon the roving and untutored heart
soon follows and the curb of conscience snapt
the laity run wildbut do they now
note their extravagance and be convinced

as nations ignorant of god contrive
a wooden one so we no longer taught
by monitors that mother church supplies
now make our own  posterity will ask
if eer posterity sees verse of mine
some fifty or a hundred lustrums hence
what was a monitor in georges days
my very gentle reader yet unborn
of whom i needs must augur better things
since heaven would sure grow weary of a world
productive only of a race like us
a monitor is woodplank shaven thin
we wear it at our backs  there closely braced
and neatly fitted it compresses hard
the prominent and most unsightly bones
and binds the shoulders flat  we prove its use
sovereign and most effectual to secure
a form not now gymnastic as of yore
from rickets and distortion else our lot
but thus admonished we can walk erect
one proof at least of manhood while the friend
sticks close a mentor worthy of his charge
our habits costlier than lucullus wore
and by caprice as multiplied as his
just please us while the fashion is at full
but change with every moon  the sycophant
that waits to dress us arbitrates their date
surveys his fair reversion with keen eye
finds one ill made another obsolete
this fits not nicely that is ill conceived
and making prize of all that he condemns
with our expenditure defrays his own
varietys the very spice of life
that gives it all its flavour  we have run
through every change that fancy at the loom
exhausted has had genius to supply
and studious of mutation still discard
a real elegance a little used
for monstrous novelty and strange disguise
we sacrifice to dress till household joys
and comforts cease  dress drains our cellar dry
and keeps our larder lean puts out our fires
and introduces hunger frost and woe
where peace and hospitality might reign
what man that lives and that knows how to live
would fail to exhibit at the public shows
a form as splendid as the proudest there
though appetite raise outcries at the cost
a man o the town dines late but soon enough
with reasonable forecast and despatch
to ensure a sidebox station at halfprice
you think perhaps so delicate his dress
his daily fare as delicate  alas
he picks clean teeth and busy as he seems
with an old tavern quill is hungry yet
the rout is follys circle which she draws
with magic wand  so potent is the spell
that none decoyed into that fatal ring
unless by heavens peculiar grace escape
there we grow early gray but never wise
there form connections and acquire no friend
solicit pleasure hopeless of success
waste youth in occupations only fit
for second childhood and devote old age
to sports which only childhood could excuse
there they are happiest who dissemble best
their weariness and they the most polite
who squander time and treasure with a smile
though at their own destruction  she that asks
her dear five hundred friends contemns them all
and hates their coming  they what can they less
make just reprisals and with cringe and shrug
and bow obsequious hide their hate of her
all catch the frenzy downward from her grace
whose flambeaux flash against the morning skies
and gild our chamber ceilings as they pass
to her who frugal only that her thrift
may feed excesses she can ill afford
is hackneyed home unlackeyed who in haste
alighting turns the key in her own door
and at the watchmans lantern borrowing light
finds a cold bed her only comfort left
wives beggar husbands husbands starve their wives
on fortunes velvet altar offering up
their last poor pittancefortune most severe
of goddesses yet known and costlier far
than all that held their routs in junos heaven
so fare we in this prisonhouse the world
and tis a fearful spectacle to see
so many maniacs dancing in their chains
they gaze upon the links that hold them fast
with eyes of anguish execrate their lot
then shake them in despair and dance again

now basket up the family of plagues
that waste our vitals  peculation sale
of honour perjury corruption frauds
by forgery by subterfuge of law
by tricks and lies as numerous and as keen
as the necessities their authors feel
then cast them closely bundled every brat
at the right door  profusion is its sire
profusion unrestrained with all thats base
in character has littered all the land
and bred within the memory of no few
a priesthood such as baals was of old
a people such as never was till now
it is a hungry viceit eats up all
that gives society its beauty strength
convenience and security and use
makes men mere vermin worthy to be trapped
and gibbeted as fast as catchpole claws
can seize the slippery prey unties the knot
of union and converts the sacred band
that holds mankind together to a scourge
profusion deluging a state with lusts
of grossest nature and of worst effects
prepares it for its ruin hardens blinds
and warps the consciences of public men
till they can laugh at virtue mock the fools
that trust them and in the end disclose a face
that would have shocked credulity herself
unmasked vouchsafing this their sole excuse
since all alike are selfish why not they
this does profusion and the accursed cause
of such deep mischief has itself a cause

in colleges and halls in ancient days
when learning virtue piety and truth
were precious and inculcated with care
there dwelt a sage called discipline  his head
not yet by time completely silvered oer
bespoke him past the bounds of freakish youth
but strong for service still and unimpaired
his eye was meek and gentle and a smile
played on his lips and in his speech was heard
paternal sweetness dignity and love
the occupation dearest to his heart
was to encourage goodness  he would stroke
the head of modest and ingenuous worth
that blushed at its own praise and press the youth
close to his side that pleased him  learning grew
beneath his care a thriving vigorous plant
the mind was well informed the passions held
subordinate and diligence was choice
if eer it chanced as sometimes chance it must
that one among so many overleaped
the limits of control his gentle eye
grew stern and darted a severe rebuke
his frown was full of terror and his voice
shook the delinquent with such fits of awe
as left him not till penitence had won
lost favour back again and closed the breach
but discipline a faithful servant long
declined at length into the vale of years
a palsy struck his arm his sparkling eye
was quenched in rheums of age his voice unstrung
grew tremulous and moved derision more
than reverence in perverse rebellious youth
so colleges and halls neglected much
their good old friend and discipline at length
oerlooked and unemployed fell sick and died
then study languished emulation slept
and virtue fled  the schools became a scene
of solemn farce where ignorance in stilts
his cap well lined with logic not his own
with parrot tongue performed the scholars part
proceeding soon a graduated dunce
then compromise had place and scrutiny
became stoneblind precedence went in truck
and he was competent whose purse was so
a dissolution of all bonds ensued
the curbs invented for the mulish mouth
of headstrong youth were broken bars and bolts
grew rusty by disuse and massy gates
forgot their office opening with a touch
till gowns at length are found mere masquerade
the tasselled cap and the spruce band a jest
a mockery of the world  what need of these
for gamesters jockeys brothellers impure
spendthrifts and booted sportsmen oftener seen
with belted waist and pointers at their heels
than in the bounds of duty  what was learned
if aught was learned in childhood is forgot
and such expense as pinches parents blue
and mortifies the liberal hand of love
is squandered in pursuit of idle sports
and vicious pleasures buys the boy a name
that sits a stigma on his fathers house
and cleaves through life inseparably close
to him that wears it  what can aftergames
of riper joys and commerce with the world
the lewd vain world that must receive him soon
add to such erudition thus acquired
where science and where virtue are professed
they may confirm his habits rivet fast
his folly but to spoil him is a task
that bids defiance to the united powers
of fashion dissipation taverns stews
now blame we most the nurselings or the nurse
the children crooked and twisted and deformed
through want of care or her whose winking eye
and slumbering oscitancy mars the brood
the nurse no doubt  regardless of her charge
she needs herself correction needs to learn
that it is dangerous sporting with the world
with things so sacred as a nations trust
the nurture of her youth her dearest pledge

all are not such  i had a brother once
peace to the memory of a man of worth
a man of letters and of manners too
of manners sweet as virtue always wears
when gay goodnature dresses her in smiles
he graced a college in which order yet
was sacred and was honoured loved and wept
by more than one themselves conspicuous there
some minds are tempered happily and mixt
with such ingredients of good sense and taste
of what is excellent in man they thirst
with such a zeal to be what they approve
that no restraints can circumscribe them more
than they themselves by choice for wisdoms sake
nor can example hurt them  what they see
of vice in others but enhancing more
the charms of virtue in their just esteem
if such escape contagion and emerge
pure from so foul a pool to shine abroad
and give the world their talents and themselves
small thanks to those whose negligence or sloth
exposed their inexperience to the snare
and left them to an undirected choice

see then the quiver broken and decayed
in which are kept our arrows  rusting there
in wild disorder and unfit for use
what wonder if discharged into the world
they shame their shooters with a random flight
their points obtuse and feathers drunk with wine
well may the church wage unsuccessful war
with such artillery armed  vice parries wide
the undreaded volley with a sword of straw
and stands an impudent and fearless mark

have we not tracked the felon home and found
his birthplace and his dam  the country mourns
mourns because every plague that can infest
society that saps and worms the base
of the edifice that policy has raised
swarms in all quarters meets the eye the ear
and suffocates the breath at every turn
profusion breeds them  and the cause itself
of that calamitous mischief has been found
found too where most offensive in the skirts
of the robed pedagogue  else let the arraigned
stand up unconscious and refute the charge
so when the jewish leader stretched his arm
and waved his rod divine a race obscene
spawned in the muddy beds of nile came forth
polluting egypt  gardens fields and plains
were covered with the pest  the streets were filled
the croaking nuisance lurked in every nook
nor palaces nor even chambers scaped
and the land stank so numerous was the fry



book iii

the garden

as one who long in thickets and in brakes
entangled winds now this way and now that
his devious course uncertain seeking home
or having long in miry ways been foiled
and sore discomfited from slough to slough
plunging and half despairing of escape
if chance at length he find a greensward smooth
and faithful to the foot his spirits rise
he chirrups brisk his earerecting steed
and winds his way with pleasure and with ease
so i designing other themes and called
to adorn the sofa with eulogium due
to tell its slumbers and to paint its dreams
have rambled wide  in country city seat
of academic fame howeer deserved
long held and scarcely disengaged at last
but now with pleasant pace a cleanlier road
i mean to tread  i feel myself at large
courageous and refreshed for future toil
if toil await me or if dangers new

since pulpits fail and soundingboards reflect
most part an empty ineffectual sound
what chance that i to fame so little known
nor conversant with men or manners much
should speak to purpose or with better hope
crack the satiric thong  twere wiser far
for me enamoured of sequestered scenes
and charmed with rural beauty to repose
where chance may throw me beneath elm or vine
my languid limbs when summer sears the plains
or when rough winter rages on the soft
and sheltered sofa while the nitrous air
feeds a blue flame and makes a cheerful hearth
there undisturbed by folly and apprised
how great the danger of disturbing her
to muse in silence or at least confine
remarks that gall so many to the few
my partners in retreat  disgust concealed
is ofttimes proof of wisdom when the fault
is obstinate and cure beyond our reach

domestic happiness thou only bliss
of paradise that has survived the fall
though few now taste thee unimpaired and pure
or tasting long enjoy thee too infirm
or too incautious to preserve thy sweets
unmixed with drops of bitter which neglect
or temper sheds into thy crystal cup
thou art the nurse of virtue  in thine arms
she smiles appearing as in truth she is
heavenborn and destined to the skies again
thou art not known where pleasure is adored
that reeling goddess with the zoneless waist
and wandering eyes still leaning on the arm
of novelty her fickle frail support
for thou art meek and constant hating change
and finding in the calm of truthtried love
joys that her stormy raptures never yield
forsaking thee what shipwreck have we made
of honour dignity and fair renown
till prostitution elbows us aside
in all our crowded streets and senates seem
convened for purposes of empire less
than to release the adultress from her bond
the adultress what a theme for angry verse
what provocation to the indignant heart
that feels for injured love but i disdain
the nauseous task to paint her as she is
cruel abandoned glorying in her shame
no let her pass and charioted along
in guilty splendour shake the public ways
the frequency of crimes has washed them white
and verse of mine shall never brand the wretch
whom matrons now of character unsmirched
and chaste themselves are not ashamed to own
virtue and vice had boundaries in old time
not to be passed and she that had renounced
her sexs honour was renounced herself
by all that prized it not for pruderys sake
but dignitys resentful of the wrong
twas hard perhaps on here and there a waif
desirous to return and not received
but was a wholesome rigour in the main
and taught the unblemished to preserve with care
that purity whose loss was loss of all
men too were nice in honour in those days
and judged offenders well  then he that sharped
and pocketed a prize by fraud obtained
was marked and shunned as odious  he that sold
his country or was slack when she required
his every nerve in action and at stretch
paid with the blood that he had basely spared
the price of his default  but nowyes now
we are become so candid and so fair
so liberal in construction and so rich
in christian charity goodnatured age
that they are safe sinners of either sex
transgress what laws they may  well dressed well bred
well equipaged is ticket good enough
to pass us readily through every door
hypocrisy detest her as we may
and no mans hatred ever wronged her yet
may claim this merit stillthat she admits
the worth of what she mimics with such care
and thus gives virtue indirect applause
but she has burnt her mask not needed here
where vice has such allowance that her shifts
and specious semblances have lost their use

i was a stricken deer that left the herd
long since with many an arrow deep infixt
my panting side was charged when i withdrew
to seek a tranquil death in distant shades
there was i found by one who had himself
been hurt by the archers  in his side he bore
and in his hands and feet the cruel scars
with gentle force soliciting the darts
he drew them forth and healed and bade me live
since then with few associates in remote
and silent woods i wander far from those
my former partners of the peopled scene
with few associates and not wishing more
here much i ruminate as much i may
with other views of men and manners now
than once and others of a life to come
i see that all are wanderers gone astray
each in his own delusions they are lost
in chase of fancied happiness still wood
and never won  dream after dream ensues
and still they dream that they shall still succeed
and still are disappointed  rings the world
with the vain stir  i sum up half mankind
and add twothirds of the remaining half
and find the total of their hopes and fears
dreams empty dreams  the million flit as gay
as if created only like the fly
that spreads his motley wings in the eye of noon
to sport their season and be seen no more
the rest are sober dreamers grave and wise
and pregnant with discoveries new and rare
some write a narrative of wars and feats
of heroes little known and call the rant
a history describe the man of whom
his own coevals took but little note
and paint his person character and views
as they had known him from his mothers womb
they disentangle from the puzzled skein
in which obscurity has wrapped them up
the threads of politic and shrewd design
that ran through all his purposes and charge
his mind with meanings that he never had
or having kept concealed  some drill and bore
the solid earth and from the strata there
extract a register by which we learn
that he who made it and revealed its date
to moses was mistaken in its age
some more acute and more industrious still
contrive creation travel nature up
to the sharp peak of her sublimest height
and tell us whence the stars why some are fixt
and planetary some what gave them first
rotation from what fountain flowed their light
great contest follows and much learned dust
involves the combatants each claiming truth
and truth disclaiming both  and thus they spend
the little wick of lifes poor shallow lamp
in playing tricks with nature giving laws
to distant worlds and trifling in their own
ist not a pity now that tickling rheums
should ever tease the lungs and blear the sight
of oracles like these  great pity too
that having wielded the elements and built
a thousand systems each in his own way
they should go out in fume and be forgot
ah what is life thus spent and what are they
but frantic who thus spend it all for smoke
eternity for bubbles proves at last
a senseless bargain  when i see such games
played by the creatures of a power who swears
that he will judge the earth and call the fool
to a sharp reckoning that has lived in vain
and when i weigh this seeming wisdom well
and prove it in the infallible result
so hollow and so falsei feel my heart
dissolve in pity and account the learned
if this be learning most of all deceived
great crimes alarm the conscience but it sleeps
while thoughtful man is plausibly amused
defend me therefore common sense say i
from reveries so airy from the toil
of dropping buckets into empty wells
and growing old in drawing nothing up

twere well says one sage erudite profound
terribly arched and aquiline his nose
and overbuilt with most impending brows
twere well could you permit the world to live
as the world pleases  whats the world to you
much  i was born of woman and drew milk
as sweet as charity from human breasts
i think articulate i laugh and weep
and exercise all functions of a man
how then should i and any man that lives
be strangers to each other  pierce my vein
take of the crimson stream meandering there
and catechise it well  apply your glass
search it and prove now if it be not blood
congenial with thine own and if it be
what edge of subtlety canst thou suppose
keen enough wise and skilful as thou art
to cut the link of brotherhood by which
one common maker bound me to the kind
true i am no proficient i confess
in arts like yours  i cannot call the swift
and perilous lightnings from the angry clouds
and bid them hide themselves in the earth beneath
i cannot analyse the air nor catch
the parallax of yonder luminous point
that seems half quenched in the immense abyss
such powers i boast notneither can i rest
a silent witness of the headlong rage
or heedless folly by which thousands die
bone of my bone and kindred souls to mine

god never meant that man should scale the heavens
by strides of human wisdom  in his works
though wondrous he commands us in his word
to seek him rather where his mercy shines
the mind indeed enlightened from above
views him in all ascribes to the grand cause
the grand effect acknowledges with joy
his manner and with rapture tastes his style
but never yet did philosophic tube
that brings the planets home into the eye
of observation and discovers else
not visible his family of worlds
discover him that rules them such a veil
hangs over mortal eyes blind from the birth
and dark in things divine  full often too
our wayward intellect the more we learn
of nature overlooks her author more
from instrumental causes proud to draw
conclusions retrograde and mad mistake
but if his word once teach us shoot a ray
through all the hearts dark chambers and reveal
truths undiscerned but by that holy light
then all is plain  philosophy baptised
in the pure fountain of eternal love
has eyes indeed and viewing all she sees
as meant to indicate a god to man
gives him his praise and forfeits not her own
learning has borne such fruit in other days
on all her branches  piety has found
friends in the friends of science and true prayer
has flowed from lips wet with castalian dews
such was thy wisdom newton childlike sage
sagacious reader of the works of god
and in his word sagacious  such too thine
milton whose genius had angelic wings
and fed on manna  and such thine in whom
our british themis gloried with just cause
immortal hale for deep discernment praised
and sound integrity not more than famed
for sanctity of manners undefiled

all flesh is grass and all its glory fades
like the fair flower dishevelled in the wind
riches have wings and grandeur is a dream
the man we celebrate must find a tomb
and we that worship him ignoble graves
nothing is proof against the general curse
of vanity that seizes all below
the only amaranthine flower on earth
is virtue the only lasting treasure truth
but what is truth twas pilates question put
to truth itself that deigned him no reply
and wherefore will not god impart his light
to them that ask itfreelytis his joy
his glory and his nature to impart
but to the proud uncandid insincere
or negligent inquirer not a spark
whats that which brings contempt upon a book
and him that writes it though the style be neat
the method clear and argument exact
that makes a minister in holy things
the joy of many and the dread of more
his name a theme for praise and for reproach
that while it gives us worth in gods account
depreciates and undoes us in our own
what pearl is it that rich men cannot buy
that learning is too proud to gather up
but which the poor and the despised of all
seek and obtain and often find unsought
tell me and i will tell thee what is truth

oh friendly to the best pursuits of man
friendly to thought to virtue and to peace
domestic life in rural leisure passed
few know thy value and few taste thy sweets
though many boast thy favours and affect
to understand and choose thee for their own
but foolish man foregoes his proper bliss
even as his first progenitor and quits
though placed in paradise for earth has still
some traces of her youthful beauty left
substantial happiness for transient joy
scenes formed for contemplation and to nurse
the growing seeds of wisdom that suggest
by every pleasing image they present
reflections such as meliorate the heart
compose the passions and exalt the mind
scenes such as these tis his supreme delight
to fill with riot and defile with blood
should some contagion kind to the poor brutes
we persecute annihilate the tribes
that draw the sportsman over hill and dale
fearless and rapt away from all his cares
should never gamefowl hatch her eggs again
nor baited hook deceive the fishs eye
could pageantry and dance and feast and song
be quelled in all our summer months retreats
how many selfdeluded nymphs and swains
who dream they have a taste for fields and groves
would find them hideous nurseries of the spleen
and crowd the roads impatient for the town
they love the country and none else who seek
for their own sake its silence and its shade
delights which who would leave that has a heart
susceptible of pity or a mind
cultured and capable of sober thought
for all the savage din of the swift pack
and clamours of the field  detested sport
that owes its pleasures to anothers pain
that feeds upon the sobs and dying shrieks
of harmless nature dumb but yet endued
with eloquence that agonies inspire
of silent tears and heartdistending sighs
vain tears alas and sighs that never find
a corresponding tone in jovial souls
wellone at least is safe  one sheltered hare
has never heard the sanguinary yell
of cruel man exulting in her woes
innocent partner of my peaceful home
whom ten long years experience of my care
has made at last familiar she has lost
much of her vigilant instinctive dread
not needful here beneath a roof like mine
yesthou mayst eat thy bread and lick the hand
that feeds thee thou mayst frolic on the floor
at evening and at night retire secure
to thy strawcouch and slumber unalarmed
for i have gained thy confidence have pledged
all that is human in me to protect
thine unsuspecting gratitude and love
if i survive thee i will dig thy grave
and when i place thee in it sighing say
i knew at least one hare that had a friend

how various his employments whom the world
calls idle and who justly in return
esteems that busy world an idler too
friends books a garden and perhaps his pen
delightful industry enjoyed at home
and nature in her cultivated trim
dressed to his taste inviting him abroad
can he want occupation who has these
will he be idle who has much to enjoy
me therefore studious of laborious ease
not slothful happy to deceive the time
not waste it and aware that human life
is but a loan to be repaid with use
when he shall call his debtors to account
from whom are all our blessings business finds
even here  while sedulous i seek to improve
at least neglect not or leave unemployed
the mind he gave me driving it though slack
too oft and much impeded in its work
by causes not to be divulged in vain
to its just pointthe service of mankind
he that attends to his interior self
that has a heart and keeps it has a mind
that hungers and supplies it and who seeks
a social not a dissipated life
has business feels himself engaged to achieve
no unimportant though a silent task
a life all turbulence and noise may seem
to him that leads it wise and to be praised
but wisdom is a pearl with most success
sought in still water and beneath clear skies
he that is ever occupied in storms
or dives not for it or brings up instead
vainly industrious a disgraceful prize

the morning finds the selfsequestered man
fresh for his task intend what task he may
whether inclement seasons recommend
his warm but simple home where he enjoys
with her who shares his pleasures and his heart
sweet converse sipping calm the fragrant lymph
which neatly she prepares then to his book
well chosen and not sullenly perused
in selfish silence but imparted oft
as aught occurs that she may smile to hear
or turn to nourishment digested well
or if the garden with its many cares
all well repaid demand him he attends
the welcome call conscious how much the hand
of lubbard labour needs his watchful eye
oft loitering lazily if not oerseen
or misapplying his unskilful strength
nor does he govern only or direct
but much performs himself no works indeed
that ask robust tough sinews bred to toil
servile employbut such as may amuse
not tire demanding rather skill than force
proud of his wellspread walls he views his trees
that meet no barren interval between
with pleasure more than even their fruits afford
which save himself who trains them none can feel
these therefore are his own peculiar charge
no meaner hand may discipline the shoots
none but his steel approach them  what is weak
distempered or has lost prolific powers
impaired by age his unrelenting hand
dooms to the knife  nor does he spare the soft
and succulent that feeds its giant growth
but barren at the expense of neighbouring twigs
less ostentatious and yet studded thick
with hopeful gems  the rest no portion left
that may disgrace his art or disappoint
large expectation he disposes neat
at measured distances that air and sun
admitted freely may afford their aid
and ventilate and warm the swelling buds
hence summer has her riches autumn hence
and hence even winter fills his withered hand
with blushing fruits and plenty not his own
fair recompense of labour well bestowed
and wise precaution which a clime so rude
makes needful still whose spring is but the child
of churlish winter in her froward moods
discovering much the temper of her sire
for oft as if in her the stream of mild
maternal nature had reversed its course
she brings her infants forth with many smiles
but once delivered kills them with a frown
he therefore timely warned himself supplies
her want of care screening and keeping warm
the plenteous bloom that no rough blast may sweep
his garlands from the boughs  again as oft
as the sun peeps and vernal airs breathe mild
the fence withdrawn he gives them evry beam
and spreads his hopes before the blaze of day

to raise the prickly and greencoated gourd
so grateful to the palate and when rare
so coveted else base and disesteemed
food for the vulgar merelyis an art
that toiling ages have but just matured
and at this moment unessayed in song
yet gnats have had and frogs and mice long since
their eulogy those sang the mantuan bard
and these the grecian in ennobling strains
and in thy numbers philips shines for aye
the solitary shilling  pardon then
ye sage dispensers of poetic fame
the ambition of one meaner far whose powers
presuming an attempt not less sublime
pant for the praise of dressing to the taste
of critic appetite no sordid fare
a cucumber while costly yet and scarce

the stable yields a stercoraceous heap
impregnated with quick fermenting salts
and potent to resist the freezing blast
for ere the beech and elm have cast their leaf
deciduous and when now november dark
checks vegetation in the torpid plant
exposed to his cold breath the task begins
warily therefore and with prudent heed
he seeks a favoured spot that where he builds
the agglomerated pile his frame may front
the suns meridian disk and at the back
enjoy close shelter wall or reeds or hedge
impervious to the wind  first he bids spread
dry fern or littered hay that may imbibe
the ascending damps then leisurely impose
and lightly shaking it with agile hand
from the full fork the saturated straw
what longest binds the closest forms secure
the shapely side that as it rises takes
by just degrees an overhanging breadth
sheltering the base with its projected eaves
the uplifted frame compact at every joint
and overlaid with clear translucent glass
he settles next upon the sloping mount
whose sharp declivity shoots off secure
from the dashed pane the deluge as it falls
he shuts it close and the first labour ends
thrice must the voluble and restless earth
spin round upon her axle ere the warmth
slow gathering in the midst through the square mass
diffused attain the surface  when behold
a pestilent and most corrosive steam
like a gross fog boeotian rising fast
and fast condensed upon the dewy sash
asks egress which obtained the overcharged
and drenched conservatory breathes abroad
in volumes wheeling slow the vapour dank
and purified rejoices to have lost
its foul inhabitant  but to assuage
the impatient fervour which it first conceives
within its reeking bosom threatening death
to his young hopes requires discreet delay
experience slow preceptress teaching oft
the way to glory by miscarriage foul
must prompt him and admonish how to catch
the auspicious moment when the tempered heat
friendly to vital motion may afford
soft fermentation and invite the seed
the seed selected wisely plump and smooth
and glossy he commits to pots of size
diminutive well filled with wellprepared
and fruitful soil that has been treasured long
and drunk no moisture from the dripping clouds
these on the warm and genial earth that hides
the smoking manure and oerspreads it all
he places lightly and as time subdues
the rage of fermentation plunges deep
in the soft medium till they stand immersed
then rise the tender germs upstarting quick
and spreading wide their spongy lobes at first
pale wan and livid but assuming soon
if fanned by balmy and nutritious air
strained through the friendly mats a vivid green
two leaves produced two rough indented leaves
cautious he pinches from the second stalk
a pimple that portends a future sprout
and interdicts its growth  thence straight succeed
the branches sturdy to his utmost wish
prolific all and harbingers of more
the crowded roots demand enlargement now
and transplantation in an ampler space
indulged in what they wish they soon supply
large foliage overshadowing golden flowers
blown on the summit of the apparent fruit
these have their sexes and when summer shines
the bee transports the fertilising meal
from flower to flower and even the breathing air
wafts the rich prize to its appointed use
not so when winter scowls  assistant art
then acts in natures office brings to pass
the glad espousals and insures the crop

grudge not ye rich since luxury must have
his dainties and the worlds more numerous half
lives by contriving delicates for you
grudge not the cost  ye little know the cares
the vigilance the labour and the skill
that day and night are exercised and hang
upon the ticklish balance of suspense
that ye may garnish your profuse regales
with summer fruits brought forth by wintry suns
ten thousand dangers lie in wait to thwart
the process  heat and cold and wind and steam
moisture and drought mice worms and swarming flies
minute as dust and numberless oft work
dire disappointment that admits no cure
and which no care can obviate  it were long
too long to tell the expedients and the shifts
which he that fights a season so severe
devises while he guards his tender trust
and oft at last in vain  the learned and wise
sarcastic would exclaim and judge the song
cold as its theme and like its theme the fruit
of too much labour worthless when produced

who loves a garden loves a greenhouse too
unconscious of a less propitious clime
there blooms exotic beauty warm and snug
while the winds whistle and the snows descend
the spiry myrtle with unwithering leaf
shines there and flourishes  the golden boast
of portugal and western india there
the ruddier orange and the paler lime
peep through their polished foliage at the storm
and seem to smile at what they need not fear
the amomum there with intermingling flowers
and cherries hangs her twigs  geranium boasts
her crimson honours and the spangled beau
ficoides glitters bright the winter long
all plants of every leaf that can endure
the winters frown if screened from his shrewd bite
live there and prosper  those ausonia claims
levantine regions these the azores send
their jessamine her jessamine remote
caffraria  foreigners from many lands
they form one social shade as if convened
by magic summons of the orphean lyre
yet such arrangement rarely brought to pass
but by a masters hand disposing well
the gay diversities of leaf and flower
must lend its aid to illustrate all their charms
and dress the regular yet various scene
plant behind plant aspiring in the van
the dwarfish in the rear retired but still
sublime above the rest the statelier stand
so once were ranged the sons of ancient rome
a noble show while roscius trod the stage
and so while garrick as renowned as he
the sons of albion fearing each to lose
some note of natures music from his lips
and covetous of shakespeares beauty seen
in every flash of his farbeaming eye
nor taste alone and wellcontrived display
suffice to give the marshalled ranks the grace
of their complete effect  much yet remains
unsung and many cares are yet behind
and more laborious cares on which depends
their vigour injured soon not soon restored
the soil must be renewed which often washed
loses its treasure of salubrious salts
and disappoints the roots the slender roots
close interwoven where they meet the vase
must smooth be shorn away the sapless branch
must fly before the knife the withered leaf
must be detached and where it strews the floor
swept with a womans neatness breeding else
contagion and disseminating death
discharge but these kind offices and who
would spare that loves them offices like these
well they reward the toil  the sight is pleased
the scent regaled each odoriferous leaf
each opening blossom freely breathes abroad
its gratitude and thanks him with its sweets

so manifold all pleasing in their kind
all healthful are the employs of rural life
reiterated as the wheel of time
runs round still ending and beginning still
nor are these all  to deck the shapely knoll
that softly swelled and gaily dressed appears
a flowery island from the dark green lawn
emerging must be deemed a labour due
to no mean hand and asks the touch of taste
here also grateful mixture of wellmatched
and sorted hues each giving each relief
and by contrasted beauty shining more
is needful  strength may wield the ponderous spade
may turn the clod and wheel the compost home
but elegance chief grace the garden shows
and most attractive is the fair result
of thought the creature of a polished mind
without it all is gothic as the scene
to which the insipid citizen resorts
near yonder heath where industry misspent
but proud of his uncouth illchosen task
has made a heaven on earth with suns and moons
of closerammed stones has charged the encumbered soil
and fairly laid the zodiac in the dust
he therefore who would see his flowers disposed
sightly and in just order ere he gives
the beds the trusted treasure of their seeds
forecasts the future whole that when the scene
shall break into its preconceived display
each for itself and all as with one voice
conspiring may attest his bright design
nor even then dismissing as performed
his pleasant work may he suppose it done
few selfsupported flowers endure the wind
uninjured but expect the upholding aid
of the smoothshaven prop and neatly tied
are wedded thus like beauty to old age
for interest sake the living to the dead
some clothe the soil that feeds them far diffused
and lowly creeping modest and yet fair
like virtue thriving most where little seen
some more aspiring catch the neighbour shrub
with clasping tendrils and invest his branch
else unadorned with many a gay festoon
and fragrant chaplet recompensing well
the strength they borrow with the grace they lend
all hate the rank society of weeds
noisome and very greedy to exhaust
the impoverished earth an overbearing race
that like the multitude made factionmad
disturb good order and degrade true worth

oh blest seclusion from a jarring world
which he thus occupied enjoys  retreat
cannot indeed to guilty man restore
lost innocence or cancel follies past
but it has peace and much secures the mind
from all assaults of evil proving still
a faithful barrier not oerleaped with ease
by vicious custom raging uncontrolled
abroad and desolating public life
when fierce temptation seconded within
by traitor appetite and armed with darts
tempered in hell invades the throbbing breast
to combat may be glorious and success
perhaps may crown us but to fly is safe
had i the choice of sublunary good
what could i wish that i possess not here
health leisure means to improve it friendship peace
no loose or wanton though a wandering muse
and constant occupation without care
thus blest i draw a picture of that bliss
hopeless indeed that dissipated minds
and profligate abusers of a world
created fair so much in vain for them
should seek the guiltless joys that i describe
allured by my report but sure no less
that selfcondemned they must neglect the prize
and what they will not taste must yet approve
what we admire we praise and when we praise
advance it into notice that its worth
acknowledged others may admire it too
i therefore recommend though at the risk
of popular disgust yet boldly still
the cause of piety and sacred truth
and virtue and those scenes which god ordained
should best secure them and promote them most
scenes that i love and with regret perceive
forsaken or through folly not enjoyed
pure is the nymph though liberal of her smiles
and chaste though unconfined whom i extol
not as the prince in shushan when he called
vainglorious of her charms his vashti forth
to grace the full pavilion  his design
was but to boast his own peculiar good
which all might view with envy none partake
my charmer is not mine alone my sweets
and she that sweetens all my bitters too
nature enchanting nature in whose form
and lineaments divine i trace a hand
that errs not and find raptures still renewed
is free to all menuniversal prize
strange that so fair a creature should yet want
admirers and be destined to divide
with meaner objects even the few she finds
stript of her ornaments her leaves and flowers
she loses all her influence  cities then
attract us and neglected nature pines
abandoned as unworthy of our love
but are not wholesome airs though unperfumed
by roses and clear suns though scarcely felt
and groves if unharmonious yet secure
from clamour and whose very silence charms
to be preferred to smoketo the eclipse
that metropolitan volcanoes make
whose stygian throats breathe darkness all day long
and to the stir of commerce driving slow
and thundering loud with his ten thousand wheels
they would be were not madness in the head
and folly in the heart were england now
what england was plain hospitable kind
and undebauched  but we have bid farewell
to all the virtues of those better days
and all their honest pleasures  mansions once
knew their own masters and laborious hands
that had survived the father served the son
now the legitimate and rightful lord
is but a transient guest newly arrived
and soon to be supplanted  he that saw
his patrimonial timber cast its leaf
sells the last scantling and transfers the price
to some shrewd sharper ere it buds again
estates are landscapes gazed upon awhile
then advertised and auctioneered away
the country starves and they that feed the oercharged
and surfeited lewd town with her fair dues
by a just judgment strip and starve themselves
the wings that waft our riches out of sight
grow on the gamesters elbows and the alert
and nimble motion of those restless joints
that never tire soon fans them all away
improvement too the idol of the age
is fed with many a victim  lo he comes
the omnipotent magician brown appears
down falls the venerable pile the abode
of our forefathers a grave whiskered race
but tasteless  springs a palace in its stead
but in a distant spot where more exposed
it may enjoy the advantage of the north
and aguish east till time shall have transformed
those naked acres to a sheltering grove
he speaks  the lake in front becomes a lawn
woods vanish hills subside and valleys rise
and streams as if created for his use
pursue the track of his directed wand
sinuous or straight now rapid and now slow
now murmuring soft now roaring in cascades
even as he bids  the enraptured owner smiles
tis finished  and yet finished as it seems
still wants a grace the loveliest it could show
a mine to satisfy the enormous cost
drained to the last poor item of his wealth
he sighs departs and leaves the accomplished plan
that he has touched and retouched many a day
laboured and many a night pursued in dreams
just when it meets his hopes and proves the heaven
he wanted for a wealthier to enjoy
and now perhaps the glorious hour is come
when having no stake left no pledge to endear
her interests or that gives her sacred cause
a moments operation on his love
he burns with most intense and flagrant zeal
to serve his country  ministerial grace
deals him out money from the public chest
or if that mine be shut some private purse
supplies his need with an usurious loan
to be refunded duly when his vote
wellmanaged shall have earned its worthy price
oh innocent compared with arts like these
crape and cocked pistol and the whistling ball
sent through the travellers temples  he that finds
one drop of heavens sweet mercy in his cup
can dig beg rot and perish wellcontent
so he may wrap himself in honest rags
at his last gasp but could not for a world
fish up his dirty and dependent bread
from pools and ditches of the commonwealth
sordid and sickening at his own success

ambition avarice penury incurred
by endless riot vanity the lust
of pleasure and variety despatch
as duly as the swallows disappear
the world of wandering knights and squires to town
london engulfs them all  the shark is there
and the sharks prey the spendthrift and the leech
that sucks him  there the sycophant and he
that with bareheaded and obsequious bows
begs a warm office doomed to a cold jail
and groat per diem if his patron frown
the levee swarms as if in golden pomp
were charactered on every statesmans door
battered and bankrupt fortunes mended here
these are the charms that sully and eclipse
the charms of nature  tis the cruel gripe
that lean hardhanded poverty inflicts
the hope of better things the chance to win
the wish to shine the thirst to be amused
that at the sound of winters hoary wing
unpeople all our counties of such herds
of fluttering loitering cringing begging loose
and wanton vagrants as make london vast
and boundless as it is a crowded coop

oh thou resort and mart of all the earth
chequered with all complexions of mankind
and spotted with all crimes in whom i see
much that i love and more that i admire
and all that i abhor thou freckled fair
that pleases and yet shocks me i can laugh
and i can weep can hope and can despond
feel wrath and pity when i think on thee
ten righteous would have saved a city once
and thou hast many righteouswell for thee
that salt preserves thee more corrupted else
and therefore more obnoxious at this hour
than sodom in her day had power to be
for whom god heard his abram plead in vain



book iv

the winter evening

hark tis the twanging horn oer yonder bridge
that with its wearisome but needful length
bestrides the wintry flood in which the moon
sees her unwrinkled face reflected bright
he comes the herald of a noisy world
with spattered boots strapped waist and frozen locks
news from all nations lumbering at his back
true to his charge the closepacked load behind
yet careless what he brings his one concern
is to conduct it to the destined inn
and having dropped the expected bagpass on
he whistles as he goes lighthearted wretch
cold and yet cheerful  messenger of grief
perhaps to thousands and of joy to some
to him indifferent whether grief or joy
houses in ashes and the fall of stocks
births deaths and marriages epistles wet
with tears that trickled down the writers cheeks
fast as the periods from his fluent quill
or charged with amorous sighs of absent swains
or nymphs responsive equally affect
his horse and him unconscious of them all
but oh the important budget ushered in
with such heartshaking music who can say
what are its tidings have our troops awaked
or do they still as if with opium drugged
snore to the murmurs of the atlantic wave
is india free and does she wear her plumed
and jewelled turban with a smile of peace
or do we grind her still  the grand debate
the popular harangue the tart reply
the logic and the wisdom and the wit
and the loud laughi long to know them all
i burn to set the imprisoned wranglers free
and give them voice and utterance once again

now stir the fire and close the shutters fast
let fall the curtains wheel the sofa round
and while the bubbling and loudhissing urn
throws up a steamy column and the cups
that cheer but not inebriate wait on each
so let us welcome peaceful evening in
not such his evening who with shining face
sweats in the crowded theatre and squeezed
and bored with elbowpoints through both his sides
outscolds the ranting actor on the stage
nor his who patient stands till his feet throb
and his head thumps to feed upon the breath
of patriots bursting with heroic rage
or placemen all tranquillity and smiles
this folio of four pages happy work
which not even critics criticise that holds
inquisitive attention while i read
fast bound in chains of silence which the fair
though eloquent themselves yet fear to break
what is it but a map of busy life
its fluctuations and its vast concerns
here runs the mountainous and craggy ridge
that tempts ambition  on the summit see
the seals of office glitter in his eyes
he climbs he pants he grasps them  at his heels
close at his heels a demagogue ascends
and with a dextrous jerk soon twists him down
and wins them but to lose them in his turn
here rills of oily eloquence in soft
meanders lubricate the course they take
the modest speaker is ashamed and grieved
to engross a moments notice and yet begs
begs a propitious ear for his poor thoughts
however trivial all that he conceives
sweet bashfulness it claims at least this praise
the dearth of information and good sense
that it foretells us always comes to pass
cataracts of declamation thunder here
there forests of no meaning spread the page
in which all comprehension wanders lost
while fields of pleasantry amuse us there
with merry descants on a nations woes
the rest appears a wilderness of strange
but gay confusion roses for the cheeks
and lilies for the brows of faded age
teeth for the toothless ringlets for the bald
heaven earth and ocean plundered of their sweets
nectareous essences olympian dews
sermons and city feasts and favourite airs
ethereal journeys submarine exploits
and katterfelto with his hair on end
at his own wonders wondering for his bread

tis pleasant through the loopholes of retreat
to peep at such a world to see the stir
of the great babel and not feel the crowd
to hear the roar she sends through all her gates
at a safe distance where the dying sound
falls a soft murmur on the uninjured ear
thus sitting and surveying thus at ease
the globe and its concerns i seem advanced
to some secure and more than mortal height
that liberates and exempts me from them all
it turns submitted to my view turns round
with all its generations i behold
the tumult and am still  the sound of war
has lost its terrors ere it reaches me
grieves but alarms me not  i mourn the pride
and avarice that makes man a wolf to man
hear the faint echo of those brazen throats
by which he speaks the language of his heart
and sigh but never tremble at the sound
he travels and expatiates as the bee
from flower to flower so he from land to land
the manners customs policy of all
pay contribution to the store he gleans
he sucks intelligence in every clime
and spreads the honey of his deep research
at his returna rich repast for me
he travels and i too  i tread his deck
ascend his topmast through his peering eyes
discover countries with a kindred heart
suffer his woes and share in his escapes
while fancy like the finger of a clock
runs the great circuit and is still at home

oh winter ruler of the inverted year
thy scattered hair with sleetlike ashes filled
thy breath congealed upon thy lips thy cheeks
fringed with a beard made white with other snows
than those of age thy forehead wrapped in clouds
a leafless branch thy sceptre and thy throne
a sliding car indebted to no wheels
but urged by storms along its slippery way
i love thee all unlovely as thou seemst
and dreaded as thou art  thou holdst the sun
a prisoner in the yet undawning east
shortening his journey between morn and noon
and hurrying him impatient of his stay
down to the rosy west but kindly still
compensating his loss with added hours
of social converse and instructive ease
and gathering at short notice in one group
the family dispersed and fixing thought
not less dispersed by daylight and its cares
i crown thee king of intimate delights
fireside enjoyments homeborn happiness
and all the comforts that the lowly roof
of undisturbed retirement and the hours
of long uninterrupted evening know
no rattling wheels stop short before these gates
no powdered pert proficients in the art
of sounding an alarm assault these doors
till the street rings no stationary steeds
cough their own knell while heedless of the sound
the silent circle fan themselves and quake
but here the needle plies its busy task
the pattern grows the welldepicted flower
wrought patiently into the snowy lawn
unfolds its bosom buds and leaves and sprigs
and curly tendrils gracefully disposed
follow the nimble finger of the fair
a wreath that cannot fade of flowers that blow
with most success when all besides decay
the poets or historians page by one
made vocal for the amusement of the rest
the sprightly lyre whose treasure of sweet sounds
the touch from many a trembling chord shakes out
and the clear voice symphonious yet distinct
and in the charming strife triumphant still
beguile the night and set a keener edge
on female industry the threaded steel
flies swiftly and unfelt the task proceeds
the volume closed the customary rites
of the last meal commence  a roman meal
such as the mistress of the world once found
delicious when her patriots of high note
perhaps by moonlight at their humble doors
and under an old oaks domestic shade
enjoyedspare feasta radish and an egg
discourse ensues not trivial yet not dull
nor such as with a frown forbids the play
of fancy or proscribes the sound of mirth
nor do we madly like an impious world
who deem religion frenzy and the god
that made them an intruder on their joys
start at his awful name or deem his praise
a jarring note themes of a graver tone
exciting oft our gratitude and love
while we retrace with memorys pointing wand
that calls the past to our exact review
the dangers we have scaped the broken snare
the disappointed foe deliverance found
unlooked for life preserved and peace restored
fruits of omnipotent eternal love
oh evenings worthy of the gods exclaimed
the sabine bard  oh evenings i reply
more to be prized and coveted than yours
as more illumined and with nobler truths
that i and mine and those we love enjoy

is winter hideous in a garb like this
needs he the tragic fur the smoke of lamps
the pentup breath of an unsavoury throng
to thaw him into feeling or the smart
and snappish dialogue that flippant wits
call comedy to prompt him with a smile
the selfcomplacent actor when he views
stealing a sidelong glance at a full house
the slope of faces from the floor to the roof
as if one masterspring controlled them all
relaxed into an universal grin
sees not a countenance there that speaks a joy
half so refined or so sincere as ours
cards were superfluous here with all the tricks
that idleness has ever yet contrived
to fill the void of an unfurnished brain
to palliate dulness and give time a shove
time as he passes us has a doves wing
unsoiled and swift and of a silken sound
but the worlds time is time in masquerade
theirs should i paint him has his pinions fledged
with motley plumes and where the peacock shows
his azure eyes is tinctured black and red
with spots quadrangular of diamond form
ensanguined hearts clubs typical of strife
and spades the emblem of untimely graves
what should be and what was an hourglass once
becomes a dicebox and a billiard mast
well does the work of his destructive scythe
thus decked he charms a world whom fashion blinds
to his true worth most pleased when idle most
whose only happy are their wasted hours
even misses at whose age their mothers wore
the backstring and the bib assume the dress
of womanhood sit pupils in the school
of carddevoted time and night by night
placed at some vacant corner of the board
learn every trick and soon play all the game
but truce with censure  roving as i rove
where shall i find an end or how proceed
as he that travels far oft turns aside
to view some rugged rock or mouldering tower
which seen delights him not then coming home
describes and prints it that the world may know
how far he went for what was nothing worth
so i with brush in hand and pallet spread
with colours mixed for a far different use
paint cards and dolls and every idle thing
that fancy finds in her excursive flights

come evening once again season of peace
return sweet evening and continue long
methinks i see thee in the streaky west
with matronstep slow moving while the night
treads on thy sweeping train one hand employed
in letting fall the curtain of repose
on bird and beast the other charged for man
with sweet oblivion of the cares of day
not sumptuously adorned nor needing aid
like homelyfeatured night of clustering gems
a star or two just twinkling on thy brow
suffices thee save that the moon is thine
no less than hers not worn indeed on high
with ostentatious pageantry but set
with modest grandeur in thy purple zone
resplendent less but of an ampler round
come then and thou shalt find thy votary calm
or make me so  composure is thy gift
and whether i devote thy gentle hours
to books to music or to poets toil
to weaving nets for birdalluring fruit
or twining silken threads round ivory reels
when they command whom man was born to please
i slight thee not but make thee welcome still

just when our drawingrooms begin to blaze
with lights by clear reflection multiplied
from many a mirror in which he of gath
goliath might have seen his giant bulk
whole without stooping towering crest and all
my pleasures too begin  but me perhaps
the glowing hearth may satisfy a while
with faint illumination that uplifts
the shadow to the ceiling there by fits
dancing uncouthly to the quivering flame
not undelightful is an hour to me
so spent in parlour twilight such a gloom
suits well the thoughtful or unthinking mind
the mind contemplative with some new theme
pregnant or indisposed alike to all
laugh ye who boast your more mercurial powers
that never feel a stupor know no pause
nor need one i am conscious and confess
fearless a soul that does not always think
me oft has fancy ludicrous and wild
soothed with a waking dream of houses towers
trees churches and strange visages expressed
in the red cinders while with poring eye
i gazed myself creating what i saw
nor less amused have i quiescent watched
the sooty films that play upon the bars
pendulous and foreboding in the view
of superstition prophesying still
though still deceived some strangers near approach
tis thus the understanding takes repose
in indolent vacuity of thought
and sleeps and is refreshed  meanwhile the face
conceals the mood lethargic with a mask
of deep deliberation as the man
were tasked to his full strength absorbed and lost
thus oft reclined at ease i lose an hour
at evening till at length the freezing blast
that sweeps the bolted shutter summons home
the recollected powers and snapping short
the glassy threads with which the fancy weaves
her brittle toys restores me to myself
how calm is my recess and how the frost
raging abroad and the rough wind endear
the silence and the warmth enjoyed within
i saw the woods and fields at close of day
a variegated show the meadows green
though faded and the lands where lately waved
the golden harvest of a mellow brown
upturned so lately by the forceful share
i saw far off the weedy fallows smile
with verdure not unprofitable grazed
by flocks fast feeding and selecting each
his favourite herb while all the leafless groves
that skirt the horizon wore a sable hue
scarce noticed in the kindred dusk of eve
tomorrow brings a change a total change
which even now though silently performed
and slowly and by most unfelt the face
of universal nature undergoes
fast falls a fleecy shower the downy flakes
descending and with neverceasing lapse
softly alighting upon all below
assimilate all objects  earth receives
gladly the thickening mantle and the green
and tender blade that feared the chilling blast
escapes unhurt beneath so warm a veil

in such a world so thorny and where none
finds happiness unblighted or if found
without some thistly sorrow at its side
it seems the part of wisdom and no sin
against the law of love to measure lots
with less distinguished than ourselves that thus
we may with patience bear our moderate ills
and sympathise with others suffering more
ill fares the traveller now and he that stalks
in ponderous boots beside his reeking team
the wain goes heavily impeded sore
by congregating loads adhering close
to the clogged wheels and in its sluggish pace
noiseless appears a moving hill of snow
the toiling steeds expand the nostril wide
while every breath by respiration strong
forced downward is consolidated soon
upon their jutting chests  he formed to bear
the pelting brunt of the tempestuous night
with halfshut eyes and puckered cheeks and teeth
presented bare against the storm plods on
one hand secures his hat save when with both
he brandishes his pliant length of whip
resounding oft and never heard in vain
oh happy and in my account denied
that sensibility of pain with which
refinement is endued thrice happy thou
thy frame robust and hardy feels indeed
the piercing cold but feels it unimpaired
the learned finger never need explore
thy vigorous pulse and the unhealthful east
that breathes the spleen and searches every bone
of the infirm is wholesome air to thee
thy days roll on exempt from household care
thy waggon is thy wife and the poor beasts
that drag the dull companion to and fro
thine helpless charge dependent on thy care
ah treat them kindly rude as thou appearest
yet show that thou hast mercy which the great
with needless hurry whirled from place to place
humane as they would seem not always show

poor yet industrious modest quiet neat
such claim compassion in a night like this
and have a friend in every feeling heart
warmed while it lasts by labour all day long
they brave the season and yet find at eve
ill clad and fed but sparely time to cool
the frugal housewife trembles when she lights
her scanty stock of brushwood blazing clear
but dying soon like all terrestrial joys
the few small embers left she nurses well
and while her infant race with outspread hands
and crowded knees sit cowering oer the sparks
retires content to quake so they be warmed
the man feels least as more inured than she
to winter and the current in his veins
more briskly moved by his severer toil
yet he too finds his own distress in theirs
the taper soon extinguished which i saw
dangled along at the cold fingers end
just when the day declined and the brown loaf
lodged on the shelf halfeaten without sauce
of savry cheese or butter costlier still
sleep seems their only refuge  for alas
where penury is felt the thought is chained
and sweet colloquial pleasures are but few
with all this thrift they thrive not  all the care
ingenious parsimony takes but just
saves the small inventory bed and stool
skillet and old carved chest from public sale
they live and live without extorted alms
from grudging hands but other boast have none
to soothe their honest pride that scorns to beg
nor comfort else but in their mutual love
i praise you much ye meek and patient pair
for ye are worthy choosing rather far
a dry but independent crust hardearned
and eaten with a sigh than to endure
the rugged frowns and insolent rebuffs
of knaves in office partial in their work
of distribution liberal of their aid
to clamorous importunity in rags
but ofttimes deaf to suppliants who would blush
to wear a tattered garb however coarse
whom famine cannot reconcile to filth
these ask with painful shyness and refused
because deserving silently retire
but be ye of good courage  time itself
shall much befriend you  time shall give increase
and all your numerous progeny well trained
but helpless in few years shall find their hands
and labour too  meanwhile ye shall not want
what conscious of your virtues we can spare
nor what a wealthier than ourselves may send
i mean the man who when the distant poor
need help denies them nothing but his name

but poverty with most who whimper forth
their long complaints is selfinflicted woe
the effect of laziness or sottish waste
now goes the nightly thief prowling abroad
for plunder much solicitous how best
he may compensate for a day of sloth
by works of darkness and nocturnal wrong
woe to the gardeners pale the farmers hedge
plashed neatly and secured with driven stakes
deep in the loamy bank  uptorn by strength
resistless in so bad a cause but lame
to better deeds he bundles up the spoil
an asss burdenand when laden most
and heaviest light of foot steals fast away
nor does the boarded hovel better guard
the wellstacked pile of riven logs and roots
from his pernicious force  nor will he leave
unwrenched the door however well secured
where chanticleer amidst his harem sleeps
in unsuspecting pomp twitched from the perch
he gives the princely bird with all his wives
to his voracious bag struggling in vain
and loudly wondering at the sudden change
nor this to feed his own  twere some excuse
did pity of their sufferings warp aside
his principle and tempt him into sin
for their support so destitute but they
neglected pine at home themselves as more
exposed than others with less scruple made
his victims robbed of their defenceless all
cruel is all he does  tis quenchless thirst
of ruinous ebriety that prompts
his every action and imbrutes the man
oh for a law to noose the villains neck
who starves his own who persecutes the blood
he gave them in his childrens veins and hates
and wrongs the woman he has sworn to love

pass where we may through city or through town
village or hamlet of this merry land
though lean and beggared every twentieth pace
conducts the unguarded nose to such a whiff
of stale debauch forthissuing from the styes
that law has licensed as makes temperance reel
there sit involved and lost in curling clouds
of indian fume and guzzling deep the boor
the lackey and the groom  the craftsman there
takes a lethean leave of all his toil
smith cobbler joiner he that plies the shears
and he that kneads the dough  all loud alike
all learned and all drunk  the fiddle screams
plaintive and piteous as it wept and wailed
its wasted tones and harmony unheard
fierce the dispute whateer the theme while she
fell discord arbitress of such debate
perched on the signpost holds with even hand
her undecisive scales  in this she lays
a weight of ignorance in that of pride
and smiles delighted with the eternal poise
dire is the frequent curse and its twin sound
the cheekdistending oath not to be praised
as ornamental musical polite
like those which modern senators employ
whose oath is rhetoric and who swear for fame
behold the schools in which plebeian minds
once simple are initiated in arts
which some may practise with politer grace
but none with readier skill  tis here they learn
the road that leads from competence and peace
to indigence and rapine till at last
society grown weary of the load
shakes her encumbered lap and casts them out
but censure profits little  vain the attempt
to advertise in verse a public pest
that like the filth with which the peasant feeds
his hungry acres stinks and is of use
the excise is fattened with the rich result
of all this riot and ten thousand casks
for ever dribbling out their base contents
touched by the midas finger of the state
bleed gold for ministers to sport away
drink and be mad then tis your country bids
gloriously drunk obey the important call
her cause demands the assistance of your throats
ye all can swallow and she asks no more

would i had fallen upon those happier days
that poets celebrate those golden times
and those arcadian scenes that maro sings
and sidney warbler of poetic prose
nymphs were dianas then and swains had hearts
that felt their virtues  innocence it seems
from courts dismissed found shelter in the groves
the footsteps of simplicity impressed
upon the yielding herbage so they sing
then were not all effaced  then speech profane
and manners profligate were rarely found
observed as prodigies and soon reclaimed
vain wish those days were never  airy dreams
sat for the picture and the poets hand
imparting substance to an empty shade
imposed a gay delirium for a truth
grant it  i still must envy them an age
that favoured such a dream in days like these
impossible when virtue is so scarce
that to suppose a scene where she presides
is tramontane and stumbles all belief
no  we are polished now  the rural lass
whom once her virgin modesty and grace
her artless manners and her neat attire
so dignified that she was hardly less
than the fair shepherdess of old romance
is seen no more  the character is lost
her head adorned with lappets pinned aloft
and ribbons streaming gay superbly raised
and magnified beyond all human size
indebted to some smart wigweavers hand
for more than half the tresses it sustains
her elbows ruffled and her tottering form
ill propped upon french heels she might be deemed
but that the basket dangling on her arm
interprets her more truly of a rank
too proud for dairywork or sale of eggs
expect her soon with footboy at her heels
no longer blushing for her awkward load
her train and her umbrella all her care

the town has tinged the country and the stain
appears a spot upon a vestals robe
the worse for what it soils  the fashion runs
down into scenes still rural but alas
scenes rarely graced with rural manners now
time was when in the pastoral retreat
the unguarded door was safe men did not watch
to invade anothers right or guard their own
then sleep was undisturbed by fear unscared
by drunken howlings and the chilling tale
of midnight murder was a wonder heard
with doubtful credit told to frighten babes
but farewell now to unsuspicious nights
and slumbers unalarmed  now ere you sleep
see that your polished arms be primed with care
and drop the nightbolt  ruffians are abroad
and the first larum of the cocks shrill throat
may prove a trumpet summoning your ear
to horrid sounds of hostile feet within
even daylight has its dangers and the walk
through pathless wastes and woods unconscious once
of other tenants than melodious birds
or harmless flocks is hazardous and bold
lamented change to which full many a cause
inveterate hopeless of a cure conspires
the course of human things from good to ill
from ill to worse is fatal never fails
increase of power begets increase of wealth
wealth luxury and luxury excess
excess the scrofulous and itchy plague
that seizes first the opulent descends
to the next rank contagious and in time
taints downward all the graduated scale
of order from the chariot to the plough
the rich and they that have an arm to check
the licence of the lowest in degree
desert their office and themselves intent
on pleasure haunt the capital and thus
to all the violence of lawless hands
resign the scenes their presence might protect
authority itself not seldom sleeps
though resident and witness of the wrong
the plump convivial parson often bears
the magisterial sword in vain and lays
his reverence and his worship both to rest
on the same cushion of habitual sloth
perhaps timidity restrains his arm
when he should strike he trembles and sets free
himself enslaved by terror of the band
the audacious convict whom he dares not bind
perhaps though by profession ghostly pure
he too may have his vice and sometimes prove
less dainty than becomes his grave outside
in lucrative concerns  examine well
his milkwhite hand  the palm is hardly clean
but here and there an ugly smutch appears
foh twas a bribe that left it  he has touched
corruption  whoso seeks an audit here
propitious pays his tribute game or fish
wildfowl or venison and his errand speeds

but faster far and more than all the rest
a noble cause which none who bears a spark
of public virtue ever wished removed
works the deplored and mischievous effect
tis universal soldiership has stabbed
the heart of merit in the meaner class
arms through the vanity and brainless rage
of those that bear them in whatever cause
seem most at variance with all moral good
and incompatible with serious thought
the clown the child of nature without guile
blest with an infants ignorance of all
but his own simple pleasures now and then
a wrestling match a footrace or a fair
is balloted and trembles at the news
sheepish he doffs his hat and mumbling swears
a bibleoath to be whateer they please
to do he knows not what  the task performed
that instant he becomes the serjeants care
his pupil and his torment and his jest
his awkward gait his introverted toes
bent knees round shoulders and dejected looks
procure him many a curse  by slow degrees
unapt to learn and formed of stubborn stuff
he yet by slow degrees puts off himself
grows conscious of a change and likes it well
he stands erect his slouch becomes a walk
he steps right onward martial in his air
his form and movement is as smart above
as meal and larded locks can make him  wears
his hat or his plumed helmet with a grace
and his three years of heroship expired
returns indignant to the slighted plough
he hates the field in which no fife or drum
attends him drives his cattle to a march
and sighs for the smart comrades he has left
twere well if his exterior change were all
but with his clumsy port the wretch has lost
his ignorance and harmless manners too
to swear to game to drink to show at home
by lewdness idleness and sabbathbreach
the great proficiency he made abroad
to astonish and to grieve his gazing friends
to break some maidens and his mothers heart
to be a pest where he was useful once
are his sole aim and all his glory now
man in society is like a flower
blown in its native bed  tis there alone
his faculties expanded in full bloom
shine out there only reach their proper use
but man associated and leagued with man
by regal warrant or selfjoined by bond
for interest sake or swarming into clans
beneath one head for purposes of war
like flowers selected from the rest and bound
and bundled close to fill some crowded vase
fades rapidly and by compression marred
contracts defilement not to be endured
hence chartered boroughs are such public plagues
and burghers men immaculate perhaps
in all their private functions once combined
become a loathsome body only fit
for dissolution hurtful to the main
hence merchants unimpeachable of sin
against the charities of domestic life
incorporated seem at once to lose
their nature and disclaiming all regard
for mercy and the common rights of man
build factories with blood conducting trade
at the swords point and dyeing the white robe
of innocent commercial justice red
hence too the field of glory as the world
misdeems it dazzled by its bright array
with all the majesty of thundering pomp
enchanting music and immortal wreaths
is but a school where thoughtlessness is taught
on principle where foppery atones
for folly gallantry for every vice

but slighted as it is and by the great
abandoned and which still i more regret
infected with the manners and the modes
it knew not once the country wins me still
i never framed a wish or formed a plan
that flattered me with hopes of earthly bliss
but there i laid the scene  there early strayed
my fancy ere yet liberty of choice
had found me or the hope of being free
my very dreams were rural rural too
the firstborn efforts of my youthful muse
sportive and jingling her poetic bells
ere yet her ear was mistress of their powers
no bard could please me but whose lyre was tuned
to natures praises  heroes and their feats
fatigued me never weary of the pipe
of tityrus assembling as he sang
the rustic throng beneath his favourite beech
then milton had indeed a poets charms
new to my taste his paradise surpassed
the struggling efforts of my boyish tongue
to speak its excellence i danced for joy
i marvelled much that at so ripe an age
as twice seven years his beauties had then first
engaged my wonder and admiring still
and still admiring with regret supposed
the joy half lost because not sooner found
thee too enamoured of the life i loved
pathetic in its praise in its pursuit
determined and possessing it at last
with transports such as favoured lovers feel
i studied prized and wished that i had known
ingenious cowley  and though now reclaimed
by modern lights from an erroneous taste
i cannot but lament thy splendid wit
entangled in the cobwebs of the schools
i still revere thee courtly though retired
though stretched at ease in chertseys silent bowers
not unemployed and finding rich amends
for a lost world in solitude and verse
tis born with all  the love of natures works
is an ingredient in the compound man
infused at the creation of the kind
and though the almighty maker has throughout
discriminated each from each by strokes
and touches of his hand with so much art
diversified that two were never found
twins at all pointsyet this obtains in all
that all discern a beauty in his works
and all can taste them  minds that have been formed
and tutored with a relish more exact
but none without some relish none unmoved
it is a flame that dies not even there
where nothing feeds it  neither business crowds
nor habits of luxurious city life
whatever else they smother of true worth
in human bosoms quench it or abate
the villas with which london stands begirt
like a swarth indian with his belt of beads
prove it  a breath of unadulterate air
the glimpse of a green pasture how they cheer
the citizen and brace his languid frame
even in the stifling bosom of the town
a garden in which nothing thrives has charms
that soothe the rich possessor much consoled
that here and there some sprigs of mournful mint
of nightshade or valerian grace the well
he cultivates  these serve him with a hint
that nature lives that sightrefreshing green
is still the livery she delights to wear
though sickly samples of the exuberant whole
what are the casements lined with creeping herbs
the prouder sashes fronted with a range
of orange myrtle or the fragrant weed
the frenchmans darling are they not all proofs
that man immured in cities still retains
his inborn inextinguishable thirst
of rural scenes compensating his loss
by supplemental shifts the best he may

to range the fields and treat their lungs with air

of honours or emolument or fame
i shall not add myself to such a chase
thwart his attempts or envy his success
some must be great  great offices will have
great talents  and god gives to every man

book v

the winter morning walk

tis morning and the sun with ruddy orb
ascending fires the horizon while the clouds
that crowd away before the driving wind
more ardent as the disk emerges more
resemble most some city in a blaze
seen through the leafless wood  his slanting ray
slides ineffectual down the snowy vale
and tingeing all with his own rosy hue
from every herb and every spiry blade
stretches a length of shadow oer the field
mine spindling into longitude immense
in spite of gravity and sage remark
that i myself am but a fleeting shade
provokes me to a smile  with eye askance
i view the muscular proportioned limb
transformed to a lean shank the shapeless pair
as they designed to mock me at my side
take step for step and as i near approach
the cottage walk along the plastered wall
preposterous sight the legs without the man
the verdure of the plain lies buried deep
beneath the dazzling deluge and the bents
and coarser grass upspearing oer the rest
of late unsightly and unseen now shine
conspicuous and in bright apparel clad
and fledged with icy feathers nod superb
the cattle mourn in corners where the fence
screens them and seem half petrified to sleep
in unrecumbent sadness  there they wait
their wonted fodder not like hungering man
fretful if unsupplied but silent meek
and patient of the slowpaced swains delay
he from the stack carves out the accustomed load
deepplunging and again deepplunging oft
his broad keen knife into the solid mass
smooth as a wall the upright remnant stands
with such undeviating and even force
he severs it away  no needless care
lest storms should overset the leaning pile
deciduous or its own unbalanced weight
forth goes the woodman leaving unconcerned
the cheerful haunts of man to wield the axe
and drive the wedge in yonder forest drear
from morn to eve his solitary task
shaggy and lean and shrewd with pointed ears
and tail cropped short half lurcher and half cur
his dog attends him  close behind his heel
now creeps he slow and now with many a frisk
widescampering snatches up the drifted snow
with ivory teeth or ploughs it with his snout
then shakes his powdered coat and barks for joy
heedless of all his pranks the sturdy churl
moves right toward the mark nor stops for aught
but now and then with pressure of his thumb
to adjust the fragrant charge of a short tube
that fumes beneath his nose the trailing cloud
streams far behind him scenting all the air
now from the roost or from the neighbouring pale
where diligent to catch the first faint gleam
of smiling day they gossiped side by side
come trooping at the housewifes wellknown call
the feathered tribes domestic half on wing
and half on foot they brush the fleecy flood
conscious and fearful of too deep a plunge
the sparrows peep and quit the sheltering eaves
to seize the fair occasion well they eye
the scattered grain and thievishly resolved
to escape the impending famine often scared
as oft return a pert voracious kind
clean riddance quickly made one only care
remains to each the search of sunny nook
or shed impervious to the blast  resigned
to sad necessity the cock foregoes
his wonted strut and wading at their head
with wellconsidered steps seems to resent
his altered gait and stateliness retrenched
how find the myriads that in summer cheer
the hills and valleys with their ceaseless songs
due sustenance or where subsist they now
earth yields them naught  the imprisoned worm is safe
beneath the frozen clod all seeds of herbs
lie covered close and berrybearing thorns
that feed the thrush whatever some suppose
afford the smaller minstrel no supply
the longprotracted rigour of the year
thins all their numerous flocks  in chinks and holes
ten thousand seek an unmolested end
as instinct prompts selfburied ere they die
the very rooks and daws forsake the fields
where neither grub nor root nor earthnut now
repays their labour more and perched aloft
by the wayside or stalking in the path
lean pensioners upon the travellers track
pick up their nauseous dole though sweet to them
of voided pulse or halfdigested grain
the streams are lost amid the splendid blank
oerwhelming all distinction  on the flood
indurated and fixed the snowy weight
lies undissolved while silently beneath
and unperceived the current steals away
not so where scornful of a check it leaps
the milldam dashes on the restless wheel
and wantons in the pebbly gulf below
no frost can bind it there  its utmost force
can but arrest the light and smoky mist
that in its fall the liquid sheet throws wide
and see where it has hung the embroidered banks
with forms so various that no powers of art
the pencil or the pen may trace the scene
here glittering turrets rise upbearing high
fantastic misarrangement on the roof
large growth of what may seem the sparkling trees
and shrubs of fairy land  the crystal drops
that trickle down the branches fast congealed
shoot into pillars of pellucid length
and prop the pile they but adorned before
here grotto within grotto safe defies
the sunbeam  there imbossed and fretted wild
the growing wonder takes a thousand shapes
capricious in which fancy seeks in vain
the likeness of some object seen before
thus nature works as if to mock at art
and in defiance of her rival powers
by these fortuitous and random strokes
performing such inimitable feats
as she with all her rules can never reach
less worthy of applause though more admired
because a novelty the work of man
imperial mistress of the furclad russ
thy most magnificent and mighty freak
the wonder of the north  no forest fell
when thou wouldst build no quarry sent its stores
to enrich thy walls but thou didst hew the floods
and make thy marble of the glassy wave
in such a palace aristaeus found
cyrene when he bore the plaintive tale
of his lost bees to her maternal ear
in such a palace poetry might place
the armoury of winter where his troops
the gloomy clouds find weapons arrowy sleet
skinpiercing volley blossombruising hail
and snow that often blinds the travellers course
and wraps him in an unexpected tomb
silently as a dream the fabric rose
no sound of hammer or of saw was there
ice upon ice the welladjusted parts
were soon conjoined nor other cement asked
than water interfused to make them one
lamps gracefully disposed and of all hues
illumined every side  a watery light
gleamed through the clear transparency that seemed
another moon newrisen or meteor fallen
from heaven to earth of lambent flame serene
so stood the brittle prodigy though smooth
and slippery the materials yet frostbound
firm as a rock  nor wanted aught within
that royal residence might well befit
for grandeur or for use  long wavy wreaths
of flowers that feared no enemy but warmth
blushed on the panels  mirror needed none
where all was vitreous but in order due
convivial table and commodious seat
what seemed at least commodious seat were there
sofa and couch and highbuilt throne august
the same lubricity was found in all
and all was moist to the warm touch a scene
of evanescent glory once a stream
and soon to slide into a stream again
alas twas but a mortifying stroke
of undesigned severity that glanced
made by a monarch on her own estate
on human grandeur and the courts of kings
twas transient in its nature as in show
twas durable as worthless as it seemed
intrinsically precious to the foot
treacherous and false it smiled and it was cold

great princes have great playthings  some have played
at hewing mountains into men and some
at building human wonders mountain high
some have amused the dull sad years of life
life spent in indolence and therefore sad
with schemes of monumental fame and sought
by pyramids and mausoleum pomp
shortlived themselves to immortalise their bones
some seek diversion in the tented field
and make the sorrows of mankind their sport
but wars a game which were their subjects wise
kings should not play at  nations would do well
to extort their truncheons from the puny hands
of heroes whose infirm and baby minds
are gratified with mischief and who spoil
because men suffer it their toy the world

when babel was confounded and the great
confederacy of projectors wild and vain
was split into diversity of tongues
then as a shepherd separates his flock
these to the upland to the valley those
god drave asunder and assigned their lot
to all the nations  ample was the boon
he gave them in its distribution fair
and equal and he bade them dwell in peace
peace was a while their care  they ploughed and sowed
and reaped their plenty without grudge or strife
but violence can never longer sleep
than human passions please  in every heart
are sown the sparks that kindle fiery war
occasion needs but fan them and they blaze
cain had already shed a brothers blood
the deluge washed it out but left unquenched
the seeds of murder in the breast of man
soon by a righteous judgment in the line
of his descending progeny was found
the first artificer of death the shrewd
contriver who first sweated at the forge
and forced the blunt and yet unblooded steel
to a keen edge and made it bright for war
him tubal named the vulcan of old times
the sword and falchion their inventor claim
and the first smith was the first murderers son
his art survived the waters and ere long
when man was multiplied and spread abroad
in tribes and clans and had begun to call
these meadows and that range of hills his own
the tasted sweets of property begat
desire of more and industry in some
to improve and cultivate their just demesne
made others covet what they saw so fair
thus wars began on earth  these fought for spoil
and those in selfdefence  savage at first
the onset and irregular  at length
one eminent above the rest for strength
for stratagem or courage or for all
was chosen leader  him they served in war
and him in peace for sake of warlike deeds
reverenced no less  who could with him compare
or who so worthy to control themselves
as he whose prowess had subdued their foes
thus war affording field for the display
of virtue made one chief whom times of peace
which have their exigencies too and call
for skill in government at length made king
king was a name too proud for man to wear
with modesty and meekness and the crown
so dazzling in their eyes who set it on
was sure to intoxicate the brows it bound
it is the abject property of most
that being parcel of the common mass
and destitute of means to raise themselves
they sink and settle lower than they need
they know not what it is to feel within
a comprehensive faculty that grasps
great purposes with ease that turns and wields
almost without an effort plans too vast
for their conception which they cannot move
conscious of impotence they soon grow drunk
with gazing when they see an able man
step forth to notice and besotted thus
build him a pedestal and saystand there
and be our admiration and our praise
they roll themselves before him in the dust
then most deserving in their own account
when most extravagant in his applause
as if exalting him they raised themselves
thus by degrees selfcheated of their sound
and sober judgment that he is but man
they demideify and fume him so
that in due season he forgets it too
inflated and astrut with selfconceit
he gulps the windy diet and ere long
adopting their mistake profoundly thinks
the world was made in vain if not for him
thenceforth they are his cattle  drudges born
to bear his burdens drawing in his gears
and sweating in his service  his caprice
becomes the soul that animates them all
he deems a thousand or ten thousand lives
spent in the purchase of renown for him
an easy reckoning and they think the same
thus kings were first invented and thus kings
were burnished into heroes and became
the arbiters of this terraqueous swamp
storks among frogs that have but croaked and died
strange that such folly as lifts bloated man
to eminence fit only for a god
should ever drivel out of human lips
even in the cradled weakness of the world
still stranger much that when at length mankind
had reached the sinewy firmness of their youth
and could discriminate and argue well
on subjects more mysterious they were yet
babes in the cause of freedom and should fear
and quake before the gods themselves had made
but above measure strange that neither proof
of sad experience nor examples set
by some whose patriot virtue has prevailed
can even now when they are grown mature
in wisdom and with philosophic deeps
familiar serve to emancipate the rest
such dupes are men to custom and so prone
to reverence what is ancient and can plead
a course of long observance for its use
that even servitude the worst of ills
because delivered down from sire to son
is kept and guarded as a sacred thing
but is it fit or can it bear the shock
of rational discussion that a man
compounded and made up like other men
of elements tumultuous in whom lust
and folly in as ample measure meet
as in the bosoms of the slaves he rules
should be a despot absolute and boast
himself the only freeman of his land
should when he pleases and on whom he will
wage war with any or with no pretence
of provocation given or wrong sustained
and force the beggarly last doit by means
that his own humour dictates from the clutch
of poverty that thus he may procure
his thousands weary of penurious life
a splendid opportunity to die
say ye who with less prudence than of old
jotham ascribed to his assembled trees
in politic convention put your trust
i th shadow of a bramble and recline
in fancied peace beneath his dangerous branch
rejoice in him and celebrate his sway
where find ye passive fortitude  whence springs
your selfdenying zeal that holds it good
to stroke the prickly grievance and to hang
his thorns with streamers of continual praise
we too are friends to loyalty we love
the king who loves the law respects his bounds
and reigns content within them him we serve
freely and with delight who leaves us free
but recollecting still that he is man
we trust him not too far  king though he be
and king in england too he may be weak
and vain enough to be ambitious still
may exercise amiss his proper powers
or covet more than freemen choose to grant
beyond that mark is treason  he is ours
to administer to guard to adorn the state
but not to warp or change it  we are his
to serve him nobly in the common cause
true to the death but not to be his slaves
mark now the difference ye that boast your love
of kings between your loyalty and ours
we love the man the paltry pageant you
we the chief patron of the commonwealth
you the regardless author of its woes
we for the sake of liberty a king
you chains and bondage for a tyrants sake

our love is principle and has its root
in reason is judicious manly free
yours a blind instinct crouches to the rod
and licks the foot that treads it in the dust
were kingship as true treasure as it seems
sterling and worthy of a wise mans wish
i would not be a king to be beloved
causeless and daubed with undiscerning praise
where love is more attachment to the throne
not to the man who fills it as he ought

whose freedom is by sufferance and at will
of a superior he is never free
who lives and is not weary of a life
exposed to manacles deserves them well
the state that strives for liberty though foiled
and forced to abandon what she bravely sought
deserves at least applause for her attempt
and pity for her loss  but thats a cause
not often unsuccessful power usurped
is weakness when opposed conscious of wrong
tis pusillanimous and prone to flight
but slaves that once conceive the glowing thought
of freedom in that hope itself possess
all that the contest calls for spirit strength
the scorn of danger and united hearts
the surest presage of the good they seek 

 the author hopes that he shall not be censured for unnecessary warmth
upon so interesting a subject  he is aware that it is become almost
fashionable to stigmatise such sentiments as no better than empty
declamation  but it is an ill symptom and peculiar to modern timesc

then shame to manhood and opprobrious more
to france than all her losses and defeats
old or of later date by sea or land
her house of bondage worse than that of old
which god avenged on pharaohthe bastille
ye horrid towers the abode of broken hearts
ye dungeons and ye cages of despair
that monarchs have supplied from age to age
with music such as suits their sovereign ears
the sighs and groans of miserable men
theres not an english heart that would not leap
to hear that ye were fallen at last to know
that even our enemies so oft employed
in forging chains for us themselves were free
for he that values liberty confines
his zeal for her predominance within
no narrow bounds her cause engages him
wherever pleaded  tis the cause of man
there dwell the most forlorn of humankind
immured though unaccused condemned untried
cruelly spared and hopeless of escape
there like the visionary emblem seen
by him of babylon life stands a stump
and filleted about with hoops of brass
still lives though all its pleasant boughs are gone
to count the hour bell and expect no change
and ever as the sullen sound is heard
still to reflect that though a joyless note
to him whose moments all have one dull pace
ten thousand rovers in the world at large
account it music that it summons some
to theatre or jocund feast or ball
the wearied hireling finds it a release
from labour and the lover that has chid
its long delay feels every welcome stroke
upon his heartstrings trembling with delight
to fly for refuge from distracting thought
to such amusements as ingenious woe
contrives hardshifting and without her tools
to read engraven on the mouldy walls
in staggering types his predecessors tale
a sad memorial and subjoin his own
to turn purveyor to an overgorged
and bloated spider till the pampered pest
is made familiar watches his approach
comes at his call and serves him for a friend
to wear out time in numbering to and fro
the studs that thick emboss his iron door
then downward and then upward then aslant
and then alternate with a sickly hope
by dint of change to give his tasteless task
some relish till the sum exactly found
in all directions he begins again
oh comfortless existence hemmed around
with woes which who that suffers would not kneel
and beg for exile or the pangs of death
that man should thus encroach on fellowman
abridge him of his just and native rights
eradicate him tear him from his hold
upon the endearments of domestic life
and social nip his fruitfulness and use
and doom him for perhaps a heedless word
to barrenness and solitude and tears
moves indignation makes the name of king
of king whom such prerogative can please
as dreadful as the manichean god
adored through fear strong only to destroy

tis liberty alone that gives the flower
of fleeting life its lustre and perfume
and we are weeds without it  all constraint
except what wisdom lays on evil men
is evil hurts the faculties impedes
their progress in the road of science blinds
the eyesight of discovery and begets
in those that suffer it a sordid mind
bestial a meagre intellect unfit
to be the tenant of mans noble form
thee therefore still blameworthy as thou art
with all thy loss of empire and though squeezed
by public exigence till annual food
fails for the craving hunger of the state
thee i account still happy and the chief
among the nations seeing thou art free
my native nook of earth  thy clime is rude
replete with vapours and disposes much
all hearts to sadness and none more than mine
thine unadulterate manners are less soft
and plausible than social life requires
and thou hast need of discipline and art
to give thee what politer france receives
from natures bountythat humane address
and sweetness without which no pleasure is
in converse either starved by cold reserve
or flushed with fierce dispute a senseless brawl
yet being free i love thee for the sake
of that one feature can be well content
disgraced as thou hast been poor as thou art
to seek no sublunary rest beside
but once enslaved farewell i could endure
chains nowhere patiently and chains at home
where i am free by birthright not at all
then what were left of roughness in the grain
of british natures wanting its excuse
that it belongs to freemen would disgust
and shock me  i should then with double pain
feel all the rigour of thy fickle clime
and if i must bewail the blessing lost
for which our hampdens and our sidneys bled
i would at least bewail it under skies
milder among a people less austere
in scenes which having never known me free
would not reproach me with the loss i felt
do i forebode impossible events
and tremble at vain dreams  heaven grant i may
but the age of virtuous politics is past
and we are deep in that of cold pretence
patriots are grown too shrewd to be sincere
and we too wise to trust them  he that takes
deep in his soft credulity the stamp
designed by loud declaimers on the part
of liberty themselves the slaves of lust
incurs derision for his easy faith
and lack of knowledge and with cause enough
for when was public virtue to be found
where private was not  can he love the whole
who loves no part he be a nations friend
who is in truth the friend of no man there
can he be strenuous in his countrys cause
who slights the charities for whose dear sake
that country if at all must be beloved
tis therefore sober and good men are sad
for englands glory seeing it wax pale
and sickly while her champions wear their hearts
so loose to private duty that no brain
healthful and undisturbed by factious fumes
can dream them trusty to the general weal
such were not they of old whose tempered blades
dispersed the shackles of usurped control
and hewed them link from link  then albions sons
were sons indeed  they felt a filial heart
beat high within them at a mothers wrongs
and shining each in his domestic sphere
shone brighter still once called to public view
tis therefore many whose sequestered lot
forbids their interference looking on
anticipate perforce some dire event
and seeing the old castle of the state
that promised once more firmness so assailed
that all its tempestbeaten turrets shake
stand motionless expectants of its fall
all has its date below  the fatal hour
was registered in heaven ere time began
we turn to dust and all our mightiest works
die too  the deep foundations that we lay
time ploughs them up and not a trace remains
we build with what we deem eternal rock
a distant age asks where the fabric stood
and in the dust sifted and searched in vain
the undiscoverable secret sleeps

but there is yet a liberty unsung
by poets and by senators unpraised
which monarchs cannot grant nor all the power
of earth and hell confederate take away
a liberty which persecution fraud
oppression prisons have no power to bind
which whoso tastes can be enslaved no more
tis liberty of heart derived from heaven
bought with his blood who gave it to mankind
and sealed with the same token  it is held
by charter and that charter sanctioned sure
by the unimpeachable and awful oath
and promise of a god  his other gifts
all bear the royal stamp that speaks them his
and are august but this transcends them all
his other works this visible display
of allcreating energy and might
are grand no doubt and worthy of the word
that finding an interminable space
unoccupied has filled the void so well
and made so sparkling what was dark before
but these are not his glory  man tis true
smit with the beauty of so fair a scene
might well suppose the artificer divine
meant it eternal had he not himself
pronounced it transient glorious as it is
and still designing a more glorious far
doomed it as insufficient for his praise
these therefore are occasional and pass
formed for the confutation of the fool
whose lying heart disputes against a god
that office served they must be swept away
not so the labours of his love they shine
in other heavens than these that we behold
and fade not  there is paradise that fears
no forfeiture and of its fruits he sends
large prelibation oft to saints below
of these the first in order and the pledge
and confident assurance of the rest
is liberty a flight into his arms
ere yet mortalitys fine threads give way
a clear escape from tyrannising lust
and fill immunity from penal woe

chains are the portion of revolted man
stripes and a dungeon and his body serves
the triple purpose  in that sickly foul
opprobrious residence he finds them all
propense his heart to idols he is held
in silly dotage on created things
careless of their creator  and that low
and sordid gravitation of his powers
to a vile clod so draws him with such force
resistless from the centre he should seek
that he at last forgets it  all his hopes
tend downward his ambition is to sink
to reach a depth profounder still and still
profounder in the fathomless abyss
of folly plunging in pursuit of death
but ere he gain the comfortless repose
he seeks and acquiescence of his soul
in heaven renouncing exile he endures
what does he not from lusts opposed in vain
and selfreproaching conscience  he foresees
the fatal issue to his health fame peace
fortune and dignity the loss of all
that can ennoble man and make frail life
short as it is supportable  still worse
far worse than all the plagues with which his sins
infect his happiest moments he forebodes
ages of hopeless misery future death
and death still future not a hasty stroke
like that which sends him to the dusty grave
but unrepealable enduring death
scripture is still a trumpet to his fears
what none can prove a forgery may be true
what none but bad men wish exploded must
that scruple checks him  riot is not loud
nor drunk enough to drown it  in the midst
of laughter his compunctions are sincere
and he abhors the jest by which he shines
remorse begets reform  his masterlust
falls first before his resolute rebuke
and seems dethroned and vanquished  peace ensues
but spurious and shortlived the puny child
of selfcongratulating pride begot
on fancied innocence  again he falls
and fights again but finds his best essay
a presage ominous portending still
its own dishonour by a worse relapse
till nature unavailing nature foiled
so oft and wearied in the vain attempt
scoffs at her own performance  reason now
takes part with appetite and pleads the cause
perversely which of late she so condemned
with shallow shifts and old devices worn
and tattered in the service of debauch
covering his shame from his offended sight

hath god indeed given appetites to man
and stored the earth so plenteously with means
to gratify the hunger of his wish
and doth he reprobate and will he damn
the use of his own bounty making first
so frail a kind and then enacting laws
so strict that less than perfect must despair
falsehood which whoso but suspects of truth
dishonours god and makes a slave of man
do they themselves who undertake for hire
the teachers office and dispense at large
their weekly dole of edifying strains
attend to their own music have they faith
in what with such solemnity of tone
and gesture they propound to our belief
nayconduct hath the loudest tongue  the voice
is but an instrument on which the priest
may play what tune he pleases  in the deed
the unequivocal authentic deed
we find sound argument we read the heart

such reasonings if that name must needs belong
to excuses in which reason has no part
serve to compose a spirit well inclined
to live on terms of amity with vice
and sin without disturbance  often urged
as often as libidinous discourse
exhausted he resorts to solemn themes
of theological and grave import
they gain at last his unreserved assent
till hardened his hearts temper in the forge
of lust and on the anvil of despair
he slights the strokes of conscience  nothing moves
or nothing much his constancy in ill
vain tampering has but fostered his disease
tis desperate and he sleeps the sleep of death
haste now philosopher and set him free
charm the deaf serpent wisely  make him hear
of rectitude and fitness  moral truth
how lovely and the moral sense how sure
consulted and obeyed to guide his steps
directly to the first and only fair
spare not in such a cause  spend all the powers
of rant and rhapsody in virtues praise
be most sublimely good verbosely grand
and with poetic trappings grace thy prose
till it outmantle all the pride of verse
ah tinkling cymbal and highsounding brass
smitten in vain such music cannot charm
the eclipse that intercepts truths heavenly beam
and chills and darkens a widewandering soul
the still small voice is wanted  he must speak
whose word leaps forth at once to its effect
who calls for things that are not and they come

grace makes the slave a freeman  tis a change
that turns to ridicule the turgid speech
and stately tone of moralists who boast
as if like him of fabulous renown
they had indeed ability to smooth
the shag of savage nature and were each
an orpheus and omnipotent in song
but transformation of apostate man
from fool to wise from earthly to divine
is work for him that made him  he alone
and he by means in philosophic eyes
trivial and worthy of disdain achieves
the wonder humanising what is brute
in the lost kind extracting from the lips
of asps their venom overpowering strength
by weakness and hostility by love

patriots have toiled and in their countrys cause
bled nobly and their deeds as they deserve
receive proud recompense  we give in charge
their names to the sweet lyre  the historic muse
proud of the treasure marches with it down
to latest times and sculpture in her turn
gives bond in stone and everduring brass
to guard them and to immortalise her trust
but fairer wreaths are due though never paid
to those who posted at the shrine of truth
have fallen in her defence  a patriots blood
well spent in such a strife may earn indeed
and for a time ensure to his loved land
the sweets of liberty and equal laws
but martyrs struggle for a brighter prize
and win it with more pain  their blood is shed
in confirmation of the noblest claim
our claim to feed upon immortal truth
to walk with god to be divinely free
to soar and to anticipate the skies
yet few remember them  they lived unknown
till persecution dragged them into fame
and chased them up to heaven  their ashes flew
no marble tells us whither  with their names
no bard embalms and sanctifies his song
and history so warm on meaner themes
is cold on this  she execrates indeed
the tyranny that doomed them to the fire
but gives the glorious sufferers little praise

he is the freeman whom the truth makes free
and all are slaves beside  theres not a chain
that hellish foes confederate for his harm
can wind around him but he casts it off
with as much ease as samson his green withes
he looks abroad into the varied field
of nature and though poor perhaps compared
with those whose mansions glitter in his sight
calls the delightful scenery all his own
his are the mountains and the valleys his
and the resplendent rivers  his to enjoy
with a propriety that none can feel
but who with filial confidence inspired
can lift to heaven an unpresumptuous eye
and smiling saymy father made them all
are they not his by a peculiar right
and by an emphasis of interest his
whose eye they fill with tears of holy joy
whose heart with praise and whose exalted mind
with worthy thoughts of that unwearied love
that planned and built and still upholds a world
so clothed with beauty for rebellious man
yesye may fill your garners ye that reap
the loaded soil and ye may waste much good
in senseless riot but ye will not find
in feast or in the chase in song or dance
a liberty like his who unimpeached
of usurpation and to no mans wrong
appropriates nature as his fathers work
and has a richer use of yours than you
he is indeed a freeman  free by birth
of no mean city planned or eer the hills
were built the fountains opened or the sea
with all his roaring multitude of waves
his freedom is the same in every state
and no condition of this changeful life
so manifold in cares whose every day
brings its own evil with it makes it less
for he has wings that neither sickness pain
nor penury can cripple or confine
no nook so narrow but he spreads them there
with ease and is at large  the oppressor holds
his body bound but knows not what a range
his spirit takes unconscious of a chain
and that to bind him is a vain attempt
whom god delights in and in whom he dwells

acquaint thyself with god if thou wouldst taste
his works  admitted once to his embrace
thou shalt perceive that thou wast blind before
thine eye shall be instructed and thine heart
made pure shall relish with divine delight
till then unfelt what hands divine have wrought
brutes graze the mountaintop with faces prone
and eyes intent upon the scanty herb
it yields them or recumbent on its brow
ruminate heedless of the scene outspread
beneath beyond and stretching far away
from inland regions to the distant main
man views it and admires but rests content
with what he views  the landscape has his praise
but not its author  unconcerned who formed
the paradise he sees he finds it such
and such well pleased to find it asks no more
not so the mind that has been touched from heaven
and in the school of sacred wisdom taught
to read his wonders in whose thought the world
fair as it is existed ere it was
nor for its own sake merely but for his
much more who fashioned it he gives it praise
praise that from earth resulting as it ought
to earths acknowledged sovereign finds at once
its only just proprietor in him
the soul that sees him or receives sublimed
new faculties or learns at least to employ
more worthily the powers she owned before
discerns in all things what with stupid gaze
of ignorance till then she overlooked
a ray of heavenly light gilding all forms
terrestrial in the vast and the minute
the unambiguous footsteps of the god
who gives its lustre to an insects wing
and wheels his throne upon the rolling worlds
much conversant with heaven she often holds
with those fair ministers of light to man
that fill the skies nightly with silent pomp
sweet conference inquires what strains were they
with which heaven rang when every star in haste
to gratulate the newcreated earth
sent forth a voice and all the sons of god
shouted for joytell me ye shining hosts
that navigate a sea that knows no storms
beneath a vault unsullied with a cloud
if from your elevation whence ye view
distinctly scenes invisible to man
and systems of whose birth no tidings yet
have reached this nether world ye spy a race
favoured as ours transgressors from the womb
and hasting to a grave yet doomed to rise
and to possess a brighter heaven than yours
as one who long detained on foreign shores
pants to return and when he sees afar
his countrys weatherbleached and battered rocks
from the green wave emerging darts an eye
radiant with joy towards the happy land
so i with animated hopes behold
and many an aching wish your beamy fires
that show like beacons in the blue abyss
ordained to guide the embodied spirit home
from toilsome life to neverending rest
love kindles as i gaze  i feel desires
that give assurance of their own success
and that infused from heaven must thither tend

so reads he nature whom the lamp of truth
illuminates  thy lamp mysterious word
which whoso sees no longer wanders lost
with intellect bemazed in endless doubt
but runs the road of wisdom  thou hast built
with means that were not till by thee employed
worlds that had never been hadst thou in strength
been less or less benevolent than strong
they are thy witnesses who speak thy power
and goodness infinite but speak in ears
that hear not or receive not their report
in vain thy creatures testify of thee
till thou proclaim thyself  theirs is indeed
a teaching voice but tis the praise of thine
that whom it teaches it makes prompt to learn
and with the boon gives talents for its use
till thou art heard imaginations vain
possess the heart and fables false as hell
yet deemed oracular lure down to death
the uninformed and heedless souls of men
we give to chance blind chance ourselves as blind
the glory of thy work which yet appears
perfect and unimpeachable of blame
challenging human scrutiny and proved
then skilful most when most severely judged
but chance is not or is not where thou reignst
thy providence forbids that fickle power
if power she be that works but to confound
to mix her wild vagaries with thy laws
yet thus we dote refusing while we can
instruction and inventing to ourselves
gods such as guilt makes welcomegods that sleep
or disregard our follies or that sit
amused spectators of this bustling stage
thee we reject unable to abide
thy purity till pure as thou art pure
made such by thee we love thee for that cause
for which we shunned and hated thee before
then we are free  then liberty like day
breaks on the soul and by a flash from heaven
fires all the faculties with glorious joy
a voice is heard that mortal ears hear not
till thou hast touched them tis the voice of song
a loud hosanna sent from all thy works
which he that hears it with a shout repeats
and adds his rapture to the general praise
in that blest moment nature throwing wide
her veil opaque discloses with a smile
the author of her beauties who retired
behind his own creation works unseen
by the impure and hears his power denied
thou art the source and centre of all minds
their only point of rest eternal word
from thee departing they are lost and rove
at random without honour hope or peace
from thee is all that soothes the life of man
his high endeavour and his glad success
his strength to suffer and his will to serve
but oh thou bounteous giver of all good
thou art of all thy gifts thyself the crown
give what thou canst without thee we are poor
and with thee rich take what thou wilt away



book vi

the winter walk at noon

there is in souls a sympathy with sounds
and as the mind is pitched the ear is pleased
with melting airs or martial brisk or grave
some chord in unison with what we hear
is touched within us and the heart replies
how soft the music of those village bells
falling at intervals upon the ear
in cadence sweet now dying all away
now pealing loud again and louder still
clear and sonorous as the gale comes on
with easy force it opens all the cells
where memory slept  wherever i have heard
a kindred melody the scene recurs
and with it all its pleasures and its pains
such comprehensive views the spirit takes
that in a few short moments i retrace
as in a map the voyager his course
the windings of my way through many years
short as in retrospect the journey seems
it seemed not always short the rugged path
and prospect oft so dreary and forlorn
moved many a sigh at its disheartening length
yet feeling present evils while the past
faintly impress the mind or not at all
how readily we wish time spent revoked
that we might try the ground again where once
through inexperience as we now perceive
we missed that happiness we might have found
some friend is gone perhaps his sons best friend
a father whose authority in show
when most severe and mustering all its force
was but the graver countenance of love
whose favour like the clouds of spring might lower
and utter now and then an awful voice
but had a blessing in its darkest frown
threatening at once and nourishing the plant
we loved but not enough the gentle hand
that reared us  at a thoughtless age allured
by every gilded folly we renounced
his sheltering side and wilfully forewent
that converse which we now in vain regret
how gladly would the man recall to life
the boys neglected sire a mother too
that softer friend perhaps more gladly still
might he demand them at the gates of death
sorrow has since they went subdued and tamed
the playful humour he could now endure
himself grown sober in the vale of tears
and feel a parents presence no restraint
but not to understand a treasures worth
till time has stolen away the slighted good
is cause of half the poverty we feel
and makes the world the wilderness it is
the few that pray at all pray oft amiss
and seeking grace to improve the prize they hold
would urge a wiser suit than asking more

the night was winter in his roughest mood
the morning sharp and clear but now at noon
upon the southern side of the slant hills
and where the woods fence off the northern blast
the season smiles resigning all its rage
and has the warmth of may  the vault is blue
without a cloud and white without a speck
the dazzling splendour of the scene below
again the harmony comes oer the vale
and through the trees i view the embattled tower
whence all the music  i again perceive
the soothing influence of the wafted strains
and settle in soft musings as i tread
the walk still verdant under oaks and elms
whose outspread branches overarch the glade
the roof though movable through all its length
as the wind sways it has yet well sufficed
and intercepting in their silent fall
the frequent flakes has kept a path for me
no noise is here or none that hinders thought
the redbreast warbles still but is content
with slender notes and more than half suppressed
pleased with his solitude and flitting light
from spray to spray whereer he rests he shakes
from many a twig the pendant drops of ice
that tinkle in the withered leaves below
stillness accompanied with sounds so soft
charms more than silence  meditation here
may think down hours to moments  here the heart
may give an useful lesson to the head
and learning wiser grow without his books
knowledge and wisdom far from being one
have ofttimes no connection  knowledge dwells
in heads replete with thoughts of other men
wisdom in minds attentive to their own
knowledge a rude unprofitable mass
the mere materials with which wisdom builds
till smoothed and squared and fitted to its place
does but encumber whom it seems to enrich
knowledge is proud that he has learned so much
wisdom is humble that he knows no more
books are not seldom talismans and spells
by which the magic art of shrewder wits
holds an unthinking multitude enthralled
some to the fascination of a name
surrender judgment hoodwinked  some the style
infatuates and through labyrinths and wilds
of error leads them by a tune entranced
while sloth seduces more too weak to bear
the insupportable fatigue of thought
and swallowing therefore without pause or choice
the total grist unsifted husks and all
but trees and rivulets whose rapid course
defies the check of winter haunts of deer
and sheepwalks populous with bleating lambs
and lanes in which the primrose ere her time
peeps through the moss that clothes the hawthorn root
deceive no student  wisdom there and truth
not shy as in the world and to be won
by slow solicitation seize at once
the roving thought and fix it on themselves

what prodigies can power divine perform
more grand than it produces year by year
and all in sight of inattentive man
familiar with the effect we slight the cause
and in the constancy of natures course
the regular return of genial months
and renovation of a faded world
see nought to wonder at  should god again
as once in gibeon interrupt the race
of the undeviating and punctual sun
how would the world admire but speaks it less
an agency divine to make him know
his moment when to sink and when to rise
age after age than to arrest his course
all we behold is miracle  but seen
so duly all is miracle in vain
where now the vital energy that moved
while summer was the pure and subtle lymph
through the imperceptible meandering veins
of leaf and flower  it sleeps  and the icy touch
of unprolific winter has impressed
a cold stagnation on the intestine tide
but let the months go round a few short months
and all shall be restored  these naked shoots
barren as lances among which the wind
makes wintry music sighing as it goes
shall put their graceful foliage on again
and more aspiring and with ampler spread
shall boast new charms and more than they have lost
then each in its peculiar honours clad
shall publish even to the distant eye
its family and tribe  laburnum rich
in streaming gold syringa ivory pure
the scented and the scentless rose this red
and of a humbler growth the other tall
and throwing up into the darkest gloom
of neighbouring cypress or more sable yew
her silver globes light as the foamy surf
that the wind severs from the broken wave
the lilac various in array now white
now sanguine and her beauteous head now set
with purple spikes pyramidal as if
studious of ornament yet unresolved
which hue she most approved she chose them all
copious of flowers the woodbine pale and wan
but well compensating their sickly looks
with nevercloying odours early and late
hypericum all bloom so thick a swarm
of flowers like flies clothing her slender rods
that scarce a leaf appears mezereon too
though leafless well attired and thick beset
with blushing wreaths investing every spray
althaea with the purple eye the broom
yellow and bright as bullion unalloyed
her blossoms and luxuriant above all
the jasmine throwing wide her elegant sweets
the deep dark green of whose unvarnished leaf
makes more conspicuous and illumines more
the bright profusion of her scattered stars
these have been and these shall be in their day
and all this uniform uncoloured scene
shall be dismantled of its fleecy load
and flush into variety again
from dearth to plenty and from death to life
is natures progress when she lectures man
in heavenly truth evincing as she makes
the grand transition that there lives and works
a soul in all things and that soul is god
the beauties of the wilderness are his
that make so gay the solitary place
where no eye sees them  and the fairer forms
that cultivation glories in are his
he sets the bright procession on its way
and marshals all the order of the year
he marks the bounds which winter may not pass
and blunts his pointed fury  in its case
russet and rude folds up the tender germ
uninjured with inimitable art
and ere one flowery season fades and dies
designs the blooming wonders of the next

some say that in the origin of things
when all creation started into birth
the infant elements received a law
from which they swerve not since that under force
of that controlling ordinance they move
and need not his immediate hand who first
prescribed their course to regulate it now
thus dream they and contrive to save a god
the encumbrance of his own concerns and spare
the great artificer of all that moves
the stress of a continual act the pain
of unremitted vigilance and care
as too laborious and severe a task
so man the moth is not afraid it seems
to span omnipotence and measure might
that knows no measure by the scanty rule
and standard of his own that is today
and is not ere tomorrows sun go down
but how should matter occupy a charge
dull as it is and satisfy a law
so vast in its demands unless impelled
to ceaseless service by a ceaseless force
and under pressure of some conscious cause
the lord of all himself through all diffused
sustains and is the life of all that lives
nature is but a name for an effect
whose cause is god  he feeds the secret fire
by which the mighty process is maintained
who sleeps not is not weary in whose sight
slowcircling ages are as transient days
whose work is without labour whose designs
no flaw deforms no difficulty thwarts
and whose beneficence no charge exhausts
him blind antiquity profaned not served
with selftaught rites and under various names
female and male pomona pales pan
and flora and vertumnus peopling earth
with tutelary goddesses and gods
that were not and commending as they would
to each some province garden field or grove
but all are under one  one spirithis
who bore the platted thorns with bleeding brows
rules universal nature  not a flower
but shows some touch in freckle streak or stain
of his unrivalled pencil  he inspires
their balmy odours and imparts their hues
and bathes their eyes with nectar and includes
in grains as countless as the seaside sands
the forms with which he sprinkles all the earth
happy who walks with him whom what he finds
of flavour or of scent in fruit or flower
or what he views of beautiful or grand
in nature from the broad majestic oak
to the green blade that twinkles in the sun
prompts with remembrance of a present god
his presence who made all so fair perceived
makes all still fairer  as with him no scene
is dreary so with him all seasons please
though winter had been none had man been true
and earth be punished for its tenants sake
yet not in vengeance as this smiling sky
so soon succeeding such an angry night
and these dissolving snows and this clear stream
recovering fast its liquid music prove

who then that has a mind well strung and tuned
to contemplation and within his reach
a scene so friendly to his favourite task
would waste attention at the chequered board
his host of wooden warriors to and fro
marching and countermarching with an eye
as fixt as marble with a forehead ridged
and furrowed into storms and with a hand
trembling as if eternity were hung
in balance on his conduct of a pin
nor envies he aught more their idle sport
who pant with application misapplied
to trivial toys and pushing ivory balls
across the velvet level feel a joy
akin to rapture when the bauble finds
its destined goal of difficult access
nor deems he wiser him who gives his noon
to miss the mercers plague from shop to shop
wandering and littering with unfolded silks
the polished counter and approving none
or promising with smiles to call again
nor him who by his vanity seduced
and soothed into a dream that he discerns
the difference of a guido from a daub
frequents the crowded auction  stationed there
as duly as the langford of the show
with glass at eye and catalogue in hand
and tongue accomplished in the fulsome cant
and pedantry that coxcombs learn with ease
oft as the pricedeciding hammer falls
he notes it in his book then raps his box
swears tis a bargain rails at his hard fate
that he has let it passbut never bids

here unmolested through whatever sign
the sun proceeds i wander neither mist
nor freezing sky nor sultry checking me
nor stranger intermeddling with my joy
even in the spring and playtime of the year
that calls the unwonted villager abroad
with all her little ones a sportive train
to gather kingcups in the yellow mead
and prank their hair with daisies or to pick
a cheap but wholesome salad from the brook
these shades are all my own  the timorous hare
grown so familiar with her frequent guest
scarce shuns me and the stockdove unalarmed
sits cooing in the pinetree nor suspends
his long loveditty for my near approach
drawn from his refuge in some lonely elm
that age or injury has hollowed deep
where on his bed of wool and matted leaves
he has outslept the winter ventures forth
to frisk awhile and bask in the warm sun
the squirrel flippant pert and full of play
he sees me and at once swift as a bird
ascends the neighbouring beech there whisks his brush
and perks his ears and stamps and scolds aloud
with all the prettiness of feigned alarm
and anger insignificantly fierce

the heart is hard in nature and unfit
for human fellowship as being void
of sympathy and therefore dead alike
to love and friendship both that is not pleased
with sight of animals enjoying life
nor feels their happiness augment his own
the bounding fawn that darts across the glade
when none pursues through mere delight of heart
and spirits buoyant with excess of glee
the horse as wanton and almost as fleet
that skims the spacious meadow at full speed
then stops and snorts and throwing high his heels
starts to the voluntary race again
the very kine that gambol at high noon
the total herd receiving first from one
that leads the dance a summons to be gay
though wild their strange vagaries and uncouth
their efforts yet resolved with one consent
to give such act and utterance as they may
to ecstasy too big to be suppressed
these and a thousand images of bliss
with which kind nature graces every scene
where cruel man defeats not her design
impart to the benevolent who wish
all that are capable of pleasure pleased
a far superior happiness to theirs
the comfort of a reasonable joy

man scarce had risen obedient to his call
who formed him from the dust his future grave
when he was crowned as never king was since
god set his diadem upon his head
and angel choirs attended  wondering stood
the newmade monarch while before him passed
all happy and all perfect in their kind
the creatures summoned from their various haunts
to see their sovereign and confess his sway
vast was his empire absolute his power
or bounded only by a law whose force
twas his sublimest privilege to feel
and own the law of universal love
he ruled with meekness they obeyed with joy
no cruel purpose lurked within his heart
and no distrust of his intent in theirs
so eden was a scene of harmless sport
where kindness on his part who ruled the whole
begat a tranquil confidence in all
and fear as yet was not nor cause for fear
but sin marred all and the revolt of man
that source of evils not exhausted yet
was punished with revolt of his from him
garden of god how terrible the change
thy groves and lawns then witnessed every heart
each animal of every name conceived
a jealousy and an instinctive fear
and conscious of some danger either fled
precipitate the loathed abode of man
or growled defiance in such angry sort
as taught him too to tremble in his turn
thus harmony and family accord
were driven from paradise and in that hour
the seeds of cruelty that since have swelled
to such gigantic and enormous growth
were sown in human natures fruitful soil
hence date the persecution and the pain
that man inflicts on all inferior kinds
regardless of their plaints  to make him sport
to gratify the frenzy of his wrath
or his base gluttony are causes good
and just in his account why bird and beast
should suffer torture and the streams be dyed
with blood of their inhabitants impaled
earth groans beneath the burden of a war
waged with defenceless innocence while he
not satisfied to prey on all around
adds tenfold bitterness to death by pangs
needless and first torments ere he devours
now happiest they that occupy the scenes
the most remote from his abhorred resort
whom once as delegate of god on earth
they feared and as his perfect image loved
the wilderness is theirs with all its caves
its hollow glens its thickets and its plains
unvisited by man  there they are free
and howl and roar as likes them uncontrolled
nor ask his leave to slumber or to play
woe to the tyrant if he dare intrude
within the confines of their wild domain
the lion tells him i am monarch here
and if he spares him spares him on the terms
of royal mercy and through generous scorn
to rend a victim trembling at his foot
in measure as by force of instinct drawn
or by necessity constrained they live
dependent upon man those in his fields
these at his crib and some beneath his roof
they prove too often at how dear a rate
he sells protection  witness at his foot
the spaniel dying for some venial fault
under dissection of the knotted scourge
witness the patient ox with stripes and yells
driven to the slaughter goaded as he runs
to madness while the savage at his heels
laughs at the frantic sufferers fury spent
upon the guiltless passenger oerthrown
he too is witness noblest of the train
that wait on man the flightperforming horse
with unsuspecting readiness he takes
his murderer on his back and pushed all day
with bleeding sides and flanks that heave for life
to the fardistant goal arrives and dies
so little mercy shows who needs so much
does law so jealous in the cause of man
denounce no doom on the delinquent  none
he lives and oer his brimming beaker boasts
as if barbarity were high desert
the inglorious feat and clamorous in praise
of the poor brute seems wisely to suppose
the honours of his matchless horse his own
but many a crime deemed innocent on earth
is registered in heaven and these no doubt
have each their record with a curse annexed
man may dismiss compassion from his heart
but god will never  when he charged the jew
to assist his foes downfallen beast to rise
and when the bushexploring boy that seized
the young to let the parent bird go free
proved he not plainly that his meaner works
are yet his care and have an interest all
all in the universal fathers love
on noah and in him on all mankind
the charter was conferred by which we hold
the flesh of animals in fee and claim
oer all we feed on power of life and death
but read the instrument and mark it well
the oppression of a tyrannous control
can find no warrant there  feed then and yield
thanks for thy food  carnivorous through sin
feed on the slain but spare the living brute

the governor of all himself to all
so bountiful in whose attentive ear
the unfledged raven and the lions whelp
plead not in vain for pity on the pangs
of hunger unassuaged has interposed
not seldom his avenging arm to smite
the injurious trampler upon natures law
that claims forbearance even for a brute
he hates the hardness of a balaams heart
and prophet as he was he might not strike
the blameless animal without rebuke
on which he rode  her opportune offence
saved him or the unrelenting seer had died
he sees that human equity is slack
to interfere though in so just a cause
and makes the task his own inspiring dumb
and helpless victims with a sense so keen
of injury with such knowledge of their strength
and such sagacity to take revenge
that oft the beast has seemed to judge the man
an ancient not a legendary tale
by one of sound intelligence rehearsed
if such who plead for providence may seem
in modern eyes shall make the doctrine clear

where england stretched towards the setting sun
narrow and long oerlooks the western wave
dwelt young misagathus a scorner he
of god and goodness atheist in ostent
vicious in act in temper savagefierce
he journeyed and his chance was as he went
to join a traveller of far different note
evander famed for piety for years
deserving honour but for wisdom more
fame had not left the venerable man
a stranger to the manners of the youth
whose face too was familiar to his view
their way was on the margin of the land
oer the green summit of the rocks whose base
beats back the roaring surge scarce heard so high
the charity that warmed his heart was moved
at sight of the manmonster  with a smile
gentle and affable and full of grace
as fearful of offending whom he wished
much to persuade he plied his ear with truths
not harshly thundered forth or rudely pressed
but like his purpose gracious kind and sweet
and dost thou dream the impenetrable man
exclaimed that me the lullabies of age
and fantasies of dotards such as thou
can cheat or move a moments fear in me
mark now the proof i give thee that the brave
need no such aids as superstition lends
to steel their hearts against the dread of death
he spoke and to the precipice at hand
pushed with a madmans fury  fancy shrinks
and the blood thrills and curdles at the thought
of such a gulf as he designed his grave
but though the felon on his back could dare
the dreadful leap more rational his steed
declined the death and wheeling swiftly round
or ere his hoof had pressed the crumbling verge
baffled his rider saved against his will
the frenzy of the brain may be redressed
by medicine well applied but without grace
the hearts insanity admits no cure
enraged the more by what might have reformed
his horrible intent again he sought
destruction with a zeal to be destroyed
with sounding whip and rowels dyed in blood
but still in vain  the providence that meant
a longer date to the far nobler beast
spared yet again the ignobler for his sake
and now his prowess proved and his sincere
incurable obduracy evinced
his rage grew cool and pleased perhaps to have earned
so cheaply the renown of that attempt
with looks of some complacence he resumed
his road deriding much the blank amaze
of good evander still where he was left
fixed motionless and petrified with dread
so on they fared discourse on other themes
ensuing seemed to obliterate the past
and tamer far for so much fury shown
as is the course of rash and fiery men
the rude companion smiled as if transformed
but twas a transient calm  a storm was near
an unsuspected storm  his hour was come
the impious challenger of power divine
was now to learn that heaven though slow to wrath
is never with impunity defied
his horse as he had caught his masters mood
snorting and starting into sudden rage
unbidden and not now to be controlled
rushed to the cliff and having reached it stood
at once the shock unseated him he flew
sheer oer the craggy barrier and immersed
deep in the flood found when he sought it not
the death he had deserved and died alone
so god wrought double justice made the fool
the victim of his own tremendous choice
and taught a brute the way to safe revenge

i would not enter on my list of friends
though graced with polished manners and fine sense
yet wanting sensibility the man
who needlessly sets foot upon a worm
an inadvertent step may crush the snail
that crawls at evening in the public path
but he that has humanity forewarned
will tread aside and let the reptile live
the creeping vermin loathsome to the sight
and charged perhaps with venom that intrudes
a visitor unwelcome into scenes
sacred to neatness and repose the alcove
the chamber or refectory may die
a necessary act incurs no blame
not so when held within their proper bounds
and guiltless of offence they range the air
or take their pastime in the spacious field
there they are privileged and he that hunts
or harms them there is guilty of a wrong
disturbs the economy of natures realm
who when she formed designed them an abode
the sum is this  if mans convenience health
or safety interfere his rights and claims
are paramount and must extinguish theirs
else they are allthe meanest things that are
as free to live and to enjoy that life
as god was free to form them at the first
who in his sovereign wisdom made them all
ye therefore who love mercy teach your sons
to love it too  the springtime of our years
is soon dishonoured and defiled in most
by budding ills that ask a prudent hand
to check them  but alas none sooner shoots
if unrestrained into luxuriant growth
than cruelty most devilish of them all
mercy to him that shows it is the rule
and righteous limitation of its act
by which heaven moves in pardoning guilty man
and he that shows none being ripe in years
and conscious of the outrage he commits
shall seek it and not find it in his turn

distinguished much by reason and still more
by our capacity of grace divine
from creatures that exist but for our sake
which having served us perish we are held
accountable and god some future day
will reckon with us roundly for the abuse
of what he deems no mean or trivial trust
superior as we are they yet depend
not more on human help than we on theirs
their strength or speed or vigilance were given
in aid of our defects  in some are found
such teachable and apprehensive parts
that mans attainments in his own concerns
matched with the expertness of the brutes in theirs
are ofttimes vanquished and thrown far behind
some show that nice sagacity of smell
and read with such discernment in the port
and figure of the man his secret aim
that oft we owe our safety to a skill
we could not teach and must despair to learn
but learn we might if not too proud to stoop
to quadruped instructors many a good
and useful quality and virtue too
rarely exemplified among ourselves
attachment never to be weaned or changed
by any change of fortune proof alike
against unkindness absence and neglect
fidelity that neither bribe nor threat
can move or warp and gratitude for small
and trivial favours lasting as the life
and glistening even in the dying eye

man praises man  desert in arts or arms
wins public honour and ten thousand sit
patiently present at a sacred song
commemorationmad content to hear
oh wonderful effect of musics power
messiahs eulogy for handels sake
but less methinks than sacrilege might serve
for was it less  what heathen would have dared
to strip joves statue of his oaken wreath
and hang it up in honour of a man
much less might serve when all that we design
is but to gratify an itching ear
and give the day to a musicians praise
remember handel who that was not born
deaf as the dead to harmony forgets
or can the more than homer of his age
yeswe remember him and while we praise
a talent so divine remember too
that his most holy book from whom it came
was never meant was never used before
to buckram out the memory of a man
but hushthe muse perhaps is too severe
and with a gravity beyond the size
and measure of the offence rebukes a deed
less impious than absurd and owing more
to want of judgment than to wrong design
so in the chapel of old ely house
when wandering charles who meant to be the third
had fled from william and the news was fresh
the simple clerk but loyal did announce
and eke did rear right merrily two staves
sung to the praise and glory of king george
man praises man and garricks memory next
when time has somewhat mellowed it and made
the idol of our worship while he lived
the god of our idolatry once more
shall have its altar and the world shall go
in pilgrimage to bow before his shrine
the theatre too small shall suffocate
its squeezed contents and more than it admits
shall sigh at their exclusion and return
ungratified  for there some noble lord
shall stuff his shoulders with king richards bunch
or wrap himself in hamlets inky cloak
and strut and storm and straddle stamp and stare
to show the world how garrick did not act
for garrick was a worshipper himself
he drew the liturgy and framed the rites
and solemn ceremonial of the day
and called the world to worship on the banks
of avon famed in song  ah pleasant proof
that piety has still in human hearts
some place a spark or two not yet extinct
the mulberrytree was hung with blooming wreaths
the mulberrytree stood centre of the dance
the mulberrytree was hymned with dulcet airs
and from his touchwood trunk the mulberrytree
supplied such relics as devotion holds
still sacred and preserves with pious care
so twas a hallowed time  decorum reigned
and mirth without offence  no few returned
doubtless much edified and all refreshed
man praises man  the rabble all alive
from tippling benches cellars stalls and styes
swarm in the streets  the statesman of the day
a pompous and slowmoving pageant comes
some shout him and some hang upon his car
to gaze in his eyes and bless him  maidens wave
their kerchiefs and old women weep for joy
while others not so satisfied unhorse
the gilded equipage and turning loose
his steeds usurp a place they well deserve
why what has charmed them  hath he saved the state
no  doth he purpose its salvation  no
enchanting novelty that moon at full
that finds out every crevice of the head
that is not sound and perfect hath in theirs
wrought this disturbance  but the wane is near
and his own cattle must suffice him soon
thus idly do we waste the breath of praise
and dedicate a tribute in its use
and just direction sacred to a thing
doomed to the dust or lodged already there
encomium in old time was poets work
but poets having lavishly long since
exhausted all materials of the art
the task now falls into the public hand
and i contented with a humble theme
have poured my stream of panegyric down
the vale of nature where it creeps and winds
among her lovely works with a secure
and unambitious course reflecting clear
if not the virtues yet the worth of brutes
and i am recompensed and deem the toil
of poetry not lost if verse of mine
may stand between an animal and woe
and teach one tyrant pity for his drudge

the groans of nature in this nether world
which heaven has heard for ages have an end
foretold by prophets and by poets sung
whose fire was kindled at the prophets lamp
the time of rest the promised sabbath comes
six thousand years of sorrow have wellnigh
fulfilled their tardy and disastrous course
over a sinful world and what remains
of this tempestuous state of human things
is merely as the working of a sea
before a calm that rocks itself to rest
for he whose car the winds are and the clouds
the dust that waits upon his sultry march
when sin hath moved him and his wrath is hot
shall visit earth in mercy shall descend
propitious in his chariot paved with love
and what his storms have blasted and defaced
for mans revolt shall with a smile repair

sweet is the harp of prophecy too sweet
not to be wronged by a mere mortal touch
nor can the wonders it records be sung
to meaner music and not suffer loss
but when a poet or when one like me
happy to rove among poetic flowers
though poor in skill to rear them lights at last
on some fair theme some theme divinely fair
such is the impulse and the spur he feels
to give it praise proportioned to its worth
that not to attempt it arduous as he deems
the labour were a task more arduous still

oh scenes surpassing fable and yet true
scenes of accomplished bliss which who can see
though but in distant prospect and not feel
his soul refreshed with foretaste of the joy
rivers of gladness water all the earth
and clothe all climes with beauty the reproach
of barrenness is past  the fruitful field
laughs with abundance and the land once lean
or fertile only in its own disgrace
exults to see its thistly curse repealed
the various seasons woven into one
and that one season an eternal spring
the garden fears no blight and needs no fence
for there is none to covet all are full
the lion and the libbard and the bear
graze with the fearless flocks  all bask at noon
together or all gambol in the shade
of the same grove and drink one common stream
antipathies are none  no foe to man
lurks in the serpent now  the mother sees
and smiles to see her infants playful hand
stretched forth to dally with the crested worm
to stroke his azure neck or to receive
the lambent homage of his arrowy tongue
all creatures worship man and all mankind
one lord one father  error has no place
that creeping pestilence is driven away
the breath of heaven has chased it  in the heart
no passion touches a discordant string
but all is harmony and love  disease
is not  the pure and uncontaminated blood
holds its due course nor fears the frost of age
one song employs all nations and all cry
worthy the lamb for he was slain for us
the dwellers in the vales and on the rocks
shout to each other and the mountaintops
from distant mountains catch the flying joy
till nation after nation taught the strain
each rolls the rapturous hosanna round
behold the measure of the promise filled
see salem built the labour of a god
bright as a sun the sacred city shines
all kingdoms and all princes of the earth
flock to that light the glory of all lands
flows into her unbounded is her joy
and endless her increase  thy rams are there
nebaioth and the flocks of kedar there
the looms of ormus and the mines of ind
and sabas spicy groves pay tribute there
praise is in all her gates  upon her walls
and in her streets and in her spacious courts
is heard salvation  eastern java there
kneels with the native of the farthest west
and aethiopia spreads abroad the hand
and worships  her report has travelled forth
into all lands  from every clime they come
to see thy beauty and to share thy joy
o sion an assembly such as earth
saw never such as heaven stoops down to see

 nebaioth and kedar the sons of ishmael and progenitors of the
arabs in the prophetic scripture here alluded to may be reasonably
considered as representatives of the gentiles at largec

thus heavenward all things tend  for all were once
perfect and all must be at length restored
so god has greatly purposed who would else
in his dishonoured works himself endure
dishonour and be wronged without redress
haste then and wheel away a shattered world
ye slowrevolving seasons  we would see
a sight to which our eyes are strangers yet
a world that does not dread and hate his laws
and suffer for its crime  would learn how fair
the creature is that god pronounces good
how pleasant in itself what pleases him
here every drop of honey hides a sting
worms wind themselves into our sweetest flowers
and even the joy that haply some poor heart
derives from heaven pure as the fountain is
is sullied in the stream taking a taint
from touch of human lips at best impure
oh for a world in principle as chaste
as this is gross and selfish over which
custom and prejudice shall bear no sway
that govern all things here shouldering aside
the meek and modest truth and forcing her
to seek a refuge from the tongue of strife
in nooks obscure far from the ways of men
where violence shall never lift the sword
nor cunning justify the proud mans wrong
leaving the poor no remedy but tears
where he that fills an office shall esteem
the occasion it presents of doing good
more than the perquisite where laws shall speak
seldom and never but as wisdom prompts
and equity not jealous more to guard
a worthless form than to decide aright
where fashion shall not sanctify abuse
nor smooth goodbreeding supplemental grace
with lean performance ape the work of love

come then and added to thy many crowns
receive yet one the crown of all the earth
thou who alone art worthy it was thine
by ancient covenant ere natures birth
and thou hast made it thine by purchase since
and overpaid its value with thy blood
thy saints proclaim thee king and in their hearts
thy title is engraven with a pen
dipt in the fountain of eternal love
thy saints proclaim thee king and thy delay
gives courage to their foes who could they see
the dawn of thy last advent longdesired
would creep into the bowels of the hills
and flee for safety to the falling rocks
the very spirit of the world is tired
of its own taunting question asked so long
where is the promise of your lords approach
the infidel has shot his bolts away
till his exhausted quiver yielding none
he gleans the blunted shafts that have recoiled
and aims them at the shield of truth again
the veil is rent rent too by priestly hands
that hides divinity from mortal eyes
and all the mysteries to faith proposed
insulted and traduced are cast aside
as useless to the moles and to the bats
they now are deemed the faithful and are praised
who constant only in rejecting thee
deny thy godhead with a martyrs zeal
and quit their office for their errors sake
blind and in love with darkness yet even these
worthy compared with sycophants who kneel
thy name adoring and then preach thee man
so fares thy church  but how thy church may fare
the world takes little thought who will may preach
and what they will  all pastors are alike
to wandering sheep resolved to follow none
two gods divide them all pleasure and gain
for these they live they sacrifice to these
and in their service wage perpetual war
with conscience and with thee  lust in their hearts
and mischief in their hands they roam the earth
to prey upon each other stubborn fierce
highminded foaming out their own disgrace
thy prophets speak of such and noting down
the features of the last degenerate times
exhibit every lineament of these
come then and added to thy many crowns
receive yet one as radiant as the rest
due to thy last and most effectual work
thy word fulfilled the conquest of a world

he is the happy man whose life even now
shows somewhat of that happier life to come
who doomed to an obscure but tranquil state
is pleased with it and were he free to choose
would make his fate his choice whom peace the fruit
of virtue and whom virtue fruit of faith
prepare for happiness bespeak him one
content indeed to sojourn while he must
below the skies but having there his home
the world oerlooks him in her busy search
of objects more illustrious in her view
and occupied as earnestly as she
though more sublimely he oerlooks the world
she scorns his pleasures for she knows them not
he seeks not hers for he has proved them vain
he cannot skim the ground like summer birds
pursuing gilded flies and such he deems
her honours her emoluments her joys
therefore in contemplation is his bliss
whose power is such that whom she lifts from earth
she makes familiar with a heaven unseen
and shows him glories yet to be revealed
not slothful he though seeming unemployed
and censured oft as useless  stillest streams
oft water fairest meadows and the bird
that flutters least is longest on the wing
ask him indeed what trophies he has raised
or what achievements of immortal fame
he purposes and he shall answernone
his warfare is within  there unfatigued
his fervent spirit labours  there he fights
and there obtains fresh triumphs oer himself
and neverwithering wreaths compared with which
the laurels that a caesar reaps are weeds
perhaps the selfapproving haughty world
that as she sweeps him with her whistling silks
scarce deigns to notice him or if she see
deems him a cipher in the works of god
receives advantage from his noiseless hours
of which she little dreams  perhaps she owes
her sunshine and her rain her blooming spring
and plenteous harvest to the prayer he makes
when isaaclike the solitary saint
walks forth to meditate at eventide
and think on her who thinks not for herself
forgive him then thou bustler in concerns
of little worth and idler in the best
if author of no mischief and some good
he seeks his proper happiness by means
that may advance but cannot hinder thine
nor though he tread the secret path of life
engage no notice and enjoy much ease
account him an encumbrance on the state
receiving benefits and rendering none
his sphere though humble if that humble sphere
shine with his fair example and though small
his influence if that influence all be spent
in soothing sorrow and in quenching strife
in aiding helpless indigence in works
from which at least a grateful few derive
some taste of comfort in a world of woe
then let the supercilious great confess
he serves his country recompenses well
the state beneath the shadow of whose vine
he sits secure and in the scale of life
holds no ignoble though a slighted place
the man whose virtues are more felt than seen
must drop indeed the hope of public praise
but he may boast what few that win it can
that if his country stand not by his skill
at least his follies have not wrought her fall
polite refinement offers him in vain
her golden tube through which a sensual world
draws gross impurity and likes it well
the neat conveyance hiding all the offence
not that he peevishly rejects a mode
because that world adopts it  if it bear
the stamp and clear impression of good sense
and be not costly more than of true worth
he puts it on and for decorum sake
can wear it een as gracefully as she
she judges of refinement by the eye
he by the test of conscience and a heart
not soon deceived aware that what is base
no polish can make sterling and that vice
though wellperfumed and elegantly dressed
like an unburied carcass tricked with flowers
is but a garnished nuisance fitter far
for cleanly riddance than for fair attire
so life glides smoothly and by stealth away
more golden than that age of fabled gold
renowned in ancient song not vexed with care
or stained with guilt beneficent approved
of god and man and peaceful in its end

so glide my life away and so at last
my share of duties decently fulfilled
may some disease not tardy to perform
its destined office yet with gentle stroke
dismiss me weary to a safe retreat
beneath the turf that i have often trod
it shall not grieve me then that once when called
to dress a sofa with the flowers of verse
i played awhile obedient to the fair
with that light task but soon to please her more
whom flowers alone i knew would little please
let fall the unfinished wreath and roved for fruit
roved far and gathered much some harsh tis true
picked from the thorns and briars of reproof
but wholesome welldigested grateful some
to palates that can taste immortal truth
insipid else and sure to be despised
but all is in his hand whose praise i seek
in vain the poet sings and the world hears
if he regard not though divine the theme
tis not in artful measures in the chime
and idle tinkling of a minstrels lyre
to charm his ear whose eye is on the heart
whose frown can disappoint the proudest strain
whose approbationprosper even mineembed"
