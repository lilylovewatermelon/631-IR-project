late dawns and early sunsets
just like my favorite scenes
then holding hands and life was perfect
just like up on the screen

prechorus
and the whole time while always giving
counting your face among the living

verse 2
up and down escalators
pennies and colder fountains
elevators and halfprice sales
trapped in by all these mountains

prechorus
running away and hiding with you
i never thought theyd get me here
not knowing you changed from just one bite
i fought them all off just to hold you close and tight

chorus
but does anyone notice but does anyone care
and if i had the guts to put this to your head
but would anything matter if youre already dead
and should i be shocked now by the last thing you said
before i pull this trigger your eyes vacant and stained
but does anyone notice but does anyone care
and if i had the guts to put this to your head
and would anything matter if youre already dead
and now should i be shocked by the last thing you said
before i pull this trigger your eyes vacant and stained
and in saying you loved me made things harder at best
and these words changing nothing as your body remains
and theres no room in this hell theres no room in the next
and our memories defeat us and ill end this duress
but does anyone notice but does anyone care
and if i had the guts to put this to your head
but does anything matter if youre already dead
and should i be shocked now by the last thing you said
before i pull this trigger your eyes vacant and stained
and in saying you loved me made things harder at best
and these words changing nothing as your body remains
and theres no room in this hell theres no room in the next
but does anyone notice theres a corpse in this bedsee my chemical romance liveget tickets as low as 445you might also like29embed"
