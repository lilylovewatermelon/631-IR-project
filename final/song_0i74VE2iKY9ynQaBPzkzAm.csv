i said…north carolina
that’s boy a lamer
prob’ly take his shirt off
twist it around his head spinnin’ like a heli
i was just makin’ sure y’all was wit’ me
aye not too long ago the lil’ homie gq prep
he hit me like “x what you think about battling jerry wess”
i said “nigga i’m not battling i’m grindin’
shit i’m just tryna see a mill’ prep”
but now i’m back cookin’ everything early i’m tryna meal prep
y’all feel that
against teewhy won’t lie j snapped
well if y’all champion get outta line i’ll give him this tec9 tech 9 if j black jayblac
what you thought for your career that this was a good idea
to battle x ‘cause he been sittin’ on bars for like four years
well good luck with that stupid shit
this ruger spit hit him from his top to his…
you pussy so ain’t no need to tell you the risk uterus
that goofy shit get his bean hit
or i’ll hit up qleen like “qleen come clean this
you know that job i was offerin’ was to get him drug”
but they ain’t tryna see qleen clean pissed
i mean this mean shit rip him apart
that 40 on his roof talk wit’ the steel i’m principal clark
hey lean on me i’ll kill a nigga
scheme on me leave his body on ice i’ll chill a nigga
what make y’all think he want this bout next y’all doubt x
these bullets new york groupies that love daylyt
i’ll have these bitches flyin’ out wess west
get ya top red when that lead up i’m fed up
not to mention this a preachers’ convention nigga i’m revved up
lead up get ya head bust
there’ll be a few concussions
not to mention my lil’ cannon’s patience runnin’ low like ilena’s cousin
aye leg shot his bitch
the way i gave her a cane hurricane you’ll think fema comin’
the baldhead out that tommy strong leave a hole in him the size of gina’s onion
nigga i don’t feel ya
i will 44 blue steel ya
i got bloods and crips that will kill ya
that sort of shit morpheus ‘cause the blue or red peel pill ya
i’m not playin’ i’m not playin’ with these lil’ niggas
i got crips on standby
they’ll give him them tecs foul
just called up a sick blood  they be lookin’ for wess now west nile
nigga always talkin’ how he get violent right
then it’s jalapeños shit get hot and j get silent
i’m better than 90 percent of these veterans
smack who hold the throne
‘cause for the right amount of cheese i promise they won’t be a pro for long provolone
but you
for actin’ slow am i wrong if i tore this tortoise shell off in him
touche…
i watched two or three of your battles and watched you take two l’s like that was cool j
well j will catch a pair of 9’s like cool grays
leave him slumped
he let a shot off  bah
ironic how jerry wess west had the 44 but only let it ring once
i got that xfactor snub nose bigger than a bitch
and the barrel longer than my shit on that photoshop pic
aye you lyin’ you phony
this 9’ll blow three
or this ice pick tearin’ tear in his face like the cryin’ emoji
aye smack i was thinkin’ born legacy supreme 2 gon’ be a thrill
plus i show out showwoutt with punches so how would i eye knot be on the bill
aye jerry wess huh you let them ‘matics blow
when he saw this tre he started playin’ another role
i’m talkin’ smack words before red rounds you radio “you ready o”
‘cause now the nigga actin’ slow
the gun spot him
three shots one drop him
his spirit rise i get to tan his soul like the gumbottoms
run that back nigga  tan sole that’s gumbottoms
chrome shit
that boy won’t make it home ‘less homeless a bum spot him
aye you got a long fuckin’ day
so i hope you got your practice
‘cause all night i’m just fatbitchbungeecordsnappin’ nigga
fuck outta here
you might also likeround 1 jerry wess
i said a lot of pioneers left this game all for commas
some relationships was maintained and that’s to my knowledge
the url always investin’  y’all even blew some dollars
but smack must still be fuckin’ wit’ exclusiv vodka
we was supposed to been battled
but the url wanted what’s best for him
told me i had to snap first
i pushed tee to the side and got x again
why we really here x
‘cause you tried to show your shit amongst the new generation and noticed yo’ style’s off
got smoked at double impact but let you tell it it’s all miles’ fault
see niggas thought his return woulda been fire
you ain’t as lit as you think
really you just came back washed backwash like you spit in your drink
i saw him bumpin’ music in his car
first thought drug him in his shit
or switch to the hammer call him  “aye you x” aux  then plug him in his whip
or i could light up his hoopty
you know that bumass subaru
i roam in roman hit x v with 15 it ain’t a numeral
i’ll have ya bitch chop ya body up you’ll be cut in two
meanin’ if i let her letter in front of x she’ll double you w
if you let your boys jump in i’m lettin’ off wild chrome
it won’t be an accomplishment when he lookin’ at miles’ stone milestone
if that nigga marv start talkin’ from the sideline then let him know a bodyguard is a dumb profession
he ain’t know that i pop groups ‘til i put it in won one direction
i was thinkin’ about sendin’ verb a shot but i put the toolie back
super fact  i would give aye an ‘r ar but his music wack
just ‘cause he never seen me before don’t make me new nigga
your new girl my old girl  i was x ex before you nigga
he made it seem like it was tough in his era
the shit had to be lies
y’all saw me come in the game walk through i’m a strategy guide
he pavin’ the way for the new generation that’s a vast prediction
i’m confused  how is he the truth when everything about factor fact or fiction
smack got me battlin’ washed vets
he tryin’ me for realagain
bet my next battle be the return of yung illagain
you haven’t been a factor since young x
come to think about it when were you young x
the more my stock rise the more you die out
that’s where you and i stand x
must be killin’ you
once i got a leg in i’ve shortened your lifespan x spandex
his lines was fire but will never be the same that’s a bad shapeup
sorry to say it but the truth gon’ hurt x ex like a bad breakup
you already know he ain’t gon’ bungeecordsnap on shit
you gon’ lose this whole first round my nigga  that’s it
brooklyn in this bitch
let’s go
round 2 xfactor
nigga they asked me to battle you like a thousand times
i’m talkin’ even after tech 9 i just ain’t feel you was deadly
a few more of his battles dropped i watched
i said “ok lil’ lil’ jerry here may be ready”
right
but in the back of my mind i’m thinkin’ “you win vers’”
nigga you couldn’t even win the flip
and that’s when i heard that infamous bar
y’all know that “bullets’ll spit out tee tea like pfft ‘ain’t no sugar in this shit’”
i said “whoo”
see now i’m panickin’ nigga pacin’ ‘round the house
‘cause sayin’ shit like that against me ya finally got the clout
well this glock20 long clip
it’ll finally hit his scalp
and bullets’ll spit out jerry like tom finally caught the mouse
my nigga called me right before the battle
he said “bub nigga don’t get dust off”
i looked at the phone crazy
he said “well well before you get appalled a paul i’m just sayin’ be mellow ‘melo and knock the rust russ off”
i said “ok c okc tell me what you really mean when you talk dawg”
he said “just go out there and break a leg ‘cause in the ‘hood niggas be ball hogs”
he said “and ya gotta carry curry yourself like a boss do
and for you to ig’ the green that’s just not somethin’ that a boss do
you a dog and he dog food
and even in ya golden state you was showin’ a lot of these rookies what them bars do”
i said “facts”
he said “and ain’t a nigga pocketcheckin’ shit
‘cause if they act hard in harden here even a chris chin’ll christian be gettin’ blessed”
nigga i say all that to confess
i’m a houston fan so i don’t wanna see nothin’ but rockets comin’ outta wess west
it only gets better
i said so don’t get me upset
i’ll be at every known relative house lookin’ for wess
they said “he at the url”
i said “nigga i’m at the ip address”
like what’s crackin’
knife or the 45
you want four shots or a bowtie
because i’ll keep the four tucked or the blade’ll poke eye
no lie  all these new battleass niggas get murdered fast
i mean the core cor’ of my misfits ms fit is ricans they’ll murda ave
aye or put a slight fee on mike p
that other nigga i’ll stick a bad bitch on him
he’ll wife her fast
that nigga think she on twork twerk team ‘til he see a pussy poppin’ his ass
aye tell k you can’t escape this death nigga you’re no rider
oh he is well this 50 son will turn shine to a ghost driver
i’mma bake his bean like boston when i’m airin’ him
desert eagle  i mean the mac kill mchale but i’d rather use the bird to perish parrish him
i’m darin’ him
i’ll put a price on yo’ head nigga
that whip ain’t safe
watch the god work
now it’s a ticket on that bentley and your life is what defines worth fonzworth
aye look aye look aye
now go on and be a bad boy
i’ll roll through wit’ 30 whips clappin’ at his shit
he’ll catch about 112 in total
oh you finally in front of me duke
well this smack taxes
you been workin’ all year to get this w too w2
you won’t catch me slippin’
not even maybe let off like 100 shots
nigga you couldn’t light bub in broad daylight if you was wit’ daylyt and he brought about 100 watts
niggas wit’ him i’m like “damn dawg”
‘cause if i flash it from the coat colt and drew andrew
i’m just sayin’ y’all it’s pure luck if these bullets i threw just take a hand off handoff
aw i know what he thinkin’
i know what he thinkin’ like “i’m goin’ all outfor x he ain’t been hot in years”
but i bring that dog out
he like “i’m gettin’ calls all day i’m gettin’ calls now
and i done snatched him out the freezer to cook him”
i said well that’s clear ‘cause this wasn’t thought thawed out
you got a long fuckin’ day
so i hope you got your practice
‘cause all night i’m just fatbitchbungeecordsnappin’ nigga

round 3 jerry wess
i got a question
does bein’ pushed as a vet or a legend make you toptier
i don’t know but i’ll push this vet off a ledge and make his top tear
since a young’un people died around me

niggas keep sleepin’ on me i’mma spaz on him just for sleepin’ on wess
i’m chris brown  for the rest of my career i’m gon’ be known for beatin’ on x ex
you took a hiatus from battle rap
he took a hiatus from battle rap real smooth
you ducked shine just to get help and still lose
you told kshine “where your girl i might pop your boo”
then i got confused ‘cause what made you say “pause”
so wait wait wait
when you say gay shit we say “pause”
but when you say straight shit you say
yo this nigga can’t adapt to this new generation and this who y’all figure vet
this round fuck the bro code i’m ‘bout to talk to that nigga x ex
now when your bro do somethin’ dumb you stop him right
see i don’t like that shit
‘cause what’s crazy is niggas say miles messed up the 2on2 but you let him write that shit
and since niggas feel i got the worst vet on the card they think i’mma play
why would i slack fam’
niggas been tellin’ me“go at ‘em wess” adam west original batman
at the end of it it i’m only here to body clowns
cold case they gon’ find how x ex dead like bobby brown
