ill tell you something 1968 was just another year the fields needed tilling and there wasnt enough rain but it was the first year rosie started bringing my lunch out to the field every day

verse 1
you get your hands in it
plant your roots in it
dusty headlight dance with your boots in it dirt
you write her name on it
spin your tires on it
build your corn field whiskey bonfires on it dirt
you bet your life on it yeah
its that

chorus
elm shade red rust clay you grew up on
that plowed up ground that your dad damned his luck on
that post game party field you circle up on
and when it rains you get stuck on
drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
and mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
her blueeyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

music video interlude 1

youve mixed some sweat with it
taking a shovel to it
youve stuck some crosses and some painted
goal posts through it dirt
you know you came from it dirt
and some day youll return to

chorus 
elm shade red rust clay you grew up on
that plowed up ground that your dad damned his luck on
that post game party field you circle up on
and when it rains you get stuck on
drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
and mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
her blueeyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

music video interlude 2
i asked rosie one time if she wanted to travel to see the world and no she said the world comes right to my window every day even if its broken
you know you came from it dirt dirt and some day youll return to

see rosie was right about two things you dont have to see the world to be worldly just raise good children bake good enough pies and the world will come right to your kitchen window shes right about something else too i built that baseball diamond way too close to the kitchen
