13 in the thick of a cornfield
i learned to fight keep roads tied and not chill
never did change stayed strange hopped a train
my first chance i got out of smallville
life has its way of movin you on dont it

verse 2
my first stop was a pawn shop
dropped a pretty penny for a cheap fender with a song in it
i had a quick right hand and an old band
i thought good friends would make a good band
life has its way of provin you wrong dont it

chorus
ive been right and ive been wrong
somewhere in between for so long
live the night miss the light and ive been shown it
life has its way of keepin you strong dont it

verse 3
so there i was a long way from nowhere
fried mind spare time and a blank stare
i was just numb enough not to feel a thang
after all we didnt share a set of rings
besides how bad could it be
she never found out id never come clean
life has its way of leadin you on dont it
see kenny chesney liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likechorus
ive been right and ive been wrong
somewhere in between for so long
live the night miss the light and ive been shown it
life has its way of keepin you strong dont it

verse 4
well now have you ever been down the old back road
on time borrowed
its a trip its a bitch its an on and off light switch
nobody follows
everybodys got their own past
skeletons to stash dont look back if you do laugh
life has its way of movin you on dont itembed"
