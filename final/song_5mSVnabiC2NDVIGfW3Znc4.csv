looking round its hard to believe where im at uh
everywhere i look somebody starin back yeah
paranoid even out in paradise
terrified to see my parents pass
red carpet and some dress shoes
and a pair of slacks
i think i might be gettin sick of wearin that
i need some peace and the burbs might be where its at
you know like where them karens like to they run they errands at
im on a journey man jarrett jack
got my twin with me like the parent trap there and back
serenade em with the clarinet
i got the tea and i aint sharin that
who the fairest of em all shawtys been declarin jack
fellas hatin i dont blame em i mean how unfair is that
the top is where they like to see you get embarrassed at
especially when you charismatic and the coppas wear hermès

prechorus jack harlow  justin timberlake
all these airplanes and these checked bags
all these rumors and these unchecked facts
old friends i forget to text back
maybe thisll show where my heads at my bad you know

chorus justin timberlake
every sky cant be blue
its hard to see when youre walkin in the grey
so many flights look at how the time flew
so many things that i never got to—
good days bad days red lights fast lanes
would you never change would you be the same
just tell me one thing thats true when i aint up
you hold me down
you might also likepostchorus justin timberlake  timbaland
you hold me down hold me—
say youll hold me down
hold me down
hold me down

verse 2 jack harlow
you know the squares hate the prom king
you know they prayin that i say the wrong thing
look at the disdain that these hit songs bring huh
i mean i couldve kept it niche
but id rather see my brothers get rich
hit the kill switch hit the slugger field first pitch
sevenfigure brand deals tend to feel worthless

prechorus jack harlow  justin timberlake
all these airplanes and these checked bags
all these rumors and these unchecked facts
old friends i forget to text back
maybe thisll show where my heads at my bad you know

chorus justin timberlake justin timberlake  jack harlow jack harlow
every sky cant be blue

just tell me one thing thats true when i aint up
