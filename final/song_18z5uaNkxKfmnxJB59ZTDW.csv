just another night at the cotton eyed joe
i was there three beers before the show
you walked in like a neon smoking gun
you know what they say a shooters gonna shoot
so i took a shot and walked up to you
you smiled when i said i dont know where youre from

chorus
but girl you look like tennessee trouble
the kind that im gonna fall for fast
you got me seein rocky top double
stealin my heart between sips of that
tullahoma whiskey fire in your eyes
girl you gonna get me in tennessee trouble tonight

verse 2
yeah we danced to a slow song kissеd to the next one
you said lеts take a shot boy you only live once
so thats the way we lived the rest of the night
yeah you and that ninety proof provin me right

chorus
cause girl you look like tennessee trouble
the kind that im gonna fall for fast
you got me seein rocky top double
stealin my heart between sips of that
tullahoma whiskey fire in your eyes
girl you gonna get me in tennessee trouble tonight
