and you were cryin loud right out in the schoolyard
and yeah i felt good
everything i knew was looking just as it should
i saw the tree
carved in it 666 and he found me
but i am no fool
i know every time i look in his eyes he sees me too
dry your eyes
i wont tell your mother
she wont ever discover
the things you kept under the covers
and please dont cry
i am not your brother
i am not your lover
and there is nothing wrongyou might also like11embed"
