you think its over now
you think well go away
but we keep climbing up
you cant keep us down

a temporary no
this shit is not for play
were not your typical
that aint what were here for

its time we light it up
our matchs to the grade
the tensions rising and
we aint looking down

watch how we take the throne
drop like a cannonball
we take the lead no
were never gonna follow

bridge

dont they know the speaker is about to explode
dont they know this building is about to blow
this building is about to

verse 2
3 years of digging holes
been burning through our clothes
yeah we keep on rising high
you cant touch us now

we give it every night
our hearts are dynamite
we spit that fire
so you better listen up

verse 3
