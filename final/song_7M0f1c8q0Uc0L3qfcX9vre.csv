rains coming down on the roof of my trailer house
with my luck id probably step outside and drown
how long will it take to get used to this doing without
guess ill just lay around in my pajamas
babys gone home to mama babys gone home to mama

chorus
babys gone home she left me alone
but she said shed phone me sometime
sad old song left me long gone outta my mind
well we did our best but we didnt have enough in common
sittin here lonesome babys gone home to mama

verse 2
glance through the paper lookin for somethin to read
even the funnies werent that funny to me
its written in the stars the future was plain to see yeah
mightve known shed leave if id read nostradamus
babys gone home to mama

chorus

outro
yall i miss her alot but at least she took the little chiwawa
sitting here lonesome babys gone home to mama
babys long gone babys gone home to mama
shes gone
aaah sitting here in my pajamas
