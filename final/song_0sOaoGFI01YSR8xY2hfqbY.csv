friends dont come easily and this i know
and every time i make one they always say they gotta go
i wanna talk with people and look em in the face
i wanna take em home and they can stay at my place
all the talking i could do i would never lie to you
we take a quick ride homicide then i confide in you
and i can love you and technically even though youre dead
youll always be around me cause im keeping your head
i keep heads on shelves everywhere in my cellar
i even own the melon of a dead fortune teller
the rotted ones i keep em up in fat pickle jars
and the new ones we lay on the lawn and look at the stars
its illegal i know but so is smoking weed
and who the fuck give a fuck when you have a need
i collect human heads fresh up off the neck
face lips hair nose ears gimme that

chorus violent j  shaggy 2 dope
faces people know more than names
the hair is there and all the brains
your head would mean so much to me
your head would mean so much to me
i wont dis you you wanna wear a hat what
how you want your eyelids open or shut
your head would mean so much to me
your head would mean so much to me

sometimes i put em in my bowling bag and bring em to work
play with their hair under my desk with my bare foot
theyre like stuffed animals all over the bed
human heads pam jennifer hubert and ted
i even put one in the shower water comes out the mouth
i kick a few around the yard when i feel like going out
i blow air in the mouth piece and duct tape it shut
bring em in the pool and the heads will float up
im not a sicko yo though ive had girlfriends
i even put their makeup on and take em for a spin
im aint a murderer like that not really
only every halloween the house do look kind of silly
you know the homeless people that be botherin you for change
almost all of my collection from them is where they came
im not insane about it its just the world is too crowded
and maybe ima do something a motherfuckin bout it

chorus violent j  shaggy 2 dope
faces people know more than names know more than names
the hair is there and all the brains and all the brains
your head would mean so much to me
your head would mean so much to me
i wont dis you you wanna wear a hat what
how you want your eyelids open or shut
your head would mean so much to me
your head would mean so much to me
verse 3 violent j
i need some therapy to help me deal with this shit
dr wigglefarmer i need to make a visit
he told me heads are normal but i gotta brush their teeth
so now im brushing four mouths at a time using my feet
he also told me to keep them from the dog
but i already knew that she chew their faces off
and then dr wigglefarmer asked me for a couple
i went into my bag and gave him two like no trouble
now i got some therapy im feeling much better
im happy forever me and my craniums together
they all over the house and they roll around the floor
and if its got an afro i use it for a pillow
im ill though i never shouldve worried anyway
i shoot head hoops and dont care what people say
you can ask dr wigglefarmer for yourself
hes the third head down top row third shelf

chorus violent j  shaggy 2 dope
faces people know more than names know more than names
the hair is there and all the brains and all the brains
your head would mean so much to me heads up yall
your head would mean so much to me
i wont dis you you wanna wear a hat what
how you want your eyelids open or shut
your head would mean so much to me i like rollin
your head would mean so much to me keep your heads up
faces people know more than names know more than names
the hair is there and all the brains and all the brains
your head would mean so much to me i like to kick em
your head would mean so much to me
i wont dis you you wanna wear a hat what
how you want your eyelids open or shut
your head would mean so much to me gimme head bitch
your head would mean so much to meembed"
