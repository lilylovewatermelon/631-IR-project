if i ever left this town
id never settle down
id just be wandering around
if i ever left this town
if i wasnt by your side
id never be satisfied
nothing would feel just right
if i wasnt by your side

cause im not easy to understand
but you know me like the back of your hand

verse 2
we can go on and on
wont ever feel too long
ill always call you home
and well go on and on

cause i know you like the back of my hand
