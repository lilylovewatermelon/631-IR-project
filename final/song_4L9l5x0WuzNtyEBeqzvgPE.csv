i remember way back late night throwback
sitting on the front lawn talking
when i lost it and oh i lost it
i remember you were saying you would come back run back
find me on the front porch like that
but you waited so i got wasted

prechorus 1
and ive always said
id never let myself hold on this long

chorus
cause people change overnight
things get strange but im alright
im still here and im still high
and ill still meet you in the middle of the night
but if you lie to me lie to me lie to me
im gone

verse 2
i still wonder if i called you what would i do
leave a toolong voicemail that i hate and then erase it
like i planned it
and i wonder if i still lived in the city would i see you at a party
take a big sip of my whiskey and then leave quickly
and pray you missed me
you might also likeprechorus 2
and though i still know exactly how this ends
i keep holding on

chorus
cause people change overnight
things get strange but im alright
im still here and im still high
and ill still meet you in the middle of the night
you know ill meet you in the middle of the night
but if you lie to me
im gone

bridge
oh i feel it in me please forgive me
leave this memory dont say you miss me
i know its still in me please forgive me
leave this memory dont say you miss me

chorus
cause people change overnight
things get strange but im alright
im still here and i must still be high
cause ill still meet you in the middle of the night
but if you lie to me lie to me
change overnight
things get strange but im alright im alright im holding on
im still here and i must still be high
but ill still meet you in the middle of the night
oh if you meet me in the middle of the night
