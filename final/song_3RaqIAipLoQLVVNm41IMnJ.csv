first floor ah
room sixteen ah
smells like danger lets go
even better lets go
set your goals ah
bless our souls ah
im in trouble yes i know
but it feels like heaven hey

verse 1
you were like one of those guys
the kind with the wandering eyes
but i said hey what the hell
once in my life ill take a ride on the wild side
you were so full of yourself
but damn were you cute as well
you liked my legs i liked your moves
anyone could tell not hard to deny that

chorus

but it felt so right i cant believe it
and all the mistakes that went on for too long
wish there was a way i could delete them
eh eh eh eh ah ah ah ah
eh eh eh eh ah ah ah

second night ah
in a row ah
back in trouble lets go
i dont get it lets go
gotta keep it down ah
cause the lobby called ah
but we ignore them yes i know
getting better hey

verse 2
when it comes to men its known
that i end up choosing wrong
cause i always trip and fall
on the same old rock and repeat and go back
how blind a girl can be
to miss you hide your ring
lied about everything
im so naïve and i should have known that

chorus
did it again now i got it all wrong
but it felt so right i cant believe it
and all the mistakes that went on for too long
wish there was a way i could delete them
eh eh eh eh ah ah ah ah
eh eh eh eh ah ah ah

right back at ya cause ill survive
it may seem to you that i am in a place

and all the mistakes that went on for too long
