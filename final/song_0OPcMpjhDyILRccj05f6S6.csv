if its cleaned up shined up pedal down on main
you can bet hes pickin up some pretty country thang
if its covered up in red mud with a wornout warn winch
theres a good chance that that man is a pretty damn good friend

prechorus
if theres horns in the back
theres a gun in the front
if theres dents on the side
he aint scared of nothin
and if the 12packs in the passenger seat
well he probably worked his ass off all week

chorus
yeah somewhere way out there in any given town
theres a red white and blue collar drivin his around
turnin heads and burnin tread and stirrin up dust clouds
like a shine haulin outlaw
yeah im talkin bout his truck
his dash
the county on his tag
the songs on his radio
the stickers on his glass
from four bars to two bars
its true you cant judge
a book by its cover
but you can judge a country boy by his truck

if theres a silver cross hangin off his dusty old rearview
its safe to say hes found amazing grace a time or two
if theres numbers on the back 92 to 2012
bet this storys about his best friend that he can barely tell
cause he misses him like hell

chorus
somewhere way out there in any given town
theres a red white and blue collar drivin his around
turnin heads and burnin tread and stirrin up dust clouds
like a shine haulin outlaw
yeah im talkin bout his truck
his dash
the county on his tag
the songs on his radio
the stickers on his glass
from four bars to two bars
its true you cant judge
a book by its cover
but you can judge a country boy by his truck

bridge
if theres horns in the back
theres a gun in the front
if theres dents on the side
he aint scared of nothin
and if the 12packs in the passenger seat
yeah well he probably worked his ass off all week
chorus
yeah somewhere way out there in any given town
theres a red white and blue collar drivin his around
turnin heads and burnin tread and stirrin up dust clouds
like a shine haulin outlaw
yeah im talkin bout his truck
his dash
the county on his tag
the songs on his radio
the stickers on his glass
from four bars to two bars
its true you cant judge
a book by its cover
but you can judge a country boy by his truck

outro
if theres horns in the back
theres a gun in the front
if theres dents on the side
yeah you can judge a country boy by his truck
if theres horns in the back
theres a gun in the front
you cant judge a book by its cover
but you can judge a country boy by his truckembed"
