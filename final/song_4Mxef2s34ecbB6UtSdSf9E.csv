verse 1
think i saw her for the first time maybe in a newsstand
she was nickin a mag and dressed oblique
she called me baby and was it me maybe with the song on the radio
so i told her i was rich then she asked could i use a dirty bitch of course

chorus 1
then she said no one loves me neither do i
you get what you give and i give goodbye
and if i should vanish dont get caught off guard
dont hold it against me unless it gets hard

interlude
uh oi uh
oh yeah
oh thats right

verse 2
well if sex is a weapon then smash boom pow how ya like me now
you cant always do it right you can always do whats left
so i told her i was trash she winked and laughed and said i already know
ive got a beautiful place to put your face and she was right

and i said no one loves me neither do i
it makes perfect sense so i never ask why
all gone tomorrow cause life doesnt wait
you could keep your soul i dont want a cell mate

bridge
call me im loose im ready to go
people in the world wanna lose control
call me im loose im ready to go
people in the world wanna lose control
call me im loose im ready to go
people in the world wanna lose control
call me im loose im ready to go
people in the world wanna lose uh

outro
i know how to burn with passion
hold nothing back for future ration
give all you are do not make haste
savor every single taste
you get got
i know how to be controlled
do opposites of what youre told
quick to react to break the box
turn on cue as your cell door locks
behind you
i know how to be lost in lust
not because you should but because you must
it burns white hot and so clouds the mind
this lightning strike isnt always kind
so use me up
use me up5embed"
