it was the middle of class and the teacher wasnt lookin
kelly  had a fat ass and trouble was cookin
she  had a boy wrapped around her finger tight
i fell in love with him but he wasnt in my life
the teacher gave me notes to go out and give kelly
she  was kissin brendon i got jelly
i  wanted to be in her shoes for one day
i just waited til recess to make her pay make her pay

should i give him away or feel this bad

her face was fucked up and my hands were bloody
we were in the playground things were getting muddy
the teacher broke us up after i broke her
and my one true love called me a monster
