take back the books and pack up the clothes
clear out the room and drop off the key
leave with whats left of my dignity
get in the car and just go
chalk it all up to experience
they said id fail but i disagreed
who could say then where my path would lead
well now i know

back to the sun
back to the shore
back to what i was before
back where im known
back in my own very small pond
laugh with my friends when i arrive
well drop the top and just drive
thats fine with me
just let me be legally blonde

thanks for your help and for all youve done
thank you for treating me decently

emmett

what about love
i never mentioned love
the timings bad i know
but perhaps if id made it more clear
that you belong right here
you wouldnt have to go
cause youd know that im so much in love

elle
back to the sun
back to the shore
back to what i was before

emmett
please will you open the door

elle
lie on the beach
dream within reach
dont stray beyond
emmett
we both know youre worth so much more

elle
some girls fight hard
some face the trial
some girls were just meant to smile

emmett
if you can hear
can i just say how much i want you to stay

elle
its not up to me
just let me be
legally blonde

emmett
i need you to stay

elle
its not up to me
just let me be
