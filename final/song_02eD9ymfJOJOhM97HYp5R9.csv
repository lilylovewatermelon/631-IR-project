i know they say you can’t go home again
i just had to come back one last time
maam i know you dont know me from adam
but these hand prints on the front steps are mine
up those stairs in that little back bedroom
is where i did my homework and i learned to play guitar
and i bet you didnt know under that live oak
my favorite dog is buried in the yard

chorus
i thought if i could touch this place or feel it
this brokenness inside me might start healing
out here it’s like im someone else
i thought that maybe i could find myself
if i could just come in i swear ill leave
wont take nothing but a memory
from the house that built me

verse 2
mama cut out pictures of houses for years
from better homes and garden magazine
plans were drawn and concrete poured
nail by nail and board by board
daddy gave life to mamas dream
see miranda lambert liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likechorus
i thought if i could touch this place or feel it
this brokenness inside me might start healing
out here it’s like im someone else
i thought that maybe i could find myself
if i could just come in i swear ill leave
wont take nothing but a memory
from the house that built me

bridge
you leave home you move on and you do the best you can
i got lost in this whole world and forgot who i am

chorus
i thought if i could touch this place or feel it
this brokenness inside me might start healing
out here it’s like im someone else
i thought that maybe i could find myself
if i could walk around i swear ill leave
wont take nothing but a memory
from the house that built me6embed"
