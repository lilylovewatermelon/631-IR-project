hello tell me you know
yeah you figured me out
something gave it away
it would be such a beautiful moment
to see the look on your face
to know that i know that you know now

verse 2
and baby thats a case of my wishful thinking
you know nothing
well you and i
why we go carrying on for hours on end
we get along much better
than you and your boyfriend

chorus
well all i really wanna do is love you
a kind much closer than friends use
but i still cant say it after all weve been through
and all i really want from you is to feel me
as the feeling inside keeps building
and i will find a way to you if it kills me
if it kills me

verse 3
how long can i go on like this
wishing to kiss you
before i rightly explode
this double life i lead isnt healthy for me
in fact it makes me nervous
if i get caught i could be risking it all
cause maybe theres a lot that i miss
in case im wrong

well all i really wanna do is love you
a kind much closer than friends use
but i still cant say it after all weve been through
and all i really want from you is to feel me
as the feeling inside keeps building
and i will find a way to you if it kills me
if it kills me

verse 4
if i should be so bold
id ask you to hold my heart in your hand
id tell you from the start how ive longed to be your man
but i never said a word
i guess im gonna miss my chance again

chorus
all i really wanna do is love you
a kind much closer than friends use
but i still cant say it after all weve been through
and all i really want from you is to feel me
as the feeling inside keeps building
and i will find a way to you if it kills me
if it kills me
if it kills me
i think it might kill me
outro
and all i really want from you is to feel me
yeah the feeling inside keeps building
ill find a way to you if it kills me
if it kills me
it might kill me3embed"
