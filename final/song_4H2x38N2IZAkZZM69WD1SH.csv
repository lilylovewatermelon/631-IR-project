house full of roses
a letter on the stairs
a tape full of messages
for anyone who cares
collage of broken words
and stories full of tears
remembering your life
cause we wish that you were here

verse 2
nothing is harder
than to wake up all alone
realize its not okay
its the end of all youve known
time keeps passing by
but it seems im frozen still
scars are left behind
but some too deep to feel

chorus
and some say this cant be real
and ive lost my power to feel tonight
were all just victims of a crime
when all is gone and cant be regained
we cant seem to shelter the pain inside
were all just victims of a crime
see avenged sevenfold liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likeverse 3
some days youll find me
in a place i like to go
ask questions to myself
bout the things ill never know
whats left to find
cause i need a little more
i need a little time
can we even up the score

chorus
and some say this cant be real
and ive lost my power to feel tonight
were all just victims of a crime
when all is gone and cant be regained
we cant seem to shelter the pain inside
were all just victims of a crime
yeah whoa yeah

bridge
and nothing lasts forever
for all good things its true
id rather trade it all
while somehow saving you
it must have been the season
that threw us out of line
once i stood so tall
now im searching for a sign
so dont need your salvation
with promises unkind
and all the speculation
save it for another time
cause we all need a reason
a reason just to stay
well some just cant be bothered
to stick around another day

chorus
and some say this cant be real
and ive lost my power to feel tonight
weve all been victims of a crime
when all is gone and cant be regained
we cant seem to shelter the pain inside
weve all been victims of a crime

postchorus
