you’ve got to trust your instinct and let go of regret
you’ve got to bet on yourself now star
‘cause that’s your best bet

verse 1
watch me now with a wicked and wild and i said
we come with the funky style
that gets us known for the show
and we’ll mix the hip hop reggae if we say it is so
and fuck the naysayers cause they don’t mean a thing
‘cause this is what style we bring

prechorus
now it’s morning but last night’s on my mind
there’s something i need to get off my chest
and no matter what may come to shine
the dream will always be mine

chorus
all mixed up you don’t know what to do
next thing you turn around and find the person is you
thought a freak might be the thing but the first could be the last
so just get off your ass
all mixed up you don’t know what to do
next thing you turn around and find the person is you
thought a freak might be the thing but you know this will pass
so just get off your ass

you’ve got to trust your instinct and let go of regret
you’ve got to bet on yourself now star
‘cause that’s your best bet

verse 2
watch me now with a wicked and wild and i said
sick sick bit got to have it
like bustin’ in on a session but you got to call it quits
sick sick bit just can’t quit
the fact that you don’t even know makes it fully legit

prechorus
now it’s morning but last night’s on my mind
there’s something i need to get off my chest
and no matter what will come to shine
the dream will always be mine

bridge 2
you make me nervous throat dry
my brain is empty don’t know why
but i saw you doing something which is really truly nothing
but you could bust me out all day

bridge 3
many moons since first i saw you
many moons since first we did the do
many moons since first i saw you

outro
and why did i try when i knew it was no and

but save it for late we should just let it skate
cause the waiting feel is fine7embed"
