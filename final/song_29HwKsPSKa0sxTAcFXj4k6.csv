i felt the first real sting
right about the time that you let it ring
left me high and dry
now i can see youre letting go

prechorus
i try to walk these streets
hoping that my feet wouldnt fail me
waiting for a sign
but i can see youre letting go

chorus
hold on cause i dont think that i can save us baby
but hold on cause i dont feel like letting go oh oh oh
we got so high we cant calm down
so hold on cause i dont feel like letting go

verse 2
we had a real good thing
right about the time that you fell for me
used to hold me tight
but i can see youre letting go

prechorus
i try to walk these streets
hoping that my feet wouldnt fail me
waiting for a sign
but i can see youre letting go
