its growing like a tangled vine and rising like a river in the tide
and everybody knew when you walked into the room
i was just a fool for you nothing i could do
everybody sees you taking control of me
well im not begging for release
im just begging darling please please

act naturally act naturally
dont let our troubles show
dont let anybody know act naturally
till we get it figured out
dont give them anything that they can doubt

our little problem doesnt seem to be about to go away
as far as i can tell its gonna keep on showing more with every day
and everybody look yeah that was all it took
i cant help believing they can read me like a book
so hide your feelings tight til we figure how to make it right
i dont know what i should but i would do it if i could

act naturally act naturally
just be you beautiful
just be you casual act naturally
ill be me before the fall
you be you before this all came down act naturally
dont let our troubles show
dont let anybody know act naturally
til we get it figured out
dont give them anything that they can doubt

just be you casual
ill be me before the fall
you be you before this all came downembed"
