if you see a flaming sword in your dreams at night
and feel inspired to assign me up to the front line
well give the order youll storm the border without me
if they tell you youre a genius but you need some proof
ask anybody on the payroll to go out with you
if they avoid ya then theyll award ya definitely

verse 2
nobody thats around you seems to get it right
how hard is it to follow just a few guidelines
and smile while you do it
if you want a page written bout you in the book
but you need a food tester cause you cursed the cook
ill take some wine but you can dine without me

verse 3
without me who would let you play god
and make believe that all the blasphemy
was coming only from me oh
if youre bound for the throne but the king wont die
i can occupy the queen but thats for her and i
i can do her and youll be ruler without me

outro
yeah you can do it
but you can do it without meyou might also like2embed"
