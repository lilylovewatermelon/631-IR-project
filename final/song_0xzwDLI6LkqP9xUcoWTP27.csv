walked into our world and made
horrible sounds
i can still hear them today
strangely they seem
beautiful now
though they outlast my love

prechorus
still each time i always meant
every word every one
though in time they finally bent
every word every one every word

chorus
i will wait for you she said
endlessly
i will wait for you so spoke
misery

verse 2
i returned to you but found
my empty home
the radio told me to stay
as it burned down
i sang alone
you will outlast my love
you might also likeprechorus
still each time i always meant
every word every one
though in time they finally bent
every word every one every word

chorus
i will wait for you she said
endlessly
i will wait for you so spoke
misery

bridge
i have been waiting for you
biding as you taught me to
i have come to relieve you
of life and love

bridge 2
i will wait for you
i will wait for you
i will wait for you
i will wait
i will wait

chorus
i will wait for you she said
i will wait
endlessly
i will wait for you so spoke
i will wait
misery
i will wait for you
wait for you
endlessly
i will wait for you so spoke
so spoke
misery
outro
i will bite straight through
as i wait for you
dear
