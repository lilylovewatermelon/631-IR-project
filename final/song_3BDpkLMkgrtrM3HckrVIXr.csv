rap diablo
yeah yeah

verse 1
its the rap diablo macho when i drop flows
the bar gets raised up its me and petey pablo
colder than gazpacho colder than the mono
rappin head honcho rockin shows like i was bono
i go play a couple keys on the piano
the industry a lie all the promises were hollow
follow me i could show you where we bes at
howd i get my gpass none of your fuckin beeswax
these raps bring a joint together like a kneecap
fuck the little 8 balls show me where the kis at
the time continuum mortal kombat finish em
tryna find a balance reachin from my equilibrium
fools i pity em im not a human im amphibian
fake superhero like the mystery men i aint savin nothin
im gettin faded til the angels comin skippin all the famous functions
how do the famous function the alist cant be trusted
i strongarm em like i play the trumpet
the bottom barrel of society
i tell my bitch if she dont love me then just lie to me
im finer than the winery
take it from the rich this is piracy piracy
finally i dont even need my fuckin eyes to see
come and die with me

verse 2
yeah um
okay my mind is yoda im on ayatollah
these other rappers just a diet soda
i find jehovah in the darkest places empty as apartment basements
this a marathon gentlemen go head and start the races
save the coffin spaces
youll come up missin tell your bitch that you been trippin now you on vacation
rappin like its automated lights i keep em on like vegas
lava makin so hot im turnin hog to bacon
only god can save him i heard the monsters made him
i aint a star im way farther with the constellations
contemplatin suicide like its a dvd
lost inside my mind its a prison homie leave me be
you can see me bleed i be with the freaks and geeks
bitch i never miss a beat im charlie conway triple deke
gordon bombay in these streets ballin like im pistol pete
been a beast every word i spit rewritin history
look at what you did to me look at what you did to me
run into the underworld with guns and set the sinners free
no bitches in my circle im the show you the commercial
i been poppin like a kernel readin justin biebers journal
treat you like a urinal
