rollin down the road in the heart of texas
drivin band playin country western
drivin all night trying to make the next gig
sure aint gettin any rested
with the highway below and the lord above me
on the telephone sayin dont cry honey
tryin to make enough to keep the motor runnin
sure i aint in it for the money

chorus
this aint check cashin country
aint check cashin country

verse 2
nights are gettin long and the miles are showin
life of a country rock and roll band
lookin out for the highway patrolman
love to stick around we got to go man
wake up to the sound of the tires on the highway
pull into a truck stop poured me a coffee
lord knows the miles that have gone behind me
sure i aint in it for the money

chorus
this aint check cashin country
aint check cashin country nawha
see midland liveget tickets as low as 58you might also likebridge
i hear that tip jars got a jingle
cause we aint got a single on the radio
we make em go dance wherever we go
tryin to turn a nickel to solid country gold

it goes t for texas and tennessee
we got miles to cover and places to be
the highways the only kind of life for me
sure i aint in it for the money

chorus
this aint check cashin country
aint check cashin country nawha
no it aint

bridge
i hear that tip jars got a jingle
cause we aint got a single on the radio
we make em dance wherever we go
tryin to turn a nickel to solid country gold

it goes t for texas and tennessee
we got miles to cover and places to be
if yall dont twostep then we dont eat
sure i aint out here for the money
chorus
