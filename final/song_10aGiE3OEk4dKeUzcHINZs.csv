just let me know
if nowadays the outer rounds of heaven dont
keep up on the charm offensive anymore
failing to remind you what youre living for
id give anything to borrow your indifference
id drink you in
to temper your belief in all my promises
to swallow my desire and choke on it

chorus
cause it still makes my blood run cold
to remember what they did before
the stories that you never told to me

verse 2
oh bird worry not
the blessings rain on battles in the heavens arms
and my polite advances wont last for long
the eager apprehension is wearing off
id give anything
to balance your conviction with certainty
to fall asleep without you lying next to me
to sever my connection with everything

chorus
cause it still makes my blood run cold
to remember what i did before
the stories that you never told to me
and it still makes my blood run thin
to remember what you are to him
and i live like ive got missing limbs
