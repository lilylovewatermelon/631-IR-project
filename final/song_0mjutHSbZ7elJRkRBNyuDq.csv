why dave died as a child
baby joe got shot front his child
wonder why a flag a part our style
wanna get out but wonder why that i cant stop

i dont wanna leave
i say father im sorry all my pain got me heartless
i just wanna find some peace
but im like mr grim reaper mr grim reaper
i do not mean to disturb your time your time
i just wan ask you can you leave my family out family
you got it hard and most of all my niggas laying up in a graveyard

verse 1
i killed that boy i aint do that shit for you
me and 10 clutchin hard while we ridin in that coupe
i been in and out the system but every time makе it through
gd gang got a difference wе a family not a crew not a squad
since i came out the front yard my life it been so hard
