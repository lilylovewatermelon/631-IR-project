outro
dear lord almighty i know when its our time to go its our time to go
but when you come to carry us home do we not be entertainers anymore
do we just rest in peace or do we go back to see our familys pain
do we not remember hell on earthll come back as a new person again
i ask these questions will aaliyah lisa tupac big pun be our newest generation
because if so like a michael jackson release the whole world is anticipatin
to see these fallen soldiers come back and get the crown they deserve
for givin us great music and great music that will always be heard
we love youembed"
