be ruled by me and have a care othe crowd
this way while fresh folk go and get their gaze
ill tell you like a book and save your shins
fie what a roaring day weve had whose fault
lorenzo in lucinaheres a church
to hold a crowd at need accommodate
all comers from the corso if this crush
make not its priests ashamed of what they show
for templeroom dont prick them to draw purse
and down with bricks and mortar eke us out
the beggarly transept with its bit of apse
into a decent spacе for christian ease
why todays lucky pearl is cast to swinе
listen and estimate the luck theyve had
the right man and i hold him

sir do you see
they laid both bodies in the church this morn
the first thing on the chancel two steps up
behind the little marble balustrade
disposed them pietro the old murdered fool
to the right of the altar and his wretched wife
on the other side in trying to count stabs
people supposed violante showed the most
till somebody explained us that mistake
his wounds had been dealt out indifferent where
but she took all her stabbings in the face
since punished thus solely for honours sake
honoris causâ thats the proper term
a delicacy there is our gallants hold
when you avenge your honour and only then
that you disfigure the subject fray the face
not just take life and end in clownish guise
it was violante gave the first offence
got therefore the conspicuous punishment
while pietro who helped merely his mere death
answered the purpose so his face went free
we fancied even free as you please that face
showed itself still intolerably wronged
was wrinkled over with resentment yet
nor calm at all as murdered faces use
once the worst ended an indignant air
o the head there was tis said the body turned
round and away rolled from violantes side
where they had laid it lovinghusbandlike
if so if corpses can be sensitive
why did not he roll right down altarstep
roll on through nave roll fairly out of church
deprive lorenzo of the spectacle
pay back thus the succession of affronts
whereto this church had served as theatre
for see at that same altar where he lies
to that same inch of step was brought the babe
for blessing after baptism and there styled
pompilia and a string of names beside
by his bad wife some seventeen years ago
who purchased her simply to palm on him
flatter his dotage and defraud the heirs
wait awhile also to this very step
did this violante twelve years afterward
bring the mockmother that childcheat fullgrown
pompilia in pursuance of her plot
and there brave god and man a second time
by linking a new victim to the lie
there having made a match unknown to him
she still unknown to pietro tied the knot
which nothing cuts except this kind of knife
yes made her daughter as the girl was held
marry a man and honest man beside
and man of birth to bootclandestinely
because of this because of that because
o the devils will to work his worst for once
confident she could top her part at need
and when her husband must be told in turn
ply the wifes trade play off the sexs trick
and alternating worry with quiet qualms
bravado with submissiveness quick fool
her pietro into patience so it proved
ay tis four years since man and wife they grew
this guido franceschini and this same
pompilia foolishly thought falsely declared
a comparini and the couples child
just at this altar where beneath the piece
of master guido reni christ on cross
second to nought observable in rome
that couple lie now murdered yestereve
even the blind can see a providence here
from dawn till now that it is growing dusk
a multitude has flocked and filled the church
coming and going coming back again
till to count crazed one rome was at the show
people climbed up the columns fought for spikes
o the chapelrail to perch themselves upon
jumped over and so broke the wooden work
painted like porphyry to deceive the eye
serve the priests right the organloft was crammed
women were fainting no few fights ensued
in short it was a show repaid your pains
for though their room was scant undoubtedly
yet they did manage matters to be just
a little at this lorenzo body ome
i saw a body exposed oncenever mind
enough that here the bodies had their due
no stinginess in wax a row all round
and one big taper at each head and foot

so people pushed their way and took their turn
saw threw their eyes up crossed themselves gave place
to pressure from behind since all the world
knew the old pair could talk the tragedy
over from first to last pompilia too
those who had known herwhat twas worth to them
guidos acquaintance was in less request
the count had lounged somewhat too long in rome
made himself cheap with him were hand and glove
barbers and bleareyed as the ancient sings
also he is alive and like to be
had he considerately diedaha
i jostled luca cini on his staff
mute in the midst the whole man one amaze
staring amain and crossing brow and breast
how now asked i tis seventy years quoth he
since i first saw holding my fathers hand
bodies set forth a many have i seen
yet all was poor to this i live and see
here the worlds wickedness seals up the sum
what with molinos doctrine and this deed
antichrists surely come and doomsday near
may i depart in peace i have seen my see
depart then i advised nor block the road
for youngsters still behindhand with such sights
why no rejoins the venerable sire
i know its horrid hideous past belief
burdensome far beyond what eye can bear
but they do promise when pompilia dies
i the course o the dayand she cant outlive night
theyll bring her body also to expose
beside the parents one two three abreast
that were indeed a sight which might i see
i trust i should not last to see the like
whereat i bade the senior spare his shanks
since doctors give her till tonight to live
and tell us how the butchery happened ah
but you cant know sighs he ill not despair
beside im useful at explaining things
as how the dagger laid there at the feet
caused the peculiar cuts i mind its make
triangular i the blade a genoese
armed with those little hookteeth on the edge
to open in the flesh nor shut again
i like to teach a novice i shall stay
and stay he did and stay be sure he will
a personage came by the private door
at noon to have his look i name no names
well then his eminence the cardinal
whose servitor in honourable sort
guido was once the same who made the match
will you have the truth whereof we see effect
no sooner whisper ran he was arrived
than up pops curate carlo a brisk lad
who never lets a good occasion slip
and volunteers improving the event
we looked hed give the historys self some help
treat us to how the wifes confession went
this morning she confessed her crime we know
and maybe throw in something of the priest
if hes not ordered back punished anew
the gallant caponsacchi lucifer
i the garden where pompilia evelike lured
her adam guido to his fault and fall
think you we got a sprig of speech akin
to this from carlo with the cardinal there
too wary he was too widely awake i trow
he did the murder in a dozen words
then said that all such outrages crop forth
i the course of nature when molinos tares
are sown for wheat flourish and choke the church
so slid on to the abominable sect
and the philosophic sinweve heard all that
and the cardinal too who bookmade on the same
but for the murder left it where he found
oh but hes quick the curate minds his game
and after all we have the main o the fact
case could not well be simplermapped as it were
we follow the murders maze from source to sea
by the red line past mistake one sees indeed
not only how all was and must have been
but cannot other than be to the end of time
turn out here by the ruspoli do you hold
guido was so prodigiously to blame
a certain cousin of yours has told you so
exactly heres a friend shall set you right
let him but have the handsel of your ear
these wretched comparini were once gay
and galiard of the modest middle class
born in this quarter seventy years ago
and married young they lived the accustomed life
citizens as they were of good repute
and childless naturally took their ease
with only their two selves to care about
and use the wealth for wealthy is the word
since pietro was possessed of house and land
and specially one house when good days were
in via vittoria the aspectable street
where he lived mainly but another house
of less pretension did he buy betimes
the villa meant for jaunts and jollity
i the pauline district to be private there
just what puts murder in an enemys head
moreoverand heres the worm i the core the germ
o the rottenness and ruin which arrived
he owned some usufruct had moneys use
lifelong but to determine with his life
in heirs default so pietro craved an heir
the story always old and always new
shut his foolseyes fast on the visible good
and wealth for certain opened them owlwide
on fortunes sole piece of forgetfulness
the child that should have been and would not be

hence seventeen years ago conceive his glee
when first violante twixt a smile and a blush
with touch of agitation proper too
announced that spite of her unpromising age
the miracle would in time be manifest
an heirs birth was to happen and it did
somehow or otherhow all in good time
by a trick a sleight of hand you are to hear
a child was born pompilia for his joy
plaything at once and prop a fairygift
a saints grace or say grant of the good god
a fiddlepins end what imbeciles are we
look now if some one could have prophesied
for love of you for liking to your wife
i undertake to crush a snake i spy
settling itself i the soft of both your breasts
give me yon babe to strangle painlessly
shell soar to the safe youll have your crying out
then sleep then wake then sleep then end your days
in peace and plenty mixed with mild regret
thirty years hence when christmas takes old folk
how had old pietro sprung up crossed himself
and kicked the conjuror whereas you and i
being wise with afterwit had clapped our hands
nay added in the old fools interest
strangle the blackeyed babe so far so good
but on condition you relieve the man
o the wife and throttle him violante too
she is the mischief

we had hit the mark
she whose trick brought the babe into the world
she it was when the babe was grown a girl
judged a new trick should reinforce the old
send vigour to the lie now somewhat spent
by twelve years service lest eves rule decline
over this adam of hers whose cabbageplot
throve dubiously since turned foolsparadise
spite of a nightingale on every stump
pietros estate was dwindling day by day
while he rapt far above such mundane care
crawled allfours with his baby pickaback
sat at serene catscradle with his child
or took the measured tallness top to toe
of what was grown a great girl twelve years old
till sudden at the door a tap discreet
a visitors premonitory cough
and poverty had reached him in her rounds

this came when he was past the workingtime
had learned to dandle and forgot to dig
and who must but violante cast about
contrive and task that head of hers again
she who had caught one fish could make that catch
a bigger still in anglers policy
so with an anglers mercy for the bait
her minnow was set wriggling on its barb
and tossed to the midstream that is this grown girl
with the great eyes and bounty of black hair
and first crisp youth that tempts a jaded taste
was whisked i the way of a certain man who snapped

count guido franceschini the aretine
was head of an old noble house enough
not overrich you cant have everything
but such a man as riches rub against
readily stick toone with a right to them
born in the blood twas in his very brow
always to knit itself against the world
so be beforehand when that stinted due
service and suit the world ducks and defers
as such folks do he had come up to rome
to better his fortune and since many years
was friend and follower of a cardinal
waiting the rather thus on providence
that a shrewd younger poorer brother yet
the abate paolo a regular priest
had long since tried his powers and found he swam
with the deftest on the galilean pool
but then he was a webfoot free o the wave
and no ambiguous dabchick hatched to strut
humbled by any fond attempt to swim
when fiercer fowl usurped his dunghill top
a whole priest paolo no mere piece of one
like guido tacked thus to the churchs tail
guido moreover as the head o the house
claiming the main prize not the lesser luck
the centre lily no mere chickweed fringe

he waited and learned waiting thirty years
got promise missed performancewhat would you have
no petty post rewards a nobleman
for spending youth in splendid lackeywork
and theres concurrence for each rarer prize
when that falls rougher hand and readier foot
push aside guido spite of his black looks
the end was guido when the warning showed
the first white hair i the glass gave up the game
determined on returning to his town
making the best of bad incurable
patching the old palace up and lingering there
the customary life out with his kin
where honour helps to spice the scanty bread

just as he trimmed his lamp and girt his loins
to go his journey and be wise at home
in the right mood of disappointed worth
who but violante sudden spied her prey
where was i with that anglersimile
and threw her bait pompilia where he sulked
a gleam i the gloom

what if he gained thus much
wrung out this sweet drop from the bitter past
bore off this rosebud from the prickly brake
to justify such torn clothes and scratched hands
and after all brought something back from rome
would not a wife serve at arezzo well
to light the dark house lend a look of youth
to the mothers face grown meagre left alone
and famished with the emptiness of hope
old donna beatrice wife you want
would you play family representative
carry you elderbrotherly high and right
oer what may prove the natural petulance
of the third brother younger greedier still
girolamo also a fledgeling priest
beginning life in turn with callow beak
agape for luck no luck had stopped and stilled
such were the pinks and greys about the bait
persuaded guido gulp down hook and all

what constituted him so choice a catch
you question past his prime and poor beside
ask that of any she who knows the trade
why first here was a nobleman with friends
a palace one might run to and be safe
when presently the threatened fate should fall
a bigbrowed master to block doorway up
parley with people bent on pushing by
and praying the mild pietro quick clear scores
is birth a privilege and power or no
alsobut judge of the result desired
by the price paid and manner of the sale
the count was made woo win and wed at once
asked and was haled for answer lest the heat
should cool to san lorenzo one blind eve
and had pompilia put into his arms
o the sly there by a hasty candleblink
with sanction of some priestconfederate
properly paid to make short work and sure

so did old pietros daughter change her style
for guido franceschinis ladywife
ere guido knew it well and why this haste
and scramble and indecent secrecy
lest pietro all the while in ignorance
should get to learn gainsay and break the match
his peevishness had promptly put aside
such honour and refused the proffered boon
pleased to become authoritative once
she remedied the wilful mans mistake
did our discreet violante rather say
thus did she lest the object of her game
guido the gulled one give him but a chance
a moments respite time for thinking twice
might count the cost before he sold himself
and try the clink of coin they paid him with

but passed the bargain struck the business done
once the clandestine marriage over thus
all parties made perforce the best o the fact
pietro could play vast indignation off
be ignorant and astounded dupe alike
at need of wife daughter and soninlaw
while guido found himself in flagrant fault
must een do suit and service soothe subdue
a father not unreasonably chafed
bring him to terms by paying sons devoir
pleasant initiation

the end this
guidos broad back was saddled to bear all
pietro violante and pompilia too
three lots cast confidently in one lap
three deadweights with one arm to lift the three
out of their limbo up to life again
the roman household was to strike fresh root
in a new soil graced with a novel name
gilt with an alien glory aretine
henceforth and never roman any more
by treaty and engagement thus it ran
pompilias dowry for pompilias self
as a thing of courseshe paid her own expense
no loss nor gain there but the couple you see
they for their part turned over first of all
their fortune in its rags and rottenness
to guido fusion and confusion he
and his with them and theirswhatever rag
with a coin residuary fell on floor
when brother paolos energetic shake
should do the relics justice since twas thought
once vulnerable pietro out of reach
that left at rome as representative
the abate backed by a potent patron here
and otherwise with purple flushing him
might play a good game with the creditor
make up a moiety which great or small
should go to the common stockif anything
guidos so far repayment of the cost
about to beand if as looked more like
nothingwhy all the nobler cost were his
who guaranteed for better or for worse
to pietro and violante house and home
kith and kin with the pick of company
and life o the fat o the land while life should last
how say you to the bargain at first blush
why did a middleaged notsilly man
show himself thus besotted all at once
quoth solomon one black eye does it all

they went to arezzopietro and his spouse
with just the dusk o the day of life to spend
eager to use the twilight taste a treat
enjoy for once with neither stay nor stint
the luxury of lordandladyship
and realise the stuff and nonsense long
asimmer in their noddles vent the fume
born there and bred the citizens conceit
how fares nobility while crossing earth
what rampart or invisible bodyguard
keeps off the taint of common life from such
they had not fed for nothing on the tales
of grandees who give banquets worthy jove
spending gold as if plutus paid a whim
served with obeisances as whenwhat god
im at the end of my tether tis enough
you understand what they came primed to see
while guido who should minister the sight
stay all this qualmish greediness of soul
with apples and with flagonsfor his part
was set on life diverse as pole from pole
lust of the flesh lust of the eyewhat else
was he just now awake from sick and sage
after the very debauch they would begin
suppose such stuff and nonsense really were
that bubble they were bent on blowing big
he had blown already till he burst his cheeks
and hence found soapsuds bitter to the tongue
he hoped now to walk softly all his days
in soberness of spirit if haply so
pinching and paring he might furnish forth
a frugal board bare sustenance no more
till times that could not well grow worse should mend

thus minded then two parties mean to meet
and make each other happy the first week
and fancy strikes fact and explodes in full
this shrieked the comparini this the count
the palace the signorial privilege
the pomp and pageantry were promised us
for this have we exchanged our liberty
our competence our darling of a child
to house as spectres in a sepulchre
under this black stone heap the streets disgrace
grimmest as that is of the gruesome town
and here pick garbage on a pewter plate
or cough at verjuice dripped from earthenware
oh via vittoria oh the other place
i the pauline did we give you up for this
wheres the foregone housekeeping good and gay
the neighbourliness the companionship
the treat and feast when holidays came round
the daily feast that seemed no treat at all
called common by the uncommon fools we were
even the sun that used to shine at rome
where is it robbed and starved and frozen too
we will have justice justice if there be
did not they shout did not the town resound
guidos old ladymother beatrice
who since her husband count tommasos death
had held sole sway i the housethe doited crone
slow to acknowledge curtsey and abdicate
was recognised of true novercal type
dragon and devil his brother girolamo
came next in order priest was he the worse
no way of winning him to leave his mumps
and help the laugh against old ancestry
and formal habits long since out of date
letting his youth be patterned on the mode
approved of where violante laid down law
or did he brighten up by way of change
dispose himself for affability
the malapert too complaisant by half
to the alarmed young novice of a bride
let him go buzz betake himself elsewhere
nor singe his flywings in the candleflame

four months probation of this purgatory
dogsnap and catclaw curse and counterblast
the devils self had been sick of his own din
and pietro after trumpeting huge wrongs
at church and marketplace pillar and post
squares corner streets end now the palacestep
and now the winehouse benchwhile on her side
violante up and down was voluble
in whatsoever pair of ears would perk
from goody gossip catercousin and sib
curious to peep at the inside of things
and catch in the act pretentious poverty
at its wits end to keep appearance up
make both ends meetnothing the vulgar loves
like what this couple pitched them right and left
then their worst done that way they struck tent marched
renounced their share o the bargain flung what dues
guido was bound to pay in guidos face
left their heartsdarling treasure of the twain
and so forth the poor inexperienced bride
to her own devices bade arezzo rot
and the life signorial and sought rome once more

i see the comment ready on your lip
the better fortune guidosfree at least
by this defection of the foolish pair
he could begin make profit in some sort
of the young bride and the new quietness
lead his own life now henceforth breathe unplagued
could he you know the sex like guidos self
learn the violantenature

once in rome
by way of helping guido lead such life
her first act to inaugurate return
was she got pricked in conscience jubilee
gave her the hint our pope as kind as just
attained his eighty years announced a boon
should make us bless the fact held jubilee
short shrift prompt pardon for the light offence
and no rough dealing with the regular crime
so this occasion were not suffered slip
otherwise sins commuted as before
without the least abatement in the price
now who had thought it all this while it seems
our sage violante had a sin of a sort
she must compound for now or not at all
now be the ready riddance she confessed
pompilia was a fable not a fact
she never bore a child in her whole life
had this child been a changeling that were grace
in some degree exchange is hardly theft
you take your stand on truth ere leap your lie
here was all lie no touch of truth at all
all the lie hersnot even pietro guessed
he was as childless still as twelve years since
the babe had been a find i the filthheap sir
catch from the kennel there was found a rome
down in the deepest of our social dregs
a woman who professed the wantons trade
under the requisite thin coverture
communis meretrix and washerwife
the creature thus conditioned found by chance
motherhood like a jewel in the muck
and straightway either trafficked with her prize
or listened to the tempter and let be
made pact abolishing her place and part
in womankind beastfellowship indeed
she sold this babe eight months before its birth
to our violante pietros honest spouse
wellfamed and widelyinstanced as that crown
to the husband virtue in a womans shape
she it was bought and paid for passed the thing
off as the flesh and blood and child of her
despite the flagrant fifty yearsand why
partly to please old pietro fill his cup
with wine at the late hour when lees are left
and send him from lifes feast rejoicingly
partly to cheat the rightful heirs agape
each uncles cousins brothers son of him
for that same principal of the usufruct
it vext him he must die and leave behind

such was the sin had come to be confessed
which of the tales the first or last was true
did she so sin once or confessing now
sin for the first time either way you will
one sees a reason for the cheat one sees
a reason for a cheat in owning cheat
where no cheat had been what of the revenge
what prompted the contrition all at once
made the avowal easy the shame slight
why prove they but pompilia not their child
no child no dowry this supposed their child
had claimed what this shown alien to their blood
claimed nowise guidos claim was through his wife
null then and void with hers the biter bit
do you see for such repayment of the past
one might conceive the penitential pair
ready to bring their case before the courts
publish their infamy to all the world
and arm in arm go chuckling thence content

is this your view twas guidos anyhow
and colourable he came forward then
protested in his very brides behalf
against this lie and all it led to least
of all the loss o the dowry no from her
and him alike he would expunge the blot
erase the brand of such a bestial birth
participate in no hideous heritage
gathered from the gutter to be garnered up
and glorified in a palace peter and paul
but that who likes may look upon the pair
exposed in yonder church and show his skill
by saying which is eye and which is mouth
thro those stabs thick and threefoldbut for that
a strong word on the liars and their lie
might crave expression and obtain it sir
though prematurely since theres more to come
more than will shake your confidence in things
your cousin tells youmay i be so bold

this makes the first act of the farceanon
the stealing sombre element comes in
till all is black or bloodred in the piece
guido thus made a laughingstock abroad
a proverb for the marketplace at home
left alone with pompilia now this graft
so reputable on his ancient stock
this plagueseed set to fester his sound flesh
what did the count revenge him on his wife
unfasten at all risks to rid himself
the noisome lazarbadge fall foul of fate
and careless whether the poor rag was ware
o the part it played or helped unwittingly
bid it go burn and leave his frayed flesh free
plainly did guido open both doors wide
spurn thence the curcast creature and clear scores
as man might tempted in extreme like this
no birth and breeding and compassion too
saved her such scandal she was young he thought
not privy to the treason punished most
i the proclamation of it why make her
a party to the crime she suffered by
then the black eyes were now her very own
not any more violantes let her live
lose in a new air under a new sun
the taint of the imputed parentage
truely or falsely take no more the touch
of pietro and his partner anyhow
all might go well yet
so she thought herself
it seems since what was her first act and deed
when news came how these kindly ones at rome
had stripped her naked to amuse the world
with spots here spots there and spots everywhere
for i should tell you that they noised abroad
not merely the main scandal of her birth
but slanders written printed published wide
pamphlets which set forth all the pleasantry
of how the promised glory was a dream
the power a bubble and the wealthwhy dust
there was a picture painted to the life
of those rare doings that superlative
initiation in magnificence
conferred on a poor roman family
by favour of arezzo and her first
and famousest the franceschini there
you had the countship holding head aloft
bravely although bespattered shifts and straits
in keeping out o the way o the wheels o the world
the comic of those homecontrivances
when the old ladymothers wit was taxed
to find six clamorous mouths in food more real
than fruit plucked off the cobwebbed familytree
or acorns shed from its gilt mouldered frame
cold glories served up with threepauls worths sauce
what i askwhen the drunkenness of hate
hiccuped return for hospitality
befouled the table they had feasted on
or saygod knows ill not prejudge the case
grievances thus distorted magnified
coloured by quarrel into calumny
what side did our pompilia first espouse
her first deliberate measure was she wrote
pricked by some loyal impulse straight to rome
and her husbands brother the abate there
who having managed to effect the match
might take mens censure for its ill success
she made a clean breast also in her turn
she qualified the couple handsomely
since whose departure hell she said was heaven
and the house late distracted by their peals
quiet as carmel where the lilies live
herself had oftentimes complained but why
all her complaints had been their prompting tales
trumped up devices to this very end
their game had been to thwart her husbands love
and cross his will malign his words and ways
so reach this issue furnish this pretence
for impudent withdrawal from their bond
theft indeed murder since they meant no less
whose last injunction to her simple self
had beenwhat parentsprecept do you think
that she should follow after with all speed
fly from her husbands house clandestinely
join them at rome again but first of all
pick up a fresh companion in her flight
putting so youth and beauty to fit use
some gay daredevil cloakandrapier spark
capable of adventurehelped by whom
she some fine eve when lutes were in the air
having put poison in the possetcup
laid hands on money jewels and the like
and to conceal the thing with more effect
by way of parting benediction too
fired the houseone would finish famously
i the tumult slip out scurry off and away
and turn up merrily at home once more
fact this and not a dream o the devil sir
and more than this a fact none dare dispute
word for word such a letter did she write
and such the abate read nor simply read
but gave all rome to ruminate upon
in answer to such charges as i say
the couple sought to be beforehand with

the cause thus carried to the courts at rome
guido away the abate had no choice
but stand forth take his absent brothers part
defend the honour of himself beside
he made what head he might against the pair
maintained pompilias birth legitimate
and all her rights intacthers guidos now
and so far by his tactics turned their flank
the enemy being beforehand in the place
that though the courts allowed the cheat for fact
suffered violante to parade her shame
publish her infamy to hearts content
and let the tale o the feigned birth pass for proved
yet they stopped there refused to intervene
and dispossess the innocents befooled
by gifts o the guilty at guilts new caprice
they would not take away the dowry now
wrongfully given at first nor bar at all
succession to the aforesaid usufruct
established on a fraud nor play the game
of pietros child and now not pietros child
as it might suit the gamesters purpose thus
was justice ever ridiculed in rome
such be the double verdicts favoured here
which send away both parties to a suit
nor puffed up nor cast downfor each a crumb
of right for neither of them the whole loaf
whence on the comparinis part appeal
counterappeal on guidosthats the game
and so the matter stands even to this hour
bandied as balls are in a tenniscourt
and so might stand unless some heart broke first
till doomsday

leave it thus and now revert
to the old arezzo whence we moved to rome
weve had enough o the parents false or true
now for a touch o the daughters quality
the starts fair henceforthevery obstacle
out of the young wifes footpathshes alone
left to walk warily now how does she walk
why once a dwellings doorpost marked and crossed
in rubric by the enemy on his rounds
as eligible as fit place of prey
baffle him henceforth keep him out who can
stop up the door at the first hint of hoof
presently at the window taps a horn
and satans by your fireside never fear
pompilia left alone now found herself
found herself young too sprightly fair enough
matched with a husband old beyond his age
though that was something like four times her own
because of cares past present and to come
found too the house dull and its inmates dead
so looked outside for light and life

and lo
there in a trice did turn up life and light
the man with the aureole sympathy made flesh
the allconsoling caponsacchi sir
a priestwhat else should the consoler be
with goodly shoulderblade and proper leg
a portly make and a symmetric shape
and curls that clustered to the tonsure quite
this was a bishop in the bud and now
a canon fullblown so far priest and priest
nowise exorbitantly overworked
the courtly christian not so much saint paul
as a saint of caesars household there posed he
sending his godglance after his shot shaft
apollos turned apollo while the snake
pompilia writhed transfixed through all her spires
he not a visitor at guidos house
scarce an acquaintance but in prime request
with the magnates of arezzo was seen here
heard there felt everywhere in guidos path
if guidos wifes path be her husbands too
now he threw comfits at the theatre
into her lapwhat harm in carnival
now he pressed close till his foot touched her gown
his hand brushed hershow help on promenade
and ever on weighty business found his steps
incline to a certain haunt of doubtful fame
which fronted guidos palace by mere chance
whilehow do accidents sometimes combine
pompilia chose to cloister up her charms
just in a chamber that oerlooked the street
sat there to pray or peep thence at mankind

this passage of arms and wits amused the town
at last the husband lifted eyebrowbent
on daybook and the study how to wring
half the due vintage from the wornout vines
at the villa tease a quarter the old rent
from the farmstead tenants swore would tumble soon
pricked up his ear asinging day and night
with ruin ruinand so surprised at last
why what else but a titter up he jumps
back to mind come those scratchings at the grange
prints of the paw about the outhouse rife
in his head at once again are word and wink
mum here and budget there the smell o the fox
the musk o the gallant friends theres falseness here

the proper help of friends in such a strait
is waggery the world over laugh him free
o the regular jealousfit thats incident
to all old husbands that wed brisk young wives
and hell go duly docile all his days
somebody courts your wife count where and when
how and why mere hornmadness have a care
your lady loves her own room sticks to it
locks herself in for hours you say yourself
andwhat its caponsacchi means you harm
the canon we caress him hes the worlds
a man of such acceptancenever dream
though he were fifty times the fox you fear
hed risk his brush for your particular chick
when the wide towns his henroost fie o the fool
so they dispensed their comfort of a kind
guido at last cried something is in the air
under the earth some plot against my peace
the trouble of eclipse hangs overhead
how it should come of that officious orb
your canon in my system you must say
i saythat from the pressure of this spring
began the chime and interchange of bells
ever one whisper and one whisper more
and just one whisper for the silvery last
till all at once arow the bronzethroats burst
into a larum both significant
and sinister stop it i must and will
let caponsacchi take his hand away
from the wiredisport himself in other paths
than lead precisely to my palacegate
look where he likes except one windows way
where cheek on hand and elbow set on sill
happens to lean and say her litanies
every day and all day long just my wife
or wife and caponsacchi may fare the worse

admire the mans simplicity ill do this
ill not have that ill punish and prevent
tis easy saying but to a fray you see
two parties go the badger shows his teeth
the fox nor lies down sheeplike nor dares fight
oh the wife knew the appropriate warfare well
the way to put suspicion to the blush
at first hint of remonstrance up and out
i the face of the world you found her she could speak
state her casefranceschini was a name
guido had his full share of foes and friends
why should not she call these to arbitrate
she bade the governor do governance
cried out on the archbishopwhy there now
take him for sample three successive times
had he to reconduct her by main force
from where she took her station opposite
his shut dooron the public steps thereto
wringing her hands when he came out to see
and shrieking all her wrongs forth at his foot
back to the husband and the house she fled
judge if that husband warmed him in the face
of friends or frowned on foes as heretofore
judge if he missed the natural grin of folk
or lacked the customary compliment
of cap and bells the luckless husbands fit

so it went on and on tillwho was right
one merry april morning guido woke
after the cuckoo so late near noonday
with an inordinate yawning of the jaws
ears plugged eyes gummed together palate tongue
and teeth one mudpaste made of poppymilk
and found his wife flown his scrutoire the worse
for a rummagejewelry that was was not
some money there had made itself wings too
the door lay wide and yet the servants slept
sound as the dead or dosed which does as well
in short pompilia she who candid soul
had not so much as spoken all her life
to the canon nay so much as peeped at him
between her fingers while she prayed in church
this lamblike innocent of fifteen years
such she was grown to by this time of day
had simply put an opiate in the drink
of the whole household overnight and then
got up and gone about her work secure
laid hand on this waif and the other stray
spoiled the philistine and marched out of doors
in company of the canon who lords love
what with his daily duty at the church
nightly devoir where ladies congregate
had something else to mind assure yourself
beside pompilia paragon though she be
or notice if her nose were sharp or blunt
well anyhow albeit impossible
both of them were together jollily
jaunting it romeward halfway there by this
while guido was left go and get undrugged
gather his wits up groaningly give thanks
when neighbours crowded round him to condole
ah quoth a gossip well i mind me now
the count did always say he thought he felt
he feared as if this very chance might fall
and when a man of fifty finds his corns
ache and his joints throb and foresees a storm
though neighbours laugh and say the sky is clear
let us henceforth believe him weatherwise
then was the story told ill cut you short
all neighbours knew no mystery in the world
the lovers left at nightfallover night
had caponsacchi come to carry off
pompilianot alone a friend of his
one guillichini the more conversant
with guidos housekeeping that he was just
a cousin of guidos and might play a prank
have you not too a cousin thats a wag
lord and a canon alsowhat would you have
such are the redclothed milkswollen poppyheads
that stand and stiffen mid the wheat o the church
this worthy came to aid abet his best
and so the house was ransacked booty bagged
the lady led downstairs and out of doors
guided and guarded till the city passed
a carriage lay convenient at the gate
goodbye to the friendly canon the loving one
could peradventure do the rest himself
in jumps pompilia after her the priest
whip drivermoney makes the mare to go
and weve a bagful take the roman road
so said the neighbours this was eight hours since

guido heard all swore the befitting oaths
shook off the relics of his poisondrench
got horse was fairly started in pursuit
with never a friend to follow found the track
fast enough twas the straight perugia way
trod soon upon their very heels too late
by a minute only at camoscia at
chiusi foligno ever the fugitives
just ahead just out as he galloped in
getting the good news ever fresh and fresh
till lo at the last stage of all last post
before romeas we say in sight of rome
and safety theres impunity at rome
for priests you know atwhats the little place
what some call castelnuovo some just call
the osteria because o the posthouse inn
there at the journeys all but end it seems
triumph deceived them and undid them both
secure they might foretaste felicity
nor fear surprisal so they were surprised
there did they halt at early evening there
did guido overtake them twas daybreak
he came in time enough not time too much
since in the courtyard stood the canons self
urging the drowsy stable grooms to haste
harness the horses have the journey end
the trifling fourhoursrunning so reach rome
and the other runaway the wife upstairs
still on the couch where she had spent the night
one couch in one room and one room for both
so gained they six hours so were lost thereby

sir whats the sequel lover and beloved
fall on their knees no impudence serves here
they beat their breasts and beg for easy death
confess this that and the otheranyhow
confess there wanted not some likelihood
to the supposition as preposterous
that o pompilia thy sequestered eyes
had noticed straying oer the prayerbooks edge
more of the canon than that black his coat
buckled his shoes were broad his hat of brim
and that o canon thy religious care
had breathed too soft a benedicite
to banish trouble from a ladys breast
so lonely and so lovely nor so lean
this you expect indeed then much you err
not to such ordinary end as this
had caponsacchi flung the cassock far
doffed the priest donned the perfect cavalier
the die was cast over shoes over boots
and just as she i presently shall show
pompilia soon looked helen to the life
recumbent upstairs in her pink and white
so in the innyard bold as twere troytown
there strutted paris in correct costume
cloak cap and feather no appointment missed
even to a wickedlooking sword at side
he seemed to find and feel familiar at
nor wanted words as ready and as big
as the part he played the bold abashless one
i interposed to save your wife from death
yourself from shame the true and only shame
ask your own conscience elseor failing that
what i have done i answer anywhere
here if you will you see i have a sword
or since i have a tonsure as you taunt
at rome by all meanspriests to try a priest
only speak where your wifes voice can reply
and then he fingered at the sword again
so guido called in aid and witness both
the public force the commissary came
officers also they secured the priest
then for his more confusion mounted up
with him a guard on either side the stair
to the bedroom where still slept or feigned a sleep
his paramour and guidos wife in burst
the company and bade her wake and rise

her defence this she woke saw sprang upright
i the midst and stood as terrible as truth
sprang to her husbands side caught at the sword
that hung there useless since they held each hand
o the lover had disarmed him properly
and in a moment out flew the bright thing
full in the face of guidobut for help
o the guards who held her back and pinioned her
with pains enough she had finished you my tale
with a flourish of red all round it pinked her man
prettily but she fought them one to six
they stopped thatbut her tongue continued free
she spat forth such invective at her spouse
oerfrothed him with such foam of murderer
thief pandarthat the popular tide soon turned
the favour of the very sbirri straight
ebbed from the husband set toward his wife
people cried hands off pay a priest respect
and persecuting fiend and martyred saint
began to lead a measure from lip to lip

but facts are facts and flinch not stubborn things
and the question prithee friend how comes my purse
i the poke of youadmits of no reply
here was a priest found out in masquerade
a wife caught playing truant if no more
while the count mortified in mien enough
and nose to face an added palm in length
was plain writ husband every piece of him
capture once made release could hardly be
beside the prisoners both made appeal
take us to rome
taken to rome they were
the husband trooping after piteously
tail between legs no talk of triumph now
no honour set firm on its feet once more
on two dead bodies of the guiltynay
no dubious salve to honours broken pate
from chance that after all the hurt might seem
a skindeep matter scratch that leaves no scar
for guidos first searchferreting poor soul
here there and everywhere in the vile place
abandoned to him when their backs were turned
foundfurnishing a last and best regale
all the loveletters bandied twixt the pair
since the first timid trembling into life
o the lovestar till its stand at fiery full
mad prose mad verse fears hopes triumph despair
avowal disclaimer plans dates nameswas nought
wanting to prove if proof consoles at all
that this had been but the fifth act o the piece
whereof the due proemium months ago
these playwrights had put forth and ever since
matured the middle added neath his nose
he might go cross himself the case was clear

therefore to rome with the clear case there plead
each party its best and leave the law do right
let her shine forth and show as god in heaven
vice prostrate virtue pedestalled at last
the triumph of truth what else shall glad our gaze
when once authority has knit the brow
and set the brain behind it to decide
between the wolf and sheep turned litigants
this is indeed a business law shook head
a husband charges hard things on a wife
the wife as hard o the husband whose fault here
a wife that flies her husbands house does wrong
the male friends interference looks amiss
lends a suspicion but suppose the wife
on the other hand be jeopardised at home
nay that she simply hold illgroundedly
an apprehension she is jeopardised
and further if the friend partake the fear
and in a commendable charity
which trusteth all trust her that she mistrusts
what do they but obey the natural law
pretence may this be and a cloak for sin
and circumstances that concur i the close
hint as much loudlyyet scarce loud enough
to drown the answer strange may yet be true
innocence often looks like guiltiness
the accused declare that in thought word and deed
innocent were they both from first to last
as malebabe haply laid by femalebabe
at church on edge of the baptismal font
together for a minute perfectpure
difficult to believe yet possible
as witness joseph the friends patronsaint
the night at the innthere charity nigh chokes
ere swallow what they both asseverate
though down the gullet faith may feel it go
when mindful of what flight fatigued the flesh
out of its faculty and fleshliness
subdued it to the soul as saints assure
so long a flight necessitates a fall
on the first bed though in a lions den
and the first pillow though the lions back
difficult to believe yet possible
last come the letters bundled beastliness
authority repugns give glance to twice
turns head and almost lets her whiplash fall
yet here a voice cries respite from the clouds
the accused both in a tale protest disclaim
abominate the horror not my hand
asserts the friendnor mine chimes in the wife
seeing i have no hand nor write at all
illiteratefor she goes on to ask
what if the friend did pen now verse now prose
commend it to her notice now and then
twas pearls to swine she read no more than wrote
and kept no more than read for as they fell
she ever brushed the burrlike things away
or better burned them quenched the fire in smoke
as for this fardel filth and foolishness
she sees it now the first time burn it too
while for his part the friend vows ignorance
alike of what bears his name and bear hers
tis forgery a felons masterpiece
and as tis the fox still finds the stench
homemanufacturer and the husbands work
though he confesses the ingenuous friend
that certain missives letters of a sort
flighty and feeble which assigned themselves
to the wife no less have fallen far too oft
in his path wherefrom he understood just this
that were they verily the ladys own
why she who penned them since he never saw
save for one minute the mere face of her
since never had there been the interchange
of word with word between them all their life
why she must be the fondest of the frail
and fit she for the apage he flung
her letters for the flame they went to feed
but now he sees her face and hears her speech
much he repents him if in fancyfreak
for a moment the minutest measurable
he coupled her with the first flimsy word
o the selfspun fabric some mean spidersoul
furnished forth stop his films and stamp on him
never was such a tangled knottiness
but thus authority cuts the gordian through
and mark how her decision suits the need
heres troublesomeness scandal on both sides
plenty of fault to find no absolute crime
let each side own its fault and make amends
what does a priest in cavaliers attire
consorting publicly with vagrant wives
in quarters close as the confessional
though innocent of harm tis harm enough
let him pay it and be relegate a good
three years to spend in some place not too far
nor yet too near midway twixt near and far
rome and arezzocivita we choose
where he may lounge away time live at large
find out the proper function of a priest
nowise an exilethat were punishment
but one our love thus keeps out of harms way
not more from the husbands anger than mayhap
his ownsay indiscretion waywardness
and wanderings when easter eves grow warm
for the wifewell our best step to take with her
on her own showing were to shift her root
from the old cold shade and unhappy soil
into a generous ground that fronts the south
where since her callow soul ashiver late
craved simply warmth and called mere passersby
to the rescue she should have her fill of shine
do house and husband hinder and not help
why then forget both and stay here at peace
come into our community enroll
herself along with those good convertites
those sinners saved those magdalens remade
accept their administration well bestow
her body and patiently possess her soul
until we see what better can be done
last for the husband if his tale prove true
well is he rid of two domestic plagues
the wife that ailed do whatsoever he would
and friend of hers that undertook the cure
see what a double load we lift from breast
off he may go return resume old life
laugh at the priest here and pompilia there
in limbo each and punished for their pains
and grateful tell the inquiring neighbourhood
in rome no wrong but has its remedy
the case was closed now am i fair or no
in what i utter do i state the facts
having forechosen a side i promised you

the canon caponsacchi then was sent
to change his garb retrim his tonsure tie
the clerkly silk round every plait correct
make the impressive entry on his place
of relegation thrill his civita
as ovid a like sufferer in the cause
planted a primrosepatch by pontus where
what with much culture of the sonnetstave
and converse with the aborigines
soft savagery of eyes unused to roll
and hearts that all awry went pitapat
and wanted setting right in charity
what were a couple of years to while away
pompilia as enjoined betook herself
to the aforesaid convertites the sisterhood
in via lungara where the light ones live
spin pray then sing like linnets oer the flax
anywhere anyhow out of my husbands house
is heaven cried shewas therefore suited so
but for count guido franceschini he
the injured man thus rightedfound no heaven
i the house when he returned there i engage
was welcomed by the city turned upside down
in a chorus of inquiry what backyou
and no wife left her with the penitents
ah being young and pretty twere a shame
to have her whipped in public leave the job
to the priests who understand such priests as yours
pontifex maximus whipped vestals once
our madcap caponsacchi think of him
so he fired up showed fight and skill of fence
ay you drew also but you did not fight
the wiser tis a word and a blow with him
true caponsacchi of old headithesack
that fought at fiesole ere florence was
he had done enough to firk you were too much
and did the little lady menace you
make at your breast with your own harmless sword
the spitfire well thank god youre safe and sound
have kept the sixth commandment whether or no
the lady broke the seventh i only wish
i were as saintlike could contain me so
i am a sinner i fear i should have left
sir priest no nosetip to turn up at me
you sir who listen but interpose no word
ask yourself had you borne a baiting thus
was it enough to make a wise man mad
oh but ill have your verdict at the end

well not enough it seems such mere hurt falls
frets awhile and aches long then less and less
and so is done with such was not the scheme
o the pleasant comparini on guidos wound
ever in due succession drop by drop
came slow distilment from the alembic here
set on to simmer by canidian hate
corrosives keeping the mans misery raw
first firedropwhen he thought to make the best
o the bad to wring from out the sentence passed
poor pitiful absurd although it were
yet what might eke him out result enough
and make it worth his while he had the right
and not the wrong i the matter judged at rome
inadequate her punishment no less
punished in some slight sort his wife had been
then punished for adultery what else
on such admitted crime he thought to seize
and institute procedure in the courts
which cut corruption of this kind from man
cast loose a wife proved loose and castaway
he claimed in due form a divorce at least

this claim was met now by a counterclaim
pompilia sought divorce from bed and board
of guido whose outrageous cruelty
whose mothers malice and whose brothers hate
were just the white o the charge such dreadful depths
blackened its centrehints of worse than hate
love from that brother by that guidos guile
that mothers prompting such reply was made
so was the engine loaded wound up sprung
on guido who received the bolt in breast
but no less bore up giddily perhaps
he had the abate paolo still in rome
brother and friend and fighter on his side
they rallied in a measure met the foe
manlike joined battle in the public courts
as if to shame supine law from her sloth
and waiting her award let beat the while
arezzos banter romes buffoonery
on this ear and on that ear deaf alike
safe from worse outrage let a scorpion nip
and never mind till he contorts his tail
but there was sting i the creature thus it struck
guido had thought in his simplicity
that lying declaration of remorse
that story of the child which was no child
and motherhood no motherhood at all
that even this sin might have its sort of good
inasmuch as no question could be more
call it false call the story true no claim
of further parentage pretended now
the parents had abjured all right at least
i the woman still his wife to plead right now
were to declare the abjuration false
he was relieved from any fear henceforth
their hands might touch their breath defile again
pompilia with his name upon her yet
well no the next news was pompilias health
demanded change after full three long weeks
spent in devotion with the sisterhood
rendering sojournso the court opined
too irksome since the convents walls were high
and windows narrow nor was air enough
nor light enough but all looked prisonlike
the last thing which had come in the courts head
propose a new expedient thereforethis
she had demandedhad obtained indeed
by intervention of whatever friends
or perhaps loversbeauty in distress
in one whose tale is the towntalk beside
never lacks friendships arm about her neck
not freedom scarce remitted penalty
solely the transfer to some private place
where better air more light new food might be
incarcerated call it all the same
at some sure friends house she must keep inside
be found in at requirement fast enough
domus pro carcere in roman style
you keep the house i the main as most men do
and all good women but free otherwise
should friends arrive to lodge and entertain
and such a domum such a dwellingplace
having all rome to choose from where chose she
what house obtained pompilias preference
why just the comparinisjust do you mark
theirs who renounced all part and lot in her
so long as guido could be robbed thereby
and only fell back on relationship
and found their daughter safe and sound again
so soon as that might stab him yes the pair
who as i told you first had baited hook
with this poor gilded fly pompiliathing
then caught the fish pulled guido to the shore
and gutted himnow found a further use
for the bait would trail the gauze wings yet again
i the way of what new swimmer passed their stand
they took pompilia to their hidingplace
not in the heart of rome as formerly
under observance subject to control
but out o the wayor in the way who knows
that blind mute villa lurking by the gate
at via paulina not so hard to miss
by the honest eye easy enough to find
in twilight by marauders where perchance
some muffled caponsacchi might repair
employ odd moments when he too tried change
found that a friends abode was pleasanter
than relegation penance and the rest

come heres the last drop does its worst to wound
heres guido poisoned to the bone you say
your boasted stills full strain and strength not so
one mastersqueeze from screw shall bring to birth
the hoard i the heart o the toad hells quintessence
he learned the true convenience of the change
and why a convent wants the cheerful hearts
and helpful hands which female straits require
when in the blind mute villa by the gate
pompiliawhat sang danced saw company
gave birth sir to a child his son and heir
or guidos heir and caponsacchis son
i want your word now what do you say to this
what would say little arezzo and great rome
and what did god say and the devil say
one at each ear o the man the husband now
the father why the overburdened mind
broke down what was a brain became a blaze
in fury of the momentthat first news
fell on the count among his vines it seems
doing his farmworkwhy he summoned steward
called in the first four hard hands and stout hearts
from field and furrow poured forth his appeal
not to romes law and gospel any more
but this clown with a mother or a wife
that clodpole with a sister or a son
and whereas law and gospel held their peace
what wonder if the sticks and stones cried out

all five soon somehow found themselves at rome
at the villa door there was the warmth and light
the sense of life so just an inch inside
some angel must have whispered one more chance

he gave it bade the others stand aside
knocked at the doorwho is it knocks cried one
i will make surely guidos angel said
one final essay last experiment
speak the word name the name from out all names
which ifas doubtless strong illusions are
and strange disguisings whence even truth seems false
and for i am a man i dare not do
gods work until assured i see with god
if i should bring my lips to breathe that name
and they be innocentnay by one touch
of innocence redeemed from utter guilt
that name will bar the door and bid fate pass
i will not say it is a messenger
a neighbour even a belated man
much less your husbands friend your husbands self
at such appeal the door is bound to ope
but i will sayheres rhetoric and to spare
why sir the stumblingblock is cursed and kicked
block though it be the name that brought offence
will bring offence the burnt child dreads the fire
although that fire feed on a taperwick
which never left the altar nor singed fly
and had a harmless man tripped you by chance
how would you wait him stand or step aside
when next you heard he rolled your way enough

giuseppe caponsacchi guido cried
and open flew the door enough again
vengeance you know burst like a mountainwave
that holds a monster in it over the house
and wiped its filthy four walls free again
with a wash of hellfirefather mother wife
killed them all bathed his name clean in their blood
and reeking so was caught his friends and he
haled hither and imprisoned yesternight
o the day all this was
now the whole is known
and how the old couple come to lie in state
though hacked to piecesnever the experts say
so thorough a study of stabbingwhile the wife
viperlike very difficult to slay
writhes still through every ring of her poor wretch
at the hospital hard bysurvives well hope
to somewhat purify her putrid soul
by full confession make so much amends
while time lasts since at days end die she must
for caponsacchiwhy theyll have him here
the hero of the adventure who so fit
to tell it in the coming carnival
twill make the fortune of whateer saloon
hears him recount with helpful cheek and eye
hotly indignant now now dewydimmed
the incidents of flight pursuit surprise
capture with hints of kisses all between
while guido the most unromantic spouse
no longer fit to laugh at since the blood
gave the broad farce an all too brutal air
why he and those our luckless friends of his
may tumble in the straw this bitter day
laid by the heels i the new prison i hear
to bide their trial since trial and for the life
follows if but for forms sake yes indeed

but with a certain issue no dispute
try him bids law formalities oblige
but as to the issuelook me in the face
if the law thinks to find them guilty sir
master or mentouch one hair of the five
then i say in the name of all thats left
of honour in rome civility i the world
whereof rome boasts herself the central source
theres an end to all hope of justice more
astraeas gone indeed let hope go too
who is it dares impugn the natural law
deny gods word the faithless wife shall die
what are we blind how can we fail to see
this crowd of miseries make the man a mark
accumulate on one devoted head
for our example yours and mine who read
its lesson thushenceforward let none dare
stand like a natural in the public way
letting the very urchins twitch his beard
and tweak his nose to earn a nickname so
of the malegrissel or the modern job
had guido in the twinkling of an eye
summed up the reckoning promptly paid himself
that morning when he came up with the pair
at the wayside innexacted his just debt
by aid of what first mattock pitchfork axe
came to hand in the helpful stableyard
and with that axe if providence so pleased
cloven each head by some rolandostroke
in one clean cut from crown to clavicle
slain the priestgallant the wifeparamour
sticking for all defence in each skulls cleft
the rhyme and reason of the stroke thus dealt
towit those letters and last evidence
of shame each package in its proper place
bidding who pitied undistend the skulls
i say the world had praised the man but no
that were too plain too straight too simply just
he hesitates calls law forsooth to help
and law distasteful to who calls in law
when honour is beforehand and would serve
what wonder if law hesitate in turn
plead her disuse to calls o the kind reply
smiling a little tis yourself assess
the worth of whats lost sum of damage done
what you touched with so light a fingertip
you whose concern it was to grasp the thing
why must law gird herself and grapple with
law alien to the actor whose warm blood
asks heat from law whose veins run lukewarm milk
what you dealt lightly with shall law make out
heinous forsooth
sir whats the good of law
in a case o the kind none as she all but says
call in law when a neighbour breaks your fence
cribs from your field tampers with rent or lease
touches the purse or pocketbut wooes your wife
no take the old way trod when men were men
guido preferred the new pathfor his pains
stuck in a quagmire floundered worse and worse
until he managed somehow scramble back
into the safe sure rutted road once more
revenged his own wrong like a gentleman
once back mid the familiar prints no doubt
he made too rash amends for his first fault
vaulted too loftily over what barred him late
and lit i the mire againthe common chance
the natural overenergy the deed
maladroit yields three deaths instead of one
and one life left for wheres the canons corpse
all which is the worse for guido but be frank
the better for you and me and all the world
husbands of wives especially in rome
the thing is put right in the old placeay
the rod hangs on its nail behind the door
fresh from the brine a matter i commend
to the notice during carnival thats near
of a certain whatshisname and jackanapes
somewhat too civil of eves with lute and song
about a house here where i keep a wife
you being his cousin may go tell him soembed"
