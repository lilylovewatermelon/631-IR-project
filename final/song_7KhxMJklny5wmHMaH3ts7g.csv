im dreaming about tomorrow
im thinking of yesterday
i consume myself in sorrow
this moment in time is what i betray
i am searching for the answers

chorus
and i look around sometimes i get sad
because i dont know which way to go
and i look around sometimes i get sad
because my life is spinning out of control

verse 2
i never know what you want
i never know what you need
it was different from the start
when you cut me in two i never
thought i would bleed
but i am searching for the answers

chorus
and i look around sometimes i get sad
because i dont know which way to go
and i look around sometimes i get sad
because my life is spinning out of control
you might also likebridge
i will go this alone
i dont need nobodys help
ive got to do this myself
alone alone alone alone

chorus
and i look around sometimes i get sad
because i dont know which way to go
and i look around sometimes i get sad
because my life is spinning out of control
and i look around sometimes i get sad
because i dont know which way to go
and i look around sometimes i get sad
because my life is spinning out of controlembed"
