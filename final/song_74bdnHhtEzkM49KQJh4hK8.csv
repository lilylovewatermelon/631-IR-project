i thought there was redemption in the four ethers
oohah oohah free—

verse baby keem
you know im borderline more than rich had to tame the orphanage
navigated two bitches textin them the coordinates
two phones literally house party loiterin
deals so dummy had to let several lawyers in
one day ill tell you how my life was unfortunate
for now ill tell you how fast these porsches get
story of the young and reckless bout to eat my bitch for breakfast
pink pussy been a prеference nеver fold under pressure
cheap shots let it rock eye open fetty wap
rain like confetti drop i bet he drop
i dont hate the trendy things just dont like to feed the trends
mama gave me all my sins love me when the story ends
flowers on my uncles tomb thousands to my aunties too
im used to takin backstreets last week was nothing new
bitches is my scapegoat who i made this tape for
i tell the story two years later for now the case closed

outro
ive heard so much about it
you talk about it all the time
i wanna go there inside your mind
