all my exes live in texas
and texas is the place id dearly love to be
but all my exes live in texas
and thats why i hang my hat in tennessee

verse 1
rosannas down in texarkana
wanted me to push her broom
and sweet eileens in abilene
she forgot i hung the moon
and allisons in galveston
somehow lost her sanity
and dimples who now lives in temples
got the law looking for me

chorus
all my exes live in texas
and texas is the place id dearly love to be
but all my exes live in texas
and thats why i hang my hat in tennessee

verse 2
i remember that old frio river
where i learned to swim
but it brings to mind another time
where i wore my welcome thin
by transcendental meditation
i go there each night
but i always come back to myself
long before daylight
