who loved you first
who loved you last
why do i even think of these things
cause ive always been the type to see all the bad before all the good things
havent written the song in a minute
havent been in love in forever
but im looking at you youre looking at me at every single possible angle

chorus
and its not like how you make me feel
i dont feel this kind of type of way
and its not like how you make me feel
i dont feel this kind of type of way

i dont feel this kind of type of way
i dont feel this kind of type of way
i dont feel this kind of type of way
i dont feel this kind of type of way

verse  2
ask what you want ask what you need
ill tell you еverything that i know
im hoping that you wont ever lеave
cause theres nowhere else i wanna go
