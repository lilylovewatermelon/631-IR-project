hoo
niaga ti ta kcab eruoy loof

verse 1
boyfriends they think youre so easy
they take you for granted
they dont know theyre just misunderstanding

refrain
you
you youre back at it again

verse 2
weakened when you get deep in
he starts secretly drinking
it gets hard to know what hes thinking

refrain
you
love a fool who knows just how to get under your skin
you
you you still open the door

bridge
youre no closer to him
now youre halfway home
only callin you when
he dont wanna be alone
oh and you go
but why you dont know
you might also likeverse 3
boyfriends are they just pretending
they dont tеll you where its heading
and you know thе games never ending

refrain
you
you lay with him as you stay in the daydream
you
feel a fool youre back at it again
