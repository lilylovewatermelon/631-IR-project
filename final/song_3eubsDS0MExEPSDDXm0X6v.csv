been about a day since i bled in a pine bed
get em full of dread when they find out that i’m dead
body full of meds mislead by a pill head
fucking infrared cocked back ready for the feds
triple six triple six rockin an upsidedown crucifix
luminous lunatic shredding the bodies
oh no im not new to this
satanic bitches that fuck for the ritual
spiritual visuals fuckboys habitual
talkin that shit you don’t know bitch don’t make me get physical
walking round miserable smoking that medical
shoot up a bag of dope
dependent on chemicals
im on a pedestal neck hangin from a rope
carecrow the skeletal fuck is acceptable
i have no frontal lobe

verse 2 7th ward dragon
bitch you can never be the 7th ward dragon
fuck nopd and fuck jppd all the white flags flappin
ruby da cherry what will he do to me i cant even imagine
ridin in a monster truck ak tucked
47 shots is what the ak pump
i be that lakefront punk with a vacant trunk
take some when the bass bump
then i wait for them at the bottom of the pit
youll be comin out the fucking bottom of my pit thats pitbull shit
red blood drippin off my fucking pitbulls lips
triple the digits of six
six days went by on the seventh day i shine
7th ward diamond minds illuminated by divine signs
painted by my minds eye blankets lyin on a fine dime
bitch im naked and i might diesee uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also like25embed"
