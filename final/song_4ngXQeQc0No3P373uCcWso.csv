no hay nadie mas que yo uno es el numero magico
en vida y en muerte uno es todo comprende

verse 1
if i multiply 2 times 2 is it really really 4 me
and if i add 5 to get 9 minus 8 that just leaves me
me me me me me me me me
so many times i define my pride through somebody elses eyes
then i looked inside and found my own stride
i found the lasting love for me
if i am searching for my spirituality passionately
i must begin with me

chorus
theres just me one is the magic number
theres just me one is the magic number

verse 2
if i add myself unto myself multiplied times
you and yours and you again theres just me
and if i divide 8 billion 48 trillion 98 zillion
there is there is just me
if i subtract one plus me to the 5th degree use any theorem
theres just me
