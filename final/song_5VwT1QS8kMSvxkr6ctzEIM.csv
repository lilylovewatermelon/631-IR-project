lets go

verse 1
as you cry in silver rings and pose
in a second youll be high and in the clouds alone alone
i never thought id see the day
but i see stars around your face
just like were in the the movies and youre scared
this was never my intention after all
so tell me what the fuck did i do

bridge
damn not even from my lifeless cold dead hands
were made to destroy

verse 2
tell me what you want until it hurts
ill hang myself in lights and i will glow for you
the colors oh my god it sends you
spinning on this circus ride
youre further than youve ever been
stuck in zerogravity we laugh
i think were in over our heads

chorus
i cant deny its getting worse
trust me its a blessing and a curse
call me if youre crashing well take turns
hello welcome to southern california
go back home
see pierce the veil liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likeverse 3
stand back i cant believe
do the math the sky will fall anyway
trust me this is a blessing and a curse
this much i cant deny

outro
i cant deny its getting worse
trust me its a blessing and a curse1embed"
