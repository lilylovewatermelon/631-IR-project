your gun went off
well you shot off your mouth and look where it got you
my mouth runs on too
shouts from both sides
well weve got the land but theyve got the view
well now heres the clue
life it rents us
and yeah i hope it put plenty on you
well i hope mine did too

chorus
as life gets longer awful feels softer
well it feels pretty soft to me
and if it takes shit to make bliss
then i feel pretty blissfully

verse 2
your gun went off
well you shot off your mouth and look where it got you
my mouth runs on too
pow pow pow pow pow pow
shots from both sides
well weve got the land but theyve got the view pow pow pow
well now heres the clue
we are fixed right where we stand
life it rents us
and yeah i hope it put plenty on you
well i hope mine did too
we are fixed right where we are

as life gets longer awful feels softer
well it feels pretty soft to me
and if it takes shit to make bliss

instrumental break
for every invention made how much time did we save
were not much farther than we were in the cave

bridge
as life gets longer awful feels softer
and it feels pretty soft to me
and if it takes shit to make bliss
well i feel pretty blissfully
if lifes not beautiful without the pain
well id just rather neverever even see beauty again
well as life gets longer awful feels softer
and it feels pretty soft to me ohho

outro
for every good deed done there is a crime committed
we are fixed
for every step ahead we could have just been seated
we are fixed
as life gets longer awful feels softer
well it feels pretty soft to me
we are fixed
and if it takes shit to make bliss
well i feel pretty blissfully
we are fixed
we are fixed we are fixed
we are fixed right where we stand9embed"
