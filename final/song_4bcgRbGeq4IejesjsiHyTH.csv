we could nurse it she said
come inside for a little lie down with me
and if you fall asleep it wouldnt be the worst thing
but when i wake up and your makeup is on my shoulder
and tell me if i lie down would you stay now
let me hold ya ohh

but if i kiss you will your mouth read this truth
darling how i miss you strawberrys taste how lips do
and its not complete yet mustnt get our feet wet
cause that leads to regret diving into soon
and ill owe it all to you oh my little bird

my little bird

if we take a walk out in the morning dew
we could lay down so im next you
come inside for a little home made tea
and if you fall asleep then at least your next to me
and if i wake up say its late love get back to sleep
im covered by nature and im safe now
underneath this oak tree with you beside me

but if i kiss you will your mouth read this truth
darling how i miss you strawberrys taste how lips do
and its not complete yet mustnt get our feet wet
cause that leads to regret diving into soon
see ed sheeran liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likeand ill owe it all to you oh my little bird

my little bird

my little bird

my little bird

and of all this thing im sure of im not quite certain of your love
you made me scream but then i made you cry when i left that little bird with its broken leg to die

but if i kiss you will your mouth read this truth
darling how i miss you strawberrys taste how lips do
and its not complete yet mustnt get our feet wet
cause that leads to regret diving into soon
but ill owe it all to you oh my little bird

my little bird whoa oh oh oh whoaa

my little bird

my little bird

your my little birdembed"
