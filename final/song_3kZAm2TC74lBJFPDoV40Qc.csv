im coming through the front i aint worried bout shit
trying to harm me i leave his ass like a tip
ima tell you now ima twist him like a hip
then smoke a blunt by my motherfucking self
i dont give a fuck bout none of you here
bitch i only rap just to let you niggas hear
and when we do a show your fan base disappear
bitch i aint lying ima keep it sincere
bitch since when could you chill up over here
bitch hit the road like a motherfucking deer
get hit too shit bitch might as well
i dont even talk all a ho do is tell
i’m standing on a boat finna set the damn sail
i burn incense because my brain likes the smell
she get a whiff and thought that it was a spell
i ain’t say come but she at the hotel
fuck a nigga mean me and my niggas dont be fucking with niggas
we give no fuck bout none of you niggas or whoever with you
i pull up to my nigga thenll spark
blunts already rolled what the fuck a nigga thought
east memphis streets still burning damn hot
police might as well live up on the damn clock
thats why i stay in the goddamn house
on the damn couch while i eat takeout
text ta when the weed run out
call tbo when we finna swerve out
i be on the beach feeling like a bird now
smoking on a ounce on the roof of the house
master roshi tried to kick a nigga out
cause i had a sack i aint tell his ass about
bitch you fucking know what the fuck do we about
hollow squad blunts dont never fade out bitchyou might also like28embed"
