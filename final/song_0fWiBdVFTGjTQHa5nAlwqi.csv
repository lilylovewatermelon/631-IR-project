hold me
show me all the talent god has given you
i want us thinking outside the box all night long
just keep on going
youve done good things for me
though im not an easy girl to please
ill never run out of faith in you all night long
just keep on going

chorus
long time baby long time
thats the way ive loved you baby
long night its been a long night
im breaking the record told ya
long time baby long time
the minutes are eternal lately
long night its been a long night
i cant wait to touch you touch you

verse 2
i wish i had longer legs
that i could fasten to your body
so youd take me with you everywhere
and when you think i can take no more all night long
just keep on going
if i let you have your way dont think im weak
you got the stamina and the technique
so let those eloquent hands of yours all night long
just keep on going
