ayy if its a drought its cause of me
i got forty k on my arm and i got a 40 underneath
my shit forty without the charm but i still play the humble beast
i got a reason to be alive cause i got people dependin on me
live off me i got hoes that really wont sleep if i dont send her a picture of me
i got rich off being stubborn neptune the epitome

verse
i got a soldout show overseas but i gotta bring that shit with me
fans say that shit killin me
man im straight up out the trenches but i live where the hipstеrs be
kiddin me i fuck the ho out onyx fеlt like italy
i was poppin xans when i shouldve been in college so i aint really got my memory
im in trackhawk ridin down columns face just gave me a bentley key
we aint really object to my knowledge pay em make it a memory
they built with me i dont wanna scare the fans but im in the mafia p
i miss juice he knew it first when i was still kinda doubtin me
im on xans but im alert i really got anxiety
red key tune im finna get this svr i spilled a pint in it
gotta be not really tryin to be that nigga was robbin people just out of me

i got rich off being stubborn neptune the epitome
