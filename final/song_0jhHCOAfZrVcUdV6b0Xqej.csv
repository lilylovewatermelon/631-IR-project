driving on the lawn
sleeping on the roof
drinking all the alcohol
all the kids from school
will be naked in the pool
while our parents are on fire island

verse 1
cranking up the tunes
til the windows break
feeding chocolate to the dog
jumping on the couch
til the feathers all come out
while our parents are on fire island

verse 2
were old enough by now
to take care of each other
we dont need no babysitter
we dont need no father or mother
were old enough by now
dont worry bout a thing
dont you remember
last december
when you went to steamboat springs

driving on the lawn
sleeping on the roof
drinking all the alcohol
all the kids from school
will be naked in the pool
while our parents are on fire islandembed"
