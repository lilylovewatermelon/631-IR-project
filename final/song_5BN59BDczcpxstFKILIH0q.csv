emotional affair
overly sincere
smoking in the car windows up
crocodile tears run the tap til its clear
drift off on the floor
i drag you to the shore
sweating through the sheets
youre gonna drown in your sleep for sure

chorus
wake up and start a big fire
in our one room apartment
but im too tired
to have a pissing contest
all the bad dreams that you hide
show me yours ill show you mine

verse 2
call me when you land
ill drive around again
one hand on the wheel one in your mouth
turn me on and turn me down

chorus
baby youre a vampire
you want blood and i promised
im a bad liar
with a savior complex
all the skeletons you hide
show me yours and ill show you mine

all the bad dreams that you hide
show me yours31embed"
