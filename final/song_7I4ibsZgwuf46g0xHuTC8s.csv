sesh

verse 1
smoking like a motherfucker higher than a motherfucker
bitch please stop the playing
seshollowaterboyz deaf to them other boys
we cant hear a word you saying
we dont know your name cant hang with the gang
crowd jumping when the bass get banging
all i need is dope so i gotta get paid
never see me on the stage unless the money is arranged
my hair 1080 my teeth 240 my blunts 4k
and my dope you couldnt load it
if they aint calling with a price we dont answer that
tryna fuck around bitch we gon handle that

chorus
if they aint calling with a price we dont answer that
tryna  fuck around bitch we gon handle that
we gon handle that bitch we gon handle that
tryna fuck around bitch we gon handle that
if they aint calling with a price we dont answer that
tryna fuck around bitch we gon handle that
we gon handle that bitch we gon handle that
tryna fuck around bitch we gon handle that

bitch im smoking sacrificial back to back
blink you might miss it
boy my team made up of legends
and my ring made out of crystal
they ask me how i been living since these labels out to get me
but the only reason they want to meet me is just to say they fucking met me

bridge
i got money on the table but—
i aint count it yet
i aint count it yet
i aint i aint count it yet
money on the table but—
i aint count it yet
i aint count it yet
i aint i aint count it yet
