verse 1 gunna
they gon be missin me
its gon be chaos when it come down to my royalties
i keep it still i miss the exit thats by any means woah
watch out for opps watch out for cops they kill for anything
i got on prada shoes and prada tee yes
i love my brother rest in peace i know youre proud of me
im pourin mud up tryna stay away from billie jean
on all these opens everybody say im hardly sleep
and i got demons on my shoulder heart gettin colder im so cold
keep me a heater thats my toaster
in my coat you would nеver know
streets dont love you i dont eithеr
i dont need ya nonono
i pray on my knees and i stay strong
take care of my family i don wan die alone

chorus landon barker machine gun kelly

someone cut the lights off please
ive been kinda sad lately
i know that im good for you yeah
but you kinda bad baby mm
witches doin love chants brewin up the potion
i had a premonition i was overdosin so
someone cut the lights off please
i dont want you to look at me
i paint my nails black
if i ever look happy then its an act
every day is an anxiety attack
i wish i could take it back
to when i was drinkin water out the tap
with the cleveland logo printed on my hat
tell me was it my fear of bein complacent
that ended up leavin me so jaded
im miserable even though i made it
got a house in the hills and i fuckin hate it ayy

chorus landon barker young thug
killed the me i used to be

yeah i know i should probably let it go let it go
yeah i know i might die in california yeah die in california
verse 3 young thug

when i did ate her i made her sit up
i dont talk to a pillow
i dont walk rolls royce truck
tell all the ladies and ther babies go inside ah
