and keep loadin them guns

throwin up sets and snappin necks until the job is done

infamous just a mafia boss
nigga walk around with his head blown off
call me the wicked ass lord of farce
nigga run up get his ass ripped apart
infamous cold cause he got no heart
coming through the ho aint no motherfuckin bars
fall through the underground cut and scarred
foes be froze in a permanent dose
these bitches blow me outta their clothes
call me the nigga with the dirty nose
then i unload da 44 up them foes

better slow that row cause you hoes dont know
but the infamous know you
so and sos and toe and toe i take yo soul
