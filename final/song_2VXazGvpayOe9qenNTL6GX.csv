get back time to kick it off
so put your hair back honey take that sweater off
i said nows the time for you to check your heart
to keep from falling dead flat when the rhythm starts
get down time to kick it off
my bodys aching from emotion like my train of thought
i said slow down lady what you tryin to do
she said to feel your bpm go back to thirtytwo
she said

refrain
tell me what youre here for
tell me what youre here for
