my temple
my temple

verse 1
i wanna hear your heart beat
the steady humming your merkaba spin
everything even thoughts about me
when i wake up in the morning time
i think about my past life
was i with you or you with me
were living in a fantasy babe its all a dream
its kinda hard to see
you need the heart to see
you need the heart to see oh see

chorus
whats going down in your town i
im riding round in the night
my body is moving im tryna get groovin yeah
whats going down in your head i
im riding round in the night
im tryna get groovin lets go to the beach and jump in

verse 2
oh they trusted her and she tried to be
everything that they want her to
but she had to see what she could do
and all the things that she would also
tell me one thing
is it really bad to have experience
then you know for yourself
rather than sit home and believe in this
they said willow dont touch that
i looked and walked and then i went and touched it
they said dont walk fast
i took off running and was not near stopping

whats going down in your town i
im riding round in the night
my body is moving im tryna get groovin yeah
whats going down in your town i
im riding round
im gonna go baby the frequency
you wanna roll with me

bridge
broken
two shards that fit together
hoping
more come together
to make a piece of art
bigger than anything we could imagine
to make a piece of art
thats raising the whole vibration of gaia
going right back to the ropes

chorus
whats going down in your town i
im riding round in the night
my body is moving im tryna get groovin yeah3embed"
