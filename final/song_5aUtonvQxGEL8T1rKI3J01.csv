dont turn away
i pray youve heard
the words ive spoken
dare to believe
oh for one last time

chorus
and then ill let
the darkness cover me
deny everything
slowly walk away
to breathe again
on my own

verse 2
carry me away
i need your strength
to get me through this
dare to believe
oh for one last time

chorus
and then ill let
the darkness cover me
deny everything
slowly walk away
to breathe again
