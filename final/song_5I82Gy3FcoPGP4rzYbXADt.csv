the imitation picks you up like a habit
writing in the glow of the tvs static
taking out the trash to the man
give the people something theyd understand
a stick man flashing a finelined smile
junk bond trader trying to sell a sucker a stock
rich man in a poor mans clothes
the permanent installment of the daily dose

verse 2
and you tell off when you tell it like it is
your worlds no wider than your hatred of his
checking into a small reality
boring as a drug you take too regularly
the athletes laugh the broken crutch
the first true love that folded at the slightest touch
brought down like an old hotel
people digging through the rubble for things they can resell

bridge
happy holidays sad sick savior
the leaving lover that i still favor
i wont take your medicine
i dont need a remedy
to be everything im supposed to be
i dont want nobody else
i can do it by myself
were meant to be together

now im a policeman directing traffic
keeping everything moving everything static
im a hitchhiker youll recognize passing
on your way to some everlasting

outro
better sell it while you can
better sell it while you can
better sell it while you can
better sell it while you can5embed"
