red light traffic standing still
keeping me from you
tough days always in this town but this one will soon be through
cause right around the bend on the porch there by the drive
theres an angel out there waiting to bring me back to life
she always saves me from all of my crazy

chorus
like a heads up penny lying on the ground shell be shining
yeah with every little laugh and look she gets me believing
there aint a worry in my world that wont stop fading
when shes next to me
so i need to be on my way

verse 2
red to green and finally im moving again
faster than this backbone should be traveling
up ahead i see her hand waiving in the air
faded cut back denim and tangled auburn hair
she opens up the door
all i want and more

chorus
like a heads up penny lying on the ground shell be shining
yeah with every little laugh and look she gets me believing
there aint a worry in my world that wont stop fading
when shes next to me
so i need to be on my way
see eli young band liveget tickets as low as 44you might also likebridge
she cant sit still for the thrill of the night thats coming on
its only a matter of time until my troubles are gone

chorus
like a heads up penny lying on the ground shell be shining
yeah with every little laugh and look she gets me believing
there aint a worry in my world that wont stop fading
when shes next to me
so i need to be on my wayembed"
