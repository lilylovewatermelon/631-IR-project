a squirrel in the tree is he watching me
does he give a damn
does he care who i am
im just a man is that all i am
are my manners misinterpreted words or only human
im human

verse 2
murderous crow hey what you know
what you reading about what you hold in your toes
is that a twig are you a dove of peace
a black dove undercover with another puzzle piece
are you a riddle to solve all along
or am i over thinking thoughts of human after all

verse 3
only human
made of flesh made of sand made of human
the planets talking about a revolution
the natural laws aint got no constitution
theyve got a right to live their own life
but we keep paving over paradise

chorus
cause were only human
yes we are only human
if its our only excuse do you think well keep on being only human
yes we are yes we are
only human only human only human
so far

up in the majors tree the one he planted back when he was just a boy
back in 1923
thirty meters and a foot take a look take a climb
what youll find is the product of a seed
the seed is sown all alone
it grows above with a heart of love
sharp and shelter of the animals of land and cold weather breathing
were all breathing in

verse 5
the planets talking about a revolution
the natural laws aint got no constitution
theyve got a right to live their own life
but we keep paving over paradise

chorus
cause were only human
yes we are only human
if its our only excuse do you think well keep on being only human
yes we are yes we are
only human only human only human
so far

verse 6
and this place it will outlive me
before i get to heaven ill climb that tree
and i will have to give my thanks
for giving me the branch to swing on
if i ever fall in love
ill have to give myself a baby
i will let my children have their way
outro
cause were only human yes we are
only human so far so farembed"
