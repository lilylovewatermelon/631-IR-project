i really cant stay baby its cold outside
ive got to go away baby its cold outside
this evening has been so very nice been hoping that youd drop by
ill hold your hands theyre just like ice
my mother will start to worry beautiful whats your hurry
my father will be pacing the floor listen to the fireplace roar
so really id better scurry beautiful please dont hurry
oh maybe just a half a drink more put some records on while i pour
the neighbors might think oh its bad out there
say whats in this drink no cabs to be had out there
i wish i knew how to break the spell your eyes are like starlight now
ill take your hat your hair looks swell
i ought to say no no no sir mind if i move a little closer
at least im gonna say that i tried whats the use in hurting my pride
i really cant stay baby dont hold out
oh but its cold outside oh but its cold outside

piano solo

verse 2 kelly clarkson  ronnie dunn
i simply must go baby its cold outside
the answer is no baby its cold outside
your welcome has been so nice and warm baby its cold outside
look out the window at that storm
my sister will be suspicious gosh your lips look delicious
my brother will be there at the door waves upon a tropical shore
my maiden aunts mind is vicious your lips are delicious
well maybe just a cigarette more never such a blizzard before
ive got to get home baby youll freeze out there
say lend me your coat its up to your knees out there
youve really been grand im thrilled when you touch my hand
but dont you see how can you do this to me
theres bound to be talk tomorrow think about my life long sorrow
at least therell be plenty advised if you caught pneumonia and died
i really cant stay get over that old out
but its cold outside but its cold outsidesee kelly clarkson liveget tickets as low as 275you might also likeembed"
