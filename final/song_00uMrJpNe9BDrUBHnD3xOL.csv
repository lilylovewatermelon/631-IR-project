im feelin empty and misunderstood
i should be thankful lord i know i should
but lord i hope this day is good

lord have you forgotten me
i been prayin to you faithfully
i should be thankful lord you know i am
but lord i hope you understand

i dont need fortune and i dont need fame
send down the thunder lord send down the rain
but when youre plannin just how it will be
plan a good day for me

lord i hope this day is good
im feelin empty and misunderstood
i should be thankful lord i know i should
but lord i hope this day is good

youve been the king since the dawn of time
all that im askin is a little less crime
it might be hard for the devil to do
but it would be easy for you

lord i hope this day is good
im feelin empty and misunderstood
i should be thankful lord i know i should
but lord i hope this day is goodsee lee ann womack liveget tickets as low as 25you might also likeembed"
