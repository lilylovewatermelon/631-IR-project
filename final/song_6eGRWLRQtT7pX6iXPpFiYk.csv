verse 2
the circumcision has already begun
desensitizing the very thing or thang
that brought you into this motherfucker in the first place
and when i say motherfucker i do mean motherfucker
because mother earth is dying
and we continue to fuck her to death
play with your own score sheet
become the master of your own bation
and yes god is watching you
but no need to be embarrassed
for the future is in your hands
no the future is in your hand
play with your own score sheet
