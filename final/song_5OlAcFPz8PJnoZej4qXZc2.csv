girl whatcha talking bout i aint believing this
i aint settling for none of this foolishness
we cant let a sure thing drown in a puddle of doubt
its just some rocky road but weve got solid ground
its just a little bump we can work around
weve got a lifetime ahead so dont go quitting me now

chorus
come on baby were still together
this aint as good as its gonna get
i swore id love you til the end of forever
and forever hasnt got here yet

verse 2
does it matter girl whos really right or wrong
this aint the kinda thing we should sleep on
i say we start it all over tonight with a kiss
so slide over here mamma its gonna be alright
lets write it off as just another angry night
i like it better when were making up like this

chorus
come on baby were still together
this aint as good as its gonna get
i swore id love you til the end of forever
and forever hasnt got here yet
you might also likecome on baby were still together
this aint as good as its gonna get
i swore id love you til the end of forever
and forever hasnt got here yet

outro
ill still love you till the end of forever
and forever hasnt got here yet
no it hasnt got here yetembed"
