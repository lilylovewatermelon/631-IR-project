fell in love with a girl from pr kept up online like pr
had me waitin like a dr stretch her out in her room like er
i stumbled on your page got liquor in my thumbs i see you followin my path my thought and actions left crumbs

i thought that i left you in atlanta
i thought that id never see you busy
i thought that without me youd go down
i thought that youd never leave the city

chorus
im comin back to you back to you
im comin back to you back to you
im comin back to you back to you
im comin back to you back to you
and i know that i shouldnt and i wouldnt if i could
and you know that this drink got me talkin late night callin yeah

out of state got a couple shows gettin money
hotel room with a ten and twenties
scoop her uber tryna manoeuvre tryna test me but i studied
got a little bit a hesitance keep one eye on you like a wink
sunset boulevard moonlight tint off the sauce like ooo i slipped

i thought that id never see you busy
i thought that without me you would go down
i thought that youd never leave the city

chorus
