its the boy you never told i like you
its the girl you let get away
its the one you saw that day on the train
but you freaked out and walked away
its the plane you wanna catch to vegas
things you swear youll do before you die
its the city of love that waits for you
but youre too damn scared to fly

chorus
hit the lights
let the music move you
lose yourself tonight
come alive
let the moment take you
lose control tonight
hit the lights
let the music move you
lose yourself tonight
come alive
let the moment take you
lose control tonight

verse 2
its the time that you totally screwed up
still youre tryna get it out your brain
its the fight you had when you didnt make up
its the past that youre dying to change
its all the money that youre savin
while the good life passes by
its all the dreams that never came true
cause youre too damn scared to try
