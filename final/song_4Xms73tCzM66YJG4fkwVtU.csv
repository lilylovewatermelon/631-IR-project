you’re out there
i hear you calling from behind
the star fields
i feel you
radiating energy like
eternal northern lights

prechorus
far from the sun
where no one knows
i’ve watched you from
my telescope

chorus
i will travel
the distance in your eyes
interstellar
light years from you
supernova
we’ll fuse when we collide
awaking in the light
of all the stars aligned

verse 2
i see you
washing over me across the sky
overcoming
projected
on my eyes eternally
i find you in the night
you might also likeprechorus
far from the sun
where no one knows
i’ve watched you from
my telescope

chorus
i will travel
the distance in your eyes
interstellar
light years from you
supernova
we’ll fuse when we collide
awaking in the light
of all the stars aligned

bridge
i will find you
i will find you
i will find you
i will find you

chorus
i will travel
the distance in your eyes
interstellar
light years from you
supernova
we’ll fuse when we collide
awaking in the light
of all the stars aligned8embed"
