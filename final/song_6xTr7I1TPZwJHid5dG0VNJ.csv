just off of the twolane where the school bus used to stop
was a little wooden aframe with a yellow tin roof top
one day it was raining on this world
she said ‘have you ever really really ever kissed a girl’

chorus
baby i’ll be your huckleberry you don’t have to double dare me
if the storm gets wild and scary count on me to be right there
you’re so extra ordinary sweet like maraschino cherries
we’ll grow up and we’ll get married
i’m going to be your huckleberry

verse 2
later on that summer we went to the county fair
they had a brand new roller coaster and everyone was scared
it was two bucks to experience the thrill
she said ‘come on boy let’s get in line i’ll ride it if you will’

chorus
baby i’ll be your huckleberry you don’t have to double dare me
if the storm gets wild and scary count on me to be right there
you’re so extra ordinary sweet like maraschino cherries
we’ll grow up and we’ll get married
i’m going to be your huckleberry

snuck off on a slow dance at the juniorsenior prom
went looking for some romance before i had to get her home
steaming up the windows of my car
she said ‘until i get my wedding ring boy we can’t go that far’

chorus
baby i’ll be your huckleberry you don’t have to double dare me
if the world gets wild and scary count on me to be right there
you’re so extra ordinary sweet like maraschino cherries
we grew up and we got married
now look at those three little huckleberriesembed"
