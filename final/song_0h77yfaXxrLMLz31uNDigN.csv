make it work
make it easy
make it clever craft it into pieces
make it sweet
crimp the edges
or make it sour and serve with lemon wedges
even doubt
can be delicious
and it washes off of all the dirty dishes
when its done
i can smile
its on someone elses plate for a while

ill place it on display
and then ill slice and serve my worries away
i can fix this
i can twist it into sugar butter covered pieces
never mind whats underneath it
i have done it before
ill bake me a door to help me get through
i learned that from you
mama its amazing what baking can do

make it up
and surprise them
tell them all my secrets but disguise them
so they dance on the tongues
of the very people that theyre secrets from
make it soon
make it better
though better never lasts forever
ill make it small so it fits
you might also likeeven this
even now
even as the walls come tumbling down
even as i cant stop remembering how
every door we ever made we never once walked out
something i never got the chance to ask her about
so with flour on my hands
ill show them all how
goddamn happy i am
sugar butter flour
dont let me down
lets see the next amazing thing baking does nowembed"
