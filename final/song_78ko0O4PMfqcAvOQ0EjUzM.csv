you went into the kitchen cupboard
got yourself another hour
and gave half of it to me
we sat there looking at the faces
of the strangers in the pages
til we knew them mathematically

prechorus 1
they were in our minds until forever
but we didnt mind we didnt know better

verse 2
so we made our own computer
out of macaroni pieces
and it did our thinking while we lived our lives
it counted up our feelings
and divided them up even
and it called our calculation perfect love

prechorus 2
didnt even know that love was bigger
didnt even know that love was so so hey hey hey

chorus
hey this fire
its burning burning us up
hey this fire
its burning burning us up

so we made the hard decision
and we each made an incision
past our muscles and our bones
saw our hearts were little stones
pulled them out they werent beating
and we werent even bleeding
as we lay them on our granite counter top

prechorus 3
we beat them up against each other
we beat them up against each other
we struck them hard against each other
we struck them so hard so hard until they sparked

chorus
hey this fire
its burning burning us up
hey this fire
its burning burning us up
hey this fire
its burning burning us up
