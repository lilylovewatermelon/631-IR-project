wake me up inside
tell me theres a reason
to take another step
to get up off my knees and
follow this path of most resistance
and wherever it takes us
whatever it faces and wherever it leads

chorus
so wake me when its through
i dont want to feel the things that you do the things that you do
dont worry ill be fine
i just dont want this dream wake me up inside

verse 2
something for the pain just to kill this feeling
although we look awake inside were all still sleeping
ive spent my time here alive but barely there
do you believe well ever make it
do you think well ever really see

chorus
so wake me when its through
i dont want to feel the things that you do the things that you do
dont worry ill be fine
i just dont want this dream wake me up inside
you might also likebridge
wake me up inside
these dreams all die if we let them
wake me up inside
today wont start if we just give in
cause youll be anything

outro
just wake me when its through
i dont want to feel the things that you do the things that you do
dont worry ill be fine
i just dont want this dream wake me up inside1embed"
