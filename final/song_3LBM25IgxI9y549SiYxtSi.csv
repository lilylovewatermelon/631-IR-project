verse 1
up in your room once again tempted
bad for me its the truth but i cant miss this
dont tell my friends that im here to visit
dont tell my friends that im here mmmmmm yeah

prechorus
waiting for you even how you treat me
youre my baby even when you leave me
maybe im the one to blame
maybe im the cause of the pain
waiting for you even how you treat me
youre my baby even when you leave me
maybe im the problem and the one thats causing all of this

chorus
i cant say i love you no more more
cause my friends gon judge me for sure

you do me wrong but it feels right
feels like im stuck on you
