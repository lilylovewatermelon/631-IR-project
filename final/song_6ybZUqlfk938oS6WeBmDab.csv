verse
tried to call you on the telephone
i didnt make it past three rings
i tried to think of the perfect things to say
to you after the beep

well im sorry that im drunk
im sorry what i said
im sorry for anything i ever did
but you aint called back so
i guess ill get some sleep


prechorus
and im waiting patiently
but youre done and its plain to see
that i messed up too much
i guess ill cut my loss

chorus
and oh well im drunk as hell
guess its so long darling i wish you well
and ill take my goddamn phone and shut it off
well im just tired of being just another missed call

pretty glad you aint call me back
it would have only made things worse
i always try to get the last word in
when you didnt even like the first

now im begging baby please
youre begging me to leave
you dont want anything to do with me
and i guess you finally hit me where it hurts

prechorus
and im waiting patiently
but youre done and its plain to see
that i messed up too much
i guess ill cut my loss

chorus
and oh well im drunk as hell
guess its so long darling i wish you well
and ill take my goddamn phone and shut it off
well im just tired of being just another missed call

bridge
yeah im just another missed call
prechorus
well im done and its safe to say
i wont make it past three rings
im pretty done finding words to say
to you after the beep

and ive waited patiently
but youre done and its plain to see
that i messed up too much
i guess ill cut my loss

chorus
and oh well im drunk as hell
guess its so long darling i wish you well
and ill take my goddamn phone and shut it off

outro
well im just tired of being just another missed call
yeah im just another missed callembed"
