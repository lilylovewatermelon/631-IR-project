oh oh

prechorus
what i got you got to give it to your mamma
what i got youve got to give it to your pappa
what i got you got to give it to your daughter
you do a little dance and then you drink a little water
what i got you got to get it put it in you
what i got you got to get it put it in you
what i got you got to get it put it in you
reeling with the feeling dont stop continue
i realize i dont want to be a miser
confide with sly youll be the wiser
young blood is the lovin upriser
how come everybody wanna keep it like the kaiser

verse 1
greedy little people in a sea of distress
keep your more to receive your less
unimpressed by material excess
love is free love me say hell yes
low brow but i rock a little know how
no time for the piggies or the hoosegow
get smart get down with the pow wow

verse 2
lucky me swimming in my ability
dancing down on life with agility
come and drink it up from my fertility
blessed with a bucket of lucky mobility
my mom i love her cause she love me
long gone are the times when she scrub me
feelin good my brother gonna hug me
drinkin my juice young love chugalug me
ah theres a river born to be a giver
keep you warm wont let you shiver
his heart is a never gonna wither
come on everybody time to deliver
