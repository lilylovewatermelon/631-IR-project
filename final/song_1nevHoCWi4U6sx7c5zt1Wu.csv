cant afford to lose my head lose my head
cant afford to lose my cool
youll blow them all in kingdom come kingdom come
i cant afford to lose my tease i just aim to please

prechorus 1
feel like a hotel motel painting
out of place and ignored
its all medals and trophies trophies and medals
and all before the race has been run

chorus
oh take off your mask take it off now baby
is it too much to ask too much to ask
go on and give it a try give it up now
kiss your ass goodbye goodbye

verse 2
autobiographical anonymous anonymous
a cotillion of friction on my jurisdiction
its a lovely disguise with the wandering eyes wandering eyes
and i get high now youve got something to look up to

prechorus 2
troubles a mangy stray dog
play with it once then it follows you home
its all have not have none hey can i have some
until ive had enough yet ive had none
you might also likechorus
oh take off your mask rip it off now baby
lose it into the trash throw it all away
go on and give it a try throw it all away
kiss your ass goodbye

bridge
suddenly it gets easy the sun goes down
the long arm of important things disappears in her gown
you finally drop the knife
forget you ever heard its a good night
but that aint forever
it feels together in love
in your arms

guitar solo

outro 1
but still it hurts to be young
i know it hurts
it hurts to be young
metamorphosis is
it hurts to be young
gotta learn every goddamn thing
you gotta hack your way through
and realize its almost entirely lies
but then youll begin to smile
smile for me real
outro 2
when you accept what you are
the transformation is done
yeah youve become
absorbed into and you know
i think i know what to do1embed"
