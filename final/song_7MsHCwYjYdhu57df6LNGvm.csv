through the dirt and the gravel
through the years and the miles
every road that you traveled
through the tears and the smiles
through the clear and the muddy
through the thick and thin
the quiet nights the howling wind
through the good and the ugly
the blue and the black
to the ends of the earth
to the moon and back

verse 2
through all of the words
the mean and the kind
through the strings that unravel
and the ties that bind
from the crazy and the different
to the more of the same
from the coast is clear
to a hurricane
yeah ill be right beside you
on a roll or off the tracks
to the ends of the earth
to the moon and back
to the moon and back
see luke bryan liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likeverse 3
through the bitter and the sweet
the cold and the fire
lonely cotton sheets
and the burning desire
until our song is over
til the stars all fade to black
im gonna love you
to the ends of the earth
to the moon and back
yeah im gonna love you
all the way to the moon and back
to the moon and back1embed"
