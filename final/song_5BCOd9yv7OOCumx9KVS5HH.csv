been wound up tighter than a banjo string
price of gas groceries and all those things
they sound little till you add them all up
then you really feel the crunch
man ive had enough

chorus
i need to chill give it a rest
get down to the lake with a full ice chest
and chill and let a cold corona
lift this world right off my shoulders
lime in the water steak on the grill
i think its way past time for me to chill
just chill

verse 2
this morning 65 was a parking lot
bumper to bumper just start and stop
sometimes i think were like a bunch of rats
getting caught in our own traps
well i say to hell with that

chorus

verse 3
before we go to therapy and take another pill
we just need to chill give it a rest
lay down in a hammock and take a deep breath
and chill it dont cost a dime
to reel in your troubles and just unwind
cork in the water and time to kill
you cant tell me this arenâ€™t a great way to chill
just chill

man i need to chill
just chillembed"
