find yourself another girl
who will love you true true true
find yourself another girl
save her love and kisses just for you
save her love and kisses just for you

the very first time i fell in love got my heart broken then
people would say when i passed their way
theres a hurt young man going there going there
an unhappy lad going there

verse 2
well one day my mother called me to her side
said son why you so blue
mother i lost the girl that i love why wont you tell me what to do
mother wont you tell me what to do

and try and start anew
for if there was a guy for her
theres got to be a girl somewhere for you
got to be a girl somewhere for you

who will love you true true true
find yourself another girl
save all her love and kisses just for you
save all her love for nobody but you

ooh another love
save her love and kissses just for you
save all her love for nobody but youembed"
