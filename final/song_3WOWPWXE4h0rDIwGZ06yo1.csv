talk to me baby
tell me what youre feeling
you say you dont need to go
dont you pretend you didnt know
how all of this would end up
girl i saw it in your eyes
and baby i can read your mind
and expectations were not in sight
you knew that talking dirty to me on the phone
would get me here
cause we both wanted to do this
but i could tell that you were scared
cause you thought there was more to us
but you knew how this would end
its gonna end how you expected
girl youre such a masochist
and i ask why
and you reply
i like the thrill
nothings gonna make me feel this real
so baby dont go home
i dont wanna spend tonight alone
baby please
would you end your night with me
dont you leave me all behind
dont you leave my little life
dont you leave my little lie
