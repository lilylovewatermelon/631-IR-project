refrain
thirsty thirsty tryna choose
i mean i know im pretty cool
my nitty bag my kitty boost
i got the juice i got the juice

verse 1
chano chathams own
foolies glad im home
even my haters kinda glad im on
rest in peace to my vagabond
rapper song singer suspended subpoena
for misdemeanors dreamer
held back ass is lowkey still a senior
and i still shake up bo squad praying for my brobois
city on the come up shout that nigga sosa
shout my nigga fat trel shout my nigga joseph
playing buenos aires while they sleepin buenas noches
wonder if i wrote this cause its so crisp
the most brokest cold stockbroker winter solstice
i could win an oscar russian accent husky
acid addict costly avid actor kevin costner

chorus

verse 3
jugo you never tasted paper
tripped racing yaself tryna chase the paper
i just faced a veger
and you love being kobe when you make the layer
til you realize everybody in the world fuckin hates the lakers
and then everybody wanna sip
til the juice spill everybody wanna bib
and then everybody wanna dip
told you i aint worried i aint scared of the booth
all you can do is spit a verse of the truth
merge the mixture with the purest of fruits
and the thirst is the worst its the curse of the juice

chorus
juice juice juice juice
i got the juice i got the juice yup
juice juice juice juice
i got the juice i got the juice yup

refrain
thirsty thirsty tryna choose
i mean i know im pretty cool
my nitty bag my kitty boost
