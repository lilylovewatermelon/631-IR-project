will the faithful be rewarded
when we come to the end
will i miss the final warning
from the lie that i have lived
is there anybody calling
i can see the soul within
and i am not worthy
i am not worthy of this

prechorus
are you with me after all
why cant i hear you
are you with me through it all
then why cant i feel you

chorus
stay with me dont let me go
because theres nothing left at all
stay with me dont let me go
until the ashes of eden fall

verse 2
will the darkness fall upon me
when the air is growing thin
will the light begin to pull me
to its everlasting will
i can hear the voices haunting
there is nothing left to fear
and i am still calling
i am still calling to you

why cant i hear you
stay with me dont let me go
because theres nothing left at all

take my hand
stay with me dont let me go

heaven above me
take my hand
stay with me dont let me go
shine until theres nothing left but you22embed"
