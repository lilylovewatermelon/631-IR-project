old yellow bricks loves a risk
quite the little escapologist
looked so miffed when you wished
for a thousand places better than this
you are the fugitive but you dont know what youre running from
you cant kid us and you couldnt trick anyone
houdini love you dont know what youre running away from

chorus
who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up
blinded by nostalgia
who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up

verse 2
she was enraged by the way
that the emperors were trapped in the cage
and the days she deemed dull
leading to nights reading beer bottles
youre such a fugitive but you dont know what youre running from
you cant kid us and you couldnt trick anyone
houdini love you dont know what youre running away from

chorus
who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up
blinded by nostalgia
who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up
you might also likeverse 3
youre at a loss just because
it wasnt all that you thought it was
you are the fugitive but you dont know what youre running away from
she said i want to sleep in the city that never wakes up
and revel in nostalgia
i know i said who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up
but dorothy was right though59embed"
