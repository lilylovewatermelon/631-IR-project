a heart of stone a smoking gun
i can give you life i can take it away
a heart of stone a smoking gun
im working it out
whyd you feel so underrated
whyd you feel so negated

chorus
turning away from the light becoming adult
turning into myself
i wanted to bite not destroy to feel her underneath
turning into the light

verse 2
she dont think straight
no no no she dont think straight
shes got such a dirty mind and it never ever stops
and you dont taste like her and you never ever will
and we dont read the papers we dont read the news
heavens never enough we will never be fooled

chorus
turning away from the light becoming adult
turning into myself
i wanted to bite not destroy to feel her underneath
turning into the light

and if you feel and if you feel
a little left behind a little left behind
we will wait for you on the other side
and if you feel and if you feel
a little left behind a little left behind
we will wait for you on the other side

outro

cause im on fire
