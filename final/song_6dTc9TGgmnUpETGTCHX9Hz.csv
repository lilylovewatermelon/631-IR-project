i smile you laugh i look away
i sigh you ask me why i say
its okay and i am
just feeling down
your hand on mine i hear the words
if only love had found us first
our lives they would be
different oh

but that was not the plan oh

chorus
where would we be now baby if we found each other first
what would you do now darling if i said these simple words
ill wait ill wait as long as you want
but where would we be now baby

verse 2
and now i must confess
that i am a sinking ship
and im anchored by the weight of my heart
cause its filled with these feelings
but i keep my true thoughts locked
beside my hearts black box
and it wont be found it wont survive
through the smoke or the wreckage
you might also likeprechorus
so i crash and burn oh

chorus
where would we be now baby if we found each other first
what would you do now darling if i said these simple words
ill wait ill wait as long as you want
but where would we be now baby
