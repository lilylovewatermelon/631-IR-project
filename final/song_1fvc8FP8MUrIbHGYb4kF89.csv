in the south land theres a city
way down on the river
where the women are very pretty
and all the men deliver
they got music its always playin
start in the day time go all through the night
and when you hear that music playin
hear what im sayin make you feel alright

grab somebody come on down
bring your paintbrush were paintin the town
theres some sweetness goin around
dreams do come true in new orleansyou might also likeembed"
