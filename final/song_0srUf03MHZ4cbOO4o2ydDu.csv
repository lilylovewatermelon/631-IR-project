i
just wanted to believe
that maybe youd be good to me
im just misunderstood you see
you
never had a clue
all the days that i spent loving you
whom i supposed to give em to

prechorus
i let you in
again and again
so tell me baby

chorus
what could i do
what could i do
i thought you were an angel
and lost myself when i caught sight of you

verse 2
im
bidding you farewell
youd never stand a chance in hell
theyve got another clientele
youre
treadin at the shore
i bet youve never drowned before
in someone that youd do it for
you might also likeprechorus
i let you in
again and again
so tell me baby

chorus
what could i do
what could i do
i thought you were an angel
and lost myself when i caught sight of you3embed"
