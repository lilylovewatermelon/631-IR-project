verse 1
we couldnt turn around til we were upside down
ill be the bad guy now but know i aint too proud
i  couldnt be there even when i tried
you  dont believe it we do this every time

chorus
seasons change and our love went cold
feed  the flame cause we cant let go
run away but were running in circles
run away run away
i dare you to do something
im  waiting on you again so i dont take the blame
run away but were running in circles
run away run away run away

verse 2
let go i got a feeling that its time to let go
i said so i knew that this was doomed from the getgo
you thought that it was special special
but it was just the sex though the sex though
and i still hear the echoes the echoes
i got a feeling that its time to let it go let it go

seasons change and our love went cold
feed the flame cause we cant let go
run away but were running in circles
run away run away
i dare you to do something
im waiting on you again so i dont take the blame
run away but were running in circles
run away run away run away

bridge
maybe you dont understand what im going through
its only me what you got to lose
make up your mind tell me what are you gonna do
its only me let it go

chorus
seasons change and our love went cold
feed the flame cause we cant let go
run away but were running in circles
run away run away
i dare you to do something
im waiting on you again so i dont take the blame
run away but were running in circles
run away run away run away211embed"
