verse 1
uh yeah
light up til the pain gone gone all i hear is the same song song
when the radio came on fuck around and get based on bitch
do this shit til the day i die die are you ready ready are you ready no
terrified but my hand is steady steady verified get the camera ready click
carry my own weight all these earthquakes dont wake
me up from this deep sleep sleep divin into this cold lake brr
fuck a bitch til her toes shake shake tellin me im her soulmate mate
disguised emotion no face bullshit with that no thanks uhhuh
dealin with it since 08 no fucked around now im done
and i heard youre supposed to race when you hear the sound of that gun blaow
now its losin all of its fun fun spendin days in solitude
too many dumb interviews put me in this awful mood
not thinkin logical no gettin high jump off the moon moon
looked into his soul when he died right there in the hospital
peace dont seem possible no when the mind is so closed closed
came in for your money ha then left with all of your hoes ha

life move fast but my baby keep it slow
open up your mind start forgettin what you know oh
shit aint been the same since she left me here alone woah
you hurt so good
girl your lovin hurt so good uh

verse 2
love me love me that fentanyl it numb me numb
beautiful it get ugly turn you into a junkie what
still searchin for something who but i dont know what what
dreaming about nothing wake you up and then fuck fuck
i love it when you get a little nasty uhhuh
hit it from the back if you like that wiggle them ass cheeks blaow
isnt that sweet same shit we did last week uhhuh
fore all the cash you mightve stood up and wouldve walked past me bye
wake me up from this bad dream dream put a match to this gasoline line
every night you somebody different got me thinkin its halloween
fucked up cant feel myself work hard might kill myself
exist through audio but all my problems as real as hell
trapped in this wishin well death creepin like splinter cell
gettin high blew my mind away find the words what im tryna say
ima think of that later later
when the world goes against you you better get that paper paper

chorus
life move fast but my baby keep it slow
open up your mind start forgettin what you know oh
this shit aint been the same since she left me here alone woah
you hurt so good
girl your lovin hurt so good
outro
you hurt so good
you hurt so good67embed"
