verse 1
i let it fall my heart
and as it fell you rose to claim it
it was dark and i was over
until you kissed my lips and you saved me
my hands they were strong
but my knees were far too weak
to stand in your arms
without falling to your feet

prechorus
but theres a side to you
that i never knew never knew
all the things youd say
they were never true never true
and the games youd play
you would always win always win

chorus
but i set fire to the rain
watched it pour as i touched your face
well it burned while i cried
cause i heard it screamin out your name
your name

when i lay with you
i could stay there close my eyes
feel you here forever
you and me together nothing is better

prechorus
cause theres a side to you
that i never knew never knew
all the things youd say
they were never true never true
and the games youd play
you would always win always win

chorus
but i set fire to the rain
watched it pour as i touched your face
well it burned while i cried
cause i heard it screamin out your name
your name
i set fire to the rain
and i threw us into the flames
when we fell somethin died
cause i knew that that was the last time
the last time
bridge
sometimes i wake up by the door
that heart you caught must be waitin for you
even now when were already over
i cant help myself from lookin for you

chorus
i set fire to the rain
watched it pour as i touched your face
well it burned while i cried
cause i heard it screamin out your name
your name
i set fire to the rain
and i threw us into the flames
when we fell somethin died
cause i knew that that was the last time
the last time
