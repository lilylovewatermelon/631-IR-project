i got a chopper i got a chopper
aint helicopter
i got some problems i got some problems
drugs are my solvent now im dissolving
all of these bitches all of these bitches
gonna end up in ditches
fuck with my emotions
legs are spreadin open
keep your pussy ho and keep your attitude
imma keep countin this cash
money so long imma change up my latitude
all of these drugs know my gratitude
all of these drugs know my gratitude
face a whole blunt bitch thats how i go ghost
turn into smoke perfect for hoes
burnin gas all alone im never leavin home
burnin gas all alone im never leavin home

verse 2 lick loth
asleep on the couch cigarette in my mouth
drugs in my house
im lookin for peace but im scattered beneath whats under my sheets
got them bottles on the table codeine on the label
my life is far from stable
take the gun then i disable
thats one in my temple with no hesitation
dont fuck with them bitches with love situations
fixated on dope narcotics my salvation
im tryna get higher and higher and higher
so high that i rise up and reach levitationsee uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also like15embed"
