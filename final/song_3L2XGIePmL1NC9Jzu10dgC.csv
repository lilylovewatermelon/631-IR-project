do you wanna be
my love my sight
my heart and my eyes
my world my pride
my stars in my sky
i am looking for a queen whos more than gorgeous on a movie screen
i am looking for the cover girl of dignified beauty magazine
i want dimples and simple symbols that shes sweet
wrinkles on her nose expose what i mean
i am looking for a fourcourse meal that isnt based in base desire
i am looking for a lady who knows the soul is more than an appetizer

prechorus
oh just one more thing yeah
oh just one more thing no

chorus
do we fit in the pocket
can we fit sit back in the pocket
when the dreams and the drums start rocking
can we dance with our knees not knocking not knocking no
see i i want a lady i can put stock in
i want a bass and back beat to lock in
i wanna know real loves not forgotten not forgotten

i want a teacher whos eager to speak her mind
delicate features sweet with her tongue so kind
i am looking for the markers that say permanent so we can share
i am looking for a love thats still alive and well in rocking chairs
i want faithful and stable able to grow
beauty that moves me improves my soul
i am looking for a shining light who likes to fight and persevere
i am looking for a lady who wants to make me part of her atmosphere

prechorus
oh just one more thing
oh just one more thing no

chorus
do we fit in the pocket
can we fit sit back in the pocket
when the dreams and the drums start rocking
can we dance with our knees not knocking not knocking no
see i i want a lady i can put stock in
i want a bass and back beat to lock in
i wanna know real loves not forgotten not forgotten

bridge
said all i need to know is
all i need to know is
all i need to know is
are you clear on who you are
do you love it
when this world starts getting hard
will you rise above it rise above it
chorus
in the pocket
can we fit sit back in the pocket
when the dreams and the drums start rocking
can we dance with our knees not knocking not knocking no
see i i want a lady i can put stock in
i want a bass and back beat to lock in
i wanna know real loves not forgotten not forgotten
i said the pocket
can we fit sit back in the pocket
when the dreams and the drums start rocking
can we dance with our knees not knocking not knocking no
see i i want a lady i can put stock in
i want a bass and back beat to lock in
i wanna know real loves not forgotten not forgotten
