a soft sound
into the way that she wears her hair down
covering up her face
and oh what a letdown
and i dont seem to be having any effect now
falling all over the place

prechorus
but youre losing your words
were speaking in bodies
avoiding me and talking bout you
and youre losing your turn
i guess ill never learn
cause i stay another hour or two

chorus
for crying out loud settle down
you know i cant be found with you
we get back to my house
your hands my mouth
now i just stop myself around you

verse 2
a small town
dictating all the people we get around
what a familiar face
do you get what i mean now
im so fixated on the girl with the soft sound
and hair all over the place

and youre sure that id learn
im pushing through bodies
avoiding me and walking round you
and youre cold and i burn
i guess ill never learn
cause i stay another hour or two

chorus
for crying out loud settle down
you know i cant be found with you you
and we get back to my house
your hands my mouth
now i just stop myself around you

a soft sound
into the way that she wears her hair down
covering up her face
and oh what a letdown down
i dont seem to be having any effect now
