where were you when the world stopped turning on that september day
were you in the yard with your wife and children
or working on some stage in la
did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
rising against that blue sky
did you shout out in anger in fear for your neighbor
or did you just sit down and cry

verse 2
did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
and pray for the ones who dont know
did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
and sob for the ones left below
did you burst out with pride for the red white and blue
and the heroes who died just doing what they do
did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
and look at yourself and what really matters

chorus
im just a singer of simple songs
im not a real political man
i watch cnn but im not sure i can tell
you the difference in iraq and iran
but i know jesus and i talk to god
and i remember this from when i was young
faith hope and love are some good things he gave us
and the greatest is love

where were you when the world stopped turning on that september day
were you teaching a class full of innocent children
or driving down some cold interstate
did you feel guilty because youre a survivor
in a crowded room did you feel alone
did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her
did you dust off that bible at home

verse 4
did you open your eyes hope it never happened
close your eyes and not go to sleep
did you notice the sunset the first time in ages
or speak to some stranger on the street
did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
or go out and buy you a gun
did you turn off that violent old movie youre watching
and turn on i love lucy reruns

bridge
did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers
did you stand in line and give your own blood
did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
thank god you had somebody to love

chorus
im just a singer of simple songs
im not a real political man
i watch cnn but im not sure i can tell
you the difference in iraq and iran
but i know jesus and i talk to god
and i remember this from when i was young
