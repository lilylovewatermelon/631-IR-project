yeah yeah

chorus
now that im gettin new money i aint worried bout no old hoes
these bitches get the dial tone ive been gettin used to my ringtone
these bitches wanna sing along but i just wanna fuckin be alone
edgar allan poe in the catacombs live alone ima die alone woah woah
watch em all turn up to the roof just to see the damn ceilin fall
one false move and im endin ya sincerely kill em all
fuck your love lil bitch rather be alonе
you was just tryna get me out my zone

verse
complications i cant dеal with on the phone
my life fast as hell i might just pour a four
catch me in the twilight zone bitch im ghost
if she aint suckin dick first night then im gone
huh ufo im on space time you aint reppin gang you aint safe slime
play with your life ima flip a coin see you niggas on the flipside
gave the world my pain but ima mourn alone ima cry alone
ima live alone ima die alone blowin woods to the sky alone

bridge
gave the world my pain but ima mourn alone ima cry alone
ima live alone ima die alone blowin woods to the sky alone
gave the world my pain but ima mourn alone ima cry alone
ima live alone ima die alone blowin woods to the sky alone
