pack the bags
this time i am heading north
left the racks
i won’t need those where i’m going
count the stacks
dodging cops cause nobody here wants a bind
toke a pack
calling shots pretend all the while that you’re mine

chorus
and im always thinking of you
always thinking i could love you more
know im always thinking of you
always thinking i could love you more

verse 2
burn it all
burn it all fire light deep in my eyes
break the noose
heed the call
howling like one of our kind
these days read clearly
like a wolf in the snow
in some way i feel you near me
and darlin’ as long as you know
you might also likechorus
that i’m always thinking of you
always thinking i could love you more
know im always thinking of you
always thinking i could love you more

instrumental interlude

outro
know im always thinking of you
always thinking i could love you moreembed"
