when you walk my way
i feel a rush come over me
a sharp panic panic
its the things you say
that makes a rush come over me
it happens all the time
i never was too good at following rules na na
im better just pretending i was the fool

chorus
all day all night
i got the lights in my eyes
and im falling for you
keep cool stay tough
but thats never enough
and these are the lessons in love
all day all night
i got the lights in my eyes
and im falling for you
keep cool stay young
im just having my fun
with the lessons in love

verse 2
if i walk away
i feel a push inside of me
that wont let me leave
but what could i say
for you to feel whats inside of me
this happens all the time
i never was too good at following rules na na
im better just pretending i was the fool hear me out
