you knew me in my spiral
happiness tidal it comes and it goes
and i sank into the water
how i drifted farther away from the coast

prechorus
sometimes i get this feeling
i was breathing someone elses air
two thousand miles away from home
under that sky i tried to make my peace with fear

chorus
so i guess ill build a boat and live alone
lord ill be the lost one oh oh
oh ill teach myself to swim and live in my head
and make sense of all my thoughts
and if i never reach the land or live again
lord ill be just fine oh oh
yeah ill drift until im dead and until then
ill be the lost one ill be the lost one

verse 2
i fell into a pattern
where nothing would matter if i didnt care
to be so close to a coastline
to know that in my life id never be there

sometimes i get this feeling
ive been breathing someone elses air

chorus
so i guess ill build a boat and live alone
lord ill be the lost one oh oh
oh ill teach myself to swim and live in my head
and make sense of all my thoughts
and if i never reach the land or live again
lord ill be just fine oh oh
yeah ill drift until im dead and until then
ill be the lost one ill be the lost one

bridge
and it wears me out
all the demons underneath the tide
but i sink like stone
below the weight of all these dreams of mine
and i wish you well
you cant save someone too far to find
but its wearing me out
and its stormy in the sea tonight in the sea tonight

chorus
so i guess ill build a boat and live alone
lord ill be the lost one oh oh
oh ill teach myself to swim and live in my head
and make sense of all my thoughts
and if i never reach the land or live again
lord ill be just fine oh oh
yeah ill drift until im dead and until then
ill be the lost one ill be the lost oneembed"
