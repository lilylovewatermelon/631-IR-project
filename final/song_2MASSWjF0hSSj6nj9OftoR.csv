verse 1
you may tire of me as our december sun is setting
cause im not who i used to be
no longer easy on the eyes
but these wrinkles masterfully disguise the youthful boy below
who turned your way and saw something he was not looking for
both a beginning and an end
but now he lives inside someone he does not recognize
when he catches his reflection on accident

verse 2
on the back of a motorbike
with your arms outstretched trying to take flight leaving everything behind
but even at our swiftest speed we couldnt break from the concrete
in the city where we still reside
and i have learned that even landlocked lovers yearn
for the sea like navy men
cause now we say goodnight from our own separate sides
like brothers on a hotel bed

bridge
like brothers on a hotel bed
like brothers on a hotel bed
like brothers on a hotel bed

you may tire of me as our december sun is setting
