but now youre gone
my love can be a dangerous drug
dont get attached
will you help me find my way back home
if i stare at the clock long enough will i have the time to tell you everything
time moves so fast in every direction
as soon as i turn over on my side pull the blankets up over my shoulders the suns creeping through the blinds
do you think if i stay long enough i can make you understand that i just need one kiss
but ill have more if you have some to spare

absorb me i want you to feel me in your bones
absorb me take me to the places that ill never know
absorb me i want you to feel me in your bones
absorb me take me to the places that ill never know
absorb me i want you to feel me in your bones
absorb me take me to the places that ill never know
absorb me i want you to feel me in your bones
absorb me take me to the places that ill never knowyou might also like1embed"
