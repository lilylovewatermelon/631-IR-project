the sun just slipped its note below my door
and i cant hide beneath my sheets
ive read the words before so now i know
the time has come again for me

chorus
and im feelin the same way all over again
feelin the same way all over again
singin the same lines all over again
no matter how much i pretend

verse 2
another day that i cant find my head
my feet dont look like theyre my own
ill try and find the floor below to stand
and i hope i reach it once again

chorus
and im feelin the same way all over again
feelin the same way all over again
singin the same lines all over again
no matter how much i pretend

verse 3
so many times i wonder where ive gone
and how i found my way back in
i look around awhile for something lost
maybe ill find it in the end
