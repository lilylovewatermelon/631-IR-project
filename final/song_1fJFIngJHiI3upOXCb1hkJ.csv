they say i was baptized in dirty water
by the hands of the devil himself
between the banks of a whiskey river
beside the highway to hell

i got scars on my heart and knuckles
i got debts that i aint pay
yeah but i got a blessing that was sent down from heaven
baby youre my saving grace

chorus
girl youve got an outlaw ready to lay down all my guns
a dirty old hound dog learning new tricks like cuddling up
youve got a hellcat purring like a kitten
youve got a sinner down on his knees
it had to be hell on an angel
loving the devil out of me

verse 2
tell me how did you get under this leather skin i wear
beneath the callouses and tattoos around the walls i built down there
to this heart ive long kept guarded all alone i was free to fly
but it takes an angel to fly with a free bird
baby weve got the sky

it had to be hell on an angel
loving the devil out of me

hell on an angel
come on boys

chorus
girl youve got an outlaw ready to lay down all my guns
a dirty old hound dog learning new tricks like cuddling up
youve got a hellcat purring like a kitten
youve got a sinner down on his knees
it had to be hell on an angel
