one two three four

verse 1
i choose me and i know thats selfish love
you are a dream and i cant thank you enough
but i give another piece of me away
every wakin day that im with you
am i a monster what will your family think of me
they brought me in they helped me out with everything
but i give a little piece of me away
every single day

chorus
so i pick up the pieces i get on the midnight train
i got my reasons but darlin i cant explain
ill always love you
but tonights the night i choose to walk away
bahbah doo bahbah doo
bahbah doo bahbah doo

verse 2
love you so much that i have to let you go
ill miss your touch and the secrets we both know
but it would be wrong for me to stay
and ill just give you hope

so i pick up the pieces i get on the midnight train
i got my reasons but darlin i cant explain
ill always love you
but tonights the night i choose to walk away
i cant stop cryin i hate that ive caused you pain
but i cant deny it i just dont feel the same
ill always love you
but tonights the night i choose to walk away
bahbah doo bahbah doo
bahbah doo bahbah doo
so i pick up the pieces i get on the midnight train
i got my reasons but darlin i cant explain
ill always love you
