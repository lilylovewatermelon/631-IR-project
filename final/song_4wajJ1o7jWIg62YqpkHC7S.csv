in the deepest ocean
the bottom of the sea
your eyes
they turn me
why should i stay here
why should i stay

verse 2
id be crazy not to follow
follow where you lead
your eyes
they turn me
turn me into phantoms way out
i follow to the edge way out
of the earth way out
and fall off
yeah everybody leaves way out
if they get the chance way out
and this way out
is my chance

chorus
i get eaten by the worms
and weird fishes
picked over by the worms
and weird fishes
weird fishes
