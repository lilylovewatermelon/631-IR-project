shes got the kind of eyes you wanna get lost in
youre gonna look twice when she gets to walkin
in a honky tonk with them blue jeans on
shes a cold beer a whiskey shot a neon light
a strait song on the jukebox a dance all night
what a cowboy wants a neverdoyouwrong

chorus
nobody leaves a girl like that
nobody walks away and never looks back
youd have to be outta your mind
to tell somethin that good goodbye
nobody goes and breaks a heart of gold
once you get a girl like that you never let her go
take it from me nobody leaves a girl like that

verse 2
i was reckless and wild didnt think i was ready
couldnt settle me down so i fired up my chevy
i was stubborn and she was cryin
well she knew she couldnt stop me but she kept right on tryin

chorus
nobody leaves a girl like that
nobody walks away and never looks back
youd have to be outta your mind
to tell somethin that good goodbye
nobody goes and breaks a heart of gold
once you get a girl like that you never let her go
take it from me nobody leaves a girl like that
see jon pardi liveget tickets as low as 60you might also likebridge
shes the kind of girl that only comes around once
well she found somebody new and im goin crazy because

chorus
nobody leaves a girl like that
nobody walks away and never looks back
youd have to be outta your mind
to tell somethin that good goodbye
nobody goes and breaks a heart of gold
once you get a girl like that you never let her go
take it from me nobody leaves
nobody leaves a girl like that ah nah
