i cant see your star
i cant see your star
though i patiently waited bedside for the death of today
i cant see your star
the mechanical lights of lisbon frightened it away

chorus
and im alone now
me and all i stood for
were wandering now
all in parts and pieces swim lonely find your own way out

verse 2
i cant see your star
i cant see your star
how can the darkness feel so wrong

chorus
and im alone now
me and all i stood for
were wandering now
all in parts and pieces swim lonely find your own way out

bridge
so far away
its growing colder without your love
why cant you feel me calling your name
cant break the silence
its breaking me
all my fears turn to rage

and im alone now me
and all i stood for
were wandering now
all in parts and pieces swim lonely find your own way out

outro
and nothing worth fighting for
were wandering now
all in parts and pieces swim lonely
find your own way out3embed"
