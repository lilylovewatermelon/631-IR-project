chorus
bondin over drugs and pain dirty sprite share
my dawg was one of a kind i know your type rare
i know life is a bitch and she dont fight fair
how the fuck i wake up from a dream to a nightmare
left us behind you seen that light glare
i know you walkin up to heaven on them white stairs
why i cant just pull up to your crib and see you right there
nobody love you til you dead thats when they might care

verse 1
lets just be friends before we rush into a label
wanna know if you really fuck with me girl whats your angle
its only for the better if im tryna change you
lovin me aint easy if you leave i dont blame you
trauma got me fucked up so im mentally unstable
i got wrapped up in my emotions now im tangled
deep in my thoughts and overthinkin can get painful
watch how i move one wrong decision can be fatal
hidden messages conversations with my angels
just walk with me and youll see im tryna save you
most times im by myself im still confused from betrayal
from rags to riches shit still hard im just on phase two

verse 2
livin on his own and he runnin out of options now
cause he felt like he couldnt be hisself at his mama house
hittin licks missin school junior year he thought bout droppin out
him against the world 40 on him when he poppin out
on his dark road he just tryna find a proper route
hate the criticism he uses music to block it out
by his auntie he was molested as a baby boy
messed up his head it even changed the way he play with toys
up late night rappin and they told him to quit makin noise
stuck in his feelings he be spendin every day annoyed
he wanna stand over a nigga leave his face destroyed
he miss his hood now this something that he cant avoid
