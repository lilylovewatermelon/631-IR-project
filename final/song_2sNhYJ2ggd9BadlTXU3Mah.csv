bridge talib kweli
this is the music that you gotta feel
gave you the truth before i got a deal
no rabbit in a hat it aint no magic aint no copperfield
more like a panther huey newton bobby seale
word to the free lunch who knew what we would become
who would be defunct which rumours would be debunked
yeah this is the music that you gotta feel
yeah gave you the truth before i got a deal
no rabbit in a hat it aint no magic aint no copperfield
more like a panther huey newton bobby seale
word to the free lunch who knew what we would become
who would be defunct which rumours would be debunked

verse 3 talib kweli
used to be scared of all my fears
til i woke up from this nightmare
now what become of a dream deferred now until i leave this earth
the music make your speakers burst i always put my people first
its deep how when i speak they say im preaching like i lead a church
no proper opposition competition gonna need a nurse
my job as an artist is making miracles
to show you how to struggle poetic and make it lyrical
crystallize the thought to make it clear to you
and make the revolution irresistable

skit
now evolution wheres it all going is it coming to an end or it it just beginning
there was one fellow who knowd malibu quite well at a certain time in history
and i doubt if uh very few people are able to find these types of conditions again
due to crowds and controls and much bureaucracy
but there are other areas which are magnificent or treasures of this world
and for somebody with adventure and excitement in their lives and they have a lot of excitement and adventure
they can find this way of living9embed"
