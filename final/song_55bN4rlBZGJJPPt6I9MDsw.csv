shes as real as it gets and there aint no way around it
theres a road thats been through hell and shes been down it
shes been mistreated shes been lied to shes seen her share of trouble
but that girl shes the beauty in this trouble

chorus
cause she aint all about herself
she aint one to ask for help
shes that diamond that you find when youve been left behind
youre sifting through the rubble
yeah that girl shes the beauty in the struggle

verse 2
she carries a weight that most could never handle
picking up the pieces of a heart thats been dismantled
shes a good friend shes a fighter shes watched her whole world crumble
but that girl shes the beauty in the struggle

chorus
she aint all about herself
she aint one to ask for help
shes that diamond that you find when youve been left behind
youre sifting through the rubble
yeah that girl shes the beauty in the struggle

chorus
cause she aint all about herself

shes that diamond that you find when youve been left behind
youre sifting through that rubble
yeah that girl shes the beauty in the struggle
