life’s greatest questions have always been
who am i where did i come from
why am i here where am i going
you are about to see and hear
one of the most significant messages given to us from god
get down
get down

verse 1
im lying to myself and this daggers my excuse
im a pawn i should have paid up
and i left an hour late i was laid up
i must abuse myself
im against all that ive made up
set in stone the sun will come
and i hate the light
you know i hate the light

refrain
to me it looks so pretty burning

chorus
burn the sun
burn the light
take take take take take take it away
take my hand
take my life
take take take take take take it away

i must have caught something
in the heat of all these dances
im a worm with no more chances
and ive lost all doubt in a chemical romance
i cant stop itching over thoughts of tarnished hope
kinda funny lonely feeling im not in love
you know its not love

refrain
to me it looks so pretty burning

chorus
burn the sun
burn the light
take take take take take take it away
take my hand
take my life
take take take take take take it away
burn the sun
burn the light
take take take take take take it away
take my hand
take my life
take take take take take take it away
bridge
brothers and sisters im right here with you
‘cause everyones got one
a story to kill me
im so apathetic in my resentment
living loving knowing not
take my hand
take my hand
take my hand
take my hand
take my hand
take my hand
take my hand
take my hand
take my life
take my heart
take my mind
take my lungs
take my life

chorus
burn the sun
burn the light
take take take take take take it away
take my hand
take my life
take take take take take take it away
burn the sun
burn the light
take take take take take take it away
take my hand
take my life
take my life
take my life1embed"
