yeah

verse 1
look i just shed tears homie and no i aint too proud to admit it
just seen my father for the first time in a minute
when i say a minute i mean years man
damn a whale could have swam in them tears fam
cause as i left em i reflected on my younger days
when it was just me and my brother and my mother played
father ‘cause no other man bothered
not even my biological it never seemed logical
but i accepted it cause i aint know no better
thought i was brighter than a polo sweater
no pops was like martin with no coretta
so many things you could have told me
and saved me the trouble of letting my mistakes show me
i feel like you barely know me
and thats a shame ‘cause our last name is the same
that blood type flowing through our veins is the same
my mama left you and it may be that angers to blame
but thats no excuse only you and god know the truth
on why you only called monthly barely ever saw me
spend some summers with you and played with my cousin maury
maybe i should be telling you “fuck you” ‘cause you selfish
but i want a father so bad i cant help but

verse 2
yeah i never thought id see my mama on that shit man
its fucking with her body now she sick damn
i wanted a big house with a white picket fence and a pool
who would have ever thought that it would come to this man
quicksand is what this life feel like
that shit these rappers kick is nothing like real life
you made a milli off of serving hard white yeah right
my mama tell you what addicted to that pipe feel like

but temptation stays round
and if she strayed how could he ever know never know
and so she goes to the club on the weekend
a little freaking but them niggas holler but she never speakin
but tonight i see the devil creeping
