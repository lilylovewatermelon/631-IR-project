i woke up in my boots this morning
fell asleep in my boots last night
had a feeling that id run out of warnings
girl i couldnt have been more right

verse 1
my only suitcase its by the front door
that look on your face says you dont want me no more
theres no use in talking
this time you mean it
youre sending me walking
well what a convenience cause

chorus
i woke up in my boots this morning
fell asleep in my boots last night
had a feeling that id run out of warnings
girl i couldnt have been more right

postchorus
and i knew i wouldn’t have to take the time putting em back on when i’m sober
yeah i knew you’d be pissed off over me and i’d just be hungover
girl i knew i’d open my eyes in a house fit for a dog
knew i’d need em come the daylight so i didn’t even take em off nah
i woke up in my boots this morning

yeah we were past the point of fighting
thered be a curb you’d kick me to
i made it easy on me girl but i made it easier on you
cant hide the truth yeah we both knew that it was coming
so i woke up in my boots this morning
i woke up in my boots this morning

chorus
i woke up in my boots this morning
cause i went out and got drunk last night
had a feeling that id run out of warnings so i
said what the hell and kissed us goodbye

postchorus
and i knew i wouldn’t have to take the time putting em back on when im sober
