she told me that she loved me by the water fountain
she told me that she loved me and she didnt love him
and that was really lovely cause it was innocent
but now shes got a cup with something else in it
its getting kind of blurry at a quarter past ten
and he was in a hurry to be touching her skin
shes feeling kind of dirty when shes dancing with him
forgetting what she told me by the water fountain

prechorus
now hes grabbing her hips and pulling her in
kissing her lips and whispering in her ear
and she knows that she shouldnt listen
and that she should be with me by the water fountain

chorus
she couldnt be at home in the night time because
it made her feel alone but at that time she was too young
i was too young
i shouldve built a home with a fountain for us
the moment that she told me that she was in love
too young i was too young
too young too young too young young

verse 2
and if she ever goes back to the water fountain
the handle will be broken and the rust set in
but my hand it will be open and ill try to fix it
my heart it will be open and ill try to give it
