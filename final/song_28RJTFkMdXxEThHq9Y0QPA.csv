the hells of the world made of puppets and fake
death won’t be too far now the seeds in my heart start to awake
so all i can do is be the man that the lord brought me to today

hold on to your life by love and
then you’ll find what’s in and out of line
just hold on

they say you’ll find yourself one of these days
as if they know i’m lost and could never be saved
a gamble is what i’ll take
trading ashes for gold hoping life will give its sake
life is too short to stop and stare at the blank page that tells your way

hold on to your life by love and
then you’ll find what’s in and out of linesee phillip phillips liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likeembed"
