before you go can we just talk a moment
we shouldnt end it like this
can you just chill for a while
put your bags down just try to hear me out
i know that recently weve been fussing and fighting
and i know that youre tired of me
but if you leave this is how ill be
picture me

hook
picture me
down and out
lost without you
picture me
broken hearted
and so lost and alone

verse 2
you dont want to go
as much as i want you to stay
cause i built my whole life around you
and im not just about to let it all slip away
and what about the tears that weve shared
and all the things that we said
were they all just in vain
girl if you bounce on me
what i used to be is just a memory
this is how ill be

picture me
down and out
lost without you
picture me
broken hearted
and so lost and alone

verse 3
i know that i  up alright
and im sorry im really sorry
i mean but i got issues
you got issues every body got issues
were human ya mean
so what you want me to do about that
i mean cause
i can tell a bunch of lies
and make like everything is alright
but i know deep down inside that ill be
deceiving you and misleading you
and i dont want to so can we just try
try this one last time
lets give it one more chance
before you say goodbye

outro
can you picture me girl
not wanting to eat no more
not wanting to sleep no more
only wanna be with you
cause i need ya
i got to have youembed"
