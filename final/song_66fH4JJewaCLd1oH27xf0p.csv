and molly was right
my daughter maggie has shown me how life can be a grand adventure while exquisite moments with my granddaughter chiara have helped me recall a small childs wonder
my wife ellen listened while i read and cheered me to the final
page

i
my father and mother should have stayed in new york where they met and married and where i was born instead they returned to ireland when i was four my brother malachy three the twins oliver and eugene barely one and my sister margaret dead and gone
when i look back on my childhood i wonder how i survived at all it was of course a miserable childhood the happy childhood is hardly worth your while worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable irish childhood and worse yet is the miserable irish catholic childhood
people everywhere brag and whimper about the woes of their early years but nothing can compare with the irish version the poverty the shiftless loquacious alcoholic father the pious defeated mother moaning by the fire pompous priests bullying schoolmasters the english and the terrible things they did to us for eight hundred long years
above allwe were wet
out in the atlantic ocean great sheets of rain gathered to drift slowly up the river shannon and settle forever in limerick the rain dampened the city from the feast of the circumcision to new years eve
it created a cacophony of hacking coughs bronchial rattles asthmatic wheezes consumptive croaks it turned noses into fountains lungs into bacterial sponges it provoked cures galore to ease the catarrh you boiled onions in milk blackened with pepper for the congested passages you made a paste of boiled flour and nettles wrapped it in a rag and slapped it sizzling on the chest
from october to april the walls of limerick glistened with the damp clothes never dried tweed and woolen coats housed living things sometimes sprouted mysterious vegetations in pubs steam rose from damp bodies and garments to be inhaled with cigarette and pipe smoke laced with the stale fumes of spilled stout and whiskey and tinged with the odor of piss wafting in from the outdoor jakes where many a man puked up his weeks wages
the rain drove us into the churchour refuge our strength our only dry place at mass benediction novenas we huddled in great damp clumps dozing through priest drone while steam rose again from our clothes to mingle with the sweetness of incense flowers and candles
limerick gained a reputation for piety but we knew it was only the
rain
my father malachy mccourt was born on a farm in toome county
antrim like his father before he grew up wild in trouble with the english or the irish or both he fought with the old ira and for some desperate act he wound up a fugitive with a price on his head
when i was a child i would look at my father the thinning hair the collapsing teeth and wonder why anyone would give money for a head like that when i was thirteen my fathers mother told me a secret as a wee lad your poor father was dropped on his head it was an accident he was never the same after and you must remember that people dropped on their heads can be a bit peculiar
because of the price on the head he had been dropped on he had to be spirited out of ireland via cargo ship from galway in new york with prohibition in full swing he thought he had died and gone to hell for his sins then he discovered speakeasies and he rejoiced
after wandering and drinking in america and england he yearned for peace in his declining years he returned to belfast which erupted all around him he said a pox on all their houses and chatted with the ladies of andersontown they tempted him with delicacies but he waved them away and drank his tea he no longer smoked or touched alcohol so what was the use it was time to go and he died in the royal victoria hospital
my mother the former angela sheehan grew up in a limerick slum with her mother two brothers thomas and patrick and a sister agnes she never saw her father who had run off to australia weeks before her birth
after a night of drinking porter in the pubs of limerick he staggers down the lane singing his favorite song who threw the overalls in mrs murphys chowder
nobody spoke so he said it all the louder its a dirty irish trick and i can lick the mick who threw the overalls in murphys chowder
hes in great form altogether and he thinks hell play a while with little patrick one year old lovely little fella loves his daddy laughs when daddy throws him up in the air upsy daisy little paddy upsy daisy up in the air in the dark so dark oh jasus you miss the child on the way down and poor little patrick lands on his head gurgles
a bit whimpers goes quiet grandma heaves herself from the bed heavy with the child in her belly my mother shes barely able to lift little patrick from the floor she moans a long moan over the child and turns on grandpa get out of it out if you stay here a minute longer ill take the hatchet to you you drunken lunatic by jesus ill swing at the end of a rope for you get out
grandpa stands his ground like a man i have a right he says to stay in me own house
she runs at him and he melts before this whirling dervish with a damaged child in her arms and a healthy one stirring inside he stumbles from the house up the lane and doesnt stop till he reaches melbourne in australia
little pat my uncle was never the same after he grew up soft in the head with a left leg that went one way his body the other he never learned to read or write but god blessed him in another way when he started to sell newspapers at the age of eight he could count money better than the chancellor of the exchequer himself no one knew why he was called ab sheehan the abbot but all limerick loved him
my mothers troubles began the night she was born there is my grandmother in the bed heaving and gasping with the labor pains praying to st gerard majella patron saint of expectant mothers there is nurse ohalloran the midwife all dressed up in her finery its new years eve and mrs ohalloran is anxious for this child to be born so that she can rush off to the parties and celebrations she tells my grandmother will you push will you push jesus mary and holy st joseph if you dont hurry with this child it wont be born till the new year and what good is that to me with me new dress never mind st gerard majella what can a man do for a woman at a time like this even if he is a saint st gerard majella my arse
my grandmother switches her prayers to st ann patron saint of difficult labor but the child wont come nurse ohalloran tells my grandmother pray to st jude patron saint of desperate cases
st jude patron of desperate cases help me im desperate she grunts and pushes and the infants head appears only the head my mother and its the stroke of midnight the new year limerick city erupts with whistles horns sirens brass bands people calling and singing happy new year should auld acquaintance be forgot and church bells all over ring out the angelus and nurse ohalloran weeps for the waste of a dress that child still in there and me in me finery will you come out child will you grandma gives a great push and the child is in the world a lovely girl with black curly hair and sad blue eyes
ah lord above says nurse ohalloran this child is a time straddler born with her head in the new year and her arse in the old or was it her head in the old year and her arse in the new youll have to write to the pope missus to find out what year this child was born in and ill save this dress for next year
and the child was named angela for the angelus which rang the midnight hour the new year the minute of her coming and because she was a little angel anyway
love her as in childhood
though feeble old and grey
for youll never miss a mothers love
till shes buried beneath the clay
at the st vincent de paul school angela learned to read write and calculate and by her ninth year her schooling was done she tried her hand at being a charwoman a skivvy a maid with a little white hat opening doors but she could not manage the little curtsy that is required and her mother said you dont have the knack of it youre pure useless why dont you go to america where theres room for all sorts of uselessness ill give you the fare
she arrived in new york just in time for the first thanksgiving day of the great depression she met malachy at a party given by dan macadorey and his wife minnie on classon avenue in brooklyn malachy liked angela and she liked him he had a hangdog look which came from the three months he had just spent in jail for hijacking a truck he and his friend john mcerlaine believed what they were told in the speakeasy that the truck was packed to the roof with cases of canned pork and beans neither knew how to drive and when the police saw the truck lurch and jerk along myrtle avenue they pulled it over the police searched the truck and wondered why anyone would hijack a truck containing not pork and beans but cases of buttons
with angela drawn to the hangdog look and malachy lonely after three months in jail there was bound to be a kneetrembler
a kneetrembler is the act itself done up against a wall man and woman up on their toes straining so hard their knees tremble with the excitement thats in it
that kneetrembler put angela in an interesting condition and of course there was talk angela had cousins the macnamara sisters delia and philomena married respectively to jimmy fortune of county mayo and tommy flynn of brooklyn itself
delia and philomena were large women greatbreasted and fierce when they sailed along the sidewalks of brooklyn lesser creatures stepped aside respect was shown the sisters knew what was right and they knew what was wrong and any doubts could be resolved by the one holy roman catholic and apostolic church they knew that angela unmarried had no right to be in an interesting condition and they would take steps
steps they took with jimmy and tommy in tow they marched to the speakeasy on atlantic avenue where malachy could be found on friday payday when he had a job the man in the speak joey cacciamani did not want to admit the sisters but philomena told him that if he wanted to keep the nose on his face and that door on its hinges hed better open up for they were there on gods business joey said awright awright you irish jeezoz trouble trouble
malachy at the far end of the bar turned pale gave the great breasted ones a sickly smile offered them a drink they resisted the smile and spurned the offer delia said we dont know what class of a tribe you come from in the north of ireland
philomena said there is a suspicion you might have presbyterians in your family which would explain what you did to our cousin
jimmy said ah now ah now tisnt his fault if theres presbyterians in his family
delia said you shuddup
tommy had to join in what you did to that poor unfortunate girl is a disgrace to the irish race and you should be ashamed of yourself
och i am said malachy i am
nobody asked you to talk said philomena you done enough damage with your blather so shut your yap
and while your yap is shut said delia were here to see you do the right thing by our poor cousin angela sheehan
malachy said och indeed indeed the right thing is the right thing and id be glad to buy you all a drink while we have this little
talk
take the drink said tommy and shove it up your ass
philomena said our little cousin no sooner gets off the boat than
you are at her we have morals in limerick you know morals were not like jackrabbits from antrim a place crawling with presbyterians
jimmy said he dont look like a presbyterian
you shuddup said delia
another thing we noticed said philomena you have a very odd
manner
malachy smiled i do
about
you do says delia i think tis one of the first things we noticed you that odd manner and it gives us a very uneasy feeling
tis that sneaky little presbyterian smile said philomena
och said malachy its just the trouble i have with my teeth teeth or no teeth odd manner or no odd manner youre gonna marry
that girl said tommy up the middle aisle youre going
och said malachy i wasnt planning to get married you know
theres no work and i wouldnt be able to support married is what youre going to be said delia up the middle aisle said jimmy
you shuddup said delia
malachy watched them leave im in a desperate pickle he told joey cacciamani
bet your ass said joey i see them babes comin at me i jump inna hudson river
malachy considered the pickle he was in he had a few dollars in his pocket from the last job and he had an uncle in san francisco or one of the other california sans wouldnt he be better off in california far from the great breasted macnamara sisters and their grim husbands he would indeed and hed have a drop of the irish to celebrate his decision and departure joey poured and the drink nearly took the lining off malachys gullet irish indeed he told joey it was a prohibition concoction from the devils own still joey shrugged i dont know nothing i only pour still it was better than nothing and malachy would have another and one for yourself joey and ask them two decent italians what theyd like and what are you talking about of course i have the money to pay for it
he awoke on a bench in the long island railroad station a cop rapping on his boots with a nightstick his escape money gone the macnamara sisters ready to eat him alive in brooklyn
on the feast of st joseph a bitter day in march four months after the kneetrembler malachy married angela and in august the child was born in november malachy got drunk and decided it was time to register the childs birth he thought he might name the child malachy after himself but his north of ireland accent and the alcoholic mumble confused the clerk so much he simply entered the name male on the certificate
not until late december did they take male to st pauls church to be baptized and named francis after his fathers father and the lovely saint of assisi angela wanted to give him a middle name munchin after the patron saint of limerick but malachy said over his dead body no son of his would have a limerick name its hard enough going through life with one name sticking on middle names was an atrocious american habit and there was no need for a second name when youre christened after the man from assisi
there was a delay the day of the baptism when the chosen godfather john mcerlaine got drunk at the speakeasy and forgot his responsibilities philomena told her husband tommy hed have to be godfather childs soul is in danger she said tommy put his head down and grumbled all right ill be godfather but im not goin to be responsible if he grows up like his father causin trouble and goin through life with the odd manner for if he does he can go to john mcerlaine at the speakeasy the priest said true for you tom decent man that you are fine man that never set foot inside a speakeasy malachy fresh from the speakeasy himself felt insulted and wanted to argue with the priest one sacrilege on top of another take off that collar and well see whos the man he had to be held back by the great breasted ones and their husbands grim angela new mother agitated forgot she was holding the child and let him slip into the baptismal font a total immersion of the protestant type the altar boy assisting the priest plucked the infant from the font and restored him to angela who sobbed and clutched him dripping to her bosom the priest laughed said he had never seen the likes that the child was a regular little baptist now and hardly needed a priest this maddened malachy again and he wanted to jump at the priest for calling the child some class of a protestant the priest said quiet man youre in gods house and when malachy said gods house my arse he was thrown out on court street because you cant say arse in gods house
after baptism philomena said she had tea and ham and cakes in her house around the corner malachy said tea and she said yes tea or is it whiskey you want he said tea was grand but first hed have to go and deal with john mcerlaine who didnt have the decency to carry out his duties as godfather angela said youre only looking for an excuse to run to the speakeasy and he said as god is my witness the drink is the last thing on my mind angela started to cry your sons christening day and you have to go drinking delia told him he was a disgusting specimen but what could you expect from the north of ireland
malachy looked from one to the other shifted on his feet pulled his cap down over his eyes shoved his hands deep in his trouser pockets said och aye the way they do in the far reaches of county antrim turned hurried up court street to the speakeasy on atlantic avenue where he was sure theyd ply him with free drink in honor of his sons baptism
at philomenas house the sisters and their husbands ate and drank while angela sat in a corner nursing the baby and crying philomena stuffed her mouth with bread and ham and rumbled at angela thats what you get for being such a fool hardly off the boat and you fall for that lunatic you shoulda stayed single put the child up for adoption and youd be a free woman today angela cried harder and delia took up the attack oh stop it angela stop it you have nobody to blame but yourself for gettin into trouble with a drunkard from the north a man that doesnt even look like a catholic him with his odd manner id say
that that malachy has a streak of the presbyterian in him right enough you shuddup jimmy
if i was you said philomena id make sure theres no more children he dont have a job so he dont an never will the way he drinks so no more children angela are you listenin to me
i am philomena
a year later another child was born angela called him malachy after his father and gave him a middle name gerard after his fathers brother
the macnamara sisters said angela was nothing but a rabbit and they wanted nothing to do with her till she came to her senses
their husbands agreed
im in a playground on classon avenue in brooklyn with my brother malachy hes two im three were on the seesaw
up down up down
malachy goes up
i get off
malachy goes down seesaw hits the ground he screams his hand is
on his mouth and theres blood
oh god blood is bad my mother will kill me
and here she is trying to run across the playground her big belly
slows her
she says what did you do what did you do to i dont know what to say i dont know what i she pulls my ear go home go to bed bed
in the middle of the day
she pushes me toward the playground gate go she picks up malachy and waddles off
my fathers friend mr macadorey is outside
the child
did
our building hes standing at the edge of the sidewalk with his wife minnie looking at a
dog lying in the gutter there is blood all around the dogs head its the color of the blood from malachys mouth
malachy has dog blood and the dog has malachy blood
i pull mr macadoreys hand i tell him malachy has blood like the
dog
oh he does indeed francis cats have it too and eskimos all
the same blood
minnie says stop that dan stop confusing the wee fellow she
tells me the poor wee dog was hit by a car and he crawled all the way from the middle of the street before he died wanted to come home the poor wee creature
mr macadorey says youd better go home francis i dont know what you did to your wee brother but your mother took him off to the hospital go home child
will malachy die like the dog mr macadorey minnie says he bit his tongue he wont die why did the dog die
it was his time francis
the apartment is empty and i wander between the two rooms the bedroom and the kitchen my father is out looking for a job and my mother is at the hospital with malachy i wish i had something to eat but theres nothing in the icebox but cabbage leaves floating in the melted ice my father said never eat anything floating in water for the rot that might be in it i fall asleep on my parents bed and when my mother
shakes me its nearly dark your little brother is going to sleep a while nearly bit his tongue off stitches galore go into the other
room
my father is in the kitchen sipping black tea from his big white
enamel mug he lifts me to his lap
dad will you tell me the story about coo coo
cuchulain say it after me coohoolin ill tell you the story
when you say the name right coohoolin
i say it right and he tells me the story of cuchulain who had a
different name when he was a boy setanta he grew up in ireland where dad lived when he was a boy in county antrim setanta had a stick and ball and one day he hit the ball and it went into the mouth of a big dog that belonged to culain and choked him oh culain was angry and he said what am i to do now without my big dog to guard my house and my wife and my ten small children as well as numerous pigs hens sheep
setanta said im sorry ill guard your house with my stick and ball and ill change my name to cuchulain the hound of culain he did he guarded the house and regions beyond and became a great hero the hound of ulster itself dad said he was a greater hero than hercules or achilles that the greeks were always bragging about and he could take on king arthur and all his knights in a fair fight which of course you could never get with an englishman anyway
thats my story dad cant tell that story to malachy or any other children down the hall
he finishes the story and lets me sip his tea its bitter but im happy there on his lap
for days malachys tongue is swollen and he can hardly make a sound never mind talk but even if he could no one is paying any attention to him because we have two new babies who were brought by an angel in the middle of the night the neighbors say ooh ah theyre lovely boys look at those big eyes
malachy stands in the middle of the room looking up at everyone pointing to his tongue and saying uck uck when the neighbors say cant you see were looking at your little brothers he cries till dad pats him on the head put in your tongue son and go out and play with frankie go on
in the playground i tell malachy about the dog who died in the street because someone drove a ball into his mouth malachy shakes his head no uck ball car uck kill dog he cries because his tongue hurts and he can hardly talk and its terrible when you cant talk he wont let me push him on the swing he says you uck kill me uck on seesaw he gets freddie leibowitz to push him and hes happy laughing when he swings to the sky freddie is big hes seven and i ask him to push me he says no you tried to kill your brother
i try to get the swing going myself but all i can do is move it back and forth and im angry because freddie and malachy are laughing at the way i cant swing theyre great pals now freddie seven malachy two they laugh every day and malachys tongue gets better with all the laughing
when he laughs you can see how white and small and pretty his teeth are and you can see his eyes shine he has blue eyes like my mother he has golden hair and pink cheeks i have brown eyes like dad i have black hair and my cheeks are white in the mirror my mother tells mrs leibowitz down the hall that malachy is the happiest child in the world
she tells mrs leibowitz down the hall frankie has the odd manner like his father i wonder what the odd manner is but i cant ask because im not supposed to be listening
i wish i could swing up into the sky up into the clouds i might be able to fly around the whole world and not hear my brothers oliver and eugene cry in the middle of the night anymore my mother says theyre always hungry she cries in the middle of the night too she says shes worn out nursing and feeding and changing and four boys is too much for her she wishes she had one little girl all for herself shed give anything for one little girl
im in the playground with malachy im four hes three he lets me push him on the swing because hes no good at swinging himself and freddie leibowitz is in school we have to stay in the playground because the twins are sleeping and my mother says shes worn out go out and play she says and give me some rest dad is out looking for a job again and sometimes he comes home with the smell of whiskey singing all the songs about suffering ireland mam gets angry and says ireland can kiss her arse he says thats nice language to be using in front of the children and she says never mind the language food on the table is what she wants not suffering ireland she says it was a sad day prohibition ended because dad gets the drink going around to saloons offering to sweep out the bars and lift barrels for a whiskey or a beer sometimes he brings home bits of the free lunch rye bread corned beef pickles he puts the food on the table and drinks tea himself he says food is a shock to the system and he doesnt know where we get our appetites mam
says
they get their appetites because theyre starving half the time
when dad gets a job mam is cheerful and she sings anyone can see why i wanted your kiss
it had to be and the reason is this
could it be true someone like you
could love me love me
when dad brings home the first weeks wages mam is delighted she can pay the lovely italian man in the grocery shop and she can hold her head up again because theres nothing worse in the world than to owe and be beholden to anyone she cleans the kitchen washes the mugs and plates brushes crumbs and bits of food from the table cleans out the icebox and orders a fresh block of ice from another italian she buys toilet paper that we can take down the hall to the lavatory and that she says is better than having the headlines from the daily news blackening your arse she boils water on the stove and spends a day at a great tin tub washing our shirts and socks diapers for the twins our two sheets our three towels she hangs everything out on the clotheslines behind the apartment house and we can watch the clothes dance in wind and sun she says you wouldnt want the neighbors to know what you have in the way of a wash but theres nothing like the sweetness of clothes dried by the sun
when dad brings home the first weeks wages on a friday night we know the weekend will be wonderful on saturday night mam will boil water on the stove and wash us in the great tin tub and dad will dry us malachy will turn around and show his behind dad will pretend to be shocked and well all laugh mam will make hot cocoa and well be able to stay up while dad tells us a story out of his head all we have to do is
say a name mr macadorey or mr leibowitz down the hall and dad will have the two of them rowing up a river in brazil chased by indians with green noses and puce shoulders on nights like that we can drift off to sleep knowing there will be a breakfast of eggs fried tomatoes and fried bread tea with lashings of sugar and milk and later in the day a big dinner of mashed potatoes peas and ham and a trifle mam makes layers of fruit and warm delicious custard on a cake soaked in sherry
when dad brings home the first weeks wages and the weather is fine mam takes us to the playground she sits on a bench and talks to minnie macadorey she tells minnie stories about characters in limerick and minnie tells her about characters in belfast and they laugh because there are funny people in ireland north and south then they teach each other sad songs and malachy and i leave the swings and seesaws to sit with them on the bench and sing a group of young soldiers one night in a camp were talking of sweethearts they had
all seemed so merry except one young lad and he was downhearted and sad
come and join us said one of the boys surely theres someone for you
but ned shook his head and proudly he said i am in love with two each like a mother to me
from neither of them shall i part
for one is my mother
god bless her and love her
the other is my sweetheart
malachy and i sing that song and mam and minnie laugh till they cry at the way malachy takes a deep bow and holds his arms out to mam at the end dan macadorey comes along on his way home from work and says rudy vallee better start worrying about the competition
when we go home mam makes tea and bread and jam or mashed potatoes with butter and salt dad drinks the tea and eats nothing mam says god above how can you work all day and not eat he says the tea is enough she says youll ruin your health and he tells her again that food is a shock to the system he drinks his tea and tells us stories and shows us letters and words in the daily news or he smokes a cigarette stares at the wall runs his tongue over his lips
when dads job goes into the third week he does not bring home the wages on friday night we wait for him and mam gives us bread and tea the darkness comes down and the lights come on along classon avenue other men with jobs are home already and having eggs for dinner because you cant have meat on a friday you can hear the families talking upstairs and downstairs and down the hall and bing crosby is singing on the radio brother can you spare a dime
malachy and i play with the twins we know mam wont sing anyone can see why i wanted your kiss she sits at the kitchen table talking to herself what am i going to do till its late and dad rolls up the stairs singing roddy mccorley he pushes in the door and calls for us where are my troops where are my four warriors
mam says leave those boys alone theyre gone to bed half hungry because you have to fill your belly with whiskey
he comes to the bedroom door up boys up a nickel for everyone who promises to die for ireland
deep in canadian woods we met
from one bright island flown
great is the land we tread but yet
our hearts are with our own
up boys up francis malachy oliver eugene the red branch knights the fenian men the ira up up
mam is at the kitchen table shaking her hair hanging damp her face wet cant you leave them alone she says jesus mary and joseph
isnt it enough that you come home without making fools of the children on top of it she comes to us go back to bed she
i want them up he says i want them
be free from the center to the sea
dont cross me she says for if you your mothers house
a penny in your pocket without
says
ready for the day ireland will
do itll be a sorry day in
he pulls his cap down over his face and cries my poor mother poor ireland och what are we going to do
mam says youre pure stone mad and she tells us again to go to bed
on the morning of the fourth friday of dads job mam asks him if hell be home tonight with his wages or will he drink everything again he looks at us and shakes his head at mam as if to say och you shouldnt talk like that in front of the children
mam keeps at him im asking you are you coming home so that we can have a bit of supper or will it be midnight with no money in your pocket and you singing kevin barry and the rest of the sad songs
he puts on his cap shoves his hands into his trouser pockets sighs and looks up at the ceiling i told you before ill be home he
says
later in the day mam dresses us she puts the twins into the pram
and off we go through the long streets of brooklyn sometimes she lets malachy sit in the pram when hes tired of trotting along beside her she tells me im too big for the pram i could tell her i have pains in my legs from trying to keep up with her but shes not singing and i know this is not the day to be talking about my pains
we come to a big gate where theres a man standing in a box with windows all around mam talks to the man she wants to know if she can go inside to where the men are paid and maybe theyd give her some of dads wages so he wouldnt spend it in the bars the man shakes his head im sorry lady but if we did that wed have half the wives in brooklyn storming the place lotta men have the drinking problem but theres nothing we can do long as they show up sober and do their work
we wait across the street mam lets me sit on the sidewalk with my back against the wall she gives the twins their bottles of water and sugar but malachy and i have to wait till she gets money from dad and we can go to the italian for tea and bread and eggs
when the whistle blows at half five men in caps and overalls swarm through the gate their faces and hands black from the work mam tells us watch carefully for dad because she can hardly see across the street
herself her eyes are that bad there are dozens of men then a few then none mam is crying why couldnt ye see him are ye blind or what
she goes back to the man in the box are you sure there wouldnt be one man left inside
no lady he says theyre out i dont know how he got past you
we go back through the long streets of brooklyn the twins hold up their bottles and cry for more water and sugar malachy says hes hungry and mam tells him wait a little well get money from dad and well all have a nice supper well go to the italian and get eggs and make toast with the flames on the stove and well have jam on it oh we will and well all be nice and warm
its dark on atlantic avenue and all the bars around the long island railroad station are bright and noisy we go from bar to bar looking for dad mam leaves us outside with the pram while she goes in or she sends me there are crowds of noisy men and stale smells that remind me of dad when he comes home with the smell of the whiskey on him
the man behind the bar says yeah sonny whaddya want youre not supposeta be in here yknow
im looking for my father is my father here
naw sonny howd i know dat whos your fawdah
his name is malachy and he sings kevin barry

he calls out to the men in the bar youse guys youse know guy

barry but he died of the drink which he had because of his war wounds the barman says jeez pete i didnt ax ya to tell me history o

the man called pete holds his glass toward me here kid have a sip but the barman says whaddya doin pete tryina get the kid drunk do that again pete an ill come out an break yass
mam tries all the bars around the station before she gives up she leans against a wall and cries jesus we still have to walk all the way to classon avenue and i have four starving children she sends me back into the bar where pete offered me the sip to see if the barman would fill the twins bottles with water and maybe a little sugar in each the men in the bar think its very funny that the barman should be filling baby bottles but hes big and he tells them shut their lip he tells me babies should be drinking milk not water and when i tell him mam doesnt have the money he empties the baby bottles and fills them with milk he says tell ya mom they need that for the teeth an bones ya drink water an sugar an all ya get is rickets tell ya mom
mam is happy with the milk she says she knows all about teeth and bones and rickets but beggars cant be choosers
when we reach classon avenue she goes straight to the italian grocery shop she tells the man her husband is late tonight that hes probably working overtime and would it be at all possible to get a few things and shell be sure to see him tomorrow
the italian says missus you always pay your bill sooner or later and you can have anything you like in this store
oh she says i dont want much
anything you like missus because i know youre an honest woman and you got a bunch o nice kids there
we have eggs and toast and jam though were so weary walking the long streets of brooklyn we can barely move our jaws to chew the twins fall asleep after eating and mam lays them on the bed to change their diapers she sends me down the hall to rinse the dirty diapers in the lavatory so that they can be hung up to dry and used the next day malachy helps her wash the twins bottoms though hes ready to fall asleep himself
i crawl into bed with malachy and the twins i look out at mam at the kitchen table smoking a cigarette drinking tea and crying i want to get up and tell her ill be a man soon and ill get a job in the place with the big gate and ill come home every friday night with money for eggs and toast and jam and she can sing again anyone can see why i wanted your kiss
the next week dad loses the job he comes home that friday night throws his wages on the table and says to mam are you happy now you hang around the gate complaining and accusing and they sack me they were looking for an excuse and you gave it to them
he takes a few dollars from his wages and goes out he comes home late roaring and singing the twins cry and mam shushes them and cries a long time herself
we spend hours in the playground when the twins are sleeping when mam is tired and when dad comes home with the whiskey smell on him roaring about kevin barry getting hanged on a monday morning or the roddy mccorley song up the narrow street he stepped smiling and proud and young about the hemp rope on his neck the golden ringlets clung theres never a tear in the blue eyes both glad and bright are they as roddy mccorley goes to die on the bridge of toome today
when he sings he marches around the table mam cries and the twins howl with her she says go out frankie go out malachy you shouldnt see your father like this stay in the playground we dont mind going to the playground
we can play with the leaves piling up on the ground and we can push each other on the swings but then winter comes to classon avenue and the swings are frozen and wont even move minnie macadorey says god help these poor wee boys
they dont have a glove between them that makes me laugh because i know malachy and i have four hands between us and one glove would be silly malachy doesnt know what im laughing at he wont know anything till hes four going on five
minnie brings us in and gives us tea and porridge with jam in it mr macadorey sits in an armchair with their new baby maisie he holds her bottle and sings clap hands clap hands till daddy comes home with buns in his pocket for maisie alone
clap hands clap hands
till daddy comes home
for daddy has money
and mammy has none
malachy tries to sing that song but i tell him stop its maisies song he starts to cry and minnie says there there you can sing the
song
and i
song
thats a song for all the children mr macadorey smiles at malachy wonder what kind of world is it where anyone can sing anyone elses
minnie says dont frown frankie it makes your face dark and god its dark enough some day youll have a little sister and you can
knows
sing that song to her och aye youll have a little sister surely
minnie is right and mam gets her wish theres a new baby soon a little girl and they call her margaret we all love margaret she has black curly hair and blue eyes like mam and she waves her little hands and chirps like any little bird in the trees along classon avenue minnie says there was a holiday in heaven the day this child was made mrs leibowitz says the world never saw such eyes such a smile such happiness she makes me dance says mrs leibowitz
sings
when dad comes home from looking for a job he holds margaret and to her in a shady nook one moonlit night a leprechaun i spied
with scarlet cap and coat of green
a cruiskeen by his side
twas tick tock tick his hammer went upon a tiny shoe
oh i laugh to think he was caught at last but the fairy was laughing too
he walks around the kitchen with her and talks to her he tells her how lovely she is with her curly black hair and the blue eyes of her mother he tells her hell take her to ireland and theyll walk the glens of antrim and swim in lough neagh hell get a job soon so he will and shell have dresses of silk and shoes with silver buckles
the more dad sings to margaret the less she cries and as the days pass she even begins to laugh mam says look at him trying to dance with that child in his arms him with his two left feet she laughs and we all laugh
the twins cried when they were small and dad and mam would say whisht and hush and feed them and theyd go back to sleep but when margaret cries theres a high lonely feeling in the air and dad is out of bed in a second holding her to him doing a slow dance around the table singing to her making sounds like a mother when he passes the window where the streetlight shines in you can see tears on his cheeks and thats strange because he never cries for anyone unless he has the drink taken and he sings the kevin barry song and the roddy mccorley song now he cries over margaret and he has no smell of drink on him
mam tells minnie macadorey hes in heaven over that child he hasnt touched a drop since she was born i shouldve had a little girl a long time ago
och theyre lovely arent they says minnie the little boys are grand too but you need a little girl for yourself
my mother laughs for myself lord above if i didnt nurse her i wouldnt be able to get near her the way he wants to be holding her day and night
minnie says its lovely all the same to see a man so charmed with his little girl for isnt everyone charmed with her
everyone
the twins are able to stand and walk and they have accidents all the time their bottoms are sore because theyre always wet and shitty they put dirty things in their mouths bits of paper feathers shoelaces and they get sick mam says were all driving her crazy she dresses the twins puts them in the pram and malachy and i take them to the playground the cold weather is gone and the trees have green leaves up and down classon avenue
we race the pram around the playground and the twins laugh and make googoo sounds till they get hungry and start to cry there are two bottles in the pram filled with water and sugar and that keeps them quiet for awhile till theyre hungry again and they cry so hard i dont know what to do because theyre so small and i wish i could give them all kinds of food so that theyd laugh and make the baby sounds they love the mushy food mam makes in a pot bread mashed up in milk and water and sugar mam calls it bread and goody
if i take the twins home now mam will yell at me for giving her no rest or for waking margaret we are to stay in the playground till she sticks her head out the window and calls for us i make funny faces for the twins to stop their crying i put a piece of paper on my head and let it fall and they laugh and laugh i push the pram over to malachy playing on the swings with freddie leibowitz malachy is trying to tell freddie all about the way setanta became cuchulain i tell him stop telling that story its my story he wont stop i push him and he cries waah waah ill tell mam freddie pushes me and everything turns dark in my head and i run at him with fists and knees and feet till he yells hey stop stop and i wont because i cant i dont know how and if i stop malachy will go on taking my story from me freddie pushes me away and runs off yelling frankie tried to kill me frankie tried to kill me i dont know what to do because i never tried to kill anyone before and now malachy on the swing cries dont kill me frankie and he looks so helpless i put my arms around him and help him off the swing he hugs me i wont tell your story anymore i wont tell freddie about coo coo i want to laugh but i cant because the twins are crying in the pram and its dark in the playground and whats the use of trying to make funny faces and letting things fall off your head when they cant see you in the dark
the italian grocery shop is across the street and i see bananas apples oranges i know the twins can eat bananas malachy loves bananas and i like them myself but you need money italians are not known for giving away bananas especially to the mccourts who owe them money already for groceries
my mother tells me all the time never never leave that playground except to come home but what am i to do with the twins bawling with the hunger in the pram i tell malachy ill be back in a minute i make sure no one is looking grab a bunch of bananas outside the italian grocery shop and run down myrtle avenue away from the playground around the block and back to the other end where theres a hole in the fence we push the pram to a dark corner and peel the bananas for the twins there are five bananas in the bunch and we feast on them in the dark corner the twins slobber and chew and spread banana over their faces their hair their clothes i realize then that questions will be asked mam will want to know why the twins are smothered in bananas where did you get them i cant tell her about the italian shop on the corner i will have to say a man
thats what ill say a man
then the strange thing happens theres a man at the gate of the playground hes calling me oh god its the italian hey sonny come ere hey talkin to ya come ere

mrs leibowitz shakes her head at malachy and me oy so thin she says oy so much malachy laughs and says oy and the leibowitzes laugh and mr leibowitz says words we can understand when irish oyes are smiling mrs leibowitz laughs so hard her body shakes and she holds her stomach and malachy says oy again because he knows that makes everyone laugh i say oy but no one laughs and i know oy belongs to malachy the way cuchulain belongs to me and malachy can have his oy

mam stays in the bed all day hardly moving malachy and i fill the twins bottles with water and sugar in the kitchen we find a half loaf of stale bread and two cold sausages we cant have tea because the milk is sour in the icebox where the ice is melted again and everyone knows you cant drink tea without milk unless your father gives it to you out of his mug while hes telling you about cuchulain
the twins are hungry again but i know i cant give them water and sugar all day and night i boil sour milk in a pot mash in some of the stale bread and try to feed them from a cup bread and goody they make faces and run to mams bed crying she keeps her face to the wall and they run back to me still crying they wont eat the bread and goody till i kill the taste of the sour milk with sugar now they eat and smile and rub the goody over their faces malachy wants some and if he can eat it so can i we all sit on the floor eating the goody and chewing on the
cold sausage and drinking water my mother keeps in a milk bottle in the icebox
after we eat and drink we have to go to the lavatory down the hall but we cant get in because mrs leibowitz is inside humming and singing she says wait chiltren wait darlinks wont be two seconds malachy claps his hands and dances around singing wait chiltren wait darlinks mrs leibowitz opens the lavatory door look at him little actor awready so chiltren hows you mother

she helps my mother sit up against the wall mam seems smaller mrs leibowitz says shell bring some soup and tells me get some water to wash my mothers face i dip a towel in cold water and pat her forehead she presses my hand against her cheeks oh jesus frankie oh jesus she wont let my hand go and im frightened because ive never seen her like this before shes saying frankie only because its my hand shes holding and its margaret shes thinking about not me your lovely little sister is dead frankie dead and where is your father she lets my hand drop i said where is your father drinking thats where he is there isnt a penny in the house he cant get a job but he finds money for the drink money for the drink money for the drink money for the drink she rears back knocks her head on the wall and screams where is she where is she where is my little girl oh jesus mary and joseph help me this night ill go mad so i will ill go pure mad
mrs leibowitz rushes in missus missus what is it the little girl where is she
my mother screams again dead mrs leibowitz dead her head drops and she rocks back and forth middle of the night mrs leibowitz in her pram i should have been watching her seven weeks she had in this world and died in the middle of the night alone mrs leibowitz all alone in that pram
mrs leibowitz holds my mother in her arms shush now shush babies go like that it happens missus god takes them
in the pram mrs leibowitz near my bed i could have picked her up and she didnt have to die did she god doesnt want little babies what is god going to do with little babies
i dont know missus i dont know from god have soup good soup make you strong you boys get bowls i give you soup
whats bowls mrs leibowitz
oh frankie you dont know bowl for the soup darlink you don have a bowl so get cups for the soup i mix pea soup and lentil soup no ham irish like the ham no ham frankie drink missus drink you soup
she spoons the soup into my mothers mouth wipes the dribble from her chin malachy and i sit on the floor drinking from mugs we spoon the soup into the twins mouths it is lovely and hot and tasty my mother never makes soup like this and i wonder if theres any chance mrs
leibowitz could ever be my mother freddie could be me and have my mother and my father too and he could have malachy and the twins for brothers he cant have margaret anymore because shes like the dog in the street that was taken away i dont know why she was taken away my mother said she died in her pram and that must be like getting hit by a car because they take you away
i wish little margaret could be here for the soup i could give it to her with a spoon the way mrs leibowitz is giving it to my mother and shed gurgle and laugh the way she did with dad she wouldnt cry anymore and my mother wouldnt be in the bed day and night and dad would be telling me cuchulain stories and i wouldnt want mrs leibowitz to be my mother anymore mrs leibowitz is nice but id rather have my father telling me cuchulain stories and margaret chirping and mam laughing when dad dances with two left feet
minnie macadorey comes in to help mother o god mrs leibowitz these twins smell to the high heavens
i dont know about mother o god minnie but these twins need a wash they need clean diapers frankie where are the clean diapers
i dont know
minnie says theyre just wearing rags for diapers ill get some of maisies frankie you take off those rags and throw them out
malachy removes olivers rag and i struggle with eugene the safety pin is stuck and when he wriggles it comes loose sticks him in the hip and starts him screaming for mam but minnie is back with a towel and soap and hot water i help her wash away the caked shit and she lets me shake talcum powder on the twins raw sore skin she says theyre good little boys and she has a big surprise for them she goes down the hall and brings back a pot of mashed potatoes for all of us there is plenty of salt and butter in the potatoes and i wonder if theres any chance minnie could be my mother so that i could eat like this all the time if i could have mrs leibowitz and minnie for mothers at the same time id have no end of soup and mashed potatoes
minnie and mrs leibowitz sit at the table mrs leibowitz says something has to be done these children are running wild and where is the father i hear minnie whisper hes out for the drink mrs leibowitz says terrible terrible the way the irish drink minnie says her dan doesnt drink never touches the stuff and dan told her that when the baby died that poor man malachy mccourt went mad all over flatbush avenue and atlantic avenue that he was thrown out of all the bars around the long island railroad station that the cops would have thrown him in jail if it was anything else but the death of that lovely little baby
here he has four lovely little boys says minnie but its no comfort to him that little girl brought out something in him you know he didnt even drink after she was born and that was a miracle
mrs leibowitz wants to know where mams cousins are the big women with the quiet husbands minnie will find them and tell them the children are neglected running wild sore arses and everything
two days later dad returns from his cigarette hunt its the middle of the night but he gets malachy and me out of the bed he has the smell of the drink on him he has us stand at attention in the kitchen we are soldiers he tells us we must promise to die for ireland
we will dad we will
all together we sing kevin barry
on mountjoy one monday morning
high upon the gallows tree
kevin barry gave his young life
for the cause of liberty
just a lad of eighteen summers
sure theres no one can deny
as he marched to death that morning
how he held his head on high
theres a knock at the door mr macadorey och malachy for gods sake its three in the morning you have the whole house woke with the singing
och dan im only teaching the boys to die for ireland
you can teach them to die for ireland in the daytime malachy tis urgent dan tis urgent
i know malachy but theyre only children babies you go to bed
now like a dacent man
bed dan what am i to do in bed her little face is there day and
night her curly black hair and her lovely blue eyes oh jesus dan what will i do was it the hunger that killed her dan
of course not your missus was nursing her god took her he has his reasons
one more song dan before we go to bed good night malachy
come on boys sing
because he loved the motherland because he loved the green
he goes to meet a martyrs fate with proud and joyous mien
true to the last oh true to the last he treads the upward way
young roddy mccorley goes to die
on the bridge at toome today
youll die for ireland wont you boys
we will dad
and well all meet your little sister in heaven wont we boys we will dad
my brother is standing with his face pressed against a leg of the
table and hes asleep dad lifts him staggers across the room places him in the bed by my mother i climb into bed and my father still in his clothes lies beside me im hoping hell put his arms around me but he goes on singing about roddy mccorley and talking to margaret oh my little curlyhaired blueeyed love i would dress you in silks and take you to lough neagh till day is at the window and i fall asleep
that night cuchulain comes to me theres a big green bird on his shoulder that keeps singing about kevin barry and roddy mccorley and i dont like that bird because theres blood dripping from his mouth when he sings in one hand cuchulain carries the gae bolga the spear that is so mighty only he can throw it in the other hand he carries a banana which he keeps offering to the bird who just squawks and spits blood at
him youd wonder why cuchulain puts up with a bird like that if the twins ever spat blood at me when i offered them a banana i think id hit them on the head with it
in the morning my father is at the kitchen table and i tell him my dream he says there were no bananas in ireland in the old times and even if there were cuchulain would never offer one to that bird because that was the one that came over from england for the summer and perched on his shoulder when he was dying and propped up against a stone and when the men of erin which is ireland wanted to kill him they were afraid till they saw the bird drinking cuchulains blood and then they knew it was safe to attack him the dirty bloody cowards so you have to be wary of birds francis birds and englishmen
most of the day mam lies in bed with her face to the wall if she drinks tea or eats anything she throws up in the bucket under the bed and i have to empty it and rinse it in the lavatory down the hall mrs leibowitz brings her soup and funny bread that is twisted mam tries to slice it but mrs leibowitz laughs and tells her just pull malachy calls it pull bread but mrs leibowitz says no its challah and teaches us how to say it she shakes her head oy you irish youll live forever but youll never say challah like a chew
minnie macadorey brings potatoes and cabbage and sometimes a piece of meat och times are hard angela but that lovely man mr roosevelt will find a job for everyone and your husband will have work poor man its not his fault theres a depression he looks for work day and night my dan is lucky four years with the city and he dont drink he grew up in toome with your husband some drink some dont curse of the irish now eat angela build yourself up after your loss
mr macadorey tells dad theres work with the wpa and when he gets the work theres money for food and mam leaves the bed to clean the twins and to feed us when dad comes home with the drink smell theres no money and mam screams at him till the twins cry and malachy and i run out to the playground on those nights mam crawls back into bed and dad sings the sad songs about ireland why doesnt he hold her and help her sleep the way he did with my little sister who died why doesnt he sing a margaret song or a song that will dry mams tears he still gets malachy and me out of bed to stand in our shirts promising to die for ireland one night he wanted to make the twins promise to die for ireland but they cant even talk and mam screamed at him you mad oul bastard cant you leave the children alone
hell give us a nickel for ice cream if we promise to die for ireland and we promise but we never get the nickel
we get soup from mrs leibowitz and mashed potatoes from minnie macadorey and they show us how to take care of the twins how to wash their bottoms and how to wash diaper rags after they get them all shitty mrs leibowitz calls them diapers and minnie calls them nappies but it doesnt matter what they call them because the twins get them shitty anyway if mam stays in the bed and dad goes out looking for a job we can do what we like all day we can put the twins in the small swings in the park and swing them till they get hungry and cry the italian man calls to me from across the street hey frankie cmere watch out crossing da street dem twins hungry again he gives us bits of cheese and ham and bananas but i cant eat bananas anymore after the way the bird spat blood at cuchulain
the man says his name is mr dimino and thats his wife angela behind the counter i tell him thats my mothers name no kiddin kid your mother is angela i didnt know the irish had any angelas hey angela his mothers name is angela she smiles she says thatsa nice
mr dimino asks me about mam and dad and who cooks for us i tell him we get food from mrs leibowitz and minnie macadorey i tell him all about the diapers and the nappies and how they get shitty anyway and he laughs angela you listenin to this thank god youre italian angela he says kid i gotta talk to mrs leibowitz ya gotta have relations can take care of you ya see minnie macadorey tell her come in see me you kids runnin wild
two big women are at the door they say who are you im frank frank how old are you
im four going on five
youre not very big for your age are you
i dont know
is your mother here
shes in the bed
what is she doing in the bed on a fine day in the middle of the
day
shes sleeping well well come in we have to talk to your
mother
they brush past me into the room jesus mary and joseph the smell
of this place and who are these children
malachy runs smiling to the big women when he smiles you can see
how white and straight and pretty his teeth are and you can see the shiny blue of his eyes the pink of his cheeks all that makes the big women smile and i wonder why they didnt smile when they talked to me
malachy says im malachy and this is oliver and this is eugene theyre twins and thats frankie over there
the big woman with the brown hair says well youre not a bit shy are you im your mothers cousin philomena and this is your mothers cousin delia im mrs flynn and shes mrs fortune and thats what you call us
good god says philomena those twins are naked dont you have clothes for them
malachy says theyre all shitty
delia barks see thats what happens a mouth like a sewer and no wonder with a father from the north dont use that word thats a bad word a curse word you could go to hell using a word like that
whats hell says malachy youll know soon enough says delia
the big women sit at the table with mrs leibowitz and minnie macadorey philomena says its terrible what happened to angelas little baby they heard all about it and youd wonder wouldnt you what they did with the little body you might wonder and i might wonder but tommy flynn didnt wonder tommy said that malachy from the north got money for that baby money says mrs leibowitz thats right says philomena money they take bodies any age and do experiments on them and theres not much left to give back nor would you want back bits of baby when they cant be buried in consecrated ground in that condition
thats terrible says mrs leibowitz a father or mother would never give the baby for something like that
they would says delia when they have the craving for the drink theyd give their own mothers when they have the craving so whats a baby thats dead and gone in the first place
mrs leibowitz shakes her head and rocks in her chair oy she says oy oy oy the poor baby the poor mother i thank god my husband donhave no what you call it craving right craving its the irish have the craving
not my husband says philomena id break his face if he came home with the craving of course delias jimmy has the craving every friday night you see him slipping into the saloon
you neednt start insulting my jimmy says delia he works he brings home his wages
youd want to keep an eye on him says philomena the craving could get the better of him and youd have another malachy from the north on your hands
mind your own bloody business says delia at least jimmy is irish not born in brooklyn like your tommy
and philomena has no answer for that
minnie is holding her baby and the big women say shes a lovely baby clean not like this pack of angelas running around this place philomena says she doesnt know where angela got her dirty habits because angelas mother was spotless so clean you could eat your dinner off her floor
i wonder why youd want to eat your dinner off the floor when you had a table and a chair
delia says something has to be done about angela and these children for they are a disgrace so they are enough to make you ashamed to be related a letter has to be written to angelas mother philomena will write it because a teacher in limerick told her once she had a fine fist delia has to tell mrs leibowitz that a fine fist means good handwriting

grandma sheehan sent money to philomena and delia they bought the tickets found a steamer trunk at the st vincent de paul society hired a van to take us to the pier in manhattan put us on the ship said good bye and good riddance and went away
the ship pulled away from the dock mam said thats the statue of liberty and thats ellis island where all the immigrants came in then she leaned over the side and vomited and the wind from the atlantic blew it all over us and other happy people admiring the view passengers cursed and ran seagulls came from all over the harbor and mam hung limp and pale on the ships rail

in a week we arrived at moville county donegal where we took a bus to belfast and from there another bus to toome in county antrim we left the trunk in a shop and set out to walk the two miles up the road to grandpa mccourts house it was dark on the road the dawn barely stirring on the hills beyond
dad carried the twins in his arms and they took turns crying with the hunger mam stopped every few minutes to sit and rest on the stone wall along the road we sat with her and watched the sky turn red and then blue birds started to chirp and sing in the trees and as the dawn came up we saw strange creatures in the fields standing looking at us malachy said what are they dad
cows son
what are cows dad
cows are cows son
we walked farther along the brightening road and there were other
creatures in the fields white furry creatures malachy said what are they dad
sheep son
what are sheep dad
my father barked at him is there any end to your questions sheep are sheep cows are cows and that over there is a goat a goat is a goat the goat gives milk the sheep gives wool the cow gives everything what else in gods name do you want to know
and malachy yelped with fright because dad never talked like that never spoke sharply to us he might get us up in the middle of the night and make us promise to die for ireland but he never barked like this malachy ran to mam and she said there there love dont cry your father is just worn out carrying the twins and tis hard answering all those questions when youre carting twins through the world
dad set the twins on the road and held out his arms to malachy now the twins started to cry and malachy clung to mam sobbing the cows mooed the sheep maaed the goat ehehed the birds twittered in the trees and the beep beep of a motor car cut through everything a man called from the motor car good lord what are you people doing on this road at this hour of an easter sunday morning
dad said good morning father
father i said dad is that your father
mam said dont ask him any questions
dad said no no this is a priest
malachy said whats a but mam put her hand over his mouth the priest had white hair and a white collar he said where are
you going
dad said up the road to mccourts of moneyglass and the priest
took us in his motor car he said he knew the mccourts a fine family good catholics some daily communicants and he hoped hed see us all at mass especially the little yankees who didnt know what a priest was god help us
at the house my mother reaches for the gate latch dad says no no not that way not the front gate they use the front door only for visits from the priest or funerals
we make our way around the house to the kitchen door dad pushes in the door and theres grandpa mccourt drinking tea from a big mug and grandma mccourt frying something
och says grandpa youre here
och we are says dad he points to my mother this is angela he says grandpa says och you must be worn out angela grandma says nothing she turns back to the frying pan grandpa leads us through the kitchen to a large room with a long table and chairs he says sit down and have some tea would you like boxty
malachy says whats boxty
dad laughs pancakes son pancakes made with potatoes
grandpa says we have eggs its easter sunday and you can have all
the eggs you can hold
we have tea and boxty and boiled eggs and we all fall asleep i
wake up in a bed with malachy and the twins my parents are in another bed over by the window where am i its getting dark this is not the ship mam snores hink dad snores honk i get up and poke at dad i have to pee he says use the chamber pot
what
under the bed son the chamber pot it has roses on it and maidens cavorting in the glen pee in that son
i want to ask him what hes talking about for even if im bursting i feel strange peeing into a pot with roses and maidens cavorting whatever they are we had nothing like this in classon avenue where mrs leibowitz sang in the lavatory while we clutched ourselves in the hall
now malachy has to use the chamber pot but he wants to sit on it dad says no you cant do that son you have to go outside when he says that i have to go too to sit he leads us downstairs and through the big room where grandpa is sitting reading by the fire and grandma is dozing in her chair its dark outside though the moon is bright enough for us to see where were going dad opens the door of a little house that has a seat with a hole in it he shows malachy and me how to sit on the hole and how to wipe ourselves with squares of newspaper stuck on a nail then he tells us wait while he goes inside closes the door and grunts the moon is so bright i can look down the field and see the things called cows and sheep and i wonder why they dont go home
in the house there are other people in the room with my grandparents dad says these are your aunts emily nora maggie vera your aunt eva is in ballymena with children like you my aunts are not like mrs leibowitz and minnie macadorey they nod their heads but they dont hug us or smile mam comes into the room with the twins and when
dad tells his sisters this is angela and these are the twins they just nod again
grandma goes to the kitchen and soon we have bread and sausages and tea the only one who speaks at the table is malachy he points his spoon at the aunts and asks their names again when mam tells him eat his sausage and be quiet his eyes fill with tears and aunt nora reaches over to comfort him she says there there and i wonder why everyone says there there when malachy cries i wonder what there there means
its quiet at the table till dad says things are terrible in america grandma says och aye i read it in the paper but they say mr roosevelt is a good man and if you stayed you might have work by now
dad shakes his head and grandma says i dont know what youre going to do malachy things are worse here than they are in america no work here and god knows we dont have room in this house for six more people
dad says i thought i might get work on some of the farms we could get a small place
where would you stay in the meantime says grandma and how would you support yourself and your family
och i could go on the dole i suppose
you cant get off a ship from america and go on the dole says grandpa they make you wait a while and what would you do while youre waiting
dad says nothing and mam looks straight ahead at the wall
youd be better off in the free state says grandma dublin is big and surely theres work there or in the farms around
youre entitled to money from the ira too says grandpa you did your bit and theyve been handing out money to men all over the free state you could go to dublin and ask for help we can loan you the bus fare to dublin the twins can sit on your lap and you wont have to pay for them
dad says och aye and mam stares at the wall with tears in her eyes
after we ate we went back to bed and next morning all the grown ups sat around looking sad soon a man came in a motor car and took us back down the road to the shop which had our trunk they lifted the trunk up on the roof of a bus and we got into the bus dad said we were going to dublin malachy said whats dublin but no one answered him dad held eugene on his lap and mam held oliver dad looked out at the fields and told me this is where cuchulain liked to go for a walk i asked him where cuchulain hit the ball into the dogs mouth and he said a few miles away
malachy said look look and we looked it was a great silvery sheet of water and dad said it was lough neagh the largest lake in ireland the lake where cuchulain used to swim after his great battles cuchulain would get so hot that when he jumped into lough neagh it boiled over and warmed the surrounding countryside for days some day wed all come back and go swimming like cuchulain himself wed fish for eels and fry them in a pan not like cuchulain who would pluck them from the lough and swallow them wriggling because theres great power in an eel
is that right dad
tis
mam didnt look out the window at lough neagh her cheek rested on
top of olivers head and she stared at the floor of the bus
soon the bus is rolling into a place where there are big houses motor cars horses pulling carts people on bicycles and hundreds walking malachy is excited dad dad wheres the playground the swings i want to see freddie leibowitz
och son youre in dublin now far from classon avenue youre in ireland a long way from new york
when the bus stops the trunk is lifted down and set on the floor of the bus station dad tells mam she can sit on a bench in the station while he goes to see the ira man in a place called terenure he says there are lavatories in the station for the boys he wont be long hell have money when he returns and well all have food he tells me go with him and mam says no i need him to help but when dad says ill need help carrying all that money she laughs and says all right go with your pop
your pop that means shes in a good mood if she says your father it means shes in a bad mood
dad holds my hand as i trot along beside him hes a fast walker its a long way to terenure and im hoping hell stop and carry me the way he did with the twins in toome but he lopes along and says nothing except to ask people where terenure is in awhile he says were in terenure and now we have to find mr charles heggarty of the ira a man with a pink patch on his eye tells us were on the right street charlie heggarty lives at number fourteen god blast him the man tells dad i can see youre a man that did his bit dad says och i did my bit and the man says i did me bit too and what did it get me but one eye less and a pension that wouldnt feed a canary
but ireland is free says dad and thats a grand thing
free my arse the man says i think we were better off under the english good luck to you anyway mister for i think i know what youre here for
a woman opens the door at number fourteen im afraid she says that mr heggarty is busy dad tells her he just walked all the way from the middle of dublin with his small son that he left wife and three children waiting for him at the bus place and if mr heggarty is that busy then well wait for him on the doorstep
the woman is back in a minute to say mr heggarty has a little time to spare and would you come this way mr heggarty is sitting at a desk near a glowing fire he says what can i do for you dad stands before the desk and says i have just returned from america with wife and four children we have nothing i fought with a flying column during the troubles and im hoping you can help me now in the time of need
mr heggarty takes dads name and turns the pages of a big book on his desk he shakes his head no no record of your service here dad makes a long speech he tells mr heggarty how he fought where when how he had to be smuggled out of ireland because of the price on his head how he was raising his sons to love ireland
mr heggarty says hes sorry but he cant be handing out money to every man who wanders in claiming he did his bit dad says to me remember this francis this is the new ireland little men in little chairs with little bits of paper this is the ireland men died for mr heggarty says hell look into dads claim and hell be sure to let him know what turns up hell let us have money to take the bus back into the city dad looks at the coins in mr heggartys hand and says you could add to that and make the price of a pint
oh its the drink you want is it
one pint is hardly drink
youd walk the miles back and make the boy walk because you want a
pint wouldnt you
walking never killed anyone
i want you to leave this house says mr heggarty or ill call a
guard and you can be sure youll never hear from me again were not handing out money to support the guinness family
night falls along the streets of dublin children laugh and play under streetlights mothers call from doorways smells of cooking come at us all the way through windows we see people around tables eating im tired and hungry and i want dad to carry me but i know theres no use asking him now the way his face is tight and set i let him hold my hand and i run to keep up with him till we reach the bus place where mam is waiting with my brothers
theyre all asleep on the bench my mother and three brothers when dad tells mam theres no money she shakes her head and sobs oh jesus what are we going to do a man in a blue uniform comes over and asks her whats up missus dad tells him were stranded there at the bus station we have no money and no place to stay and the children are hungry the man says hes going off duty now hell take us to the police barracks where he has to report anyway and theyll see what can be done
the man in uniform tells us we can call him guard thats what you call policemen in ireland he asks us what you call policemen in america and malachy says cop the guard pats him on the head and tells him hes a clever little yankee
at the police barracks the sergeant tells us we can spend the night hes sorry but all he can offer is the floor its thursday and the cells are filled with men who drank their dole money and wouldnt leave the pubs
the guards give us hot sweet tea and thick slices of bread slathered with butter and jam and were so happy we run around the barracks playing the guards say were a great bunch of little yanks and theyd like to take us home but i say no malachy says no the twins say no no and all the guards laugh men in cells reach out and pat our heads they smell like dad when he comes home singing about kevin barry and roddy mccorley going to die the men say jasus will ye listen to them they sound like bloody fillum stars did yez fall outa the sky or what women in cells at the other end tell malachy hes gorgeous and the twins are dotes one woman talks to me cmere love would you like a sweet i nod and she says all right put your hand out she takes something sticky from her mouth and puts it on my hand there you are now she says a nice bit of butterscotch put that in your mouth i dont want to put it in my mouth because its sticky and wet from her mouth but i dont know what youre supposed to do when a woman in a cell offers you sticky butterscotch and im about to put it in my mouth when a guard comes takes the butterscotch and throws it back at the woman you drunken hoor he says leave the child alone and all the women laugh
the sergeant gives my mother a blanket and she sleeps stretched out on a bench the rest of us lie on the floor dad sits with his back to the wall his eyes open under the peak of his cap and he smokes when the guards give him cigarettes the guard who threw the butterscotch at the woman says hes from ballymena in the north and he talks with dad about people they know there and in other places like cushendall and toome the
guard says hell have a pension some day and hell live on the shores of lough neagh and fish his days away eels he says eels galore jasus i love a fried eel i ask dad is this cuchulain and the guard laughs till his face turns red ah mother o god did yez hear this the lad wants to know if im cuchulain a little yank and he knows all about cuchulain
dad says no hes not cuchulain but hes a fine man who will live on the shores of lough neagh and fish his days away

dad is shaking me up francis up it is noisy in the barracks a boy mopping the floor is singing anyone can see why i wanted your kiss it had to be and the reason is this could it be true someone like you could love me love me
i tell him thats my mothers song and hes to stop singing it but he just puffs on his cigarette and walks away and i wonder why people have to sing other peoples songs men and women coming out of the cells are yawning and grunting the woman who offered me the butterscotch stops and says i had a drop taken child im sorry i made a fool of you but the guard from ballymena tells her move on you oul hoor before i lock you up again
oh lock me up she says in out what does it matter you blue arsed bastard
mam is sitting up on the bench the blanket wrapped around her a woman with gray hair brings her a mug of tea and tells her sure im the sergeants wife and he said you might need help would you like a nice softboiled egg missus
mam shakes her head no
ah now missus surely you should have a nice egg in your condition
but mam shakes her head and i wonder how she can say no to a soft boiled egg when theres nothing in the world like it
all right maam says the sergeants wife a bit of toast then and something for the children and your poor husband
she goes back to another room and soon theres tea and bread dad drinks his tea but gives us his bread and mam says will you eat your bread for gods sake you wont be much use to us falling down with the hunger he shakes his head and asks the sergeants wife is there any chance of a cigarette she brings him the cigarette and tells mam the guards in the barracks have taken up a collection to pay our train fares to limerick there will be a motor car to pick up our trunk and leave us at kingsbridge railway station and youll be in limerick in three or four hours
mam puts up her arms and hugs the sergeants wife god bless you and your husband and all the guards mam says i dont know what wed do without you god knows tis a lovely thing to be back among our own
tis the least we could do says the sergeants wife these are lovely children you have and im from cork meself and i know what tis to be in dublin without two pennies to rub together
dad sits at the other end of the bench smoking his cigarette drinking his tea he stays that way till the motor car comes to take us through the streets of dublin dad asks the driver if hed mind going by way of the g p o and the driver says is it a stamp you want or what no says dad i hear they put up a new statue of cuchulain to honor the men who died in 1916 and id like to show it to my son here who has a great admiration for cuchulain
the driver says he has no notion of who this cuchulain was but he wouldnt mind stopping one bit he might come in himself and see what the commotion is all about for he hasnt been in the g p o since he was a boy and the english nearly wrecked it with their big guns firing up from the liffey river he says youll see the bullet holes all over the front and they should be left there to remind the irish of english perfidy i ask the man whats perfidy and he says ask your father and i would but were stopping outside a big building with columns and thats the g p o
mam stays in the motor car while we follow the driver into the g p o there he is he says theres your man cuchulain
and i feel tears coming because im looking at him at last cuchulain there on his pedestal in the g p o hes golden and he has long hair his head is hanging and theres a big bird perched on his shoulder
the driver says now what in gods name is this all about whats this fellow doin with the long hair and the bird on his shoulder and will you kindly tell me mister what this has to do with the men of 1916
dad says cuchulain fought to the end like the men of easter week his enemies were afraid to go near him till they were sure he was dead and when the bird landed on him and drank his blood they knew
well says the driver tis a sad day for the men of ireland when they need a bird to tell them a man is dead i think we better go now or well be missing that train to limerick
the sergeants wife said shed send a telegram to grandma to meet us in limerick and there she was on the platform grandma with white hair sour eyes a black shawl and no smile for my mother or any of us even my brother malachy who had the big smile and the sweet white teeth mam pointed to dad this is malachy she said and grandma nodded and looked away she called two boys who were hanging around the railway station and paid them to carry the trunk the boys had shaved heads snotty noses and no shoes and we followed them through the streets of limerick i asked mam why they had no hair and she said their heads were shaved so that the lice would have no place to hide malachy said whats a lice and mam said not lice one of them is a louse grandma said will ye stop it what kind o talk is this the boys whistled and laughed and trotted along as if they had shoes and grandma told them stop that laughin or tis droppin an breakin that trunk yell be they stopped the whistling and laughing and we followed them into a park with a tall pillar and a statue in the middle and grass so green it dazzled you
dad carried the twins mam carried a bag in one hand and held malachys hand with the other when she stopped every few minutes to catch her breath grandma said are you still smokin them fags them fags will be the death of you theres enough consumption in limerick without people smokin fags on top of it an
tis a rich mans foolishness
along the path through the park there were hundreds of flowers of different colors that excited the twins they pointed and made squeaky noises and we laughed everyone except grandma who pulled her shawl over her head dad stopped and put the twins down so that they could be closer to the flowers he said flowers and they ran back and forth pointing trying to say flowers one of the boys with the trunk said god are they americans and mam said they are they were born in new york all the
boys were born in new york the boy said to the other boy god theyre americans they put the trunk down and stared at us and we stared back at them till grandma said are ye goin to stand here all day lookin at flowers an gawkin at each other and we all moved on again out of the park down a narrow lane and into another lane to grandmas house
there is a row of small houses on each side of the lane and grandma lives in one of the small houses her kitchen has a shiny polished black iron range with a fire glowing in the grate there is a table along the wall under the window and a press opposite with cups and saucers and vases this press is always locked and she keeps the key in her purse because youre not supposed to use anything in there unless someone dies or returns from foreign parts or theres a visit by a priest
there is a picture on the wall by the range of a man with long brown hair and sad eyes he is pointing to his chest where there is a big heart with flames coming out of it mam tells us thats the sacred heart of jesus and i want to know why the mans heart is on fire and why doesnt he throw water on it grandma says dont these children know anything about their religion and mam tells her its different in america grandma says the sacred heart is everywhere and theres no excuse for that kind of ignorance
under the picture of the man with the burning heart there is a shelf with a red glass holding a flickering candle and next to it a small statue mam tells us thats the baby jesus the infant of prague and if ye ever need anything pray to him
malachy says mam could i tell him im hungry and mam puts her finger to her lips
grandma grumbles around the kitchen making tea and telling mam to cut the loaf of bread and dont make the cuts too thick mam sits by the table with her breath coming hard and says shell cut the bread in a minute dad takes the knife and starts slicing the bread and you can see grandma doesnt like that she frowns at him but says nothing even though he makes thick slices
there arent enough chairs for everyone so i sit on the stairs with my brothers to have bread and tea dad and mam sit at the table and grandma sits under the sacred heart with her mug of tea she says i dont know under god what im goin to do with ye there is no room in this house there isnt room for even one of ye
malachy says ye ye and starts to giggle and i say ye ye and the twins say ye ye and were laughing so hard we can hardly eat our bread
grandma glares at us what are ye laughin at theres nothin to laugh at in this house ye better behave yeerselves before i go over to
ye
she wont stop saying ye and now malachy is helpless with
laughter spewing out his bread and tea his face turning red
dad says malachy and the rest of you stop it but malachy cant he goes on laughing till dad says come over here he rolls up malachys
sleeve and raises his hand to slap his arm
are you going to behave yourself
malachys eyes fill with tears and he nods i will because dad
never raised his hand like that before dad says be a good boy and go sit with your brothers and he pulls down the sleeve and pats malachy on the head
that night mams sister aunt aggie came home from her job in the clothing factory she was big like the macnamara sisters and she had flaming red hair she wheeled a large bicycle into the little room behind the kitchen and came out to her supper she was living in grandmas because she had a fight with her husband pa keating who told her when he had drink taken youre a great fat cow go home to your mother thats what grandma told mam and thats why there was no room for us in grandmas house she had herself aunt aggie and her son pat who was my uncle and who was out selling newspapers
aunt aggie complained when grandma told her mam would have to sleep with her that night grandma said oh will you shut your gob tis only for one night an that wont kill you an if you dont like it you can go back to your husband where you belong anyway instead of runnin home to me jesus mary an holy st joseph look at this house you an pat an angela and her clatther of americans will i have any peace in the latter end of my life
she spread coats and rags on the floor of the little back room and we slept there with the bicycle dad stayed on a chair in the kitchen took us to the lavatory in the backyard when we needed it and in the night hushed the twins when they cried from the cold
in the morning aunt aggie came for her bicycle telling us will ye mind yeerselves will ye will ye get out of my way
when she left malachy kept saying will ye mind yeerselves will ye will ye get out of the way will ye and i could hear dad laughing out in the kitchen till grandma came down the stairs and he had to tell malachy be quiet
that day grandma and mam went out and found a furnished room on windmill street where aunt aggie had a flat with her husband pa keating grandma paid the rent ten shillings for two weeks she gave mam money for food loaned us a kettle a pot a frying pan knives and spoons jam jars to be used for mugs a blanket and a pillow she said that was all she could afford anymore that dad would have to get up off his arse get a job go on the dole go for the charity at the st vincent de paul society or go on the relief
the room had a fireplace where we could boil water for our tea or an egg in case we ever came into money we had a table and three chairs and a bed which mam said was the biggest she had ever seen we were glad of the bed that night worn out after nights on floors in dublin and in grandmas it didnt matter that there were six of us in the bed we were together away from grandmothers and guards malachy could say ye ye ye and we could laugh as much as we liked
dad and mam lay at the head of the bed malachy and i at the bottom the twins wherever they could find comfort malachy made us laugh again ye ye ye he said and oy oy oy and then fell asleep mam made the little hink hink snore sound that told us she was sleeping in the moonlight i could look up the length of the bed and see dad still awake and when oliver cried in his sleep dad reached for him and held him whisht he said whisht
then eugene sat up screaming tearing at himself ah ah mommy mommy dad sat up what whats up son eugene went on crying and when dad leaped from the bed and turned on the gaslight we saw the fleas leaping jumping fastened to our flesh we slapped at them and slapped but they hopped from body to body hopping biting we tore at the bites till they bled we jumped from the bed the twins crying mam moaning
oh jesus will we have no rest dad poured water and salt into a jam jar and dabbed at our bites the salt burned but he said wed feel better
soon
mam sat by the fireplace with the twins on her lap dad pulled on
his trousers and dragged the mattress off the bed and out to the street he filled the kettle and the pot with water stood the mattress against the wall pounded it with a shoe told me to keep pouring water on the ground to drown the fleas dropping there the limerick moon was so bright i could see bits of it shimmering in the water and i wanted to scoop up moon bits but how could i with the fleas leaping on my legs dad kept pounding with the shoe and i had to run back through the house to the backyard tap for more water in the kettle and the pot mam said look at you your shoes are drenched and youll catch your death and your father will surely get the pneumonia without a shoe to his foot
a man on a bicycle stopped and wanted to know why dad was beating that mattress mother o god he said i never heard such a cure for fleas do you know that if a man could jump like a flea one lep would take him halfway to the moon the thing to do is this when you go back inside with that mattress stick it on the bed upside down and that will confuse the little buggers they wont know where they are and theyll be biting the mattress or each other which is the best cure of all after they bite the human being they have the frenzy you know for there are other fleas around them that also bit the human being and the smell of the blood is too much for them and they go out of their minds theyre a right bloody torment an i should know for didnt i grow up in limerick down in the irishtown an the fleas there were so plentiful an forward theyd sit on the toe of your boot an discuss irelands woeful history with you it is said there were no fleas in ancient ireland that they were brought in be the english to drive us out of our wits entirely ani wouldnt put it past the english anisnt it a very curious thing that st patrick drove the snakes out of ireland an the english brought in the fleas for centuries ireland was a lovely peaceful place snakes gone not a flea to be found you could stroll the four green fields of ireland without fear of snakes an have a good nights sleep with no fleas to bother you them snakes were doin no harm they wouldnt bother you unless you cornered them an they lived off other creatures that move under bushes ansuch places whereas the flea sucks the blood from you mornin noon an night for thats his nature an he cant help himself i hear for a fact that places that have snakes galore have no fleas arizona for instance youre forever hearing about the snakes of arizona but when did you ever hear of fleas in arizona good luck to you i have to be careful standin here for if one of them gets on my clothes i might as well invite his whole family home they multiply faster than hindus
dad said you wouldnt by any chance have a cigarette would you
a cigarette oh sure of course here you are arent i nearly destroyed from the fags myself the oul hacking cough you know so powerful it nearly knocks me off the bicycle i can feel that cough stirring in me solar plexus an workin its way up through me entrails till the next thing it takes off the top o me head
he struck a match on a box lit a cigarette for himself and held out the match for dad of course he said youre bound to have the cough when you live in limerick because this is the capital city of the weak chest and the weak chest leads to the consumption if all the people that has consumption in limerick were to die this would be a ghost town
though i dont have consumption meself no this cough was a present from the germans he paused puffed on his cigarette and struggled with a cough bejesus excuse the language but the fagsll get me in the end well ill leave you now to the mattress an remember what i told you confuse the little buggers
he wobbled away on his bicycle the cigarette dangling from his mouth the cough racking his body dad said limerickmen talk too much come on well put this mattress back and see if theres any sleep in this night
mam sat by the fireplace with the twins asleep on her lap and malachy lay curled up on the floor by her feet she said who was that you were talking to it sounded very like pa keating aggies husband i could tell by the cough he got that cough in france in the war when he swallowed the gas
we slept the rest of that night and in the morning we saw where the fleas had feasted our flesh pink with flea welts and bright with the blood of our scratches
mam made tea and fried bread and once more dad dabbed at our bites with the salty water he hauled the mattress outside again to the backyard on a cold day like this the fleas would surely freeze to death and wed all have a good nights sleep
a few days later when were settled into the room dad is shaking me out of my dreams up francis up put on your clothes and run over for your aunt aggie your mother needs her hurry
mam is moaning in the bed her face pure white dad has malachy and the twins out of the bed and sitting on the floor by the dead fire i run across the street and knock on aunt aggies door till uncle pat keating comes coughing and grumbling whats up whats up
my mother is moaning in the bed i think shes sick
now aunt aggie comes grumbling ye are nothing but trouble since ye came from america

four of us not a lost child anywhere and why cant they tell me whats wrong with my mother uncle pa comes back and the ambulance is right behind him a man comes in with a stretcher and after they carry mam away there are blood spots on the floor by the bed malachy bit his tongue and there was blood and the dog on the street had blood and he died i want to ask dad to tell me if mam will be gone forever like my sister margaret but hes going with mam and theres no use asking aunt aggie anything for fear shed bite your head off she wipes away the blood spots and tells us get back into bed and stay there till dad comes home
its the middle of the night and the four of us are warm in the bed and we fall asleep till dad comes home and tells us mam is nice and comfortable in the hospital and shell be home in no time
later dad goes to the labour exchange for the dole there is no hope of a laboring man with a north of ireland accent getting a job in limerick
when he returns he tells mam well be getting nineteen shillings a week she says thats just enough for all of us to starve on nineteen shillings for six of us thats less than four dollars in american money and how are we supposed to live on that what are we to do when we have to pay rent in a fortnight if the rent for this room is five shillings a week well have fourteen shillings for food and clothes and coal to boil the water for the tea
dad shakes his head sips his tea from a jam jar stares out the window and whistles the boys of wexford  malachy and oliver clap their hands and dance around the room and dad doesnt know whether to whistle or smile because you cant do both and he cant help himself he has to stop and smile and pat olivers head and then go back to the whistling mam smiles too but its a very quick smile and when she looks into the ashes you can see the worry where the corners of her mouth turn down
next day she tells dad to mind the twins and takes malachy and me with her to the st vincent de paul society we stand in a queue with women wearing black shawls they ask our names and smile when we talk they say lord above would you listen to the little yankees and they wonder why mam in her american coat would be looking for charity since theres hardly enough for the poor people of limerick without yanks coming over and taking the bread out of their mouths
mam tells them a cousin gave her that coat in brooklyn that her husband has no work that she has other children at home twin boys the women sniff and pull their shawls about them they have their own troubles mam tells them she had to leave america because she couldnt stand it after her baby girl died the women sniff again but now its because mam is crying some say they lost little ones too and theres nothing worse in the world you could live as long as methuselems wife but you never get over it no man can ever know what it is to be a mother that has lost a child not if the man lived longer than two methuselems
they all have a good cry till a redhaired woman passes a little box around the women pick something from the box between their fingers and stuff it up their noses a young woman sneezes and the redhaired woman laughs ah sure biddy youre not able for that snuff come here little yankee boys have a pinch she plants the brown stuff in our nostrils and we sneeze so hard the women stop crying and laugh till they have to wipe their eyes with their shawls mam tells us thats good for ye twill clear yeer heads
the young woman biddy tells mam were two lovely boys she points at malachy that little fella with the goldy ringlet isnt he gorgeous he could be a film star with shirley temple and malachy smiles and warms up the queue
the woman with the snuff says to mam missus i dont want to be forward but i think you should be sitting down for we heard about your
loss
another woman worries ah no they dont like that who dont like what
ah sure nora molloy the society dont like us sittin on the steps they want us to be standin respectful against the wall
they can kiss my arse says nora the redhaired woman sit down there missus on that step an ill sit next to you an if theres one word out of the st vincent de paul society ill take the face off em so i will do you smoke missus
i do says mam but i dont have them
nora takes a cigarette from a pocket in her apron breaks it and offers half to mam
the worried woman says they dont like that either they say every fag you smoke is taking food from the mouth of your child mr quinlivan inside is dead against it he says if you have money for the fags you have money for food
quinlivan can kiss my arse too the grinny oul bastard is he going to begrudge us a puff of a fag the only comfort we have in the world
a door opens at the end of the hall and a man appears are any of ye waiting for childrens boots
women raise their hands i am i am
well the boots are all gone yell have to come back next month but my mikey needs boots for school
theyre all gone i told you
but tis freezin abroad mr quinlivan
the boots are all gone nothing i can do whats this whos
smoking
nora waves her cigarette i am she says and enjoying it down to
the last ash
every puff you take he starts
i know she says im taking food out of the mouths of my children youre insolent woman youll get no charity here
is that a fact well mr quinlivan if i dont get it here i know
where i will
what are you talking about
ill go to the quakers theyll give me the charity
mr quinlivan steps toward nora and points a finger do you know
what we have here we have a souper in our midst we had the soupers in the famine the protestants went round telling good catholics that if they gave up their faith and turned protestant theyd get more soup than their bellies could hold and god help us some catholics took the soup and were ever after known as soupers and lost their immortal souls doomed to the deepest part of hell and you woman if you go to the quakers youll lose your immortal soul and the souls of your children
other
then mr quinlivan youll have to save us wont you
he stares at her and she stares back at him his eyes wander to the
women one puts her hand to her mouth to smother a laugh
what are you tittering about he barks
oh nothing mr quinlivan honest to god
im telling ye once more no boots and he slams the door behind
him
one by one the women are called into the room when nora comes out
shes smiling and waving a piece of paper boots she says three pairs im gettin for my children threaten the men in there with the quakers and theyll give you the drawers off their arses
when mam is called she brings malachy and me in with her we stand before a table where three men are sitting asking questions mr quinlivan starts to say something but the man in the middle says enough out of you quinlivan if we left it up to you wed have the poor people of limerick jumping into the arms of the protestants
he turns to mam he wants to know where she got that fine red coat she tells him what she told the women outside and when she comes to the death of margaret she shakes and sobs she tells the men shes very sorry for crying like that but it was only a few months ago and shes not over it yet not even knowing where her baby was buried if she was buried at all not knowing even if she was baptized itself because she was so weak from having the four boys she didnt have the energy to be going to the church for the baptism and its a heart scald to think margaret might be in limbo forever with no hope of her ever seeing the rest of us whether were in heaven hell or purgatory itself
mr quinlivan brings her his chair ah now missus ah now sit down will you ah now
the other men look at the table the ceiling the man in the middle says hes giving mam a docket to get a weeks groceries at mcgraths shop on parnell street there will be tea sugar flour milk butter and a separate docket for a bag of coal from suttons coal yard on the dock road
the third man says of course you wont be getting this every week missus we will be visiting your house to see if theres a real need we have to do that missus so we can review your claim
mam wipes her face on the back of her sleeve and takes the docket she tells the men god bless you for your kindness they nod and look at the table the ceiling the walls and tell her send in the next woman
the women outside tell mam when you go to mcgraths keep an eye on the oul bitch for shell cheat you on the weight shell put stuff on a paper on the scale with the paper hanging down on her side behind the counter where she thinks you cant see it shell pull on that paper so that youre lucky if you get half of what youre supposed to get and she has pictures of the virgin mary and the sacred heart of jesus all over the shop and shes forever on her knees abroad in st josephs chapel clackin her rosary beads an breathing like a virgin martyr the oul bitch
nora says ill go with you missus im on to the same mrs mcgrath and ill know if shes cheating you
she leads the way to the shop in parnell street the woman behind the counter is pleasant to mam in her american coat till mam shows the st vincent de paul docket the woman says i dont know what youre doing here at this hour of the day i never serve the charity cases before six in the evening but this is your first time and ill make an exception
she says to nora do you have a docket too
no im a friend helping this poor family with their first docket from the st vincent de paul
the woman lays a sheet of newspaper on the scale and pours on flour from a large bag when she finishes pouring she says theres a pound of flour
i dont think so says nora thats a very small pound of flour the woman flushes and glares are you accusin me
ah no mrs mcgrath says nora i think there was a little accident there the way your hip was pressed against that paper and you didnt even know the paper was pulled down a bit oh god no a woman like you thats forever on her knees before the virgin mary is an inspiration to us all and is that your money i see on the floor there
mrs mcgrath steps back quickly and the needle on the scale jumps and quivers what money she says till she looks at nora and knows nora smiles must be a trick of the shadows she says and smiles at the scale there was a mistake right enough for that shows barely half a pound of flour
that scale gives me more trouble says mrs mcgrath
im sure it does says nora
but my conscience is clear before god says mrs mcgrath
im sure it is says nora and youre admired by one and all at the
st vincent de paul society and the legion of mary
i try to be a good catholic
try god knows tis little trying youd have for youre well known
for having a kind heart and i was wondering if you could spare a couple of sweets for the little boys here
well now im not a millionaire but here
god bless you mrs mcgrath and i know its asking a lot but could you possibly lend me a couple of cigarettes
well now theyre not on the docket im not here to supply luxuries
if you could see your way missus id be sure to mention your kindness to the st vincent de paul
all right all right says mrs mcgrath here one time for the cigarettes and one time only
god bless you says nora and im sorry you had so much trouble with that scale
on the way home we stopped in the peoples park and sat on a bench while malachy and i sucked on our sweets and mam and nora smoked their cigarettes the smoking brought on noras cough and she told mam the fags would kill her in the end that there was a touch of consumption in her family and no one lived to a ripe old age though who would want to in limerick a place where you could look around and the first thing you noticed was a scarcity of gray hairs all the gray hairs either in the graveyard or across the atlantic working on railroads or sauntering around in police uniforms
youre lucky missus that you saw a bit of the world oh god id give anything to see new york people dancing up and down broadway without a care no i had to go and fall for a boozer with the charm peter molloy a champion pint drinker that had me up the pole and up the aisle when i was barely seventeen i was ignorant missus we grew up ignorant in limerick so we did knowing feck all about anything and signs on were mothers before were women and theres nothing here but rain and oul biddies saying the rosary id give me teeth to get out go to america or even england itself the champion pint drinker is always on the dole and sometimes he even drinks that and drives me so demented i wind up in the lunatic asylum
she drew on her cigarette and gagged coughing till her body rocked back and forth and in between the coughs she whimpered jesus jesus when the cough died away she said she had to go home and take her medicine she said ill see you next week missus at the st vincent de
paul if youre stuck for anything send a message to me at vizes field ask anyone for the wife of peter molloy champion pint drinker
eugene is sleeping under a coat on the bed dad sits by the fireplace with oliver on his lap i wonder why dad is telling oliver a cuchulain story he knows the cuchulain stories are mine but when i look at oliver i dont mind his cheeks are bright red hes staring into the dead fire and you can see he has no interest in cuchulain mam puts her hand on his forehead i think he has a fever she says i wish i had an onion and id boil it in milk and pepper thats good for the fever but even if i had what would i boil the milk on we need coal for that fire
she gives dad the docket for the coal down the dock road he takes me with him but its dark and all the coal yards are closed
what are we going to do now dad
i dont know son
ahead of us women in shawls and small children are picking up coal
along the road
there dad theres coal
och no son we wont pick coal off the road were not beggars he tells mam the coal yards are closed and well have to drink milk
and eat bread tonight but when i tell her about the women on the road she passes eugene to him
if youre too grand to pick coal off the road ill put on my coat and go down the dock road
she gets a bag and takes malachy and me with her beyond the dock road there is something wide and dark with lights glinting in it mam says thats the river shannon she says thats what she missed most of all in america the river shannon the hudson was lovely but the shannon sings i cant hear the song but my mother does and that makes her happy the other women are gone from the dock road and we search for the bits of coal that drop from lorries mam tells us gather anything that burns coal wood cardboard paper she says there are them that burn the horse droppings but were not gone that low yet when her bag is nearly full she says now we have to find an onion for oliver malachy says hell find one but she tells him no you dont find onions on the road you get them in shops
the minute he sees a shop he cries out theres a shop and runs
in
oonyen he says oonyen for oliver
mam runs into the shop and tells the women behind the counter im
sorry the woman says lord hes a dote is he an american or what mam says he is the woman smiles and shows two teeth one on each
side of her upper gum a dote she says and look at them gorgeous goldy curls and what is it he wants now a sweet
ah no says mam an onion
the woman laughs an onion i never heard a child wanting an onion before is that what they like in america
mam says i just mentioned i wanted to get an onion for my other child thats sick boil the onion in milk you know
true for you missus you cant beat the onion boiled in milk and look little boy heres a sweet for yourself and one for the other little boy the brother i suppose
mam says ah sure you shouldnt say thank you boys
the woman says heres a nice onion for the sick child missus
mam says oh i cant buy the onion now missus i dont have a penny on me

ah no i dont but i should be getting it any day now
well here missus pepper and a little salt do the child all the good in the world
mam says god bless you maam and her eyes are watery
dad is walking back and forth with oliver in his arms and eugene is playing on the floor with a pot and a spoon dad says did you get the onion
i did says mam and more i got coal and the way of lighting it i knew you would i said a prayer to st jude hes my favorite saint patron of desperate cases
i got the coal i got the onion no help from st jude
dad says you shouldnt be picking up coal off the road like a common beggar it isnt right bad example for the boys
then you should have sent st jude down the dock road
malachy says im hungry and im hungry too but mam says yell wait till oliver has his onion boiled in milk
she gets the fire going cuts the onion in half drops it in the boiling milk with a little butter and sprinkles the milk with pepper she takes oliver on her lap and tries to feed him but he turns away and looks into the fire
ah come on love she says good for you make you big and strong
he tightens his mouth against the spoon she puts the pot down rocks him till hes asleep lays him on the bed and tells the rest of us be quiet or shell demolish us she slices the other half of the onion and fries it in butter with slices of bread she lets us sit on the floor around the fire where we eat the fried bread and sip at the scalding sweet tea in jam jars she says that fire is good and bright so we can turn off that gaslight till we get money for the meter
the fire makes the room warm and with the flames dancing in the coal you can see faces and mountains and valleys and animals leaping eugene falls asleep on the floor and dad lifts him to the bed beside oliver mam puts the boiled onion pot up on the mantelpiece for fear a mouse or rat might be at it she says shes tired out from the day the vincent de paul society mrs mcgraths shop the search for coal down the dock road the worry over oliver not wanting the boiled onion and if hes like this tomorrow shes taking him to the doctor and now shes going to bed
soon were all in bed and if theres the odd flea i dont mind because its warm in the bed with the six of us and i love the glow of the fire the way it dances on the walls and ceiling and makes the room go red and black red and black till it dims to white and black and all you can hear is a little cry from oliver turning in my mothers arms
in the morning dad is lighting the fire making tea cutting the bread hes already dressed and hes telling mam hurry up and get dressed he says to me francis your little brother oliver is sick and were taking him to the hospital you are to be a good boy and take care of your two brothers well be back soon
mam says when were out go easy with that sugar were not millionaires
when mam picks up oliver and wraps him in a coat eugene stands on the bed i want ollie he says ollie play
ollie will be back soon she says and you can play with him now you can play with malachy and frank
ollie ollie i want ollie
he follows oliver with his eyes and when theyre gone he sits on the bed looking out the window malachy says genie genie we have bread we have tea sugar on your bread genie he shakes his head and pushes away the bread malachy is offering he crawls to the place where oliver slept with mam puts his head down and stares out the window
grandma is at the door i heard your father and mother were running down henry street with the child in their arms now where are they gone to
oliver is sick i said he wouldnt eat the boiled onion in milk what are you blatherin about

jesus mary and holy st joseph whats porridge porridge is
porridge thats what porridge is ye are the most ignorant bunch o yanks i ever seen come on put on yeer clothes and well go across the street to your aunt aggie shes there with the husband pa keating and shell give ye some porridge
she picks up eugene wraps him in her shawl and we cross the street to aunt aggies shes living with uncle pa again because he said she wasnt a fat cow after all
do you have any porridge grandma says to aunt aggie
porridge am i supposed to be feeding porridge to a crowd of yanks pity about you says grandma it wont kill you to give them a
little porridge
and i suppose theyll be wanting sugar and milk on top of
everything or they might be banging on my door looking for an egg if you dont mind i dont know why we have to pay for angelas mistakes
jesus says grandma tis a good thing you didnt own that stable in bethlehem or the holy family would still be wanderin the world crumblin with the hunger
grandma pushes her way past aunt aggie puts eugene on a chair near the fire and makes the porridge a man comes in from another room he has black curly hair and his skin is black and i like his eyes because theyre very blue and ready to smile hes aunt aggies husband the man who stopped the night we were attacking the fleas and told us all about fleas and snakes the man with the cough he got from swallowing gas in the war
malachy says why are you all black and uncle pa keating laughs and coughs so hard he has to ease himself with a cigarette oh the little yanks he says theyre not a bit shy im black because i work at the limerick gas works shoveling coal and coke into the furnaces gassed in france and back to limerick to work in the gas works when you grow up youll laugh
malachy and i have to leave the table so the big people can sit and have tea they have their tea but uncle pa keating who is my uncle because hes married to my aunt aggie picks up eugene and takes him on his lap he says this is a sad little fella and makes funny faces and silly sounds malachy and i laugh but eugene only reaches up to touch the blackness of pa keatings skin and then when pa pretends to bite his little hand eugene laughs and everyone in the room laughs malachy goes to eugene and tries to make him laugh even more but eugene turns away and hides his face in pa keatings shirt
i think he likes me says pa and thats when aunt aggie puts down her teacup and starts to bawl waah waah waah big teardrops tumbling down her fat red face
aw jesus says grandma there she is again whats up with you this time
and aunt aggie blubbers to see pa there with a child on his lap an me with no hope of having my own
grandma barks at her stop talkin like that in front of the children have you no shame when god is good and ready hell send you your family
aunt aggie sobs angela with five born an one just gone an her so useless she couldnt scrub a floor an me with none an i can scrub an clean with the best and make any class of a stew or a fry
pa keating laughs i think ill keep this little fella
malachy runs to him no no no thats my brother thats eugene and i say no no no thats our brother aunt aggie pats the tears on her cheeks she says i dont want nothing of angelas i dont want nothing thats half limerick and half north of ireland so i dont so ye can take him home ill have me own someday if i have to do a hundred novenas to the virgin mary and her mother st ann or if i have to crawl from here to lourdes on me two bended knees
grandma says thats enough ye have had yeer porridge and tis time to go home and see if yeer father and mother are back from the hospital
she puts on her shawl and goes to pick up eugene but he clutches so hard at pa keatings shirt she has to pull him away though he keeps looking back at pa till were out the door

we followed grandma back to our room she put eugene in the bed and gave him a drink of water she told him to be a good boy and go to sleep for his little brother oliver would be home soon and theyd be playing again there on the floor
but he kept looking out the window
she told malachy and me we could sit on the floor and play but to be quiet because she was going to say her prayers malachy went to the bed and sat by eugene and i sat on a chair at the table making out words on the newspaper that was our tablecloth all you could hear in the room was malachy whispering to make eugene happy and grandma mumbling to the click of her rosary beads it was so quiet i put my head on the table and fell asleep
dad is touching my shoulder come on francis you have to take care of your little brothers
mam is slumped on the edge of the bed making small crying sounds like a bird grandma is pulling on her shawl she says ill go down to
thompson the undertaker about the coffin and the carriage the st vincent de paul society will surely pay for that god knows
she goes out the door dad stands facing the wall over the fire beating on his thighs with his fists sighing och och och
dad frightens me with his och och och and mam frightens me with her small bird sounds and i dont know what to do though i wonder if anyone will light the fire in the grate so that we can have tea and bread because its a long time since we had the porridge if dad would move away from the fireplace i could light the fire myself all you need is paper a few bits of coal or turf and a match he wont move so i try to go around his legs while hes beating on his thighs but he notices me and wants to know why im trying to light the fire i tell him were all hungry and he lets out a crazy laugh hungry he says och francis your wee brother oliver is dead your wee sister is dead and your wee brother is dead
he picks me up and hugs me so hard i cry out then malachy cries my mother cries dad cries i cry but eugene stays quiet then dad sniffles well have a feast come on francis
he tells my mother well be back in awhile but she has malachy and eugene on her lap in the bed and she doesnt look up he carries me through the streets of limerick and we go from shop to shop with him asking for food or anything they can give to a family that has two children dead in a year one in america one in limerick and in danger of losing three more for the want of food and drink most shopkeepers shake their heads sorry for your troubles but you could go to the st vincent de paul society or get the public assistance
dad says hes glad to see the spirit of christ alive in limerick and they tell him they dont need the likes of him with his northern accent to be telling them about christ and he should be ashamed of himself dragging a child around like that like a common beggar a tinker a knacker
a few shopkeepers give bread potatoes tins of beans and dad says well go home now and you boys can eat something but we meet uncle pa keating and he tells dad hes very sorry for his troubles and would dad like to have a pint in this pub here
there are men sitting in this pub with great glasses of black stuff before them uncle pa keating and dad have the black stuff too they lift their glasses carefully and slowly drink there is creamy white stuff on their lips which they lick with little sighs uncle pa gets me a bottle of lemonade and dad gives me a piece of bread and i dont feel hungry anymore still i wonder how long well sit here with malachy and eugene hungry at home hours from the porridge which eugene didnt eat anyway
dad and uncle pa drink their glass of black stuff and have another uncle pa says frankie this is the pint this is the staff of life this is the best thing for nursing mothers and for those who are long weaned
he laughs and dad smiles and i laugh because i think thats what youre supposed to do when uncle pa says something he doesnt laugh when he tells the other men about oliver dying the other men tip their hats to dad sorry for your troubles mister and surely youll have a pint
dad says yes to the pints and soon hes singing roddy mccorley and kevin barry and song after song i never heard before and crying over his lovely little girl margaret that died in america and his little boy oliver dead beyond in the city home hospital it frightens me the way he
yells and cries and sings and i wish i could be at home with my three brothers no my two brothers and my mother
the man behind the bar says to dad i think now mister youve had enough were sorry for your troubles but you have to take that child home to his mother that must be heartbroken by the fire
dad says one one more pint just one eh and the man says no dad shakes his fist i did me bit for ireland and when the man comes out and takes dads arm dad tries to push him away
uncle pa says come on now malachy stop the blaguarding you have to go home to angela you have a funeral tomorrow and the lovely children waiting for you
but dad struggles till a few men push him out into the darkness uncle pa stumbles out with the bag of food come on he says well go back to your room
dad wants to go to another place for a pint but uncle pa says he has no more money dad says hell tell everyone his sorrows and theyll give him pints uncle pa says thats a disgraceful thing to do and dad cries on his shoulder youre a good friend he tells uncle pa he cries again till uncle pa pats him on the back its terrible terrible says uncle pa but youll get over this in time
dad straightens up and looks at him never he says never
next day we rode to the hospital in a carriage with a horse they put oliver in a white box that came with us in the carriage and we took him to the graveyard they put the white box into a hole in the ground and covered it with earth my mother and aunt aggie cried grandma looked angry dad uncle pa keating and uncle pat sheehan looked sad but did not cry and i thought that if youre a man you can cry only when you have the black stuff that is called the pint
i did not like the jackdaws that perched on trees and gravestones and i did not want to leave oliver with them i threw a rock at a jackdaw that waddled over toward olivers grave dad said i shouldnt throw rocks at jackdaws they might be somebodys soul i didnt know what a soul was but i didnt ask him because i didnt care oliver was dead and i hated jackdaws id be a man someday and id come back with a bag of rocks and id leave the graveyard littered with dead jackdaws
the morning after olivers burial dad went to the labour exchange to sign and collect the weeks dole nineteen shillings and sixpence he said hed be home by noon that hed get coal and make a fire that wed have rashers and eggs and tea in honor of oliver that we might even have a sweet or two
he wasnt home by noon or one or two and we boiled and ate the few potatoes the shopkeepers had given the day before he wasnt home anytime before the sun went down that day in may there was no sign of him till we heard him long after the pubs closed rolling along windmill street singing when all around a vigil keep the wests asleep the wests asleep alas and well may erin weep when connacht lies in slumber deep
there lake and plain smile fair and free mid rocks their guardian chivalry
sing oh let man learn liberty
from crashing wind and lashing sea
he stumbled into the room hanging on to the wall a snot oozed from his nose and he wiped it away with the back of his hand he tried to speak zeeze shildren should be in bed lishen to me shildren go to bed
mam faced him these children are hungry wheres the dole money well get fish and chips so theyll have something in their bellies when they go to sleep
she tried to stick her hands into his pockets but he pushed her away have respheck he said reshpeck in front of shildren
she struggled to get at his pockets wheres the money the children are hungry you mad oul bastard did you drink all the money again just what you did in brooklyn
he blubbered och poor angela and poor wee margaret and poor wee oliver
he staggered to me and hugged me and i smelled the drink i used to smell in america my face was wet from his tears and his spit and his snot and i was hungry and i didnt know what to say when he cried all over my head
then he let me go and hugged malachy still going on about the wee sister and the wee brother cold in the ground and how we all have to pray and be good how we have to be obedient and do what our mother tells us he said we have our troubles but its time for malachy and me to start school because theres nothing like an education it will stand to you in the end and you have to get ready to do your bit for ireland

mam says she cant spend another minute in that room on windmill street she cant sleep with the memory of oliver in that room oliver in the bed oliver playing on the floor oliver sitting on dads lap by the fire she says its not good for eugene to be in that place that a twin will suffer more over the loss of his brother than even a mother can understand theres a room going on hartstonge street with two beds instead of the one we have here for the six of us no the five of us were getting that room and to make sure shes going to the labour exchange on thursday to stand in the queue to take the dole money the minute its handed to dad he says she cant do that hed be disgraced with the other men the labour exchange is a place for men not for women taking the money from under their noses she says pity about you if you didnt squander the money in the pubs i wouldnt have to follow you the way i did in brooklyn
he tells her hell be shamed forever she says she doesnt care she wants that room on hartstonge street a nice warm comfortable room with a lavatory down the hall like the one in brooklyn a room without fleas and the dampness that kills she wants that room because its on the same street as leamys national school and malachy and i can come home at the dinner hour which is noon for a cup of tea and a cut of fried bread
on thursday mam follows dad to the labour exchange she marches in behind him and when the man pushes the money toward dad she takes it the other men on the dole nudge each other and grin and dad is disgraced because a woman is never supposed to interfere with a mans dole money he might want to put sixpence on a horse or have a pint and if all the women start acting like mam the horses will stop running and guinness will go broke but she has the money now and we move to hartstonge street then she carries eugene in her arms and we go up the street to leamys national school the headmaster mr scallan says we are to
return on monday with a composition book a pencil and a pen with a good nib on it we are not to come to school with ringworm or lice and our noses are to be blown at all times not on the floor that spreads the consumption or on our sleeves but in a handkerchief or a clean rag he asks us if we are good boys and when we say we are he says good lord whats this are they yanks or what
mam tells him about margaret and oliver and he says lord above lord above theres great suffering in the world anyway well put the little fellow malachy in the infants class and his brother in first class theyre in the same room with one master monday morning then nine oclock prompt
the boys in leamys want to know why we talk like that are ye yanks or what and when we tell them we came from america they want to know are ye gangsters or cowboys
a big boy sticks his face up to mine im asking ye a question he says are ye gangsters or cowboys
i tell him i dont know and when he pokes his finger into my chest malachy says im a gangster franks a cowboy the big boy says your little brother is smart and youre a stupid yank
the boys around him are excited fight they yell fight and he pushes me so hard i fall i want to cry but the blackness comes over me the way it did with freddie leibowitz and i rush at him kicking and punching i knock him down and try to grab his hair to bang his head on the ground but theres a sharp sting across the backs of my legs and im pulled away from him
mr benson the master has me by the ear and hes whacking me across the legs you little hooligan he says is that the kind of behavior you brought from america well by god youll behave yourself before im done with you
he tells me hold out one hand and then the other and hits me with his stick once on each hand go home now he says and tell your mother what a bad boy you were youre a bad yank say after me im a bad boy
im a bad boy
now say im a bad yank
im a bad yank
malachy says hes not a bad boy its that big boy he said we
were cowboys and gangsters
is that what you did heffernan
i was only jokin sir
no more joking heffernan its not their fault that theyre yanks tisnt sir
and you heffernan should get down on your two knees every night
and thank god youre not a yank for if you were heffernan youd be the greatest gangster on two sides of the atlantic al capone would be coming to you for lessons youre not to be bothering these two yanks anymore heffernan
i wont sir
and if you do heffernan ill hang your pelt on the wall now go home all of ye
there are seven masters in leamys national school and they all have leather straps canes blackthorn sticks they hit you with the sticks on the shoulders the back the legs and especially the hands if they hit you on the hands its called a slap they hit you if youre
late if you have a leaky nib on your pen if you laugh if you talk and if you dont know things
they hit you if you dont know why god made the world if you dont know the patron saint of limerick if you cant recite the apostles creed if you cant add nineteen to fortyseven if you cant subtract nineteen from fortyseven if you dont know the chief towns and products of the thirtytwo counties of ireland if you cant find bulgaria on the wall map of the world thats blotted with spit snot and blobs of ink thrown by angry pupils expelled forever
they hit you if you cant say your name in irish if you cant say the hail mary in irish if you cant ask for the lavatory pass in irish it helps to listen to the big boys ahead of you they can tell you
about the master you have now what he likes and what he hates
one master will hit you if you dont know that eamon de valera is
the greatest man that ever lived another master will hit you if you dont know that michael collins was the greatest man that ever lived
mr benson hates america and you have to remember to hate america or hell hit you
mr odea hates england and you have to remember to hate england or hell hit you
if you ever say anything good about oliver cromwell theyll all hit
you
even if they slap you six times on each hand with the ash plant or
the blackthorn with the knobs you must not cry youll be a sissy there are boys who might jeer at you and mock you on the street but even they have to be careful because the day will come when the master hits and slaps them and they have to keep the tears behind their eyes or be disgraced forever some boys say it is better to cry because that pleases the masters if you dont cry the masters hate you because youve made them look weak before the class and they promise themselves the next time they have you up theyll draw tears or blood or both
big boys in fifth class tell us mr odea likes to get you in front of the class so that he can stand behind you pinch your sideburns which are called cossicks pull up on them up up he says till youre on tiptoe and the tears are filling your eyes you dont want the boys in the class to see you cry but pulling on the cossicks makes the tears come whether you like it or not and the master likes that mr odea is the one master who can always bring the tears and the shame
it is better not to cry because you have to stick with the boys in the school and you never want to give the masters any satisfaction
if the master hits you theres no use complaining to your father or mother they always say you deserve it dont be a baby
i know oliver is dead and malachy knows oliver is dead but eugene is too small to know anything when he wakes in the morning he says ollie ollie and toddles around the room looking under the beds or he climbs up on the bed by the window and points to children on the street especially children with fair hair like him and oliver ollie ollie he says and mam picks him up sobs hugs him he struggles to get down because he doesnt want to be picked up and hugged he wants to find oliver
dad and mam tell him oliver is in heaven playing with angels and well all see him again someday but he doesnt understand because hes only two and doesnt have the words and thats the worst thing in the whole world
malachy and i play with him we try to make him laugh we make funny faces we put pots on our heads and pretend to let them fall off we run across the room and pretend to fall down we take him to the peoples park to see the lovely flowers play with dogs roll in the grass
he sees small children with fair hair like oliver he doesnt say ollie anymore he only points
dad says eugene is lucky to have brothers like malachy and me because we help him forget and soon with gods help hell have no memory of oliver at all

he died anyway
six months after oliver went we woke on a mean november morning
and there was eugene cold in the bed beside us dr troy came and said that child died of pneumonia and why wasnt he in the hospital long ago dad said he didnt know and mam said she didnt know and dr troy said thats why children die people dont know he said if malachy or i showed the slightest sign of a cough or the faintest rattle in the throat we were to be brought to him no matter what time of day or night we were to be kept dry at all times because there seemed to be a bit of a weakness in the chest in this family he told mam he was very sorry for her troubles and hed give her a prescription for something to ease the pain of the days to come he said god was asking too much too damn much
grandma came over to our room with aunt aggie she washed eugene and aunt aggie went to a shop for a little white gown and a set of rosary beads they dressed him in a white gown and laid him on the bed by the window where he used to look out for oliver they placed his hands on his chest one hand on top of the other bound in the little white rosary beads grandma brushed the hair back from his eyes and forehead and she said doesnt he have lovely soft silky hair mam went to the bed and pulled a blanket over his legs to keep him warm grandma and aunt aggie looked at each other and said nothing dad stood at the end of the bed beating his fists against his thighs talking to eugene telling him och it was the river shannon that harmed you the dampness from that river that came and took you and oliver grandma said will you stop that youre making the whole house nervous she took dr troys prescription and told me run over to oconnor the chemist for the pills that there would be no charge due to the kindness of dr troy dad said hed come with me that wed go to the jesuit church and say a prayer for margaret and oliver and eugene all happy in heaven the chemist gave us the pills we stopped to say the prayers and when we returned to the room grandma gave dad money to bring a few bottles of stout from the pub mam said no no but grandma said he doesnt have the pills to ease him god help us and a bottle of stout will be some small comfort then she told him hed have to go to the undertaker tomorrow to bring the coffin back in a carriage she told me to go with my father and make sure he didnt stay in the pub all night and drink all the money dad said och frankie shouldnt be in pubs and she said then dont stay there he put on his cap and we went to souths pub and he told me at the door i could go home now that hed be home after one pint i said no and he said dont be disobedient go home to your poor mother i said no and he said i was a bad boy and god would be displeased i said i wasnt going home without him and he said och what is the world coming to he had one quick pint of porter in the pub and we went home with the bottles
of stout pa keating was in our room with a small bottle of whiskey and bottles of stout and uncle pat sheehan brought two bottles of stout for himself uncle pat sat on the floor with his arms around his bottles and he kept saying theyre mine theyre mine for fear theyd be taken from him people who were dropped on their heads always worry someone will steal their stout grandma said all right pat drink your stout yourself no one will bother you she and aunt aggie sat on the bed by eugene pa keating sat at the kitchen table drinking his stout and offering everyone a sip of his whiskey mam took her pills and sat by the fire with malachy on her lap she kept saying malachy had hair like eugene and aunt aggie said no he did not till grandma drove her elbow into aunt aggies chest and told her shut up dad stood against the wall drinking his stout between the fireplace and the bed with eugene pa keating told stories and the big people laughed even though they didnt want to laugh or they werent supposed to laugh in the presence of a dead child he said when he was in the english army in france the germans sent gas over which made him so sick they had to take him to the hospital they kept him in the hospital a while and then sent him back to the trenches english soldiers were sent home but they didnt give a fiddlers fart about the irish soldiers whether they lived or died instead of dying pa made a vast fortune he said he solved one of the great problems of trench warfare in the trenches it was so wet and muddy they had no way of boiling the water for the tea he said to himself jasus i have all this gas in my system and tis a great pity to waste it so he shoved a pipe up his arse lit a match to it and there in a second he had a fine flame ready to boil water in any billycan tommies came running from trenches all around when they heard the news and they gave him any amount of money if hed let them boil water he made so much money he was able to bribe the generals to let him out of the army and off he went to paris where he had a fine time drinking wine with artists and models he had such a high time of it he spent all his money and when he came back to limerick the only job he could get was in the gas works shoveling coal into the furnaces he said there was so much gas in his system now he could supply light to a small town for a year aunt aggie sniffed and said that was not a proper story to be telling in the presence of a dead child and grandma said it was better to have a story like that than to be sitting around with the long face uncle pat sheehan sitting on the floor with his stout said he was going to sing a song more power to you said pa keating and uncle pat sang the road to rasheen  he kept saying rasheen rasheen mavourneen mean and the song made no sense because his father dropped him on his head long ago and every time he sang that song he had different words grandma said that was a fine song and pa keating said caruso better look over his shoulder dad went over to the bed in the corner where he slept with mam he sat on the edge put his bottle on the floor covered his face with his hands and cried he said frank frank come here and i had to go to him so that he could hug me the way mam was hugging malachy grandma said we better go now and sleep a bit before the funeral tomorrow they each knelt by the bed and said a prayer and kissed eugenes forehead dad put me down stood up and nodded to them as they left when they were gone he lifted each of the stout bottles to his mouth and drained it he ran his finger inside the whiskey bottle and licked it he turned down the flame in the paraffin oil lamp on the table and said it was time for malachy and me to be in bed wed have to sleep with him and mam that
night as little eugene would be needing the bed for himself it was dark in the room now except for the sliver of streetlight that fell on eugenes lovely soft silky hair
dad lights the fire in the morning makes the tea toasts the bread in the fire he brings mams toast and tea but she waves it away and turns to the wall he brings malachy and me to eugene to kneel and say a prayer he says the prayers of one child like us are worth more in heaven than the prayers of ten cardinals and forty bishops he shows us how to bless ourselves in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost amen and he says dear god this is what you want isnt it you want my son eugene you took his brother oliver you took his sister margaret im not supposed to question that am i dear god above i dont know why children have to die but that is your will you told the river to kill and the shannon killed could you at last be merciful could you leave us the children we have that is all we ask amen
he helps malachy and me wash our heads and feet so that well be clean for eugenes funeral we have to be very quiet even when he hurts us cleaning our ears with the corner of the towel we brought from america we have to be quiet because eugene is there with his eyes closed and we dont want him to be waking up and looking out the window for oliver
grandma comes and tells mam she has to get up there are children dead she says but there are children alive and they need their mother she brings mam a little tea in a mug to wash down the pills that ease the pain dad tells grandma its thursday and he has to go to the labour exchange for the dole and then down to the undertaker to bring the mourning carriage and the coffin grandma tells him to take me with him but he says its better for me to stay with malachy so that i can pray for my little brother dead in the bed grandma says is it coddin me you are pray for a little child thats barely two and already playing with his little brother in heaven youll take your son with you and hell remind you this is no day for the pubs she looks at him and he looks at her and he puts on his cap
at the labour exchange we stand at the end of the queue till a man comes from behind the counter and tells dad hes very sorry for his troubles and he should go ahead of everyone else on this sorrowful day men touch their caps and say theyre sorry for his troubles and some pat my head and give me pennies twentyfour pennies two shillings dad tells me im rich now and i should buy myself a sweet while he goes into this place for a minute i know this place is a pub and i know he wants to get the black stuff that is called a pint but i dont say anything because i want to go to the shop next door for a piece of toffee i chew my toffee till it melts and leaves my mouth all sweet and sticky dad is still in the pub and i wonder if i should get another piece of toffee as long as hes in there with the pint im about to give the money to the woman in the shop when my hand is slapped down and theres aunt aggie raging is this what you do she says on the day of your brothers funeral gorgin yourself on sweets and wheres that father of yours
hes hes in the pub
of course hes in the pub you out here stuffin yourself with sweets and him in there gettin himself into a staggerin condition the day your poor little brother goes to the graveyard
she tells the shop woman just like his father the same odd manner the same oul northern jaw she tells me get into that pub and tell my father to stop the drinking and get the coffin and the carriage she will not set foot inside the pub for the drink is the curse of this poor godforsaken country
dad is sitting at the back of the pub with a man who has a dirty face and hair growing out of his nose theyre not talking but staring straight ahead and their black pints are resting on a small white coffin on the seat between them i know thats eugenes coffin because oliver had one like it and i want to cry when i see the black pints on top of it im sorry now i ever ate that toffee and i wish i could take it out of my stomach and give it back to the woman in the shop because its not right to be eating toffee when eugene is dead in the bed and im frightened by the two black pints on his white coffin the man with dad is saying no mister you cant leave a childs coffin in a carriage no more i did that once went in for a pint and they robbed that little coffin out of the bloody carriage can you credit that it was empty thank god but there you are desperate times we live in desperate the man with dad lifts his pint and takes a long swallow and when he puts his glass down theres a hollow sound in the coffin dad nods at me well be going in a minute son but when he goes to put his glass on the coffin after the long swallow i push it away
thats eugenes coffin ill tell mam you put your glass on eugenes coffin
now son now son
dad thats eugenes coffin the other man says will we have another pint mister
dad says to me wait outside another few minutes francis no
dont be a bad boy
no
the other man says by jesus if that was my son id kick his arse from here to the county kerry he have no right to be talkin to his father in that manner on a sorrowful day if a man cant have a pint the day of a funeral whats the use of livin at all at all
dad says all right well go
they finish their pints and wipe the wet brown stains off the coffin with their sleeves the man climbs up to the drivers seat of the carriage and dad and i ride inside he has the coffin on his lap and he presses it against his chest at home our room is filled with big people mam grandma aunt aggie her husband pa keating uncle pat sheehan uncle tom sheehan who is mams oldest brother and who never came near us before because he hates people from the north of ireland uncle tom has his wife jane with him shes from galway and people say she has the look of a spaniard and thats why no one in the family talks to her
the man takes the coffin from dad and when he brings it into the room mam moans oh no oh god no the man tells grandma hell be back in awhile to take us to the graveyard grandma tells him hed better not come back to this house in a drunken state because this child thats going to the graveyard suffered greatly and deserves a bit of dignity and she wont put up with a driver thats drunk and ready to fall out of the high seat
the man says missus i drove dozens o children to the graveyard an never once fell out of any seat high or low
the men are drinking stout from bottles again and the women are sipping sherry from jam jars uncle pat sheehan tells everyone this is my stout this is my stout and grandma says tis all right pat no one will take your stout then he says he wants to sing the road to rasheen till pa keating says no pat you cant sing on the day of a funeral you can sing the night before but uncle pat keeps saying this is my stout and i want to sing the road to rasheen  and everyone knows he talks like that because he was dropped on his head he starts to sing his song but stops when grandma takes the lid off the coffin and mam sobs oh jesus oh jesus will it ever stop will i be left with one child
mam is sitting on a chair at the head of the bed shes stroking eugenes hair and face and hands she tells him that of all the children in the world he was the sweetest and the most delicate and loving she tells him tis a terrible thing to lose him but isnt he in heaven now with his brother and his sister and isnt that a comfort to us knowing oliver is no longer lonesome for his twin still she puts her head down next to eugene and cries so hard all the women in the room cry with her she cries till pa keating tells her we have to go before the darkness falls that we cant be in graveyards in the dark
grandma whispers to aunt aggie wholl put the child in the coffin and aunt aggie whispers i wont thats the job for the mother
uncle pat hears them ill put the child in the coffin he says he limps to the bed and places his arms around mams shoulders she looks up at him and her face is drenched he says ill put the child in the coffin angela
oh pat she says pat
i can do it he says sure hes only a small child an i never lifted a small child before in my life i never had a small child in me arms i wont drop him angela i wont honest to god i wont
i know you wont pat i know you wont
ill lift him an i wont be singinthe road to rasheen
i know you wont pat mam says
pat pulls down the blanket mam put there to keep eugene warm
eugenes feet are white and bright with little blue veins pat bends over picks up eugene and holds him against his chest he kisses eugenes forehead and then everyone in the room kisses eugene he places eugene in the coffin and steps back we are all gathered around looking at eugene for the last time
uncle pat says see i didnt drop him angela and she touches his
face
aunt aggie goes to the pub for the driver he puts the lid on the
coffin and screws it down he says whos comin in the carriage and takes the coffin to the carriage theres room only for mam and dad malachy and me grandma says ye go ahead to the graveyard and well wait here
i dont know why we cant keep eugene i dont know why they have to send him away with that man who puts his pint on the white coffin i dont know why they had to send margaret away and oliver it is a bad thing to put my sister and my brothers in a box and i wish i could say something to someone
the horse clopclopped through the streets of limerick malachy said are we going to see oliver and dad said no oliver is in heaven and dont ask me what heaven is because i dont know
mam said heaven is a place where oliver and eugene and margaret are happy and warm and well see them there some day
malachy said the horse did his doodoo on the street and there was a smell and mam and dad had to smile
at the graveyard the driver climbs down and opens the door of the carriage gimme that coffin he says an ill carry it up to the grave he yanks at the coffin and stumbles mam says youre not carrying my child in the condition youre in she turns to dad you carry him she says do what you like says the driver
do what you bloody well like and he climbs up to his seat
its getting dark now and the coffin seems whiter than ever in dads arms mam takes our hands and we follow dad through the graves the jackdaws are quiet in the trees because their day is nearly over and they have to rest so that they can get up early in the morning and feed their babies
two men with shovels are waiting by a small open grave one man says ye are very late good thing this is a small job or wed be gone he climbs into the grave hand it to me he says and dad hands him the coffin
the man sprinkles some straw and grass on the coffin and as he climbs out the other man shovels in the earth mam lets out a long cry oh jesus jesus and a jackdaw croaks in a tree i wish i had a rock to hit that jackdaw when the men finish shoveling in the earth they wipe their foreheads and wait one says ah well now theres usually a little something for the thirst thats in it
dad says oh yes yes and gives them money they say sorry for your troubles and they leave
we make our way back to the carriage at the graveyard gate but the carriage is gone dad looks around in the darkness and comes back shaking his head mam says that driver is nothing but a dirty old drunkard god forgive me
its a long walk from the graveyard to our room mam tells dad these children need some nourishment and you have money left from the dole this morning if youre thinking of going to the pubs tonight you can forget it were taking them to naughtons and they can have fish and chips and lemonade for tisnt every day they bury a brother
the fish and chips are delicious with vinegar and salt and the lemonade is tart in our throats
when we get home the room is empty there are empty stout bottles on the table and the fire is out dad lights the paraffin oil lamp and you can see the hollow left in the pillow by eugenes head you expect to hear him and see him toddling across the room climbing up on the bed to look out the window for oliver
dad tells mam hes going out for a walk she says no she knows what hes up to that he cant wait to spend his last few shillings in the pubs all right he says he lights the fire and mam makes tea and soon were in bed
malachy and i are back in the bed where eugene died i hope hes not cold in that white coffin in the graveyard though i know hes not there anymore because angels come to the graveyard and open the coffin and hes far from the shannon dampness that kills up in the sky in heaven with oliver and margaret where they have plenty of fish and chips and toffee and no aunts to bother you where all the fathers bring home
the money from the labour exchange and you dont have to be running around to pubs to find them
iii
mam says she cant spend another minute in that room on hartstonge street she sees eugene morning noon and night she sees him climbing the bed to look out at the street for oliver and sometimes she sees oliver outside and eugene inside the two of them chatting away shes happy theyre chatting like that but she doesnt want to be seeing and hearing them the rest of her life its a shame to move when were so near leamys national school but if she doesnt move soon shell go out of her mind and wind up in the lunatic asylum
we move to roden lane on top of a place called barrack hill there are six houses on one side of the lane one on the opposite side the houses are called two up two down two rooms on top two on the bottom our house is at the end of the lane the last of the six next to our door is a small shed a lavatory and next to that a stable
mam goes to the st vincent de paul society to see if theres any chance of getting furniture the man says hell give us a docket for a table two chairs and two beds he says well have to go to a second hand furniture shop down in the irishtown and haul the furniture home ourselves mam says we can use the pram she had for the twins and when she says that she cries she wipes her eyes on her sleeves and asks the man if the beds were getting are secondhand he says of course they are and she says shes very worried about sleeping in beds someone might have died in especially if they had the consumption the man says im very sorry but beggars cant be choosers
it takes us all day to haul the furniture on the pram from one end of limerick to the other there are four wheels on the pram but one is bockety it wants to go in a different direction we have two beds one sideboard with a mirror a table and two chairs were happy with the house we can walk from room to room and up and down the stairs you feel very rich when you can go up and down the stairs all day as much as you please dad lights the fire and mam makes the tea he sits at the table on one chair she sits on the other and malachy and i sit on the trunk we brought from america while were drinking our tea an old man passes our door with a bucket in his hand he empties the bucket into the lavatory and flushes and theres a powerful stink in our kitchen mam goes to the door and says why are you emptying your bucket in our lavatory he raises his cap to her your lavatory missus ah no youre making a bit of a mistake there ha ha this is not your lavatory sure isnt this the lavatory for the whole lane youll see passing your door here the buckets of eleven families and i can tell you it gets very powerful here in the warm weather very powerful altogether tis december now thank god with a chill in the air and christmas around the corner and the lavatory isnt that bad but the day will come when youll be calling for a gas mask so good night to you missus and i hope youll be happy in your house
mam says wait a minute sir could you tell me who cleans this lavatory
cleans ah jasus thats a good one cleans she says is it joking you are these houses were built in the time of queen victoria herself and if this lavatory was ever cleaned it must have been done by someone in the middle of the night when no one was lookin
and he shuffles up the lane laughing away to himself
mam comes back to her chair and her tea we cant stay here she says that lavatory will kill us with all diseases
dad says we cant move again where will we get a house for six shillings a week well keep the lavatory clean ourselves well boil buckets of water and throw them in there
oh will we says mam and where will we get the coal or turf or blocks to be boiling water
dad says nothing he finishes his tea and looks for a nail to hang our one picture the man in the picture has a thin face he wears a yellow skullcap and a black robe with a cross on his chest dad says he was a pope leo the thirteenth a great friend of the workingman he brought this picture all the way from america where he found it thrown out by someone who had no time for the workingman mam says hes talking a lot of bloody nonsense and he says she shouldnt say bloody in front of the children dad finds a nail but wonders how hes going to get it into the wall without a hammer mam says he could go borrow one from the people next door but he says you dont go around borrowing from people you dont know he leans the picture against the wall and drives the nail with the bottom of a jam jar the jam jar breaks and cuts his hand and a blob of blood falls on the popes head he wraps his hand in the dish rag and tells mam quick quick wipe the blood off the pope before it dries she tries to wipe the blood away with her sleeve but its wool and spreads the blood till the whole side of the popes face is smeared dad says lord above angela youve destroyed the pope entirely and she says arrah stop your whining well get some paint and go over his face some day and dad says hes the only pope that was ever a friend to the workingman and what are we to say if someone from the st vincent de paul society comes in and sees blood all over him mam says i dont know its your blood and tis a sad thing when a man cant even drive a nail straight it just goes to show how useless you are youd be better off digging fields and anyway i dont care i have pain in my back and im going to bed
och what am i going to do dad says
take down the pope and hide him in the coal hole under the stairs where he wont be seen and hell be out of harms way
i cant says dad it would be bad luck coal hole is no place for a pope when the pope is up hes up
suit yourself says mam
i will says dad
this is our first christmas in limerick and the girls are out in
the lane skipping rope and singing christmas is coming and the goose is getting fat please put a penny in the old mans hat
if you havent a penny
a hapenny will do
and if you havent a hapenny
god bless you
boys tease the girls and call out
may your mother have an accident
abroad in the loo
mam says shed like to have a nice christmas dinner but what can you do when the labour exchange reduces the dole to sixteen shillings after oliver and eugene died you pay the rent of six shillings you have ten shillings left and what use is that to four people
dad cant get any work he gets up early on weekdays lights the fire boils water for the tea and his shaving mug he puts on a shirt and attaches a collar with studs he puts on his tie and his cap and goes to the labour exchange to sign for the dole he will never leave the house without collar and tie a man without collar and tie is a man with no respect for himself you never know when the clerk at the labour exchange might tell you theres a job going at ranks flour mills or the limerick cement company and even if its a laboring job what will they think if you appear without collar and tie
bosses and foremen always show him respect and say theyre ready to hire him but when he opens his mouth and they hear the north of ireland accent they take a limerickman instead thats what he tells mam by the fire and when she says why dont you dress like a proper workingman he says hell never give an inch never let them know and when she says why cant you try to talk like a limerickman he says hell never sink that low and the greatest sorrow of his life is that his sons are now afflicted with the limerick accent she says sorry for your troubles and i hope thats all youll ever have and he says that some day with gods help well get out of limerick and far from the shannon that kills
i ask dad what afflicted means and he says sickness son and things that dont fit
when hes not looking for work dad goes for long walks miles into the country he asks farmers if they need any help that he grew up on a farm and can do anything if they hire him he goes to work right away with his cap on and his collar and tie he works so hard and long the farmers have to tell him to stop they wonder how a man can work through a long hot day with no thought of food or drink dad smiles he never brings home the money he earns on farms that money seems to be different from the dole which is supposed to be brought home he takes the farm money to the pub and drinks it if hes not home when the angelus rings at six oclock mam knows he had a day of work she hopes he might think of his family and pass the pub even once but he never does she hopes he might bring home something from the farm potatoes cabbage turnips carrots but hell never bring home anything because hed never stoop so low as to ask a farmer for anything mam says tis all right for her to be begging at the st vincent de paul society for a docket for food but he cant stick a few spuds in his pocket he says its different for a man you have to keep the dignity wear your collar and tie keep up the appearance and never ask for anything mam says i hope it keeps fine for you
when the farm money is gone he rolls home singing and crying over ireland and his dead children mostly about ireland if he sings roddy mccorley it means he had only the price of a pint or two if he sings kevin barry it means he had a good day that he is now falling down drunk and ready to get us out of bed line us up and make us promise to die for ireland unless mam tells him leave us alone or shell brain him with the poker
you wouldnt do that angela
i would and more you better stop the nonsense and go to bed
bed bed bed whats the use of going to bed if i go to bed ill
only have to get up again and i cant sleep in a place where theres a river sending poison to us in mist and fog
he goes to bed pounds the wall with his fist sings a woeful song falls asleep hes up at daylight because no one should sleep beyond the dawn he wakes malachy and me and were tired from being kept up the night before with his talking and singing we complain and say were sick were tired but he pulls back the overcoats that cover us and forces us out on the floor its december and its freezing and we can see our breath we pee into the bucket by the bedroom door and run down stairs for the warmth of the fire dad has already started we wash our faces and hands in a basin that sits under the water tap by the door the pipe that leads to the tap has to be held to the wall by a piece of twine looped around a nail everything around the tap is damp the floor the wall the chair the basin sits on the water from the tap is icy and our fingers turn numb dad says this is good for us it will make men of us he throws the icy water on his face and neck and chest to show theres nothing to fear we hold our hands to the fire for the heat thats in it but we cant stay there long because we have to drink our tea and eat our bread and go to school dad makes us say grace before meals and grace after meals and he tells us be good boys at school because god is watching every move and the slightest disobedience will send us straight to hell where well never have to worry about the cold again
and he smiles
two weeks before christmas malachy and i come home from school in a heavy rain and when we push in the door we find the kitchen empty the table and chairs and trunk are gone and the fire is dead in the grate the pope is still there and that means we havent moved again dad would never move without the pope the kitchen floor is wet little pools of water all around and the walls are twinkling with the damp theres a noise upstairs and when we go up we find dad and mam and the missing furniture its nice and warm there with a fire blazing in the grate mam sitting in the bed and dad reading the irish press and smoking a cigarette by the fire mam tells us there was a terrible flood that the rain came down the lane and poured in under our door they tried to stop it with rags but they only turned sopping wet and let the rain in people emptying their buckets made it worse and there was a sickening stink in the kitchen she thinks we should stay upstairs as long as there is rain well be warm through the winter months and then we can go downstairs in the springtime if there is any sign of a dryness in the walls or the floor dad says its like going away on our holidays to a warm foreign place like italy thats what well call the upstairs from now on italy malachy says the pope is still on the wall downstairs and hes going to be all cold and couldnt we bring him up but mam says no hes going to stay where he is because i dont want him on the wall glaring at me in the bed isnt it enough that we dragged him all the way from brooklyn to belfast to dublin to limerick all i want now is a little peace ease and comfort
mam takes malachy and me to the st vincent de paul society to stand in the queue and see if theres any chance of getting something for the christmas dinnera goose or a ham but the man says everyone in
limerick is desperate this christmas he gives her a docket for groceries at mcgraths shop and another one for the butcher
no goose says the butcher no ham no fancy items when you bring the docket from the st vincent de paul what you can have now missus is black pudding and tripe or a sheeps head or a nice pigs head no harm in a pigs head missus plenty of meat and children love it slice that cheek slather it with mustard and youre in heaven though i suppose they wouldnt have the likes of that in america where theyre mad for the steak and all classes of poultry flying walking or swimming itself
he tells mam no she cant have boiled bacon or sausages and if she has any sense shell take the pigs head before theyre all gone the way the poor people of limerick are clamoring for them
mam says the pigs head isnt right for christmas and he says tis more than the holy family had in that cold stable in bethlehem long ago you wouldnt find them complaining if someone offered them a nice fat pigs head
no they wouldnt complain says mam but theyd never eat the pigs head they were jewish
and what does that have to do with it a pigs head is a pigs head
and a jew is a jew and tis against their religion and i dont blame them
the butcher says are you a bit of an expert missus on the jews and the pig
i am not says mam but there was a jewish woman mrs leibowitz in new york and i dont know what we would have done without her
the butcher takes the pigs head off a shelf and when malachy says ooh look at the dead dog the butcher and mam burst out laughing he wraps the head in newspaper hands it to mam and says happy christmas then he wraps up some sausages and tells her take these sausages for your breakfast on christmas day mam says oh i cant afford sausages and he says am i asking you for money am i take these sausages they might help make up for the lack of a goose or a ham
sure you dont have to do that says mam
i know that missus if i had to do it i wouldnt
mam says she has a pain in her back that ill have to carry the
pigs head i hold it against my chest but its damp and when the newspaper begins to fall away everyone can see the head mam says im ashamed of me life that the world should know were having pigs head for christmas boys from leamys national school see me and they point and laugh aw gawd look at frankie mccourt anhis pigs snout is that what the yanks ate for christmas dinner frankie
one calls to another hey christy do you know how to ate a pigs
head
no i dont paddy
grab him by the ears an chew the face offa him
and christy says hey paddy do you know the only part of the pig the mccourts dont ate
no i dont christy
the only part they dont ate is the oink
after a few streets the newspaper is gone altogether and everyone
can see the pigs head his nose is flat against my chest and pointing up at my chin and i feel sorry for him because hes dead and the world is
laughing at him my sister and two brothers are dead too but if anyone laughed at them id hit them with a rock
i wish dad would come and help us because mam has to stop every few steps and lean against a wall shes holding her back and telling us shell never be able to climb barrack hill even if dad came he wouldnt be much use because he never carries anything parcels bags packages if you carry such things you lose your dignity thats what he says he carried the twins when they were tired and he carried the pope but that was not the same as carrying ordinary things like a pigs head he tells malachy and me that when you grow up you have to wear a collar and tie and never let people see you carry things
hes upstairs sitting by the fire smoking a cigarette reading the irish press which he loves because its de valeras paper and he thinks de valera is the greatest man in the world he looks at me and the pigs head and tells mam its a disgraceful thing to let a boy carry an object like that through the streets of limerick she takes off her coat and eases herself into the bed and tells him that next christmas he can go out and find the dinner shes worn out and gasping for a cup of tea so would he drop his grand airs boil the water for the tea and fry some bread before his two small sons starve to death
on christmas morning he lights the fire early so that we can have sausages and bread and tea mam sends me to grandma to see if we can borrow a pot for the pigs head grandma says what are ye having for yeer dinner pigs head jesus mary an joseph thats goin beyond the beyonds couldnt your father get out and find a ham or a goose at least what kind of man is he at all at all
mam puts the head in the pot just covered with water and while the pig is boiling away dad takes malachy and me to mass at the redemptorist church its warm in the church and sweet with flowers and incense and candles he takes us to see the baby jesus in the crib hes a big fat baby with fair curls like malachy dad tells us thats jesus mother there mary in the blue dress and his father st joseph the old man with the beard he says theyre sad because they know jesus will grow up and be killed so that we can all go to heaven i ask why the baby jesus has to die and dad says you cant ask questions like that malachy says why and dad tells him be quiet
mam is in a terrible state at home there isnt enough coal to cook the dinner the water isnt boiling anymore and she says shes demented with worry well have to go down the dock road again to see if theres any coal or turf lying around from the lorries surely well find something on the road this day of all days even the poorest of the poor dont go out on christmas day picking coal off the road theres no use asking dad to go because he will never stoop that low and even if he did he wont carry things through the streets its a rule he has mam cant go because of the pain in her back
she says youll have to go frank and take malachy with you
its a long way to the dock road but we dont mind because our bellies are filled with sausages and bread and its not raining we carry a canvas bag mam borrowed from mrs hannon next door and mam is right there is no one on the dock road the poor are all at home having pigs head or maybe a goose and we have the dock road to ourselves we find bits of coal and turf stuck in cracks on the road and in the walls of the coal yards we find bits of paper and cardboard that will be useful in starting the fire again were wandering around trying to fill the bag
when pa keating comes along he must have washed himself for christmas because hes not as black as he was when eugene died he wants to know what were doing with that bag and when malachy tells him he says jesus mary and holy st joseph christmas day and ye dont have a fire for yeer pigs head thats a bloody disgrace
he takes us to souths pub which is not supposed to be open but hes a regular customer and theres a back door for men who want their pint to celebrate the birthday of the baby jesus above in the crib he orders his pint and lemonade for us and asks the man if theres any chance of getting a few lumps of coal the man says hes been serving drink for twentyseven years and nobody ever asked him for coal before pa says it would be a favor and the man says if pa asked for the moon hed fly up and bring it back the man leads us to the coal hole under the stairs and tells us take what we can carry its real coal and not bits from the dock road and if we cant carry it we can drag it along the ground
it takes us a long time to go from souths pub to barrack hill because of a hole in the bag i pull the bag and its malachys job to pick up the lumps that fall through the hole and put them back again then it starts to rain and we cant stand in a doorway till it passes because we have that coal and its leaving a black trail along the pavement and malachy is turning black from picking up the lumps pushing them into the bag and wiping the rain from his face with his wet black hands i tell him hes black he tells me im black and a woman in a shop tells us get away from that door tis christmas day and she doesnt want to be looking at africa
we have to keep dragging the bag or well never have our christmas dinner it will take ages to get a fire going and ages more to get our dinner because the water has to be boiling when mam puts in the head of cabbage and the potatoes to keep the pig company in the pot we drag the bag up oconnell avenue and we see people in their houses sitting around tables with all kinds of decorations and bright lights at one house they push up the window and the children point and laugh and call to us look at the zulus where are yeer spears
malachy makes faces at them and wants to throw coal at them but i tell him if he throws coal theres less for the pig and well never get our dinner
the downstairs in our house is a lake again from the rain pouring under the door but it doesnt matter because were drenched anyway and we can wade through the water dad comes down and drags the bag upstairs to italy he says were good boys for getting so much coal that the dock road must have been covered with it when mam sees us she starts to laugh and then she cries shes laughing because were so black and crying because were sopping wet she tells us take off all our clothes and she washes the coal off our hands and faces she tells dad the pigs head can wait a while so that we can have a jam jar of hot tea
its raining outside and theres a lake downstairs in our kitchen but up here in italy the fire is going again and the room is so dry and warm that after our tea malachy and i doze off in the bed and we dont wake till dad tells us the dinner is ready our clothes are still wet so malachy sits on the trunk at the table wrapped in mams red american overcoat and im wrapped in an old coat that mams father left behind when he went to australia
there are delicious smells in the room cabbage potatoes and the pigs head but when dad lifts the head from the pot to a plate malachy says oh the poor pig i dont want to eat the poor pig
mam says if you were hungry youd eat it now stop the nonsense and eat your dinner
dad says wait a minute he takes slices from the two cheeks places them on our plates and smears them with mustard he takes the plate that holds the pigs head and puts it on the floor under the table now he says to malachy thats ham and malachy eats it because hes not looking at what it came from and it isnt pigs head anymore the cabbage is soft and hot and there are plenty of potatoes with butter and salt mam peels our potatoes but dad eats his skin and all he says all the nourishment of a potato is in the skin and mam says its a good thing hes not eating eggs hed be chewing the shells and all
he says he would and its a disgrace that the irish throw out millions of potato skins every day and thats why thousands are dying of consumption and surely theres nourishment in the shell of an egg since waste is the eighth deadly sin if he had his way and mam says never mind your way eat your dinner
he eats half a potato with its skin on and puts the other half back in the pot he eats a small slice of the pigs cheek and a leaf of cabbage and leaves the rest on his plate for malachy and me he makes more tea and we have that with bread and jam so that no one can say we didnt have a sweet on christmas day
its dark now and still raining outside and the coal is glowing in the grate where mam and dad sit and smoke their cigarettes theres nothing to do when your clothes are wet but get back into bed where its cozy and your father can tell you a story about how cuchulain became a catholic and you fall asleep and dream about the pig standing in the crib at the redemptorist church crying because he and the baby jesus and cuchulain all have to grow up and die
the angel that brought margaret and the twins comes again and brings us another brother michael dad says he found michael on the seventh step of the stairs to italy he says thats what you have to watch for when you ask for a new baby the angel on the seventh step
malachy wants to know how you can get a new brother from the angel on the seventh step if you dont have any stairs in your house and dad tells him that asking too many questions is an affliction
malachy wants to know what an affliction is
affliction id like to know what that word means affliction but dad says och child the world is an affliction and everything in it puts on his cap and goes to the bedford row hospital to see mam and michael shes in the hospital with the pain in her back and she has the baby with her to make sure he was healthy when he was left on the seventh step i dont understand this because im sure angels would never leave a sick baby on the seventh step theres no use asking dad or mam about this they say youre getting as bad as your brother for asking questions go play
i know that big people dont like questions from children they can ask all the questions they like hows school are you a good boy did you say your prayers but if you ask them did they say their prayers you might be hit on the head
dad brings mam home with the new baby and she has to stay in bed for a few days with the pain in her back she says this baby is the
spitting image of our sister who died with his wavy black hair his lovely blue eyes and the gorgeous eyebrows thats what mam says
i want to know if the baby will be spitting i also want to know which is the seventh step because there are nine steps on the stairs and id like to know if you count from the bottom or the top dad doesnt mind answering this question angels come down from above he says and not up from kitchens like ours which are lakes from october till april
so i find the seventh step by counting from the top
the baby michael has a cold his head is stuffed and he can barely breathe mam worries because its sunday and the dispensary for the poor is closed if you go to the doctors house and the maid sees youre from the lower classes she tells you go to the dispensary where you belong if you tell her the child is dying in your arms shell say the doctor is in the country riding his horse
mam cries because the baby is struggling to get air through his mouth she tries to clear his nostrils with a bit of rolled up paper but shes afraid to push it too far up dad says theres no need for that youre not supposed to be pushing things inside a childs head it looks like hes going to kiss the baby instead he has his mouth on the little nose and hes sucking sucking the bad stuff out of michaels head he spits it into the fire michael gives out a loud cry and you can see him drawing the air into his head and kicking his legs and laughing mam looks at dad as if he just came down from heaven and dad says thats what we did in antrim long before there were doctors riding their horses
michael entitles us to a few extra shillings on the dole but mam says it isnt enough and now she has to go to the st vincent de paul society for food one night there is a knock on the door and mam sends me down to see who it is there are two men from the st vincent de paul and they want to see my mother and father i tell them my parents are upstairs in italy and they say what
upstairs where tis dry ill tell them
they want to know what that little shed is beside our front door i tell them its the lavatory they want to know why it isnt in the back of the house and i tell them its the lavatory for the whole lane and its a good thing its not in the back of our house or wed have people traipsing through our kitchen with buckets that would make you sick
they say are you sure theres one lavatory for the whole lane i am
they say mother of god
mam calls down from italy whos down there
the men
what men from the st vincent de paul
theyre careful the way they step into the lake in the kitchen and
they make tsk tsk and tut tut noises and they tell one another isnt this a disgrace till they get upstairs to italy they tell mam and dad theyre sorry to disturb them but the society has to be sure theyre helping deserving cases mam offers them a cup of tea but they look around and say no thank you they want to know why were living upstairs they want to know about the lavatory they ask questions because big people can ask all the questions they like and write in notebooks especially when theyre wearing collars and ties and suits they ask how old michael is how much dad gets at the labour exchange when did he last have a job why doesnt he have a job now and what class of an accent is that he has
dad tells them the lavatory could kill us with every class of disease that the kitchen floods in the winter and we have to move upstairs to stay dry he says the river shannon is responsible for all the dampness in the world and killing us one by one
malachy tells them were living in italy and they smile
mam asks if theres any chance of getting boots for malachy and me and they say shell have to come down to ozanam house and apply she says she hasnt been feeling well since the baby came and she wouldnt be able to stand long in a queue but they say everyone has to be treated the same even a woman down in the irishtown that had triplets and thank you well make our report to the society
when theyre leaving malachy wants to show them where the angel left michael on the seventh step but dad tells him not now not now malachy cries and one of the men gives him a piece of toffee from his pocket and i wish i had something to cry about so that id get a piece too
i have to go downstairs again and show the men where to step to keep their feet dry they keep shaking their heads and saying god almighty and mother of god this is desperate thats not italy they have upstairs thats calcutta
dad is telling mam up in italy she should never beg like that what do you mean beg
dont you have any pride begging for boots like that
and what would you do mr grand manner would you let them go
barefoot
id rather fix the shoes they have
the shoes they have are falling to pieces
i can fix them he says
you cant fix anything youre useless she says
he comes home the next day with an old bicycle tire he sends me to
mr hannon next door for the loan of a last and a hammer he takes mams sharp knife and he hacks at the tire till he has pieces to fit on the soles and heels of our shoes mam tells him hes going to destroy the shoes altogether but he pounds away with the hammer driving the nails through the rubber pieces and into the shoes mam says god above if you left the shoes alone theyd last till easter at least and we might get the boots from the st vincent de paul but he wont stop till the soles and heels are covered with squares of rubber tire which stick out on each side of the shoe and flop before and behind he makes us put on the shoes and tells us our feet will be good and warm but we dont want to wear them anymore because the tire pieces are so lumpy we stumble when we walk around italy he sends me back to mr hannon with the last and hammer and mrs hannon says god above whats up with your shoes she laughs and mr hannon shakes his head and i feel ashamed i dont want to go to school next day and i pretend to be sick but dad gets us up and gives us our fried bread and tea and tells us we should be grateful we have any shoes at all that there are boys in leamys national school who go to school barefoot on bitter days on our way to school leamys boys laugh at us because the tire pieces are so thick they add a few inches to our height and the boys say hows the air up there there are six or seven barefoot boys in my class and they dont say anything and i wonder if its better to have shoes with rubber tires that make you trip and stumble or to go barefoot if you have no shoes at all youll have all the barefoot boys on your side if you have rubber tires on your shoes
youre all alone with your brother and you have to fight your own battles i sit on a bench in the schoolyard shed and take off my shoes and stockings but when i go into the class the master wants to know where my shoes are he knows im not one of the barefoot boys and he makes me go back to the yard bring in the shoes and put them on then he says to the class there is sneering here there is jeering at the misfortunes of others is there anyone in this class that thinks hes perfect raise your hands
there are no hands is there anyone in this class that comes from a rich family with money galore to spend on shoes raise your hands
there are no hands
he says there are boys here who have to mend their shoes whatever way they can there are boys in this class with no shoes at all its not their fault and its no shame our lord had no shoes he died shoeless do you see him hanging on the cross sporting shoes do you boys
no sir
what is it you dont see our lord doing
hanging on the cross and sporting shoes sir
now if i hear of one boy in this class jeering and sneering at
mccourt or his brother over their
will come out boys
the stick sir
the stick will sting boys
air it will land on the backside
sneers where will it land boys
shoes the stick will come out what
the ash plant will whistle through the
of the boy that jeers the boy that
on the boy that jeers sir
and
the boy that sneers sir
the boys bother us no more and we wear our shoes with the rubber
tires the few weeks to easter when the st vincent de paul society gives us the gift of boots
if i have to get up in the middle of the night to pee in the bucket i go to the top of the stairs and look down to see if the angel might be on the seventh step sometimes im sure theres a light there and if everyones asleep i sit on the step in case the angel might be bringing another baby or just coming for a visit i ask mam if the angel just brings the babies and then forgets about them she says of course not the angel never forgets the babies and comes back to make sure the baby is happy
i could ask the angel all kinds of questions and im sure hed answer unless its a girl angel but im sure a girl angel would answer questions too i never heard anyone say they didnt
i sit on the seventh step a long time and im sure the angel is there i tell him all the things you cant tell your mother or father for fear of being hit on the head or told go out and play i tell him all about school and how im afraid of the master and his stick when he roars at us in irish and i still dont know what hes talking about because i came from america and the other boys were learning irish a year before me
i stay on the seventh step till it gets too cold or dad gets up and tells me go back to bed hes the one who told me the angel comes to the seventh step in the first place and youd think hed know why im sitting there i told him one night that i was waiting for the angel and he said och now francis youre a bit of a dreamer
i get back into bed but i can hear him whisper to my mother the poor wee lad was sitting on the stairs talking away to an angel
he laughs and my mother laughs and i think isnt it curious the way big people laugh over the angel who brought them a new child
before easter we move back downstairs to ireland easter is better than christmas because the air is warmer the walls are not dripping with the damp and the kitchen isnt a lake anymore and if were up early we might catch the sun slanting for a minute through the kitchen window
in fine weather men sit outside smoking their cigarettes if they have them looking at the world and watching us play women stand with their arms folded chatting they dont sit because all they do is stay at home take care of the children clean the house and cook a bit and the men need the chairs the men sit because theyre worn out from walking to the labour exchange every morning to sign for the dole discussing the worlds problems and wondering what to do with the rest of the day some stop at the bookie to study the form and place a shilling or two on a sure thing some spend hours in the carnegie library reading english and irish newspapers a man on the dole needs to keep up with things because all the other men on the dole are experts on whats going on in the world a man on the dole must be ready in case another man on the dole brings up hitler or mussolini or the terrible state of the chinese millions a man on the dole goes home after a day with the bookie or the newspaper and his wife will not begrudge him a few minutes with the ease and peace of his cigarette and his tea and time to sit in his chair and think of the world
easter is better than christmas because dad takes us to the redemptorist church where all the priests wear white and sing theyre happy because our lord is in heaven i ask dad if the baby in the crib is dead and he says no he was thirtythree when he died and there he is hanging on the cross i dont understand how he grew up so fast that hes hanging there with a hat made of thorns and blood everywhere dripping from his head his hands his feet and a big hole near his belly
dad says ill understand when i grow up he tells me that all the time now and i want to be big like him so that i can understand everything it must be lovely to wake up in the morning and understand everything i wish i could be like all the big people in the church standing and kneeling and praying and understanding everything
at the mass people go up to the altar and the priest puts something into their mouths they come back to their seats with their heads down their mouths moving malachy says hes hungry and he wants some too dad says shush thats holy communion the body and blood of our lord
but dad
shush its a mystery
theres no use asking more questions if you ask a question they
tell you its a mystery youll understand when you grow up be a good boy ask your mother ask your father for the love o jesus leave me alone go out and play
dad gets his first job in limerick at the cement factory and mam is happy she wont have to stand in the queue at the st vincent de paul society asking for clothes and boots for malachy and me she says its not begging its charity but dad says its begging and shameful mam says she can now pay off the few pounds she owes at kathleen oconnells shop and she can pay back what she owes her own mother she hates to be under obligation to anyone especially her own mother
the cement factory is miles outside limerick and that means dad has to be out of the house by six in the morning he doesnt mind because hes used to the long walks the night before mam makes him a flask of tea a sandwich a hardboiled egg she feels sorry for him the way he has to walk three miles out and three miles back a bicycle would be handy but youd have to be working a year for the price of it
friday is payday and mam is out of the bed early cleaning the house and singing
anyone can see why i wanted your kiss it had to be and the reason is this
there isnt much to clean in the house she sweeps the kitchen floor and the floor of italy upstairs she washes the four jam jars we use for mugs she says if dads job lasts well get proper cups and maybe saucers and some day with the help of god and his blessed mother well have sheets on the bed and if we save a long time a blanket or two instead of those old coats which people must have left behind during the great famine she boils water and washes the rags that keep michael from shitting all over the pram and the house itself oh she says well have a lovely tea when your pop brings home the wages tonight
pop shes in a good mood
sirens and whistles go off all over the city when the men finish work at halfpast five malachy and i are excited because we know that when your father works and brings home the wages you get the friday penny we know this from other boys whose fathers work and we know that after your tea you can go to kathleen oconnells shop and buy sweets if your mother is in a good mood she might even give you tuppence to go to the lyric cinema the next day to see a film with james cagney
the men who work in factories and shops in the city are coming into the lanes to have their supper wash themselves and go to the pub the women go to the films at the coliseum or the lyric cinema they buy sweets and wild woodbine cigarettes and if their husbands are working a long time they treat themselves to boxes of black magic chocolates they love the romance films and they have a great time crying their eyes out when theres an unhappy ending or a handsome lover goes away to be shot by hindus and other noncatholics
we have to wait a long time for dad to walk the miles from the cement factory we cant have our tea till hes home and thats very hard because you smell the cooking of other families in the lane mam says its a good thing payday is friday when you cant eat meat because the smell of bacon or sausages in other houses would drive her out of her mind we can still have bread and cheese and a nice jam jar of tea with lashings of milk and sugar and what more do you want
the women are gone to the cinemas the men are in the pubs and still dad isnt home mam says its a long way to the cement factory even if hes a fast walker she says that but her eyes are watery and shes not singing anymore shes sitting by the fire smoking a wild woodbine she got on credit from kathleen oconnell the fag is the only luxury she has and shell never forget kathleen for her goodness she doesnt know how long she can keep the water boiling in this kettle theres no use making the tea till dad gets home because it will be stewed coddled boiled and unfit to drink malachy says hes hungry and she gives him a piece of bread and cheese to keep him going she says this job could be
the saving of us tis hard enough for him to get a job with his northern accent and if he loses this one i dont know what were going to do
the darkness is in the lane and we have to light a candle she has to give us our tea and bread and cheese because were so hungry we cant wait another minute she sits at the table eats a bit of bread and cheese smokes her wild woodbine she goes to the door to see if dad is coming down the lane and she talks about the paydays when we searched for him all over brooklyn she says some day well all go back to america and well have a nice warm place to live and a lavatory down the hall like the one in classon avenue and not this filthy thing outside our door
the women are coming home from the cinemas laughing and the men singing from the pubs mam says theres no use waiting up any longer if dad stays in the pubs till closing time there will be nothing left from his wages and we might as well go to bed she lies in her bed with michael in her arms its quiet in the lane and i can hear her crying even though she pulls an old coat over her face and i can hear in the distance my father
i know its my father because hes the only one in limerick who sings that song from the north roddy mccorley goes to die on the bridge of toome today he comes round the corner at the top of the lane and starts kevin barry he sings a verse stops holds on to a wall cries over kevin barry people stick their heads out windows and doors and tell him for jasus sake put a sock in it some of us have to get up in the morning for work go home and sing your feckin patriotic songs
he stands in the middle of the lane and tells the world to step outside hes ready to fight ready to fight and die for ireland which is more than he can say for the men of limerick who are known the length and breadth of the world for collaborating with the perfidious saxons
hes pushing in our door and singing
and if when all a vigil keep
the wests asleep the wests asleep alas and well my erin weep
that connacht lies in slumber deep
but hark a voice like thunder spake the wests awake the wests awake sing oh hurrah let england quake well watch till death for erins sake
he calls from the bottom of the stairs angela angela is there a drop of tea in this house
she doesnt answer and he calls again francis malachy come down here boys i have the friday penny for you
i want to go down and get the friday penny but mam is sobbing with the coat over her mouth and malachy says i dont want his old friday penny he can keep it
dad is stumbling up the stairs making a speech about how we all have to die for ireland he lights a match and touches it to the candle by mams bed he holds the candle over his head and marches around the room singing see who comes over the redblossomed heather their green banners kissing the pure mountain air heads erect eyes to front
stepping proudly together sure freedom sits throned on each proud spirit there
michael wakes and lets out a loud cry the hannons are banging on the wall next door mam is telling dad hes a disgrace and why doesnt he get out of the house altogether
he stands in the middle of the floor with the candle over his head he pulls a penny from his pocket and waves it to malachy and me your friday penny boys he says i want you to jump out of that bed and line up here like two soldiers and promise to die for ireland and ill give the two of you the friday penny
malachy sits up in the bed i dont want it he says
and i tell him i dont want it either
dad stands for a minute swaying and puts the penny back in his
pocket he turns toward mam and she says youre not sleeping in this bed tonight he makes his way downstairs with the candle sleeps on a chair misses work in the morning loses the job at the cement factory and were back on the dole again
iv
the master says its time to prepare for first confession and first communion to know and remember all the questions and answers in the catechism to become good catholics to know the difference between right and wrong to die for the faith if called on
the master says its a glorious thing to die for the faith and dad says its a glorious thing to die for ireland and i wonder if theres anyone in the world who would like us to live my brothers are dead and my sister is dead and i wonder if they died for ireland or the faith dad says they were too young to die for anything mam says it was disease and starvation and him never having a job dad says och angela puts on his cap and goes for a long walk
the master says were each to bring threepence for the first communion catechism with the green cover the catechism has all the questions and answers we have to know by heart before we can receive first communion older boys in the fifth class have the thick confirmation catechism with the red cover and that costs sixpence id love to be big and important and parade around with the red confirmation catechism but i dont think ill live that long the way im expected to die for this or that i want to ask why there are so many big people who havent died for ireland or the faith but i know if you ask a question like that you get you the thump on the head or youre told go out and play
its very handy to have mikey molloy living around the corner from me hes eleven he has fits and behind his back we call him molloy the fit people in the lane say the fit is an affliction and now i know what affliction means mikey knows everything because he has visions in his fits and he reads books hes the expert in the lane on girls bodies and dirty things in general and he promises ill tell you everything frankie when youre eleven like me and youre not so thick and ignorant
its a good thing he says frankie so ill know hes talking to me because he has crossed eyes and you never know who hes looking at if hes talking to malachy and i think hes talking to me he might go into a
rage and have a fit that will carry him off he says its a gift to have crossed eyes because youre like a god looking two ways at once and if you had crossed eyes in the ancient roman times you had no problem getting a good job if you look at pictures of roman emperors youll see theres always a great hint of crossed eyes when hes not having the fit he sits on the ground at the top of the lane reading the books his father brings home from the carnegie library his mother says books books books hes ruining his eyes with the reading he needs an operation to straighten them but wholl pay for it she tells him if he keeps on straining his eyes theyll float together till he has one eye in the middle of his head ever after his father calls him cyclops who is in a greek story
nora molloy knows my mother from the queues at the st vincent de paul society she tells mam that mikey has more sense than twelve men drinking pints in a pub he knows the names of all the popes from st peter to pius the eleventh hes only eleven but hes a man oh a man indeed many a week he saves the family from pure starvation he borrows a handcart from aidan farrell and knocks on doors all over limerick to see if there are people who want coal or turf delivered and down the dock road hell go to haul back great bags a hundredweight or more hell run messages for old people who cant walk and if they dont have a penny to give him a prayer will do
if he earns a little money he hands it over to his mother who loves her mikey he is her world her hearts blood her pulse and if anything ever happened to him they might as well stick her in the lunatic asylum and throw away the key
mikeys father peter is a great champion he wins bets in the pubs by drinking more pints than anyone all he has to do is go out to the jakes stick his finger down his throat and bring it all up so that he can start another round peter is such a champion he can stand in the jakes and throw up without using his finger hes such a champion they could chop off his fingers and hed carry on regardless he wins all that money but doesnt bring it home sometimes hes like my father and drinks the dole itself and thats why nora molloy is often carted off to the lunatic asylum demented with worry over her hungry famishing family she knows as long as youre in the asylum youre safe from the world and its torments theres nothing you can do youre protected and whats the use of worrying its well known that all the lunatics in the asylum have to be dragged in but shes the only one that has to be dragged out back to her five children and the champion of all pint drinkers
you can tell when nora molloy is ready for the asylum when you see her children running around white with flour from poll to toe that happens when peter drinks the dole money and leaves her desperate and she knows the men will come to take her away you know shes inside frantic with the baking she wants to make sure the children wont starve while shes gone and she roams limerick begging for flour she goes to priests nuns protestants quakers she goes to ranks flour mills and begs for the sweepings from the floor she bakes day and night peter begs her to stop but she screams this is what comes of drinking the dole he tells her the bread will only go stale theres no use talking to her bake bake bake if she had the money shed bake all the flour in limerick and regions beyond if the men didnt come from the lunatic asylum to take her away shed bake till she fell to the floor
the children stuff themselves with so much bread people in the lane say theyre looking like loaves still the bread goes stale and mikey is so bothered by the waste he talks to a rich woman with a cookbook and she tells him make bread pudding he boils the hard bread in water and sour milk and throws in a cup of sugar and his brother loves it even if thats all they have the fortnight their mother is in the lunatic asylum
my father says do they take her away because shes gone mad baking bread or does she go mad baking bread because theyre taking her away
nora comes home calm as if she had been at the seaside she always says wheres mikey is he alive she worries over mikey because hes not a proper catholic and if he had a fit and died who knows where he might wind up in the next life hes not a proper catholic because he could never receive his first communion for fear of getting anything on his tongue that might cause a fit and choke him the master tried over and over with bits of the limerick leader but mikey kept spitting them out till the master got into a state and sent him to the priest who wrote to the bishop who said dont bother me handle it yourself the master sent a note home saying mikey was to practice receiving communion with his father or mother but even they couldnt get him to swallow a piece of the limerick leader in the shape of a wafer they even tried a piece of bread shaped like the wafer with bread and jam and it was no use the priest tells mrs molloy not to worry god moves in mysterious ways his wonders to perform and surely he has a special purpose for mikey fits and all she says isnt it remarkable he can swally all kinds of sweets and buns but if he has to swally the body of our lord he goes into a fit isnt that remarkable she worries mikey might have the fit and die and go to hell if he has any class of a sin on his soul though everyone knows hes an angel out of heaven mikey tells her god is not going to afflict you with the fit and then boot you into hell on top of it what kind of a god would do a thing like that
are you sure mikey
i am i read it in a book
he sits under the lamppost at the top of the lane and laughs over
his first communion day which was all a cod he couldnt swallow the wafer but did that stop his mother from parading him around limerick in his little black suit for the collection she said to mikey well im not lying so im not im only saying to the neighbors heres mikey in his first communion suit thats all im saying mind you heres mikey if they think you swallied your first communion who am i to contradict them and disappoint them mikeys father said dont worry cyclops you have loads of time jesus didnt become a proper catholic till he took the bread and wine at the last supper and he was thirtythree years of age nora molloy said will you stop calling him cyclops he has two eyes in his head and hes not a greek but mikeys father champion of all pint drinkers is like my uncle pa keating he doesnt give a fiddlers fart what the world says and thats the way id like to be myself
mikey tells me the best thing about first communion is the collection your mother has to get you a new suit somehow so she can show you off to the neighbors and relations and they give you sweets and money and you can go to the lyric cinema to see charlie chaplin
what about james cagney
never mind james cagney lots of blather charlie chaplin is your only man but you have to be with your mother on the collection the grownup people of limerick are not going to be handing out money to
every little tom dick and mick with a first communion suit that doesnt have his mother with him
mikey got over five shillings on his first communion day and ate so many sweets and buns he threw up in the lyric cinema and frank goggin the ticket man kicked him out he says he didnt care because he had money left over and went to the savoy cinema the same day for a pirate film and ate cadbury chocolate and drank lemonade till his stomach stuck out a mile he cant wait for confirmation day because youre older theres another collection and that brings more money than first communion hell go to the cinema the rest of his life sit next to girls from lanes and do dirty things like an expert he loves his mother but hell never get married for fear he might have a wife in and out of the lunatic asylum whats the use of getting married when you can sit in cinemas and do dirty things with girls from lanes who dont care what they do because they already did it with their brothers if you dont get married you wont have any children at home bawling for tea and bread and gasping with the fit and looking in every direction with their eyes when hes older hell go to the pub like his father drink pints galore stick the finger down the throat to bring it all up drink more pints win the bets and bring the money home to his mother to keep her from going demented
he says hes not a proper catholic which means hes doomed so he can do anything he bloody well likes he says ill tell you more when you grow up frankie youre too young now and you dont know your arse from your elbow
the master mr benson is very old he roars and spits all over us every day the boys in the front row hope he has no diseases for its the spit that carries all the diseases and he might be spreading consumption right and left he tells us we have to know the catechism backwards forwards and sideways we have to know the ten commandments the seven virtues divine and moral the seven sacraments the seven deadly sins we have to know by heart all the prayers the hail mary the our father the confiteor the apostles creed the act of contrition the litany of the blessed virgin mary we have to know them in irish and english and if we forget an irish word and use english he goes into a rage and goes at us with the stick if he had his way wed be learning our religion in latin the language of the saints who communed intimately with god and his holy mother the language of the early christians who huddled in the catacombs and went forth to die on rack and sword who expired in the foaming jaws of the ravenous lion irish is fine for patriots english for traitors and informers but its the latin that gains us entrance to heaven itself its the latin the martyrs prayed in when the barbarians pulled out their nails and cut their skin off inch by inch he tells us were a disgrace to ireland and her long sad history that wed be better off in africa praying to bush or tree he tells us were hopeless the worst class he ever had for first communion but as sure as god made little apples hell make catholics of us hell beat the idler out of us and the sanctifying grace into us
brendan quigley raises his hand we call him question quigley because hes always asking questions he cant help himself sir he says whats sanctifying grace
the master rolls his eyes to heaven hes going to kill quigley instead he barks at him never mind whats sanctifying grace quigley thats none of your business youre here to learn the catechism and do
what youre told youre not here to be asking questions there are too many people wandering the world asking questions and thats what has us in the state were in and if i find any boy in this class asking questions i wont be responsible for what happens do you hear me quigley
i do
i do what
i do sir
he goes on with his speech there are boys in this class who will
never know the sanctifying grace and why because of the greed i have heard them abroad in the schoolyard talking about first communion day the happiest day of your life are they talking about receiving the body and blood of our lord oh no those greedy little blaguards are talking about the money theyll get the collection theyll go from house to house in their little suits like beggars for the collection and will they take any of that money and send it to the little black babies in africa will they think of those little pagans doomed forever for lack of baptism and knowledge of the true faith little black babies denied knowledge of the mystical body of christ limbo is packed with little black babies flying around and crying for their mothers because theyll never be admitted to the ineffable presence of our lord and the glorious company of saints martyrs virgins oh no its off to the cinemas our first communion boys run to wallow in the filth spewed across the world by the devils henchmen in hollywood isnt that right mccourt
tis sir
question quigley raises his hand again there are looks around the room and we wonder if its suicide hes after
whats henchmen sir
the masters face goes white then red his mouth tightens and opens and spit flies everywhere he walks to question and drags him from his seat he snorts and stutters and his spit flies around the room he flogs question across the shoulders the bottom the legs he grabs him by the collar and drags him to the front of the room
look at this specimen he roars
question is shaking and crying im sorry sir
the master mocks him im sorry sir what are you sorry for im sorry i asked the question ill never ask a question again
sir
the day you do quigley will be the day you wish god would take
you to his bosom what will you wish quigley
that god will take me to his bosom sir
go back to your seat you omadhaun you poltroon you thing from
the far dark corner of a bog
he sits down with the stick before him on the desk he tells
question to stop the whimpering and be a man if he hears a single boy in this class asking foolish questions or talking about the collection again hell flog that boy till the blood spurts
what
what will i do boys
flog the boy sir
till
till the blood spurts sir
now clohessy what is the sixth commandment
thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not commit adultery
thou shalt not commit adultery sir
and what is adultery clohessy
impure thoughts impure words impure deeds sir
good clohessy youre a good boy you may be slow and forgetful in
the sir department and you may not have a shoe to your foot but youre powerful with the sixth commandment and that will keep you pure
paddy clohessy has no shoe to his foot his mother shaves his head to keep the lice away his eyes are red his nose always snotty the sores on his kneecaps never heal because he picks at the scabs and puts them in his mouth his clothes are rags he has to share with his six brothers and a sister and when he comes to school with a bloody nose or a black eye you know he had a fight over the clothes that morning he hates school hes seven going on eight the biggest and oldest boy in the class and he cant wait to grow up and be fourteen so that he can run away and pass for seventeen and join the english army and go to india where its nice and warm and hell live in a tent with a dark girl with the red dot on her forehead and hell be lying there eating figs thats what they eat in india figs and shell cook the curry day and night and plonk on a ukulele and when he has enough money hell send for the whole family and theyll all live in the tent especially his poor father whos at home coughing up great gobs of blood because of the consumption when my mother sees paddy on the street she says wisha look at that poor child hes a skeleton with rags and if they were making a film about the famine hed surely be put in the middle of it
i think paddy likes me because of the raisin and i feel a bit guilty because i wasnt that generous in the first place the master mr benson said the government was going to give us the free lunch so we wouldnt have to be going home in the freezing weather he led us down to a cold room in the dungeons of leamys school where the charwoman nellie ahearn was handing out the half pint of milk and the raisin bun the milk was frozen in the bottles and we had to melt it between our thighs the boys joked and said the bottles would freeze our things off and the master roared any more of that talk and ill warm the bottles on the backs of yeer heads we all searched our raisin buns for a raisin but nellie said they must have forgotten to put them in and shed inquire from the man who delivered we searched again every day till at last i found a raisin in my bun and held it up the boys started grousing and said they wanted a raisin and nellie said it wasnt her fault shed ask the man again now the boys were begging me for the raisin and offering me everything a slug of their milk a pencil a comic book toby mackey said i could have his sister and mr benson heard him and took him out to the hallway and knocked him around till he howled i wanted the raisin for myself but i saw paddy clohessy standing in the corner with no shoes and the room was freezing and he was shivering like a dog that had been kicked and i always felt sad over kicked dogs so i walked over and gave paddy the raisin because i didnt know what else to do and all the boys yelled that i was a fool and a feckin eejit and id regret the day and after i handed the raisin to paddy i longed for it but it was too late now because he pushed it right into his mouth and gulped it and looked at me and said nothing and i said in my head what kind of an eejit are you to be giving away your raisin
mr benson gave me a look and said nothing and nellie ahearn said youre a great oulyankee frankie
the priest will come soon to examine us on the catechism and everything else the master himself has to show us how to receive holy
communion he tells us gather round him he fills his hat with the limerick leader torn into little bits he gives paddy clohessy the hat kneels on the floor tells paddy to take one bit of paper and place it on his tongue he shows us how to stick out the tongue receive the bit of paper hold it a moment draw in the tongue fold your hands in prayer look toward heaven close your eyes in adoration wait for the paper to melt in your mouth swallow it and thank god for the gift the sanctifying grace wafting in on the odor of sanctity when he sticks out his tongue we have to hold in the laugh because we never saw a big purple tongue before he opens his eyes to catch the boys who are giggling but he cant say anything because he still has god on his tongue and its a holy moment he gets off his knees and tells us kneel around the classroom for the holy communion practice he goes around the room placing bits of paper on our tongues and mumbling in latin some boys giggle and he roars at them that if the giggling doesnt stop its not holy communion theyll be getting but the last rites and what is that sacrament called mccourt
extreme unction sir
thats right mccourt not bad for a yank from the sinful shores of amerikay
he tells us we have to be careful to stick out our tongues far enough so that the communion wafer wont fall to the floor he says thats the worst thing that can happen to a priest if the wafer slides off your tongue that poor priest has to get down on his two knees pick it up with his own tongue and lick the floor around it in case it bounced from one spot to another the priest could get a splinter that would make his tongue swell to the size of a turnip and thats enough to choke you and kill you entirely
he tells us that next to a relic of the true cross the communion wafer is the holiest thing in the world and our first communion is the holiest moment in our lives talking about first communion makes the master all excited he paces back and forth waves his stick tells us we must never forget that the moment the holy communion is placed on our tongues we become members of that most glorious congregation the one holy roman catholic and apostolic church that for two thousand years men women and children have died for the faith that the irish have nothing to be ashamed of in the martyr department havent we provided martyrs galore havent we bared our necks to the protestant ax havent we mounted the scaffold singing as if embarking on a picnic havent we boys
we have sir
what have we done boys
bared our necks to the protestant ax sir
and
mounted the scaffold singing sir
as if
embarking on a picnic sir
he says that perhaps in this class there is a future priest or a
martyr for the faith though he doubts it very much for we are the laziest gang of ignoramuses it has ever been his misfortune to teach
but it takes all kinds he says and surely god had some purpose when he sent the likes of ye to infest this earth surely god had a purpose when among us he sent clohessy with no shoes quigley with his damnable questions and mccourt heavy with sin from america and remember
this boys god did not send his only begotten son to hang on the cross so that ye can go around on yeer first communion day with the paws clutching for the collection our lord died so that ye might be redeemed it is enough to receive the gift of faith are ye listening to me
we are sir
and whats enough
the gift of faith sir
good go home
at night three of us sit under the light pole at the top of the
lane reading mikey malachy and i the molloys are like us with their father drinking the dole money or the wages and leaving no money for candles or paraffin oil for the lamp mikey reads books and the rest of us read comic books his father peter brings books from the carnegie library so that hell have something to do when hes not drinking pints or when hes looking after the family anytime mrs molloy is in the lunatic asylum he lets mikey read any book he likes and now mikey is reading this book about cuchulain and talking as if he knows everything about him i want to tell him i knew all about cuchulain when i was three going on four that i saw cuchulain in dublin that cuchulain thinks nothing of dropping into my dreams i want to tell him stop talking about cuchulain hes mine he was mine years ago when i was young but i cant because mikey reads us a story i never heard of before a dirty story about cuchulain which i can never tell my father or mother the story of how emer became cuchulains wife
cuchulain was getting to be an old man of twentyone he was lonely and wanted to get married which made him weak says mikey and got him killed in the end all the women in ireland were mad about cuchulain and they wanted to marry him he said that would be grand he wouldnt mind marrying all the women of ireland if he could fight all the men of ireland why couldnt he marry all the women but the king conor macnessa said thats all very well for you cu but the men of ireland dont want to be lonely in the far reaches of the night the king decided there would have to be a contest to see who would marry cuchulain and it would be a pissing contest all the women of ireland assembled on the plains of muirthemne to see who could piss the longest and it was emer she was the champion woman pisser of ireland and married cuchulain and thats why to this day she is called great bladdered emer
mikey and malachy laugh over this story though i dont think malachy understands it hes young and far from his first communion and hes only laughing over the piss word then mikey tells me ive committed a sin by listening to a story that has that word in it and when i go to my first confession ill have to tell the priest malachy says thats right piss is a bad word and you have to tell the priest because tis a sin word
i dont know what to do how can i go to the priest and tell him this terrible thing in my first confession all the boys know what sins theyre going to tell so that theyll get the first communion and make the collection and go to see james cagney and eat sweets and cakes at the lyric cinema the master helped us with our sins and everyone has the same sins i hit my brother i told a lie i stole a penny from my mothers purse i disobeyed my parents i ate a sausage on friday
but now i have a sin no one else has and the priest is going to be shocked and drag me out of the confession box into the aisle and out into the street where everyone will know i listened to a story about
cuchulains wife being the champion woman pisser in all ireland ill never be able to make my first communion and mothers will hold their small children up and point at me and say look at him hes like mikey molloy never made his first communion wandering around in a state of sin never made the collection never saw james cagney
im sorry i ever heard of first communion and the collection im sick and i dont want any tea or bread or anything mam tells dad its a strange thing when a child wont have his bread and tea and dad says och hes just nervous over the first communion i want to go over to him and sit on his lap and tell him what mikey molloy did to me but im too big to be sitting on laps and if i did malachy would go out in the lane and tell everyone i was a big baby id like to tell my troubles to the angel on the seventh step but hes busy bringing babies to mothers all over the world still ill ask dad
dad does the angel on the seventh step have other jobs besides bringing babies
he does
would the angel on the seventh step tell you what to do if you didnt know what to do
och he would son he would thats the job of an angel even the one on the seventh step
dad goes for a long walk mam takes michael and goes to see grandma malachy plays in the lane and i have the house to myself so that i can sit on the seventh step and talk to the angel i know hes there because the seventh step feels warmer than the other steps and theres a light in my head i tell him my troubles and i hear a voice fear not says the voice
hes talking backward and i tell him i dont know what hes talking about
do not fear says the voice tell the priest your sin and youll be forgiven
next morning im up early and drinking tea with dad and telling him about the angel on the seventh step he places his hand on my forehead to see if im feeling all right he asks if im sure i had a light in my head and heard a voice and what did the voice say
i tell him the voice said fear not and that means do not fear
dad tells me the angel is right i shouldnt be afraid and i tell him what mikey molloy did to me i tell him all about great bladdered emer and i even use the piss word because the angel said fear not dad puts down his jam jar of tea and pats the back of my hand och och och he says and i wonder if hes going demented like mrs molloy in and out of the lunatic asylum but he says is that what you were worried about last night
i tell him it is and he says its not a sin and i dont have to tell the priest
but the angel on the seventh step said i should
all right tell the priest if you like but the angel on the seventh step said that only because you didnt tell me first isnt it better to be able to tell your father your troubles rather than an angel who is a light and a voice in your head
tis dad
the day before first communion the master leads us to st josephs church for first confession we march in pairs and if we so much as move a lip on the streets of limerick hell kill us on the spot and send us to
hell bloated with sin that doesnt stop the bragging about the big sins willie harold is whispering about his big sin that he looked at his sisters naked body paddy hartigan says he stole ten shillings from his aunts purse and made himself sick with ice cream and chips question quigley says he ran away from home and spent half the night in a ditch with four goats i try to tell them about cuchulain and emer but the master catches me talking and gives me a thump on the head
we kneel in the pews by the confession box and i wonder if my emer sin is as bad as looking at your sisters naked body because i know now that some things in the world are worse than others thats why they have different sins the sacrilege the mortal sin the venial sin then the masters and grownup people in general talk about the unforgivable sin which is a great mystery no one knows what it is and you wonder how you can know if youve committed it if you dont know what it is if i tell a priest about great bladdered emer and the pissing contest he might say thats the unforgivable sin and kick me out of the confession box and ill be disgraced all over limerick and doomed to hell tormented forever by devils who have nothing else to do but stab me with hot pitchforks till im worn out
i try to listen to willies confession when he goes in but all i can hear is a hissing from the priest and when willie comes out hes crying
its my turn the confession box is dark and theres a big crucifix hanging over my head i can hear a boy mumbling his confession on the other side i wonder if theres any use trying to talk to the angel on the seventh step i know hes not supposed to be hanging around confession boxes but i feel the light in my head and the voice is telling me fear not
the panel slides back before my face and the priest says yes my child
bless me father for i have sinned this is my first confession yes my child and what sins have you committed
i told a lie i hit my brother i took a penny from my mothers
purse i said a curse
yes my child anything else
i i listened to a story about cuchulain and emer
surely thats not a sin my child after all we are assured by
certain writers that cuchulain turned catholic in his last moments as did his king conor macnessa
tis about emer father and how she married him
how was that my child
she won him in a pissing contest
there is heavy breathing the priest has his hand over his mouth
and hes making choking sounds and talking to himself mother o god who who told you that story my child
mikey molloy father
and where did he hear it
he read it in a book father
ah a book books can be dangerous for children my child turn your mind from those silly stories and think of the lives of the saints think of st joseph the little flower the sweet and gentle st francis of assisi who loved the birds of the air and the beasts of the field will you do that my child
i will father
are there any other sins my child
no father
for your penance say three hail marys three our fathers and say a
special prayer for me
i will father was that the worst sin
what do you mean
am i the worst of all the boys father
no my child you have a long way to go now say an act of
contrition and remember our lord watches you every minute god bless you my child

i ran to the kitchen take off that shirt she said i took off the shirt and she pushed me into a tin tub of icy cold water my mother scrubbed me my grandmother scrubbed me i was raw i was red
they dried me they dressed me in my black velvet first communion suit with the white frilly shirt the short pants the white stockings the black patent leather shoes around my arm they tied a white satin bow and on my lapel they pinned the sacred heart of jesus a picture of the sacred heart with blood dripping from it flames erupting all around it and on top a nasty looking crown of thorns
come here till i comb your hair said grandma look at that mop it wont lie down you didnt get that hair from my side of the family thats that north of ireland hair you got from your father thats the kind of hair you see on presbyterians if your mother had married a proper decent limerickman you wouldnt have this standing up north of ireland presbyterian hair
she spat twice on my head
grandma will you please stop spitting on my head if you have anything to say shut up a little spit wont kill you come on well be late for the mass
we ran to the church my mother panted along behind with michael in her arms we arrived at the church just in time to see the last of the boys leaving the altar rail where the priest stood with the chalice and the host glaring at me then he placed on my tongue the wafer the body and blood of jesus at last at last
its on my tongue i draw it back
it stuck
i had god glued to the roof of my mouth i could hear the masters
voice dont let that host touch your teeth for if you bite god in two youll roast in hell for eternity
i tried to get god down with my tongue but the priest hissed at me stop that clucking and get back to your seat
god was good he melted and i swallowed him and now at last i was a member of the true church an official sinner
when the mass ended there they were at the door of the church my mother with michael in her arms my grandmother they each hugged me to their bosoms they each told me it was the happiest day of my life they each cried all over my head and after my grandmothers contribution that morning my head was a swamp

proper first communion breakfast at my house come on

i overslept i nearly missed my first communion my grandmother said i have standing up north of ireland presbyterian hair i threw up my first communion breakfast now grandma says she has god in her backyard and what should she do
the priest is like the first confession priest he has the heavy breathing and the choking sounds
ah ah tell your grandmother to wash god away with a little water and for your penance say one hail mary and one our father say a prayer for me and god bless you my child
grandma and mam were waiting close to the confession box grandma said were you telling jokes to that priest in the confession box if tis a thing i ever find out you were telling jokes to jesuits ill tear the bloody kidneys outa you now what did he say about god in me backyard

grandma said take him then to james cagney and see if that will
save his presbyterian north of ireland american soul go ahead
she pulled her shawl around her and walked away
mam said god its getting very late for the collection and youll
never see james cagney well go to the lyric cinema and see if theyll let you in anyway in your first communion suit
we met mikey molloy on barrington street he asked if i was going to the lyric and i said i was trying trying he said you dont have money
i was ashamed to say no but i had to and he said thats all right ill get you in ill create a diversion
whats a diversion
i have the money to go and when i get in ill pretend to have the fit and the ticket man will be out of his mind and you can slip in when i let out the big scream ill be watching the door and when i see you in ill have a miraculous recovery thats a diversion thats what i do to get my brothers in all the time
mam said oh i dont know about that mikey wouldnt that be a sin and surely you wouldnt want frank to commit a sin on his first communion day
mikey said if there was a sin it would be on his soul and he wasnt a proper catholic anyway so it didnt matter he let out his scream and i slipped in and sat next to question quigley and the ticket man frank goggin was so worried over mikey he never noticed it was a thrilling film but sad in the end because james cagney was a public enemy and when they shot him they wrapped him in bandages and threw him in the door shocking his poor old irish mother and that was the end of my first communion day

grandma wont talk to mam anymore because of what i did with god in her backyard mam doesnt talk to her sister aunt aggie or her brother uncle tom dad doesnt talk to anyone in mams family and they dont talk to him because hes from the north and he has the odd manner no one talks to uncle toms wife jane because shes from galway and she has the look of a spaniard everyone talks to mams brother uncle pat because he was dropped on his head hes simple and he sells newspapers everyone calls him the abbot or ab sheehan and no one knows why everyone talks to uncle pa keating because he was gassed in the war and married aunt aggie and if they didnt talk to him he wouldnt give a fiddlers fart anyway and thats why the men in souths pub call him a gas man
thats the way id like to be in the world a gas man not giving a fiddlers fart and thats what i tell the angel on the seventh step till i remember youre not supposed to say fart in the presence of an angel
uncle tom and galway jane have children but were not supposed to talk to them because our parents are not talking they have a son and daughter gerry and peggy and mam will yell at us for talking to them but we dont know how not to talk to our cousins
people in families in the lanes of limerick have their ways of not talking to each other and it takes years of practice there are people who dont talk to each other because their fathers were on opposite sides in the civil war in 1922 if a man goes off and joins the english army his family might as well move to another part of limerick where there are families with men in the english army if anyone in your family was the least way friendly to the english in the last eight hundred years it will be brought up and thrown in your face and you might as well move to dublin where no one cares there are families that are ashamed of themselves because their forefathers gave up their religion for the sake of a bowl of protestant soup during the famine and those families are known ever after as soupers its a terrible thing to be a souper because youre doomed forever to the souper part of hell its even worse to be an informer the master at school said that everytime the irish were about to demolish the english in a fair fight a filthy informer betrayed them a man whos discovered to be an informer deserves to be hanged or even worse to have no one talk to him for if no one talks to you youre better off hanging at the end of a rope
in every lane theres always someone not talking to someone or everyone not talking to someone or someone not talking to everyone you can always tell when people are not talking by the way they pass each other the women hoist their noses tighten their mouths and turn their faces away if the woman is wearing a shawl she takes a corner and flings it over her shoulder as if to say one word or look from you you ma faced bitch and ill tear the countenance from the front of your head
its bad when grandma wont talk to us because we cant run to her when we need to borrow sugar or tea or milk theres no use going to aunt aggie shell only bite your head off go home shell say and tell your father to get off his northern arse and get a job like the decent men of limerick
they say shes always angry because she has red hair or she has red hair because shes always angry
mam is friendly with bridey hannon who lives next door with her mother and father mam and bridey talk all the time when my father goes for his long walk bridey comes in and she and mam sit by the fire drinking tea and smoking cigarettes if mam has nothing in the house bridey brings tea sugar and milk sometimes they use the same tea leaves over and over and mam says the tea is stewed coddled and boiled
mam and bridey sit so close to the fire their shins turn red and purple and blue they talk for hours and they whisper and laugh over secret things were not supposed to hear the secret things so were told go out and play i often sit on the seventh step listening and they have no notion im there it might be lashing rain out but mam says rain or no out you go and shell tell us if you see your father coming run in and tell me mam says to bridey did you ever hear that poem that someone must have made up about me and him
what poem angela
tis called the man from the north  i got this poem from minnie macadorey in america
i never heard that poem say it for me
mam says the poem but she laughs all through it and i dont know why he came from the north so his words were few but his voice was kind and his heart was true
and i knew by his eyes that no guile had he so i married my man from the north country
oh garryowen may be more gay
than this quiet man from beside lough neagh and i know that the sun shines softly down
on the river that runs through my native town
but theres notand i say it with joy and with pride a better man in all munster wide
and limerick town has no happier hearth
than mine has been with my man from the north
i wish that in limerick they only knew the kind kind neighbors i came unto small hate or scorn would there ever be between the south and the north country
she always repeats the third verse and laughs so hard shes crying and i dont know why she goes into hysterics when she says and limerick town has no happier hearth than mine has been with my man from the north
if he comes back early and sees bridey in the kitchen the man from the north says gossip gossip gossip and stands there with his cap on till she leaves
brideys mother and other people in our lane and lanes beyond will come to the door to ask dad if hell write a letter to the government or a relation in a distant place he sits at the table with his pen and bottle of ink and when the people tell him what to write he says och no thats not what you want to say and he writes what he feels like writing the people tell him thats what they wanted to say in the first place that he has a lovely way with the english language and a fine fist for the writing they offer him sixpence for his trouble but he waves it away and they hand it to mam because hes too grand to be taking sixpence when the people leave he takes the sixpence and sends me to kathleen oconnells shop for cigarettes
grandma sleeps in a big bed upstairs with a picture of the sacred heart of jesus over her head and a statue of the sacred heart on the mantel piece she wants to switch from gaslight to electric light someday so that shell have a little red light under the statue forever her devotion to the sacred heart is known up and down the lane and in lanes beyond
uncle pat sleeps in a small bed in a corner of the same room where grandma can make sure he comes in at a proper hour and kneels by the bed to say his prayers he might have been dropped on his head he may not know how to read and write he may drink one pint too many but theres no excuse for not saying his prayers before he goes to sleep
uncle pat tells grandma he met a man who is looking for a place to stay that will let him wash himself morning and night and give him two
meals a day dinner and tea his name is bill galvin and he has a good job down at the lime kiln hes covered all the time with white lime dust but surely thats better than coal dust
grandma will have to give up her bed and move into the small room shell take the sacred heart picture and leave the statue to watch over the two men besides she has no place for a statue in her little room
bill galvin comes after work to see the place hes small all white and he snuffles like a dog he asks grandma if shed mind taking down that statue because hes a protestant and he wouldnt be able to sleep grandma barks at uncle pat for not telling her he was dragging a protestant into the house jesus she says there will be gossip up and down the lane and beyond
uncle pat says he didnt know bill galvin was a protestant you could never tell by looking at him especially the way hes covered with lime he looks like an ordinary catholic and youd never imagine a protestant would be shoveling lime
bill galvin says his poor wife that just died was a catholic and she had the walls covered with pictures of the sacred heart and the virgin mary showing their hearts hes not against the sacred heart himself its just that seeing the statue will remind him of his poor wife and give him the heartache
grandma says ah god help us why didnt you tell me that in the first place sure i can put the statue on the windowsill in my room and your heart wont be tormented at the sight of it
every morning grandma cooks bills dinner and takes it to him at the lime kiln mam wonders why he cant take it with him in the morning and grandma says do you expect me to get up at dawn and boil cabbage and pigs toes for his lordship to take in his dinner can
mam tells her in another week school will be over and if you give frank sixpence a week hell surely be glad to take bill galvin his dinner
i dont want to go to grandmas every day i dont want to take bill galvin his dinner all the way down the dock road but mam says thats sixpence we could use and if i dont do it im going nowhere else
youre staying in the house she says youre not playing with your
pals
grandma warns me to take the dinner can directly and not be
meandering looking this way and that kicking canisters and ruining the toes of my shoes this dinner is hot and thats the way bill galvin wants
it
theres a lovely smell from the dinner can boiled bacon and
cabbage and two big floury white potatoes surely he wont notice if i try half a potato he wont complain to grandma because he hardly ever talks outside of a snuffle or two
its better if i eat the other half potato so that he wont be asking why he got a half i might as well try the bacon and cabbage too and if i eat the other potato hell surely think she didnt send one at all
the second potato melts in my mouth and ill have to try another bit of cabbage another morsel of bacon there isnt much left now and hell be very suspicious so i might as well finish off the rest
what am i going to do now grandma will destroy me mam will keep me in for a year bill galvin will bury me in lime ill tell him i was
attacked by a dog on the dock road and he ate the whole dinner and im lucky i escaped without being eaten myself
oh is that so says bill galvin and whats that bit of cabbage hanging on your gansey did the dog lick you wit his cabbagey gob go home and tell your grandmother you ate me whole dinner and im falling down with the hunger here in this lime kiln
shell kill me
tell her dont kill you till she sends me some class of a dinner and if you dont go to her now and get me a dinner ill kill you and throw your body into the lime there and there wont be much left for your mother to moan over
grandma says what are you doin back with that can he could bring that back by himself
he wants more dinner
what do you mean more dinner jesus above is it a hole he has in his leg
hes falling down with the hunger below in the lime kiln is it coddin me you are
he says send him any class of a dinner
i will not i sent him his dinner
he didnt get it
he didnt why not
i ate it
what
i was hungry and i tasted it and i couldnt stop
jesus mary and holy st joseph
she gives me a clout on the head that brings tears to my eyes she
screams at me like a banshee and jumps around the kitchen and threatens to drag me to the priest the bishop the pope himself if he lived around the corner she cuts bread and waves the knife at me and makes sandwiches of brawn and cold potatoes
take these sandwiches to bill galvin and if you even look cross eyed at them ill skin your hide
of course she runs to mam and they agree the only way i can make up for my terrible sin is to deliver bill galvins dinner for a fortnight without pay im to bring back the can every day and that means i have to sit watching him stuff the food into his gob and hes not one that would ever ask you if you had a mouth in your head
every day i take the can back grandma makes me kneel to the statue of the sacred heart and tell him im sorry and all this over bill galvin a protestant
mam says im a martyr for the fags and so is your father
there may be a lack of tea or bread in the house but mam and dad always manage to get the fags the wild woodbines they have to have the woodbines in the morning and anytime they drink tea they tell us every day we should never smoke its bad for your lungs its bad for your chest it stunts your growth and they sit by the fire puffing away mam says if tis a thing i ever see you with a fag in your gob ill break your face they tell us the cigarettes rot your teeth and you can see theyre not lying the teeth turn brown and black in their heads and fall out one by one dad says he has holes in his teeth big enough for a sparrow to raise a family he has a few left but he gets them pulled at the clinic and applies for a false set when he comes home with the new teeth he shows his big new white smile that makes him look like an
american and whenever he tells us a ghost story by the fire he pushes the lower teeth up beyond his lip to his nose and frightens the life out of us mams teeth are so bad she has to go to barringtons hospital to have them all pulled at the same time and when she comes home shes holding at her mouth a rag bright with blood she has to sit up all night by the fire because you cant lie down when your gums are pumping blood or youll choke in your sleep she says shell give up smoking entirely when this bleeding stops but she needs one puff of a fag this minute for the comfort thats in it she tells malachy go to kathleen oconnells shop and ask her would she ever let her have five woodbines till dad collects the dole on thursday if anyone can get the fags out of kathleen malachy can mam says he has the charm and she tells me theres no use sending you with your long puss and your fathers odd manner
when the bleeding stops and mams gums heal she goes to the clinic for her false teeth she says shell give up the smoking when her new teeth are in but she never does the new teeth rub on her gums and make them sore and the smoke of the woodbines eases them she and dad sit by the fire when we have one and smoke their cigarettes and when they talk their teeth clack they try to stop the clacking by moving their jaws back and forth but that only makes it worse and they curse the dentists and the people above in dublin who made the teeth and while they curse they clack dad claims these teeth were made for rich people in dublin and didnt fit so they were passed on to the poor of limerick who dont care because you dont have much to chew when youre poor anyway and youre grateful you have any class of a tooth in your head if they talk too long their gums get sore and the teeth have to come out then they sit talking by the fire with their faces collapsed every night they leave the teeth in the kitchen in jam jars filled with water malachy wants to know why and dad tells him it cleans them mam says no you cant have teeth in your head while youre sleeping for theyll slip and choke you to death entirely
the teeth are the cause of malachy going to barringtons hospital and me having an operation malachy whispers to me in the middle of the night do you want to go downstairs and see if we can wear the teeth
the teeth are so big we have trouble getting them into our mouths but malachy wont give up he forces dads upper teeth into his mouth and cant get them out again his lips are drawn back and the teeth make a big grin he looks like a monster in a film and it makes me laugh but he pulls at them and grunts uck uck and tears come to his eyes the more he goes uck uck the harder i laugh till dad calls from upstairs what are you boys doing malachy runs from me up the stairs and now i hear dad and mam laughing till they see he can choke on the teeth they both stick their fingers in to pull out the teeth but malachy gets frightened and makes desperate uck uck sounds mam says well have to take him to the hospital and dad says hell take him he makes me go in case the doctor has questions because im older than malachy and that means i must have started all the trouble dad rushes through the streets with malachy in his arms and i try to keep up i feel sorry for malachy up there on dads shoulder looking back at me tears on his cheeks and dads teeth bulging in his mouth the doctor at barringtons hospital says no bother he pours oil into malachys mouth and has the teeth out in a minute then he looks at me and says to dad why is that child standing there with his mouth hanging open
dad says thats a habit he has standing with his mouth open
the doctor says come here to me he looks up my nose in my ears down my throat and feels my neck
the tonsils he says the adenoids they have to come out the sooner the better or hell look like an idiot when he grows up with that gob wide as a boot
next day malachy gets a big piece of toffee as a reward for sticking in teeth he cant get out and i have to go to the hospital to have an operation that will close my mouth
on a saturday morning mam finishes her tea and says youre going to dance
dance why
youre seven years old you made your first communion and now tis time for the dancing im taking you down to catherine street to mrs oconnors irish dancing classes youll go there every saturday morning and thatll keep you off the streets thatll keep you from wandering around limerick with hooligans
she tells me wash my face not forgetting ears and neck comb my hair blow my nose take the look off my face what look never mind just take it off put on my stockings and my first communion shoes which she says are destroyed because i cant pass a canister or a rock without kicking it shes worn out standing in the queue at the st vincent de paul society begging for boots for me and malachy so that we can wear out the toes with the kicking your father says its never too early to learn the songs and dances of your ancestors
whats ancestors
never mind she says youre going to dance
i wonder how i can die for ireland if i have to sing and dance for
ireland too i wonder why they never say you can eat sweets and stay home from school and go swimming for ireland
mam says dont get smart or ill warm your ear
cyril benson dances he has medals hanging from his shoulders to his kneecaps he wins contests all over ireland and he looks lovely in his saffron kilt hes a credit to his mother and he gets his name in the paper all the time and you can be sure he brings home the odd few pounds you dont see him roaming the streets kicking everything in sight till the toes hang out of his boots oh no hes a good boy dancing for his poor mother
mam wets an old towel and scrubs my face till it stings she wraps the towel around her finger and sticks it in my ears and claims theres enough wax there to grow potatoes she wets my hair to make it lie down she tells me shut up and stop the whinging that these dancing lessons will cost her sixpence every saturday which i could have earned bringing bill galvin his dinner and god knows she can barely afford it i try to tell her ah mam sure you dont have to send me to dancing school when you could be smoking a nice woodbine and having a cup of tea but she says oh arent you clever youre going to dance if i have to give up the fags forever
if my pals see my mother dragging me through the streets to an irish dancing class ill be disgraced entirely they think its all right to dance and pretend youre fred astaire because you can jump all over the screen with ginger rogers there is no ginger rogers in irish dancing and you cant jump all over you stand straight up and down and keep your arms against yourself and kick your legs up and around and never smile
my uncle pa keating said irish dancers look like they have steel rods up their arses but i cant say that to mam shed kill me
theres a gramophone in mrs oconnors playing an irish jig or a reel and boys and girls are dancing around kicking their legs out and keeping their hands to their sides mrs oconnor is a great fat woman and when she stops the record to show the steps all the fat from her chin to her ankles jiggles and i wonder how she can teach the dancing she comes over to my mother and says so this is little frankie i think we have the makings of a dancer here boys and girls do we have the makings of a dancer here
we do mrs oconnor
mam says i have the sixpence mrs oconnor
ah yes mrs mccourt hold on a minute
she waddles to a table and brings back the head of a black boy with
kinky hair big eyes huge red lips and an open mouth she tells me put the sixpence in the mouth and take my hand out before the black boy bites me all the boys and girls watch and they have little smiles i drop in the sixpence and pull my hand back before the mouth snaps shut everyone laughs and i know they wanted to see my hand caught in the mouth mrs oconnor gasps and laughs and says to my mother isnt that a howl now mam says its a howl she tells me behave myself and come home dancing i dont want to stay in this place where mrs oconnor cant take the sixpence herself instead of letting me nearly lose my hand in the black boys mouth
i dont want to stay in this place where you have to stand in line with boys and girls straighten your back hands by your sides look ahead dont look down move your feet move your feet look at cyril look at cyril and there goes cyril all dressed up in his saffron kilt and the medals jingling medals for this and medals for that and the girls love cyril and mrs oconnor loves cyril for didnt he bring her fame and didnt she teach him every step he knows oh dance cyril dance oh jesus he floats around the room hes an angel out of heaven and stop the frowning frankie mccourt or youll have a puss on you like a pound of tripe dance frankie dance pick up your feet for the love o jesus onetwothreefourfivesixseven onetwothree and a onetwothree maura will you help that frankie mccourt before he ties his two feet around his poll entirely help him maura
maura is a big girl about ten she dances up to me with her white teeth and her dancers dress with all the gold and yellow and green figures that are supposed to come from olden times and she says give me your hand little boy and she wheels me around the room till im dizzy and making a pure eejit of myself and blushing and foolish till i want to cry but im saved when the record stops and the gramophone goes hoosh hoosh
mrs oconnor says oh thank you maura and next week cyril you can show frankie a few of the steps that made you famous next week boys and girls and dont forget the sixpence for the little black boy
boys and girls leave together i make my own way down the stairs and out the door hoping my pals wont see me with boys who wear kilts and girls with white teeth and fancy dresses from olden times
mam is having tea with bridey hannon her friend from next door mam says what did you learn and makes me dance around the kitchen onetwothreefourfivesixseven onetwothree and a onetwothree she has a good
laugh with bridey thats not too bad for your first time in a month youll be like a regular cyril benson
i dont want to be cyril benson i want to be fred astaire
they turn hysterical laughing and squirting tea out of their mouths jesus love him says bridey doesnt he have a great notion of himself fred astaire how are you
mam says fred astaire went to his lessons every saturday and didnt go around kicking the toes out of his boots and if i wanted to be like him id have to go to mrs oconnors every week
the fourth saturday morning billy campbell knocks at our door mrs mccourt can frankie come out and play mam tells him no billy frankie is going to his dancing lesson
he waits for me at the bottom of barrack hill he wants to know why im dancing that everyone knows dancing is a sissy thing and ill wind up like cyril benson wearing a kilt and medals and dancing all over with girls he says next thing ill be sitting in the kitchen knitting socks he says dancing will destroy me and i wont be fit to play any kind of football soccer rugby or gaelic football itself because the dancing teaches you to run like a sissy and everyone will laugh
i tell him im finished with the dancing that i have sixpence in my pocket for mrs oconnor thats supposed to go into the black boys mouth that im going to the lyric cinema instead sixpence will get the two of us in with tuppence left over for two squares of cleeves toffee and we have a great time looking at riders of the purple sage
dad is sitting by the fire with mam and they want to know what steps i learned today and what theyre called i already did the siege of ennis and the walls of limerick  which are real dances now i have to make up names and dances mam says she never heard of a dance called the siege of dinglebut if thats what i learned go ahead dance it and i dance around the kitchen with my hands down by my sides making my own music diddley eye di eye di eye diddley eye do you do you dad and mam clapping in time with my feet dad says och thats a fine dance and youll be a powerful irish dancer and a credit to the men who died for their country mam says that wasnt much for a sixpence
next week its a george raft film and the week after that a cowboy film with george obrien then its james cagney and i cant take billy because i want to get a bar of chocolate to go with my cleeves toffee and im having a great time till theres a terrible pain in my jaw and its a tooth out of my gum stuck in my toffee and the pain is killing me still i cant waste the toffee so i pull out the tooth and put it in my pocket and chew the toffee on the other side of my mouth blood and all theres pain on one side and delicious toffee on the other and i remember what my uncle pa keating would say there are times when you wouldnt know whether to shit or go blind
i have to go home now and worry because you cant go through the world short a tooth without your mother knowing mothers know everything and shes always looking into our mouths to see if theres any class of disease shes there by the fire and dad is there and theyre asking me the same old questions the dance and the name of the dance i tell them i learned the walls of cork and i dance around the kitchen trying to hum a made up tune and dying with the pain of my tooth mam says walls o cork  my eye theres no such dance and dad says come over here stand there before me tell us the truth did you go to your dancing classes today
i cant tell a lie anymore because my gum is killing me and theres blood in my mouth besides i know they know everything and thats what theyre telling me now some snake of a boy from the dancing school saw me going to the lyric cinema and told and mrs oconnor sent a note to say she hadnt seen me in ages and was i all right because i had great promise and could follow in the footsteps of the great cyril benson
dad doesnt care about my tooth or anything he says im going to confession and drags me over to the redemptorist church because its saturday and confessions go on all day he tells me im a bad boy hes ashamed of me that i went to the pictures instead of learning irelands national dances the jig the reel the dances that men and women fought and died for down those sad centuries he says theres many a young man that was hanged and now moldering in a lime pit that would be glad to rise up and dance the irish dance
the priest is old and i have to yell my sins at him and he tells me im a hooligan for going to the pictures instead of my dancing lessons although he thinks himself that dancing is a dangerous thing almost as bad as the films that it stirs up thoughts sinful in themselves but even if dancing is an abomination i sinned by taking my mothers sixpence and lying and theres a hot place in hell for the likes of me say a decade of the rosary and ask gods forgiveness for youre dancing at the gates of hell itself child
im seven eight nine going on ten and still dad has no work he drinks his tea in the morning signs for the dole at the labour exchange reads the papers at the carnegie library goes for his long walks far into the country if he gets a job at the limerick cement company or ranks flour mills he loses it in the third week he loses it because he goes to the pubs on the third friday of the job drinks all his wages and misses the half day of work on saturday morning
mam says why cant he be like the other men from the lanes of limerick theyre home before the angelus rings at six oclock they hand over their wages change their shirts have their tea get a few shillings from the wife and theyre off to the pub for a pint or two
mam tells bridey hannon that dad cant be like that and wont be like that she says hes a right bloody fool the way he goes to pubs and stands pints to other men while his own children are home with their bellies stuck to their backbones for the want of a decent dinner hell brag to the world he did his bit for ireland when it was neither popular nor profitable that hell gladly die for ireland when the call comes that he regrets he has only one life to give for his poor misfortunate country and if anyone disagrees theyre invited to step outside and settle this for once and for all
oh no says mam they wont disagree and they wont step outside that bunch of tinkers and knackers and begrudgers that hang around the pubs they tell him hes a grand man even if hes from the north and twould be an honor to accept a pint from such a patriot
mam tells bridey i dont know under god what im going to do the dole is nineteen shillings and sixpence a week the rent is six and six and that leaves thirteen shillings to feed and clothe five people and keep us warm in the winter
bridey drags on her woodbine drinks her tea and declares that god is good mam says shes sure god is good for someone somewhere but he hasnt been seen lately in the lanes of limerick
bridey laughs oh angela you could go to hell for that and mam says arent i there already bridey
and they laugh and drink their tea and smoke their woodbines and tell one another the fag is the only comfort they have
tis
question quigley tells me i have to go to the redemptorist church on friday and join the boys division of the arch confraternity you have to join you cant say no all the boys in the lanes and back streets that have fathers on the dole or working in laboring jobs have to join
question says your father is a foreigner from the north and he dont matter but you still have to join
everyone knows limerick is the holiest city in ireland because it has the arch confraternity of the holy family the biggest sodality in the world any city can have a confraternity only limerick has the arch
our confraternity fills the redemptorist church five nights a week three for the men one for the women one for the boys there is benediction and hymn singing in english irish and latin and best of all the big powerful sermon redemptorist priests are famous for its the sermon that saves millions of chinese and other heathens from winding up in hell with the protestants
the question says you have to join the confraternity so that your mother can tell the st vincent de paul society and theyll know youre a good catholic he says his father is a loyal member and thats how he got a good pensionable job cleaning lavatories at the railway station and when he grows up himself hell get a good job too unless he runs away and joins the royal canadian mounted police so that he can sing ill be calling you ooo ooo ooo  like nelson eddy singing to jeanette macdonald expiring with consumption there on the sofa if he brings me to the confraternity the man in the office will write his name in a big book and some day he might be promoted to prefect of a section which is all he wants in life next to wearing the mountie uniform
the prefect is head of a section which is thirty boys from the same lanes and streets every section has the name of a saint whose picture is painted on a shield stuck on top of a pole by the prefects seat the prefect and his assistant take the attendance and keep an eye on us so that they can give us a thump on the head in case we laugh during benediction or commit any other sacrileges if you miss one night the man in the office wants to know why wants to know if youre slipping away from the confraternity or he might say to the other man in the office i think our little friend here has taken the soup thats the worst thing you can say to any catholic in limerick or ireland itself because of what happened in the great famine if youre absent twice the man in the office sends you a yellow summons to appear and explain yourself and if youre absent three times he sends the posse which is five or six big boys from your section who search the streets to make sure youre not out enjoying yourself when you should be on your knees at the confraternity praying for the chinese and other lost souls the posse will go to your house and tell your mother your immortal soul is in danger some mothers worry but others will say get away from my door or ill come out and give every one o ye a good fong in the hole of yeer arse these are not good confraternity mothers and the director will say we should pray for them that theyll see the error of their ways
the worst thing of all is a visit from the director of the confraternity himself father gorey hell stand at the top of the lane
and roar in the voice that converted the chinese millions where is the house of frank mccourt he roars even though he has your address in his pocket and knows very well where you live he roars because he wants the world to know youre slipping away from the confraternity and putting your immortal soul in danger the mothers are terrified and the fathers will whisper im not here im not here and theyll make sure you go to the confraternity from this on out so they wont be disgraced and shamed entirely with the neighbors muttering behind their hands
the question takes me to the section st finbars and the prefect tells me sit over there and shut up his name is declan collopy hes fourteen and he has lumps on his forehead that look like horns he has thick ginger eyebrows that meet in the middle and hang over his eyes and his arms hang down to his kneecaps he tells me hes making this the best section in the confraternity and if im ever absent hell break my arse and send the bits to my mother theres no excuse for absence because there was a boy in another section that was dying and still they brought him in on a stretcher he says if youre ever absent it better be a death not a death in the family but your own death do you hear me
i do declan
boys in my section tell me that prefects get rewards if there is perfect attendance declan wants to get out of school as soon as he can and get a job selling linoleum at cannocks big shop on patrick street his uncle foncey sold linoleum there for years and made enough money to start his own shop in dublin where he has his three sons selling linoleum father gorey the director can easily get declan the reward of a job at cannocks if hes a good prefect and has perfect attendance in his section and thats why declan will destroy us if were absent he tells us no one will stand between me and the linoleum
declan likes question quigley and lets him miss an occasional friday night because the question said declan when i grow up and get married im going to cover my house in linoleum and ill buy it all from you
other boys in the section try this trick with declan but he says bugger off yell be lucky enough to have a pot to piss in never mind yards of linoleum
dad says when he was my age in toome he served mass for years and its time for me to be an altar boy mam says whats the use the child doesnt have proper clothes for school never mind the altar dad says the altar boy robes will cover the clothes and she says we dont have the money for robes and the wash they need every week
he says god will provide and makes me kneel on the kitchen floor he takes the part of the priest for he has the whole mass in his head and i have to know the responses he says introibo ad altare dei and i have to say ad deum qui laetificat juventutem meam
every evening after tea i kneel for the latin and he wont let me move till im perfect mam says he could at least let me sit but he says latin is sacred and it is to be learned and recited on the knees you wont find the pope sitting around drinking tea while he speaks the latin
the latin is hard and my knees are sore and scabby and id like to be out in the lane playing though still id like to be an altar boy helping the priest vest in the sacristy up there on the altar all decked out in my red and white robes like my pal jimmy clark answering the priest in latin moving the big book from one side of the tabernacle to
the other pouring water and wine into the chalice pouring water over the priests hands ringing the bell at consecration kneeling bowing swinging the censer at benediction sitting off to the side with the palms of my hands on my knees all serious while he gives his sermon everyone in st josephs looking at me and admiring my ways
in a fortnight i have the mass in my head and its time to go to st josephs to see the sacristan stephen carey who is in charge of altar boys dad polishes my boots mam darns my socks and throws an extra coal on the fire to heat up the iron to press my shirt she boils water to scrub my head neck hands and knees and any inch of skin that shows she scrubs till my skin burns and tells dad she wouldnt give it to the world to say her son went on the altar dirty she wishes i didnt have scabby knees from running around kicking canisters and falling down pretending i was the greatest footballer in the world she wishes we had a drop of hair oil in the house but water and spit will keep my hair from sticking up like black straw in a mattress she warns me speak up when i go to st josephs and dont be mumbling in english or latin she says tis a great pity you grew out of your first communion suit but you have nothing to be ashamed of you come from good blood mccourts sheehans or my mothers family the guilfoyles that owned acre after acre in county limerick before the english took it away and gave it to footpads from london
dad holds my hand going through the streets and people look at us because of the way were saying latin back and forth he knocks at the sacristy door and tells stephen carey this is my son frank who knows the latin and is ready to be an altar boy
stephen carey looks at him then me he says we dont have room for him and closes the door
dad is still holding my hand and squeezes till it hurts and i want to cry out he says nothing on the way home he takes off his cap sits by the fire and lights a woodbine mam is smoking too well she says is he going to be an altar boy
theres no room for him
oh she puffs on her woodbine ill tell you what it is she says tis class distinction they dont want boys from lanes on the altar they dont want the ones with scabby knees and hair sticking up oh no they want the nice boys with hair oil and new shoes that have fathers with suits and ties and steady jobs thats what it is and tis hard to hold on to the faith with the snobbery thats in it
och aye
oh och aye my arse thats all you ever say you could go to the priest and tell him you have a son that has a head stuffed with latin and why cant he be an altar boy and what is he going to do with all that latin
och he might grow up to be a priest
i ask him if i can go out and play yes he says go out and play mam says you might as well
vi
mr oneill is the master in the fourth class at school we call him dotty because hes small like a dot he teaches in the one classroom with
a platform so that he can stand above us and threaten us with his ash plant and peel his apple for all to see the first day of school in september he writes on the blackboard three words which are to stay there the rest of the year euclid geometry idiot he says if he catches any boy interfering with these words that boy will go through the rest of his life with one hand he says anyone who doesnt understand the theorems of euclid is an idiot now repeat after me anyone who doesnt understand the theorems of euclid is an idiot of course we all know what an idiot is because thats what the masters keep telling us we are
brendan quigley raises his hand sir whats a theorem and whats a euclid
we expect dotty to lash at brendan the way all the masters do when you ask them a question but he looks at brendan with a little smile ah now heres a boy with not one but two questions what is your name boy
brendan quigley sir
this is a boy who will go far where will he go boys
far sir
indeed and he will the boy who wants to know something about the
grace elegance and beauty of euclid can go nowhere but up in what direction and no other can this boy go boys
up sir
without euclid boys mathematics would be a poor doddering thing without euclid we wouldnt be able to go from here to there without euclid the bicycle would have no wheel without euclid st joseph could not have been a carpenter for carpentry is geometry and geometry is carpentry without euclid this very school could never have been built
paddy clohessy mutters behind me feckin euclid
dotty barks at him you boy what is your name
clohessy sir
ah the boy flies on one wing what is your christian name paddy
paddy what
paddy sir
and what paddy were you saying to mccourt i said we
down on our two knees and thank god for euclid
im sure you did clohessy i see the lie festering in
what do i see boys
the lie sir
and what is the lie doing boys
festering sir
where boys where
in his teeth sir
euclid boys was a greek what clohessy is a greek some class of a foreigner sir
clohessy you are a halfwit now brendan surely you
should get
your teeth
know what a
greek is
yes sir euclid was a greek
dotty gives him the little smile he tells clohessy he should model
himself on quigley who knows what a greek is he draws two lines side by side and tells us these are parallel lines and the magical and mysterious thing is that they never meet not if they were to be extended to infinity not if they were extended to gods shoulders and that boys is a long way though there is a german jew who is upsetting the whole world with his ideas on parallel lines
we listen to dotty and wonder what all this has to do with the state of the world with the germans marching everywhere and bombing everything that stands we cant ask him ourselves but we can get brendan quigley to do it anyone can see brendan is the masters pet and that means he can ask any question he likes after school we tell brendan he has to ask the question tomorrow what use is euclid and all those lines that go on forever when the germans are bombing everything brendan says he doesnt want to be the masters pet he didnt ask for it and he doesnt want to ask the question hes afraid if he asks that question dotty will attack him we tell him if he doesnt ask the question well attack him
next day brendan raises his hand dotty gives him the little smile sir what use is euclid and all the lines when the germans are bombing everything that stands
the little smile is gone ah brendan ah quigley oh boys oh boys
he lays his stick on the desk and stands on the platform with his eyes closed what use is euclid he says use without euclid the messerschmitt could never have taken to the sky without euclid the spitfire could not dart from cloud to cloud euclid brings us grace and beauty and elegance what does he bring us boys
grace sir
and
beauty sir
and
elegance sir
euclid is complete in himself and divine in application do you
understand that boys
we do sir
i doubt it boys i doubt it to love euclid is to be alone in this world
he opens his eyes and sighs and you can see the eyes are a little watery
paddy clohessy is leaving the school that day and hes stopped by mr odea who teaches the fifth class mr odea says you whats your
name
clohessy sir
what class are you in
fourth class sir
now tell me clohessy is that master of yours talking to you about
euclid
he is sir
and what is he saying
hes saying hes a greek
of course he is you diddering omadhaun what else is he saying hes saying there would be no school without euclid
ah now is he drawing anything on the board
hes drawing lines side by side that will never meet even if they
land on gods shoulders
mother o god
no sir gods shoulders
i know you idiot go home
the next day theres a great noise at our classroom door and mr odea is yelling come out oneill you chancer you poltroon we can hear everything hes saying because of the broken glass over the door
the new headmaster mr ohalloran is saying now now mr odea control yourself no quarreling in front of our pupils
well then mr ohalloran tell him stop teaching the geometry the geometry is for the fifth form and not the fourth the geometry is mine tell him to teach the long division and leave euclid to me long division will stretch his intellect such as it is god help us i dont want the minds of these boys destroyed by that chancer up there on the platform him handing out apple skins and causing diarrhea right and left tell him euclid is mine mr ohalloran or ill put a stop to his gallop
mr ohalloran tells mr odea to return to his classroom and asks mr oneill to step into the hall mr ohalloran says now mr oneill i have asked you before to stay away from euclid
you have mr ohalloran but you might as well ask me to stop eating my daily apple
ill have to insist mr oneill no more euclid
mr oneill comes back to the room and his eyes are watery again he says little has changed since the time of the greeks for the barbarians are within the gates and their names are legion what has changed since the time of the greeks boys
it is torture to watch mr oneill peel the apple every day to see the length of it red or green and if youre up near him to catch the freshness of it in your nose if youre the good boy for that day and you answer the questions he gives it to you and lets you eat it there at your desk so that you can eat it in peace with no one to bother you the way they would if you took it into the yard then theyd torment you gimme a piece gimme a piece and youd be lucky to have an inch left for yourself
there are days when the questions are too hard and he torments us by dropping the apple peel into the wastebasket then he borrows a boy from another class to take the wastebasket down to the furnace to burn papers and apple peel or hell leave it for the charwoman nellie ahearn to take it all away in her big canvas sack wed like to ask nellie to keep the peel for us before the rats get it but shes weary from cleaning the whole school by herself and she snaps at us i have other things to be doin with me life besides watchin a scabby bunch rootin around for the skin of an apple go way
he peels the apple slowly he looks around the room with the little smile he teases us do you think boys i should give this to the pigeons on the windowsill we say no sir pigeons dont eat apples paddy clohessy calls out twill give them the runs sir and well have it on our heads abroad in the yard
clohessy you are an omadhaun do you know what an omadhaun is
i dont sir
its the irish clohessy your native tongue clohessy an omadhaun
is a fool clohessy you are an omadhaun what is he boys an omadhaun sir
clohessy says thats what mr odea called me sir a diddering omadhaun
he pauses in his peeling to ask us questions about everything in the world and the boy with the best answers wins hands up he says who is the president of the united states of america
every hand in the class goes up and were all disgusted when he asks a question that any omadhaun would know we call out roosevelt
then he says you mulcahy who stood at the foot of the cross when our lord was crucified
mulcahy is slow the twelve apostles sir mulcahy what is the irish word for fool omadhaun sir
and what are you mulcahy
an omadhaun sir
fintan slattery raises his hand i know who stood at the foot of the cross sir
of course fintan knows who stood at the foot of the cross why wouldnt he hes always running off to mass with his mother who is known for her holiness shes so holy her husband ran off to canada to cut down trees glad to be gone and never to be heard from again she and fintan say the rosary every night on their knees in the kitchen and read all kinds of religious magazines the little messenger of the sacred heart the lantern the far east as well as every little book printed by the catholic truth society they go to mass and communion rain or shine and every saturday they confess to the jesuits who are known for their interest in intelligent sins not the usual sins you hear from people in lanes who are known for getting drunk and sometimes eating meat on fridays before it goes bad and cursing on top of it fintan and his mother live on catherine street and mrs slatterys neighbors call her mrs offeritup because no matter what happens a broken leg a spilled cup of tea a disappeared husband she says well now ill offer that up and ill have no end of indulgences to get me into heaven fintan is just as bad if you push him in the schoolyard or call him names hell smile and tell you hell pray for you and hell offer it up for his soul and yours the boys in leamys dont want fintan praying for them and they threaten to give him a good fong in the arse if they catch him praying for them he says he wants to be a saint when he grows up which is ridiculous because you cant be a saint till youre dead he says our grandchildren will be praying to his picture one big boy says my grandchildren will piss on your picture and fintan just smiles his sister ran away to england when she was seventeen and everyone knows he wears her blouse at home and curls his hair with hot iron tongs every saturday night so that hell look gorgeous at mass on sunday if he meets you going to mass hell say isnt my hair gorgeous frankie he loves that word gorgeous and no other boy will ever use it
of course he knows who stood at the foot of the cross he probably knows what they were wearing and what they had for breakfast and now hes telling dotty oneill it was the three marys dotty says come up here fintan and take your reward he takes his time going to the platform and we cant believe our eyes when he takes out a pocketknife to cut the apple peel into little bits so that he can eat them one by one and not be stuffing the whole thing into his mouth like the rest of us when we win he raises his hand sir id like to give some of my apple away
the apple fintan no indeed you do not have the apple fintan you have the peel the mere skin you have not nor will you ever achieve
heights so dizzy youll be feasting on the apple itself not my apple fintan now did i hear you say you want to give away your reward
you did sir id like to give three pieces to quigley clohessy and mccourt
why fintan
theyre my friends sir
the boys around the room are sneering and nudging each other and i
feel ashamed because theyll say i curl my hair and ill be tormented in the schoolyard and why does he think im his friend if they say i wear my sisters blouse theres no use telling them i dont have a sister because theyll say youd wear it if you had a sister theres no use saying anything in the schoolyard because theres always someone with an answer and theres nothing you can do but punch them in the nose and if you were to punch everyone who has an answer youd be punching morning noon and night
quigley takes the bit of peel from fintan thanks fintan
the whole class is looking at clohessy because hes the biggest and the toughest and if he says thanks ill say thanks he says thanks very much fintan and blushes and i say thanks very much fintan and i try to stop myself from blushing but i cant and all the boys sneer again and id like to hit them
after school the boys call to fintan hoi fintan are you goinhome to curl your gorgeous hair fintan smiles and climbs the steps of the schoolyard a big boy from seventh class says to paddy clohessy i suppose youd be curlin your hair too if you wasnt a baldy with a shaved head
paddy says shurrup and the boy says oh an whos goin to make me paddy tries a punch but the big boy hits his nose and knocks him down and theres blood i try to hit the big boy but he grabs me by the throat and bangs my head against the wall till i see lights and black dots paddy walks away holding his nose and crying and the big boy pushes me after him fintan is outside on the street and he says oh francis francis oh patrick patrick whats up why are you crying patrick and paddy says im hungry i cant fight nobody because im starving with the hunger an fallin down an im ashamed of meself
fintan says come with me patrick my mother will give us something and paddy says ah no me nose is bleedin
dont worry shell put something on your nose or a key on the back of your neck francis you must come too you always look hungry
ah no fintan
ah do francis
all right fintan
fintans flat is like a chapel there are two pictures the sacred
heart of jesus and the immaculate heart of mary jesus is showing his heart with the crown of thorns the fire the blood his head is tilted to the left to show his great sorrow the virgin mary is showing her heart and it would be a pleasant heart if it didnt have that crown of thorns her head is tilted to the right to show her sorrow because she knows her son will come to a sad end
theres a picture on another wall of a man with a brown robe and birds sitting all over him fintan says do you know who that is francis no thats your patron st francis of assisi and do you know what today is
the fourth of october
thats right and its his feast day and special for you because you can ask st francis for anything and hell surely give it to you thats why i wanted you to come here today sit down patrick sit down francis
mrs slattery comes in with her rosary beads in her hand shes happy to meet fintans new friends and would we like a cheese sandwich and look at your poor nose patrick she touches his nose with the cross on her rosary beads and says a little prayer she tells us these rosary beads were blessed by the pope himself and would stop the flow of a river if requested never mind patricks poor nose
fintan says he wont have a sandwich because hes fasting and praying for the boy who hit paddy and me mrs slattery gives him a kiss on the head and tells him hes a saint out of heaven and asks if wed like mustard on our sandwiches and i tell her i never heard of mustard on cheese and id love it paddy says i dunno i never had a sangwidge in me life and we all laugh and i wonder how you could live ten years like paddy and never have a sandwich paddy laughs too and you can see his teeth are white and black and green
we eat the sandwich and drink tea and paddy wants to know where the lavatory is fintan takes him through the bedroom to the backyard and when they come back paddy says i have to go home me motherll kill me ill wait for you outside frankie
now i have to go to the lavatory and fintan leads me to the backyard he says i have to go too and when i unbutton my fly i cant pee because hes looking at me and he says you were fooling you dont have to go at all i like to look at you francis thats all i wouldnt want to commit any class of a sin with our confirmation coming next year
paddy and i leave together im bursting and run behind a garage to pee paddy is waiting for me and as we walk along hartstonge street he says that was a powerful sangwidge frankie an him an his mother is very holy but i wouldnt want to go to fintans flat anymore because hes very odd isnt he frankie
he is paddy
the way he looks at it when you take it out thats odd isnt it frankie
tis paddy
a few days later paddy whispers fintan slattery said we could come to his flat at lunchtime his mother wont be there and she leaves his lunch for him he might give us some too and he has lovely milk will we go
fintan sits two rows from us he knows what paddy is saying to me and he moves his eyebrows up and down as if to say will you come i whisper yes to paddy and he nods to fintan and the master barks at us to stop waggling our eyebrows and our lips or the ash plant will sing across our backsides
boys in the schoolyard see the three of us walk out and they pass remarks oh gawd look at fintan and his ingles paddy says fintan whats an ingle and fintan says its just a boy from olden times who sits in a corner thats all he tells us sit at the table in his kitchen and we can read his comic books if we like film fun the beano the dandy or the religious magazines or his mothers romance magazines the miracle and the oracle which always have stories about factory girls who are poor but beautiful in love with sons of earls and vice versa and the factory girl ends up throwing herself into the thames with the
hopelessness only to be rescued by a passing carpenter who is poor but honest and will love the factory girl for her own humble self though it turns out the passing carpenter is really the son of a duke which is much higher than an earl so that now the poor factory girl is a duchess and can look down her nose at the earl who spurned her because shes happy tending her roses on her twelvethousandacre estate in shropshire and being kind to her poor old mother who refuses to leave her humble little cottage for all the money in the world
paddy says i dont want to read nothing its all a cod all them stories fintan removes the cloth covering his sandwich and glass of milk the milk looks creamy and cool and delicious and the sandwich bread is almost as white paddy says is that a ham sangwidge and fintan says tis paddy says thats a lovely looking sangwidge and is there mustard on it fintan nods and slices the sandwich in two mustard seeps out he licks it off his fingers and takes a nice mouthful of milk he cuts the sandwich again into quarters eighths sixteenths takes the little messenger of the sacred heart from the pile of magazines and reads while he eats his sandwich bits and drinks his milk and paddy and i look at him and i know paddy is wondering what were doing here at all at all because thats what im wondering myself hoping fintan will pass over the plate to us but he doesnt he finishes the milk leaves bits of sandwich on the plate covers it with the cloth and wipes his lips in his dainty way lowers his head blesses himself and says grace after meals and god well be late for school and blesses himself again on the way out with holy water from the little china font hanging by the door with the little image of the virgin mary showing her heart and pointing at it with two fingers as if we couldnt make it out for ourselves
its too late for paddy and me to run and get the bun and milk from nellie ahearn and i dont know how im going to last from now till i can run home after school and get a piece of bread paddy stops at the school gate he says i cant go in there starving with the hunger id fall asleep and dottyd kill me
fintan is anxious come on come on well be late come on francis hurry up
im not going in fintan you had your lunch we had nothing
paddy explodes youre a feckin chancer fintan thats what you are an a feckin begrudger too with your feckin sangwidge an your feckin sacred heart of jesus on the wall an your feckin holy water you can kiss my arse fintan
oh patrick
oh patrick my feckin arse fintan come on frankie
fintan runs into school and paddy and i make our way to an orchard
in ballinacurra we climb a wall and a fierce dog comes at us till paddy talks to him and tells him hes a good dog and were hungry and go home to your mother the dog licks paddys face and trots away waving his tail and paddy is delighted with himself we stuff apples into our shirts till we can barely get back over the wall to run into a long field and sit under a hedge eating the apples till we cant swallow another bit and we stick our faces into a stream for the lovely cool water then we run to opposite ends of a ditch to shit and wipe ourselves with grass and thick leaves paddy is squatting and saying theres nothing in the world like a good feed of apples a drink of water and a good shit better than any sangwidge of cheese and mustard and dotty oneill can shove his apple up his arse
there are three cows in a field with their heads over a stone wall and they say moo to us paddy says bejasus tis milkin time and hes over the wall stretched on his back under a cow with her big udder hanging into his face he pulls on a teat and squirts milk into his mouth he stops squirting and says come on frankie fresh milk tis lovely get that other cow theyre all ready for the milkin
i get under the cow and pull on a teat but she kicks and moves and im sure shes going to kill me paddy comes over and shows me how to do it pull hard and straight and the milk comes out in a powerful stream the two of us lie under the one cow and were having a great time filling ourselves with milk when theres a roar and theres a man with a stick charging across the field were over the wall in a minute and he cant follow us because of his rubber boots he stands at the wall and shakes his stick and shouts that if he ever catches us well have the length of his boot up our arses and we laugh because were out of harms way and im wondering why anyone should be hungry in a world full of milk and apples
its all right for paddy to say dotty can shove the apple up his arse but i dont want to rob orchards and milk cows forever and ill always try to win dottys apple peel so that i can go home and tell dad how i answered the hard questions
were walking back through ballinacurra theres rain and lightning and we run but its hard for me with the sole of my shoe flapping and threatening to trip me paddy can run all he wants in his long bare feet and you hear them slapping on the pavement my shoes and stockings are soaked and they make their own sound squish squish paddy notices that and we make a song from our two sounds slap slap squish squish slap squish squish slap we laugh so hard over our song we have to hold on to one another the rain gets heavier and we know we cant stand under a tree or well be fried entirely so we stand by a door which is opened in a minute by a big fat maid in a little white hat and a black dress with a little white apron who tells us get away from this door were a disgrace we run from the door and paddy calls back mullingar heifer beef to the heels and he laughs till he chokes and has to lean against a wall with the weakness theres no sense in standing in from the rain anymore were soaked to the skin so we take our time down oconnell avenue paddy says he learned that mullingar heifer thing from his uncle peter the one that was in india in the english army and they have a photo of him standing with a group of soldiers with their helmets and guns and bandoliers around their chests and there are dark men in uniform who are indians and loyal to the king uncle peter had a great time for himself in a place called kashmir which is lovelier than killarney that theyre always bragging about and singing paddy goes on again about running away and winding up in india in a silken tent with the girl with the red dot and the curry and the figs and hes making me hungry even if im stuffed with apples and milk
the rain is clearing and there are birds honking over our heads paddy says theyre ducks or geese or something on their way to africa where its nice and warm the birds have more sense than the irish they come to the shannon for their holidays and then they go back to the warm places maybe even india he says hell write me a letter when hes over there and i can come to india and have my own girl with a red dot
whats that dot for paddy
it shows theyre high class the quality
but paddy would the quality in india talk to you if they knew you were from a lane in limerick and had no shoes
course they would but the english quality wouldnt the english quality wouldnt give you the steam of their piss
steam of their piss god paddy did you think of that yourself
naw naw thats what my father says below in the bed when hes coughin up the gobs and blamin the english for everything
and i think steam of their piss ill keep that for myself ill go around limerick saying it steam of their piss steam of their piss and when i go to america some day ill be the only one who knows it
question quigley is wobbling toward us on a big womans bicycle and calls to me hoi frankie mccourt youre going to be killed dotty oneill sent a note to your house and said you didnt come back to school after lunch that you went on the mooch with paddy clohessy your mother is going to kill you your father is out looking for you and hes going to kill you too
oh god i feel cold and empty and i wish i could be in india where its nice and warm and theres no school and my father could never find me to kill me paddy tells the question he didnt go on the mooch and i didnt either fintan slattery starved us to death and we were too late for the bun and the milk then paddy says to me dont mind em frankie tis all a cod theyre always sendin notes to our house and we wipe our arses with them
my mother and father would never wipe their arses with a note from the master and im afraid now to go home the question rides off on the bicycle laughing and i dont know why because he once ran away from home and slept in a ditch with four goats and thats worse than mooching from school half a day anytime
i could turn up the barrack road now and go home and tell my parents im sorry i went on the mooch and i did it because of the hunger but paddy says come on well go down the dock road and throw rocks in the shannon
we throw rocks in the river and we swing on the iron chains along the bank its getting dark and i dont know where im going to sleep i might have to stay there by the shannon or find a door or i might have to go back out the country and find a ditch like brendan quigley with four goats paddy says i can go home with him i can sleep on the floor and ill dry out
paddy lives in one of the tall houses on arthurs quay looking at the river everyone in limerick knows these houses are old and might fall down at any minute mam often says i dont want any of ye going down to arthurs quay and if i find ye there ill break yeer faces the people down there are wild and ye could get robbed and killed
its raining again and small children are playing in the hallway and up the stairs paddy says mind yourself because some of the steps are missing and there is shit on the ones that are still there he says thats because theres only one privy and its in the backyard and children dont get down the stairs in time to put their little arses on the bowl god help us
theres a woman with a shawl sitting on the fourth flight smoking a cigarette she says is that you paddy

well i dont know if theres any bread left go up an see paddys family live in one big room with a high ceiling and a small
fireplace there are two tall windows and you can see out to the shannon his father is in a bed in the corner groaning and spitting into a bucket paddys brothers and sisters are on mattresses on the floor sleeping talking looking at the ceiling theres a baby with no clothes crawling over to paddys fathers bucket and paddy pulls him away his mother comes in gasping from the stairs jesus im dead she says
she finds some bread and makes weak tea for paddy and me i dont know what im supposed to do they dont say anything they dont say what are you doing here or go home or anything till mr clohessy says whos that and paddy tells him tis frankie mccourt

vii
there are thursdays when dad gets his dole money at the labour exchange and a man might say will we go for a pint malachy and dad will say one only one and the man will say oh god yes one and before the night is over all the money is gone and dad comes home singing and getting us out of bed to line up and promise to die for ireland when the
call comes he even gets michael up and hes only three but there he is singing and promising to die for ireland at the first opportunity thats what dad calls it the first opportunity im nine and malachy is eight and we know all the songs we sing all the verses of kevin barry and roddy mccorley the wests asleep 
odonnell abu 
the boys of wexford  we sing and promise to die because you never know when dad might have a penny or two left over from the drinking and if he gives it to us we can run to kathleen oconnells next day for toffee some nights he says michael is the best singer of all and he gives him the penny malachy and i wonder whats the use of being eight and nine and knowing all the songs and ready to die when michael gets the penny so that he can go to the shop next day and stuff his gob with toffee galore no one can ask him to die for ireland at the age of three not even padraig pearse who was shot by the english in dublin in 1916 and expected the whole world to die with him besides mikey molloys father said anyone who wants to die for ireland is a donkeys arse men have been dying for ireland since the beginning of time and look at the state of the country
its bad enough that dad loses jobs in the third week but now he drinks all the dole money once a month mam gets desperate and in the morning she has the bitter face and she wont talk to him he has his tea and leaves the house early for the long walk into the country when he returns in the evening she still wont talk to him and she wont make his tea if the fire is dead for the want of coal or turf and theres no way of boiling water for the tea he says och aye and drinks water out of a jam jar and smacks his lips the way he would with a pint of porter he says good water is all a man needs and mam makes a snorting sound when shes not talking to him the house is heavy and cold and we know were not supposed to talk to him either for fear shell give us the bitter look we know dad has done the bad thing and we know you can make anyone suffer by not talking to him even little michael knows that when dad does the bad thing you dont talk to him from friday to monday and when he tries to lift you to his lap you run to mam
im nine years old and i have a pal mickey spellacy whose relations are dropping one by one of the galloping consumption i envy mickey because every time someone dies in his family he gets a week off from school and his mother stitches a black diamond patch on his sleeve so that he can wander from lane to lane and street to street and people will know he has the grief and pat his head and give him money and sweets for his sorrow
but this summer mickey is worried his sister brenda is wasting away with the consumption and its only august and if she dies before september he wont get his week off from school because you cant get a week off from school when theres no school he comes to billy campbell and me to ask if well go around the corner to st josephs church and pray for brenda to hang on till september
whats in it for us mickey if we go around the corner praying
well if brenda hangs on and i get me week off ye can come to the wake and have ham and cheese and cake and sherry and lemonade and everything and ye can listen to the songs and stories all night
who could say no to that theres nothing like a wake for having a good time we trot around to the church where they have statues of st joseph himself as well as the sacred heart of jesus the virgin mary and
st thÃ©rÃ¨se of lisieux the little flower i pray to the little flower because she died of the consumption herself and shed understand
one of our prayers must have been powerful because brenda stays alive and doesnt die till the second day of school we tell mickey were sorry for his troubles but hes delighted with his week off and he gets the black diamond patch which will bring the money and sweets
my mouth is watering at the thought of the feast at brendas wake billy knocks on the door and theres mickeys aunt well
we came to say a prayer for brenda and mickey said we could come to the wake
she yells mickey what come here did you tell this gang they could come to your sisters wake
no
but mickey you promised
she slams the door in our faces we dont know what to do till
billy campbell says well go back to st josephs and pray that from now on everyone in mickey spellacys family will die in the middle of the summer and hell never get a day off from school for the rest of his life
one of our prayers is surely powerful because next summer mickey himself is carried off by the galloping consumption and he doesnt get a day off from school and that will surely teach him a lesson
proddy woddy ring the bell
not for heaven but for hell
on sunday mornings in limerick i watch them go to church the protestants and i feel sorry for them especially the girls who are so lovely they have such beautiful white teeth i feel sorry for the beautiful protestant girls theyre doomed thats what the priests tell us outside the catholic church there is no salvation outside the catholic church there is nothing but doom and i want to save them protestant girl come with me to the true church youll be saved and you wont have the doom after mass on sunday i go with my friend billy campbell to watch them play croquet on the lovely lawn beside their church on barrington street croquet is a protestant game they hit the ball with the mallet pock and pock again and laugh i wonder how they can laugh or dont they even know theyre doomed i feel sorry for them and i say billy whats the use of playing croquet when youre doomed
he says frankie whats the use of not playing croquet when youre doomed

the bus stops at the oconnell monument and uncle pat goes to the monument fish and chip cafÃ© where the smells are so delicious my stomach beats with the hunger he gets a shillings worth of fish and chips and my mouth is watering but when we get to grandmas door he gives me a threepenny bit tells me meet him again next friday and go home now to my mother
the dog macushla is lying outside mr timoneys door and when i open the little garden gate to go up the path she rushes at me and knocks me back out on the pavement and shed eat my face if mr timoney didnt come out and flail at her with his stick and yell come in out of it ye hoor ye overgrown man eatin bitch didnt you have your breakfast you hoor are you all right francis come in that dog is a right hindu so she is and thats where i found her mother wandering around bangalore if ever youre getting a dog francis make sure its a buddhist good natured dogs the buddhists never never get a mahommedan theyll eat you sleeping never a catholic dog theyll eat you every day including fridays sit down and read to me

he stops me after two or three pages youre a good reader and what do you think of that francis that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food whether stewed roasted baked or boiled eh macushla would love a dinner of a nice plump irish infant wouldnt you you oul hoor
he gives me sixpence and tells me return next saturday
mam is delighted i earned sixpence for reading to mr timoney and what was it he wanted read the limerick leader i tell her i had to read a modest proposal from the back of gullivers travels and she says thats all right tis only a childrens book youd expect him to want something strange for hes a little off in the head after years in the sun in the english army in india and they say he was married to one of them indian women and she was accidentally shot by a soldier during some class of a disturbance thats the kind of thing that would drive you to childrens books she knows this mrs minihan who lives next door to mr timoney and used to clean house but couldnt stand it anymore the way he laughed at the catholic church and said one mans sin was another mans romp mrs minihan didnt mind the odd drop of sherry of a saturday morning but then he tried to turn her into a buddhist which he said he was himself and the irish would be much better off in general if they sat under a tree and watched the ten commandments and the seven deadly sins float down the shannon and far out to sea
the next friday declan collopy from the confraternity sees me on the street delivering the papers with my uncle pat sheehan hoi frankie mccourt what are you doin with ab sheehan

uncle pat says go way go way or ill walk on you
ah shut up mr stupid that was dropped on your head he pushes uncle pat on the shoulder and knocks him back against the wall i drop the papers and run at him but he steps aside and punches me on the back of the neck and my forehead is rammed into the wall and it puts me in such a rage i cant see him anymore i go at him with arms and legs and if i could tear his face off with my teeth i would but he has long arms like a gorilla and he just keeps pushing me away so that i cant touch him he says you mad feckin eejit ill destroy you in the confraternity and he runs away
uncle pat says you shouldnt be fightin like that an you dropped all me papers an some o them is wet an how am i supposed to sell wet papers and i wanted to jump on him too and hit him for talking about papers after i stood up to declan collopy
at the end of the night he gives me three chips from his bag and sixpence instead of threepence he complains its too much money and its all my mothers fault for going on to grandma about the low pay
mam is delighted im getting sixpence on fridays from uncle pat and sixpence on saturdays from mr timoney a shilling a week makes a big difference and she gives me tuppence to see the dead end kids at the lyric after im finished the reading
next morning mr timoney says wait till we get to gulliver francis youll know jonathan swift is the greatest irish writer that ever lived no the greatest man to put pen to parchment a giant of a man francis he laughs all through a modest proposal and youd wonder what hes laughing at when its all about cooking irish babies he says youll laugh when you grow up francis
youre not supposed to talk back to grownups but mr timoney is different and he doesnt mind when i say mr timoney big people are
always telling us that oh youll laugh when you grow up youll understand when you grow up everything will come when you grow up
he lets out such a roar of a laugh i think hes going to collapse oh mother o god francis youre a treasure whats up with you do you have a bee up your arse tell me whats up
nothing mr timoney
i think you have the long puss francis and i wish i could go over to the mirror on the wall snow white and tell me if you the long puss never mind just tell me whats up
declan collopy was at me last night and i got into a fight
he makes me tell him about the confraternity and declan and
uncle pat sheehan who was dropped on his head and then he tells

ill do francis ill talk to pa keating and well go to the crawthumpers at the confraternity im a buddhist myself and i dont hold with fighting but i havent lost it theyre not going to interfere with my little reader oh by jesus no
mr timoney is an old man but he talks like a friend and i can say what i feel dad would never talk to me like mr timoney hed say och aye and go for a long walk
uncle pat sheehan tells grandma he doesnt want me to help with the papers anymore he can get another boy much cheaper and he thinks i should be giving him some of my saturday morning sixpence anyway since id never have the reading job without him
a woman next door to mr timoney tells me im wasting my time knocking on the door macushla bit the postman the milkman and a passing nun on the same day and mr timoney couldnt stop laughing though he cried when the dog was taken away to be put down you can bite postmen and milkmen all you like but the case of the passing nun goes all the way to the bishop and he takes steps especially if the owner of the dog is a known buddhist and a danger to good catholics around him mr timoney was told this and cried and laughed so hard the doctor came and said he was gone beyond recall so they carted him off to the city home where they keep old people who are helpless or demented
thats the end of my saturday sixpence but ill read to mr timoney money or no money i wait down the street till the woman next door goes in i climb in mr timoneys window for gulliverstravels and walk miles to the city home so that he wont miss his reading the man at the gate says what you want to come in an read to an oul man is it coddin me you are get outa here before i call the guards
could i leave the book for someone else to read to mr timoney leave it leave it for jaysus sake an dont be botherin me ill send it up to him
and he laughs
mam says whats up with you why are you moping and i tell her how uncle pat doesnt want me anymore and how they put mr timoney in the city home for laughing just because macushla bit the postman the milkman and a passing nun she laughs too and im sure the world is gone mad then she says ah im sorry and its a pity you lost two jobs you might as well start going to the confraternity again to keep the posse away and worse the director father gorey
declan tells me sit in front of him and if theres any blaguarding hell break my feckin neck for hell be watching me as long as hes
see it have
my
me he

mam says she has trouble climbing the stairs and shes moving her bed to the kitchen she laughs ill come back up to sorrento when the walls are damp and the rain runs under the door school is over and she can stay in bed in the kitchen as long as she likes because she doesnt have to get up for us dad lights the fire makes the tea cuts the bread makes sure we wash our faces and tells us go out and play he lets us stay in bed if we like but you never want to stay in bed when theres no school were ready to run out and play in the lane the minute we wake
then one day in july he says we cant go downstairs we have to stay up here and play
why dad
never mind play here with malachy and michael and you can go down later when i tell you
he stands at the door in case we might get a notion to wander down the stairs we push our blanket up in the air with our feet and pretend were in a tent robin hood and his merry men we hunt fleas and squash them between our thumbnails
then theres a babys cry and malachy says dad did mam get a new
baby
och aye son
im older so i tell malachy the bed is in the kitchen so that the angel can fly down and leave the baby on the seventh step but malachy doesnt understand because hes only eight going on nine and ill be ten next month
mam is in the bed with the new baby he has a big fat face and hes red all over theres a woman in the kitchen in a nurses uniform and we know shes there to wash new babies who are always dirty from the long journey with the angel we want to tickle the baby but she says no no ye can look at him but dont lay a finger
dont lay a finger thats the way nurses talk
we sit at the table with our tea and bread looking at our new brother but he wont even open his eyes to look back at us so we go out and play
in a few days mam is out of the bed holding the baby on her lap by the fire his eyes are open and when we tickle him he makes a gurgling sound his belly shakes and that makes us laugh dad tickles him and sings a scottish song oh oh stop your ticklin jock stop your ticklin jock
stop your ticklin
ickle ickle icklin
stop your ticklin jock
dad has a job so bridey hannon is able to visit mam and the baby any time she likes and for once mam doesnt tell us go out and play so they can talk about secret things they sit by the fire smoking and talking about names mam says she likes the names kevin and sean but bridey says ah no theres too many of them in limerick jesus angela if you stuck your head out the door and called kevin or sean come in for your tea youd have half o limerick running to your door
bridey says if she had a son which please god she will some day shell call him ronald because shes mad about ronald colman that you see in the coliseum cinema or errol now thats another lovely name errol flynn
mam says will you go way outa that bridey id never be able to stick my head out the door and say errol errol come in for your tea sure the poor child would be a laughingstock
ronald says bridey ronald hes gorgeous
no says mam it has to be irish isnt that what we fought for all these years whats the use of fighting the english for centuries if were going to call our children ronald
jesus angela youre starting to talk like himself with his irish this and his english that
still an all bridey hes right
suddenly bridey is gasping jesus angela theres something wrong with that child mam is out of the chair hugging the child moaning oh jesus bridey hes choking
bridey says ill run for my mother and shes back in a minute with mrs hannon castor oil says mrs hannon do you have it any oil cod liver oil thatll do
she pours the oil into the babys mouth turns him over presses on his back turns him back over sticks a spoon down his throat and brings up a white ball thats it now she says the milk it collects and gets hard in their little throats so you have to ease it with any class of an oil
mam is crying jesus i nearly lost him oh id die so i would
shes clutching the baby and crying and trying to thank mrs hannon
yerra dont mention it missus take the child and get back into that bed for the two o ye had a great shock
while bridey and mrs hannon are helping mam to the bed i notice spots of blood on her chair is my mother bleeding to death is it all right to say look theres blood on mams chair no you cant say anything because they always have secrets i know if you say anything the grownup people will tell you never mind youre always gawking none of your business go out and play
i have to keep it inside or i can talk to the angel mrs hannon and bridey leave and i sit on the seventh step i try to tell the angel mam is bleeding to death i want him to tell me fear not but the step is cold and theres no light no voice im sure hes gone forever and i wonder if that happens when you go from nine to ten
mam doesnt bleed to death shes out of the bed next day getting the baby ready for baptism telling bridey she could never forgive herself if the baby died and went to limbo a place for unbaptized babies where it may be nice and warm but still dark forever and no hope of escape even on the judgment day
grandma is there to help and she says thats right no hope in heaven for the infant thats not baptized
bridey says it would be a hard god that would do the likes of that
he has to be hard says grandma otherwise youd have all kinds of babies clamorin to get into heaven protestants an everything an why should they get in after what they did to us for eight hundred years
the babies didnt do it says bridey theyre too small
they would if they got the chance says grandma theyre trained for it
they dress the baby in the limerick lace dress we were all baptized in mam says we can all go to st josephs and were excited because there will be lemonade and buns after
malachy says mam whats the babys name
alphonsus joseph
the words fly out of my mouth thats a stupid name its not even
irish
grandma glares at me with her old red eyes she says that fella
needs a good clitther on the gob mam slaps me across the face and sends me flying across the kitchen my heart is pounding and i want to cry but i cant because my father isnt there and im the man of the family mam says you go upstairs with your big mouth and dont move from that room
i stop at the seventh step but its still cold no light no voice
the house is quiet with everyone gone to the chapel i sit and wait upstairs knocking the fleas off my arms and legs wishing i had dad here thinking of my little brother and his foreign name alphonsus an affliction of a name
in awhile there are voices downstairs and there is talk of tea sherry lemonade buns and isnt that child the loveliest little fella in the world little alphie foreign name but still an all still an all not a sound outa him the whole time hes that goodnatured god bless him sure hell live forever with the sweetness thats in him the little dote spittin image of his mother his father his grandma his little brothers dead an gone

think hed be happy for his little brother except that a boy thats going from nine to ten is always a right pain in the arse an i know for didnt i have two of em
the lemonade and bun are delicious and alphie the new baby is chirping away enjoying his baptism day too innocent to know his name is an affliction
grandpa in the north sends a telegram money order for five pounds for the baby alphie mam wants to cash it but she cant go far from the bed dad says hell cash it at the post office she tells malachy and me to go with him he cashes it and tells us all right boys go home and tell your mother ill be home in a few minutes

now now son go home to your mother dad give us the money that money is for the baby
now francis dont be a bad boy do what your father tells you
he walks away from us and into souths pub mam is sitting by the fireplace with alphie in her arms she shakes her head he went to the pub didnt he he did i want ye to go back down to that pub and read
him out of it i want ye to stand in the middle of the pub and tell every man your father is drinking the money for the baby ye are to tell the world there isnt a scrap of food in this house not a lump of coal to start the fire not a drop of milk for the babys bottle
we walk through the streets and malachy practices his speech at the top of his voice dad dad that five pounds is for the new baby thats not for the drink the child is above in the bed bawling and roaring for his milk and youre drinking the pint
hes gone from souths pub malachy still wants to stand and make his speech but i tell him we have to hurry and look in other pubs before dad drinks the whole five pounds we cant find him in other pubs either he knows mam would come for him or send us and there are so many pubs at this end of limerick and beyond we could be looking for a month we have to tell mam theres no sign of him and she tells us were pure useless oh jesus i wish i had my strength and id search every pub in limerick id tear the mouth out of his head so i would go on go back down and try all the pubs around the railway station and try naughtons fish and chip shop
i have to go by myself because malachy has the runs and cant stray far from the bucket i search all the pubs on parnell street and around i look into the snugs where the women drink and in all the mens lavatories im hungry but im afraid to go home till i find my father hes not in naughtons fish and chip shop but theres a drunken man asleep at a table in the corner and his fish and chips are on the floor in their limerick leader wrapping and if i dont get them the cat will so i shove them under my jersey and im out the door and up the street to sit on the steps at the railway station eat my fish and chips watch the drunken soldiers pass by with the girls that giggle thank the drunken man in my mind for drowning the fish and chips in vinegar and smothering them in salt and then remember that if i die tonight im in a state of sin for stealing and i could go straight to hell stuffed with fish and chips but its saturday and if the priests are still in the confession boxes i can clear my soul after my feed
the dominican church is just up glentworth street
bless me father for i have sinned its a fortnight since my last confession i tell him the usual sins and then i stole fish and chips from a drunken man
why my child
i was hungry father
and why were you hungry
there was nothing in my belly father
he says nothing and even though its dark i know hes shaking his
head my dear child why cant you go home and ask your mother for something because she sent me out looking for my father in the pubs father and i couldnt find him and she hasnt a scrap in the house because hes drinking the five pounds grandpa sent from the north for the new baby and shes raging by the fire because i cant find my father
i wonder if this priest is asleep because hes very quiet till he says my child i sit here i hear the sins of the poor i assign the penance i bestow absolution i should be on my knees washing their feet do you understand me my child
i tell him i do but i dont
go home child pray for me
no penance father
no my child
i stole the fish and chips im doomed
youre forgiven go pray for me he blesses me in latin talks to
himself in english and i wonder what i did to him i wish i could find my father so i could say to mam here he is and he has three pounds left in his pocket im not hungry now so i can go up one side of oconnell street and down the other and search pubs on the side streets and there he is in gleesons how could i miss him with his singing tis alone my concern if the grandest surprise would be shining at me out of somebodys eyes
tis my private affair what my feelings would be while the green glens of antrim were welcoming me
my heart is banging away in my chest and i dont know what to do because i know im raging inside like my mother by the fire and all i can think of doing is running in and giving him a good kick in the leg and running out again but i dont because we have the mornings by the fire when he tells me about cuchulain and de valera and roosevelt and if hes there drunk and buying pints with the babys money he has that look in his eyes eugene had when he searched for oliver and i might as well go home and tell my mother a lie that i never saw him couldnt find him
shes in the bed with the baby malachy and michael are up in italy asleep i know i dont have to tell mam anything that soon when the pubs close hell be home singing and offering us a penny to die for ireland and it will be different now because its bad enough to drink the dole or the wages but a man that drinks the money for a new baby is gone beyond the beyonds as my mother would say
viii
im ten years old and ready to go to st josephs church for my confirmation in school the master mr odea prepares us we have to know all about sanctifying grace a pearl of great price bought for us by jesus in his dying mr odeas eyes roll in his head when he tells us that with confirmation we will become part of divinity we will have the gifts of the holy ghost wisdom understanding counsel fortitude knowledge piety the fear of the lord priests and masters tell us confirmation means youre a true soldier of the church and that entitles you to die and be a martyr in case were invaded by protestants or mahommedans or any other class of a heathen more dying i want to tell them i wont be able to die for the faith because im already booked to die for ireland
mikey molloy says is it jokin you are that thing about dying for the faith is all a cod tis only a saying they made up to frighten you ireland too no one dies for anything anymore all the dying is done i wouldnt die for ireland or the faith i might die for my mother but thats all
mikey knows everything hes going on fourteen he gets the fits he has visions
the grownups tell us its a glorious thing to die for the faith only were not ready for that yet because confirmation day is like first communion day you make the rounds of lanes and back streets and you get cakes and sweets and money the collection
thats where poor peter dooley comes in we call him quasimodo because he has a hump on his back like the one on the hunchback of notre dame whose real name we know is charles laughton
quasimodo has nine sisters and it is said his mother never wanted him but that was what the angel brought her and its a sin to question whats sent quasimodo is old hes fifteen his red hair sticks up in all directions he has green eyes and one rolls around in his head so much hes constantly tapping his temple to keep it where its supposed to be his right leg is short and twisted and when he walks he does a little twirly dance and you never know when hell fall thats when youre surprised he curses his leg he curses the world but he curses in a lovely english accent which he got from the radio the bbc before he leaves his house he always sticks his head out the door and tells the lane heres me head me arse is coming when he was twelve quasimodo decided that with the way he looked and the way the world looked at him the best thing would be to prepare for a job where he could be heard and not seen and what better than sitting behind a microphone at the bbc in london reading the news
but you cant get to london without money and thats why he hobbles up to us that friday the day before confirmation he has an idea for billy and me he knows the next day well be getting confirmation money and if we promise to pay him a shilling each hell let us climb up the rainspout behind his house this very night to look in the window and see his sisters naked bodies when they take their weekly wash i sign right away billy says i have my own sister why should i pay to see your naked sisters
quasimodo says that looking at your own sisters naked body is the worst sin of all and hes not sure if theres a priest in the world can forgive you that you might have to go to the bishop who everyone knows is a holy terror
billy signs
friday night we climb the wall of quasimodos backyard its a lovely night with the june moon floating high over limerick and you can feel a warm breeze off the shannon river quasimodo is about to let billy up the spout and who comes clambering over the wall but mikey molloy the fit himself hissing at quasimodo heres a shilling quasimodo let me up the spout mikey is fourteen now bigger than any of us and strong from his job delivering coal hes black from the coal like uncle pa keating and all you can see are the whites of his eyes and the white froth on his lower lip which means he could have the fit anytime
quasimodo says wait mikey theyre first wait my arse says mikey and hes away up the spout billy complains but quasimodo shakes his head i cant help it he comes every week with the shilling i have to let him up the spout or hell beat me up and tell my mother and the next thing she locks me in the coal hole all day with the rats the fit is up hanging on to the spout with one hand the other hand is in his pocket moving moving and when the spout itself starts to move and creak quasimodo hisses molloy theres to be no whankin up the spout he hops around the yard cackling his bbc accent is gone and hes pure limerick jaysus molloy come down off that spout or ill tell me mother mikeys hand goes faster in his pocket so fast the spout gives a lurch and collapses and mikey is rolling on the ground yelping im dead im destroyed oh god you can see the froth on his lips and the blood that comes from biting his tongue
quasimodos mother comes screaming through the door what in the name of jesus and the kitchen light fills the yard the sisters are squawking from the window above billy tries to escape and she drags him off the wall she tells him run to oconnor the chemist around the corner to ring up an ambulance or a doctor or something for mikey she screams at us to get into the kitchen she kicks quasimodo into the hall hes on his hands and knees and she drags him to the coal hole under the stairs and locks him in stay there till you come to your senses
hes crying and calling to her in a pure limerick accent ah mamma mamma let me out the rats is here i only want to go to the bbc mamma aw jasus mamma jasus ill never let anyone up the spout again ill send money from london mamma mamma
mikey is still on his back jerking and twisting around the yard the ambulance takes him off to the hospital with a broken shoulder and his tongue in ribbons
our mothers are there in no time mrs dooley says im disgraced so i am disgraced my daughters cant wash theirselves of a friday night without the whole world gawking in the window and them boys there are in a state of sin and should be taken to the priest for confession before their confirmation tomorrow
but mam says i dont know about the rest of the world but i saved a whole year for franks confirmation suit and im not going to the priest to have him tell me my son is not fit for confirmation so that ill have to wait another year when he grows out of this suit and all because he climbed a spout for an innocent gawk at the scrawny arse of mona dooley
she drags me home by the ear and makes me kneel before the pope swear she says swear to that pope that you didnt look at mona dooley in her pelt
i swear
if youre lying you wont be in a state of grace for confirmation tomorrow and thats the worst kind of sacrilege
i swear
only the bishop himself could forgive a sacrilege like that
i swear
all right go to bed and from this day out stay far away from that
misfortunate quasimodo dooley
we are all confirmed the next day the bishop asks me a catechism
question what is the fourth commandment and i tell him honor thy father and thy mother he pats my cheek and that makes me a soldier of the true church i kneel in the pew and think of quasimodo locked in the coal hole under the stairs and i wonder should i give him the shilling anyway for his career at the bbc
but i forget all about quasimodo because my nose starts bleeding and i feel dizzy confirmation boys and girls are outside st josephs with their parents and there is hugging and kissing in the bright sun and i dont care my father is working and i dont care my mother kisses me and i dont care the boys talk about the collection and i dont care my nose wont stop and mam is worried ill ruin my suit she runs into the church to see if stephen carey the sacristan would spare her a rag and he gives her some kind of canvas cloth that makes my nose sore she says do you want to make your collection and i tell her i dont care malachy says do do frankie and hes sad because i promised id take him to the lyric cinema to see the film and stuff ourselves with sweets i want
to lie down i could lie down there on the steps of st josephs and sleep forever mam says grandma is making a nice breakfast and the mention of food makes me so sick i run to the edge of the pavement to throw up and the whole world is looking at me and i dont care mam says shed better take me home and put me to bed and my pals look surprised that anyone can go to bed when theres a collection to be made
she helps me take off my confirmation suit and puts me to bed she wets a rag and places it under my neck and after awhile the bleeding stops she brings tea but the look of it makes me sick and i have to throw up in the bucket mrs hannon comes in from next door and i can hear her say thats a very sick child and he should have a doctor mam says its saturday the dispensary is closed and where would you get a doctor
dad comes home from his job at ranks flour mills and tells mam im going through a stage growing pains grandma comes up and says the same thing she says when boys go from the one number year which is nine to the two number year which is ten theyre changing and prone to the nosebleed she says i might have too much blood in me anyway and a good cleaning out wouldnt do me one bit of harm
the day passes and im in and out of sleep malachy and michael come into the bed at night and i can hear malachy say frankie is very hot michael says hes bleeding on my leg mam puts the wet rag on my nose and a key on my neck but it wont stop the bleeding on sunday morning theres blood on my chest and all around me mam tells dad im bleeding through my bottom and he says i might have a case of the runs which is common with the growing pains
dr troy is our doctor but hes away on holiday and the man that comes to see me on monday has a smell of whiskey on him he examines me and tells my mother i have a bad cold and keep me in bed days pass and i sleep and bleed mam makes tea and beef tea and i dont want it she even brings ice cream and the look of it makes me sick mrs hannon comes in again and says that doctor doesnt know what hes talking about see if dr troy is back
mam comes with dr troy he feels my forehead rolls up my eyelids turns me over to see my back picks me up and runs to his motor car mam runs after him and he tells her i have typhoid fever mam cries oh god oh god am i to lose the whole family will it ever end she gets into the car holds me in her lap and moans all the way to the fever hospital at the city home
the bed has cool white sheets the nurses have clean white uniforms and the nun sister rita is all in white dr humphrey and dr campbell have white coats and things hanging from their necks which they stick against my chest and all over i sleep and sleep but im awake when they bring in jars of bright red stuff that hang from tall poles above my bed and they stick tubes into my ankles and the back of my right hand sister rita says youre getting blood francis soldiers blood from the sarsfield barracks
mam is sitting by the bed and the nurse is saying you know missus this is very unusual no one is ever allowed into the fever hospital for fear theyd catch something but they made an exception for you with his crisis coming if he gets over this hell surely recover
i fall asleep mam is gone when i wake but theres movement in the room and its the priest father gorey from the confraternity saying mass at a table in the corner i drift off again and now theyre waking
me and pulling down the bedclothes father gorey is touching me with oil and praying in latin i know its extreme unction and that means im going to die and i dont care they wake me again to receive communion i dont want it im afraid i might get sick i keep the wafer on my tongue and fall asleep and when i wake up again its gone
its dark and dr campbell is sitting by my bed hes holding my wrist and looking at his watch he has red hair and glasses and he always smiles when he talks to me he sits now and hums and looks out the window his eyes close and he snores a little he tilts over on the chair and farts and smiles to himself and i know now im going to get better because a doctor would never fart in the presence of a dying boy
sister ritas white habit is bright in the sun that comes in the window shes holding my wrist looking at her watch smiling oh she says were awake are we well francis i think weve come through the worst our prayers are answered and all the prayers of those hundreds of little boys at the confraternity can you imagine that hundreds of boys saying the rosary for you and offering up their communion
my ankles and the back of my hand are throbbing from the tubes bringing in the blood and i dont care about boys praying for me i can hear the swish of sister ritas habit and the click of her rosary beads when she leaves the room i fall asleep and when i wake its dark and dad is sitting by the bed with his hand on mine
son are you awake
i try to talk but im dry nothing will come out and i point to my mouth he holds a glass of water to my lips and its sweet and cool he presses my hand and says im a great old soldier and why wouldnt i dont i have the soldiers blood in me
the tubes are not in me anymore and the glass jars are gone
sister rita comes in and tells dad he has to go i dont want him to go because he looks sad hes like paddy clohessy the day i gave him the raisin when he looks sad its the worst thing in the world and i start crying now whats this says sister rita crying with all that soldier blood in you theres a big surprise for you tomorrow francis youll never guess well ill tell you were bringing you a nice biscuit with your tea in the morning isnt that a treat and your father will be back in a day or two wont you mr mccourt
dad nods and puts his hand on mine again he looks at me steps away stops comes back kisses me on the forehead for the first time in my life and im so happy i feel like floating out of the bed
the other two beds in my room are empty the nurse says im the only typhoid patient and im a miracle for getting over the crisis
the room next to me is empty till one morning a girls voice says yoo hoo whos there
im not sure if shes talking to me or someone in the room beyond yoo hoo boy with the typhoid are you awake
i am
are you better
i am
well why are you here
i dont know im still in the bed they stick needles in me and
give me medicine
what do you look like
i wonder what kind of a question is that i dont know what to tell her
yoo hoo are you there typhoid boy
i am
whats your name
frank
thats a good name my name is patricia madigan how old are you ten oh she sounds disappointed
but ill be eleven in august next month
well thats better than ten ill be fourteen in september do you
want to know why im in the fever hospital i do
i have diphtheria and something else
whats something else
they dont know they think i have a disease from foreign parts
because my father used to be in africa i nearly died are you going to tell me what you look like
i have black hair
you and millions
i have brown eyes with bits of green thats called hazel
you and thousands
i have stitches on the back of my right hand and my two feet where
they put in the soldiers blood
oh god did they
they did
you wont be able to stop marching and saluting
theres a swish of habit and click of beads and then sister ritas
voice now now whats this theres to be no talking between two rooms especially when its a boy and a girl do you hear me patricia
i do sister
do you hear me francis
i do sister
you could be giving thanks for your two remarkable recoveries you
could be saying the rosary you could be reading the little messenger of the sacred heart thats beside your beds dont let me come back and find you talking
she comes into my room and wags her finger at me especially you francis after thousands of boys prayed for you at the confraternity give thanks francis give thanks
she leaves and theres silence for awhile then patricia whispers give thanks francis give thanks and say your rosary francis and i laugh so hard a nurse runs in to see if im all right shes a very stern nurse from the county kerry and she frightens me whats this francis laughing what is there to laugh about are you and that madigan girl talking ill report you to sister rita theres to be no laughing for you could be doing serious damage to your internal apparatus
she plods out and patricia whispers again in a heavy kerry accent no laughing francis you could be doin serious damage to your internal apparatus say your rosary francis and pray for your internal apparatus
mam visits me on thursdays id like to see my father too but im out of danger crisis time is over and im allowed only one visitor besides she says hes back at work at ranks flour mills and please god this job will last a while with the war on and the english desperate for flour she brings me a chocolate bar and that proves dad is working she could never afford it on the dole he sends me notes he tells me my
brothers are all praying for me that i should be a good boy obey the doctors the nuns the nurses and dont forget to say my prayers hes sure st jude pulled me through the crisis because hes the patron saint of desperate cases and i was indeed a desperate case
patricia says she has two books by her bed one is a poetry book and thats the one she loves the other is a short history of england and do i want it she gives it to seamus the man who mops the floors every day and he brings it to me he says im not supposed to be bringing anything from a dipteria room to a typhoid room with all the germs flying around and hiding between the pages and if you ever catch dipteria on top of the typhoid theyll know and ill lose my good job and be out on the street singing patriotic songs with a tin cup in my hand which i could easily do because there isnt a song ever written about irelands sufferings i dont know and a few songs about the joy of whiskey too
oh yes he knows roddy mccorley hell sing it for me right enough but hes barely into the first verse when the kerry nurse rushes in whats this seamus singing of all the people in this hospital you should know the rules against singing i have a good mind to report you to sister rita
ah god dont do that nurse
very well seamus ill let it go this one time you know the singing could lead to a relapse in these patients
when she leaves he whispers hell teach me a few songs because singing is good for passing the time when youre by yourself in a typhoid room he says patricia is a lovely girl the way she often gives him sweets from the parcel her mother sends every fortnight he stops mopping the floor and calls to patricia in the next room i was telling frankie youre a lovely girl patricia and she says youre a lovely man seamus he smiles because hes an old man of forty and he never had children but the ones he can talk to here in the fever hospital he says heres the book frankie isnt it a great pity you have to be reading all about england after all they did to us that there isnt a history of ireland to be had in this hospital
the book tells me all about king alfred and william the conqueror and all the kings and queens down to edward who had to wait forever for his mother victoria to die before he could be king the book has the first bit of shakespeare i ever read
i do believe induced by potent circumstances that thou art mine enemy
the history writer says this is what catherine who is a wife of henry the eighth says to cardinal wolsey who is trying to have her head cut off i dont know what it means and i dont care because its shakespeare and its like having jewels in my mouth when i say the words if i had a whole book of shakespeare they could keep me in the hospital for a year
patricia says she doesnt know what induced means or potent circumstances and she doesnt care about shakespeare she has her poetry book and she reads to me from beyond the wall a poem about an owl and a pussycat that went to sea in a green boat with honey and money and it makes no sense and when i say that patricia gets huffy and says thats the last poem shell ever read to me she says im always reciting the lines from shakespeare and they make no sense either seamus stops mopping again and tells us we shouldnt be fighting over poetry because well have enough to fight about when we grow up and get married
patricia says shes sorry and im sorry too so she reads me part of another poem which i have to remember so i can say it back to her early in the morning or late at night when there are no nuns or nurses about the wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees the moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas the road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor and the highwayman came riding riding riding the highwayman came riding up to the old inn door
hed a french cocked hat on his forehead a bunch of lace at his chin
a coat of the claret velvet
and breeches of brown doe skin
they fitted with never a wrinkle
his boots were up to the thigh
and he rode with a jewelled twinkle
his pistol butts atwinkle
his rapier hilt atwinkle
under the jewelled sky
every day i cant wait for the doctors and nurses to leave me alone so i can learn a new verse from patricia and find out whats happening to the highwayman and the landlords red lipped daughter i love the poem because its exciting and almost as good as my two lines of shakespeare the redcoats are after the highwayman because they know he told her ill come to thee by moonlight though hell should bar the way
id love to do that myself come by moonlight for patricia in the next room not giving a fiddlers fart though hell should bar the way shes ready to read the last few verses when in comes the nurse from kerry shouting at her shouting at me i told ye there was to be no talking between rooms dipthteria is never allowed to talk to typhoid and visa versa i warned ye and she calls out seamus take this one take the by sister rita said one more word out of him and upstairs with him we gave ye a warning to stop the blathering but ye wouldnt take the by seamus take him
ah now nurse sure isnt he harmless tis only a bit o poetry take that by seamus take him at once
he bends over me and whispers ah god im sorry frankie heres
your english history book he slips the book under my shirt and lifts me from the bed he whispers that im a feather i try to see patricia when we pass through her room but all i can make out is a blur of dark head on a pillow
sister rita stops us in the hall to tell me im a great disappointment to her that she expected me to be a good boy after what god had done for me after all the prayers said by hundreds of boys at the confraternity after all the care from the nuns and nurses of the fever hospital after the way they let my mother and father in to see me a thing rarely allowed and this is how i repaid them lying in the bed reciting silly poetry back and forth with patricia madigan knowing very well there was a ban on all talk between typhoid and diphtheria she says ill have plenty of time to reflect on my sins in the big ward upstairs and i should beg gods forgiveness for my disobedience reciting a pagan english poem about a thief on a horse and a maiden with red lips who commits a terrible sin when i could have been praying or reading the life
of a saint she made it her business to read that poem so she did and id be well advised to tell the priest in confession
the kerry nurse follows us upstairs gasping and holding on to the banister she tells me i better not get the notion shell be running up to this part of the world every time i have a little pain or a twinge
there are twenty beds in the ward all white all empty the nurse tells seamus put me at the far end of the ward against the wall to make sure i dont talk to anyone who might be passing the door which is very unlikely since there isnt another soul on this whole floor she tells seamus this was the fever ward during the great famine long ago and only god knows how many died here brought in too late for anything but a wash before they were buried and there are stories of cries and moans in the far reaches of the night she says twould break your heart to think of what the english did to us that if they didnt put the blight on the potato they didnt do much to take it off no pity no feeling at all for the people that died in this very ward children suffering and dying here while the english feasted on roast beef and guzzled the best of wine in their big houses little children with their mouths all green from trying to eat the grass in the fields beyond god bless us and save us and guard us from future famines
seamus says twas a terrible thing indeed and he wouldnt want to be walking these halls in the dark with all the little green mouths gaping at him the nurse takes my temperature tis up a bit have a good sleep for yourself now that youre away from the chatter with patricia madigan below who will never know a gray hair
she shakes her head at seamus and he gives her a sad shake back
nurses and nuns never think you know what theyre talking about if youre ten going on eleven youre supposed to be simple like my uncle pat sheehan who was dropped on his head you cant ask questions you cant show you understand what the nurse said about patricia madigan that shes going to die and you cant show you want to cry over this girl who taught you a lovely poem which the nun says is bad
the nurse tells seamus she has to go and hes to sweep the lint from under my bed and mop up a bit around the ward seamus tells me shes a right oul bitch for running to sister rita and complaining about the poem going between the two rooms that you cant catch a disease from a poem unless its love ha ha and thats not bloody likely when youre what ten going on eleven he never heard the likes of it a little fella shifted upstairs for saying a poem and he has a good mind to go to the limerick leader and tell them print the whole thing except he has this job and hed lose it if ever sister rita found out anyway frankie youll be outa here one of these fine days and you can read all the poetry you want though i dont know about patricia below i dont know about patricia god help us
he knows about patricia in two days because she got out of the bed to go to the lavatory when she was supposed to use a bedpan and collapsed and died in the lavatory seamus is mopping the floor and there are tears on his cheeks and hes saying tis a dirty rotten thing to die in a lavatory when youre lovely in yourself she told me she was sorry she had you reciting that poem and getting you shifted from the room frankie she said twas all her fault
it wasnt seamus
i know and didnt i tell her that
patricia is gone and ill never know what happened to the highwayman and bess the landlords daughter i ask seamus but he doesnt know any poetry at all especially english poetry he knew an irish poem once but it was about fairies and had no sign of a highwayman in it still hell ask the men in his local pub where theres always someone reciting something and hell bring it back to me wont i be busy meanwhile reading my short history of england and finding out all
their perfidy thats what seamus says perfidy and i dont know
means and he doesnt know what it means but if its something the
do it must be terrible
he comes three times a week to mop the floor and the nurse is there every morning to take my temperature and pulse the doctor listens to my chest with the thing hanging from his neck they all say and hows our little soldier today a girl with a blue dress brings meals three times a day and never talks to me seamus says shes not right in the head so dont say a word to her
the july days are long and i fear the dark there are only two ceiling lights in the ward and theyre switched off when the tea tray is taken away and the nurse gives me pills the nurse tells me go to sleep but i cant because i see people in the nineteen beds in the ward all dying and green around their mouths where they tried to eat grass and moaning for soup protestant soup any soup and i cover my face with the pillow hoping they wont come and stand around the bed clawing at me and howling for bits of the chocolate bar my mother brought last week
no she didnt bring it she had to send it in because i cant have any more visitors sister rita tells me a visit to the fever hospital is a privilege and after my bad behavior with patricia madigan and that poem i cant have the privilege anymore she says ill be going home in a few weeks and my job is to concentrate on getting better and learn to walk again after being in bed for six weeks and i can get out of bed tomorrow after breakfast i dont know why she says i have to learn how to walk when ive been walking since i was a baby but when the nurse stands me by the side of the bed i fall to the floor and the nurse laughs see youre a baby again
i practice walking from bed to bed back and forth back and forth i dont want to be a baby i dont want to be in this empty ward with no patricia and no highwayman and no red lipped landlords daughter i dont want the ghosts of children with green mouths pointing bony fingers at me and clamoring for bits of my chocolate bar
seamus says a man in his pub knew all the verses of the highwayman poem and it has a very sad end would i like him to say it because he never learned how to read and he had to carry the poem in his head he stands in the middle of the ward leaning on his mop and recites tlot tlot in the frosty silence tlottlot in the echoing night
nearer he came and nearer her face was like a light
her eyes grew wide for a moment she drew one last deep breath then her finger moved in the moonlight her musket shattered the moonlight shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned himwith her death
he hears the shot and escapes but when he learns at dawn how bess died he goes into a rage and returns for revenge only to be shot down by the redcoats
blood red were his spurs in the golden noon wine red was his velvet coat when they shot him down on the highway down like a dog on
about
what it
english
the highway and he lay in his blood on the highway with a bunch of lace at his throat
seamus wipes his sleeve across his face and sniffles he says there was no call at all to shift you up here away from patricia when you didnt even know what happened to the highwayman and bess tis a very sad story and when i said it to my wife she wouldnt stop crying the whole night till we went to bed she said there was no call for them redcoats to shoot that highwayman they are responsible for half the troubles of the world and they never had any pity on the irish either now if you want to know any more poems frankie tell me and ill get them from the pub and bring em back in my head
the girl with the blue dress whos not right in the head suddenly says one day would you like a book for to read and she brings me the amazing quest of mr ernest bliss by e phillips oppenheim which is all about an englishman who is fed up and doesnt know what to do with himself every day even though hes so rich he cant count his money his manservant brings him the morning paper the tea the egg the toast and marmalade and he says take it away life is empty he cant read his paper he cant eat his egg and he pines away his doctor tells him go and live among the poor in the east end of london and hell learn to love life which he does and falls in love with a girl who is poor but honest and very intelligent and they get married and move into his house in the west end which is the rich part because its easier to help the poor and not be fed up when youre nice and comfortable
seamus likes me to tell him what im reading he says that story about mr ernest bliss is a madeup story because no one in his right mind would have to go to a doctor over having too much money and not eating his egg though you never know it might be like that in england youd never find the likes of that in ireland if you didnt eat your egg here youd be carted off to the lunatic asylum or reported to the bishop
i cant wait to go home and tell malachy about this man who wont eat his egg malachy will fall down on the floor laughing because such a thing could never happen hell say im making it up but when i tell him this story is about an englishman hell understand
i cant tell the girl in the blue dress that this story was silly because she might have a fit she says if youre finished with that book ill bring you another one because theres a whole box of books left behind by patients from the old days she brings me a book called tom browns schooldays which is hard to read and no end of books by p g wodehouse who makes me laugh over ukridge and bertie wooster and jeeves and all the mulliners bertie wooster is rich but he eats his egg every morning for fear of what jeeves might say i wish i could talk to the girl in the blue dress or anyone about the books but im afraid the kerry nurse or sister rita might find out and theyd move me to a bigger ward upstairs with fifty empty beds and famine ghosts galore with green mouths and bony fingers pointing at night i lie in bed thinking about tom brown and his adventures at rugby school and all the characters in p g wodehouse i can dream about the red lipped landlords daughter and the highwayman and the nurses and nuns can do nothing about it its lovely to know the world cant interfere with the inside of your head
its august and im eleven ive been in this hospital for two months and i wonder if theyll let me out for christmas the kerry nurse tells me i should get down on my two knees and thank god im alive at all at all and not be complaining
im not complaining nurse im only wondering if ill be home for christmas
she wont answer me she tells me behave myself or shell send sister rita up to me and then ill behave myself
mam comes to the hospital on my birthday and sends up a package with two chocolate bars and a note with names of people in the lane telling me get better and come home and youre a great soldier frankie the nurse lets me talk to her through the window and its hard because the windows are high and i have to stand on seamuss shoulders i tell mam i want to go home but she says im a bit too weak and surely ill be out in no time seamus says tis a grand thing to be eleven because any day now youll be a man shaving and all and ready to get out and get a job and drink your pint good as any man
after fourteen weeks sister rita tells me i can go home and arent i a lucky boy that the day will be the feast of st francis of assisi she tells me i was a very good patient except for that little problem with the poem and patricia madigan god rest her and im invited to come back and have a big christmas dinner in the hospital mam comes for me and with my weak legs it takes us a long time to walk to the bus at union cross she says take your time after three and a half months we can spare an hour
people are at their doors on barrack road and roden lane telling me its grand to see me back that im a great soldier a credit to my father and mother malachy and michael run up to me in the lane and say god youre walking very slow cant you run anymore
its a bright day and im happy till i see dad sitting in the kitchen with alphie on his lap and theres an empty feeling in my heart because i know hes out of work again all along i was sure he had a job mam told me he did and i thought there would be no shortage of food and shoes he smiles at me and tells alphie och theres your big brother home from the hospital
mam tells him what the doctor said that im to have plenty of nourishing food and rest the doctor said beef would be the right thing for building me up again dad nods mam makes beef tea from a cube and malachy and mike watch me drink it they say theyd like some too but mam says go away ye didnt have the typhoid she says the doctor wants me to go to bed early she tried to get rid of the fleas but theyre worse than ever with the warm weather were having besides she says they wont get much out of you all bones and little skin
i lie in bed and think of the hospital where the white sheets were changed every day and there wasnt a sign of a flea there was a lavatory where you could sit and read your book till someone asked if you were dead there was a bath where you could sit in hot water as long as you liked and say i do believe induced by potent circumstances that thou art mine enemy and saying that helps me fall asleep
when malachy and michael get up for school in the morning mam tells me i can stay in bed malachy is in fifth class now with mr odea and he likes to tell everyone hes learning the big red catechism for confirmation and mr odea is telling them all about state of grace and euclid and how the english tormented the irish for eight hundred long years
i dont want to stay in bed anymore the october days are lovely and i want to sit outside looking up the lane at the way the sun slants along the wall opposite our house mikey moloney brings me p g
wodehouse books his father gets from the library and i have great days with ukridge and bertie wooster and all the mulliners dad lets me read his favorite book john mitchels jail journal which is all about a great irish rebel the english condemned to exile in van diemens land in australia the english tell john mitchel hes free to come and go as he pleases all over van diemens land if he gives his word of honor as a gentleman he wont try to escape he gives his word till a ship comes to help him escape and he goes to the office of the english magistrate and says im escaping jumps on his horse and winds up in new york dad says he doesnt mind if i read silly english books by p g wodehouse as long as i dont forget the men who did their bit and gave their lives for ireland
i cant stay at home forever and mam takes me back to leamys school in november the new headmaster mr ohalloran says hes sorry ive missed over two months of school and i have to be put back in fifth class mam says surely im ready for sixth class after all she says hes missed only a few weeks mr ohalloran says hes sorry take the boy next door to mr odea
we walk along the hallway and i tell mam i dont want to be in fifth class malachy is in that class and i dont want to be in a class with my brother who is a year younger i made my confirmation last year he didnt im older im not bigger anymore because of the typhoid but im older
mam says it wont kill you
she doesnt care and im put into that class with malachy and i know all his friends are there sneering at me because i was put back mr odea makes me sit in the front and tells me get that sour look off my puss or ill feel the end of his ash plant
then a miracle happens and its all because of st francis of assisi my favorite saint and our lord himself i find a penny in the street that first day back at school and i want to run to kathleen oconnells for a big square of cleeves toffee but i cant run because my legs are still weak from the typhoid and sometimes i have to hold on to a wall im desperate for the cleevestoffee but im also desperate to get out of fifth class
i know i have to go to the statue of st francis of assisi hes the only one who will listen but hes at the other end of limerick and it takes me an hour to walk there sitting on steps holding on to walls its a penny to light a candle and i wonder if i should just light the candle and keep the penny no st francis would know he loves the bird in the air and the fish in the stream but hes not a fool i light the candle i kneel at his statue and beg him to get me out of fifth class where im stuck with my brother who is probably going around the lane now bragging that his big brother was kept back st francis doesnt say a word but i know hes listening and i know hell get me out of that class its the least he could do after all my trouble coming to his statue sitting on steps holding on to walls when i could have gone to st josephs church and lit a candle to the little flower or the sacred heart of jesus himself whats the use of being named after him if hes going to desert me in my hour of need
i have to sit in mr odeas class listening to the catechism and all the other stuff he taught last year id like to raise my hand and give the answers but he says be quiet let your brother answer he gives them tests in arithmetic and makes me sit there and correct them he
dictates to them in irish and makes me correct what theyve written then he gives me special compositions to write and makes me read them to the class because of all i learned from him last year he tells the class frank mccourt is going to show you how well he learned to write in this class last year hes going to write a composition on our lord arent you mccourt hes going to tell us what it would be like if our lord had grown up in limerick which has the arch confraternity of the holy family and is the holiest city in ireland we know that if our lord had grown up in limerick he would never have been crucified because the people of limerick were always good catholics and not given to crucifixion so mccourt you are to go home and write that composition and bring it in tomorrow
dad says mr odea has a great imagination but didnt our lord suffer enough on the cross without sticking him in limerick on top of it with the damp from the river shannon he puts on his cap and goes for a long walk and i have to think about our lord by myself and wonder what im going to write tomorrow
the next day mr odea says all right mccourt read your composition to the class
the name of my composition is
the title mccourt the title
the title of my composition is jesus and the weather 
what
jesus and the weather 
all right read it
this is my composition i dont think jesus who is our lord would
have liked the weather in limerick because its always raining and the shannon keeps the whole city damp my father says the shannon is a killer river because it killed my two brothers when you look at pictures of jesus hes always wandering around ancient israel in a sheet it never rains there and you never hear of anyone coughing or getting consumption or anything like that and no one has a job there because all they do is stand around and eat manna and shake their fists and go to crucifixions
anytime jesus got hungry all he had to do was walk up the road to a fig tree or an orange tree and have his fill if he wanted a pint he could wave his hand over a big glass and there was the pint or he could visit mary magdalene and her sister martha and theyd give him his dinner no questions asked and hed get his feet washed and dried with mary magdalenes hair while martha washed the dishes which i dont think is fair why should she have to wash the dishes while her sister sits out there chatting away with our lord its a good thing jesus decided to be born jewish in that warm place because if he was born in limerick hed catch the consumption and be dead in a month and there wouldnt be any catholic church and there wouldnt be any communion or confirmation and we wouldnt have to learn the catechism and write compositions about him the end
mr odea is quiet and gives me a strange look and im worried because when hes quiet like that it means someone is going to suffer he says mccourt who wrote that composition
i did sir
did your father write that composition he didnt sir
come here mccourt
i follow him out the door along the hall to the headmasters room mr odea shows him my composition and mr ohalloran gives me the strange look too did you write this composition
i did sir
im taken out of the fifth class and put into mr ohallorans sixth class with all the boys i know paddy clohessy fintan slattery the question quigley and when school is over that day i have to go back down to the statue of st francis of assisi to thank him even if my legs are still weak from the typhoid and i have to sit on steps and hold on to walls and i wonder was it something good i said in that composition or something bad
mr thomas l ohalloran teaches three classes in one room sixth seventh eighth he has a head like president roosevelt and he wears gold glasses he wears suits navy blue or gray and theres a gold watch chain that hangs across his belly from pocket to pocket in his waistcoat we call him hoppy because he has a short leg and hops when he walks he knows what we call him and he says yes im hoppy and ill hop on you he carries a long stick a pointer and if you dont pay attention or give a stupid answer he gives you three slaps on each hand or whacks you across the backs of your legs he makes you learn everything by heart everything and that makes him the hardest master in the school he loves america and makes us know all the american states in alphabetical order he makes charts of irish grammar irish history and algebra at home hangs them on an easel and we have to chant our way through the cases conjugations and declensions of irish famous names and battles proportions ratios equations we have to know all the important dates in irish history he tells us what is important and why no master ever told us why before if you asked why youd be hit on the head hoppy doesnt call us idiots and if you ask a question he doesnt go into a rage hes the only master who stops and says do ye understand what im talking about do ye want to ask a question
its a shock to everyone when he says the battle of kinsale in sixteen nought one was the saddest moment in irish history a close battle with cruelty and atrocities on both sides
cruelty on both sides the irish side how could that be all the other masters told us the irish always fought nobly they always fought the fair fight he recites and makes us remember they went forth to battle but they always fell their eyes were fixed above the sullen shields
nobly they fought and bravely but not well and sank heart wounded by a subtle spell
if they lost it was because of traitors and informers but i want to know about these irish atrocities
sir did the irish commit atrocities at the battle of kinsale
they did indeed it is recorded that they killed prisoners but they were no better nor worse than the english
mr ohalloran cant lie hes the headmaster all these years we were told the irish were always noble and they made brave speeches before the english hanged them now hoppy ohalloran is saying the irish did bad things next thing hell be saying the english did good things he says you have to study and learn so that you can make up your own mind about history and everything else but you cant make up an empty mind stock your mind stock your mind it is your house of treasure and no one in the world can interfere with it if you won the irish sweepstakes and
bought a house that needed furniture would you fill it with bits and pieces of rubbish your mind is your house and if you fill it with rubbish from the cinemas it will rot in your head you might be poor your shoes might be broken but your mind is a palace
he calls us one by one to the front of the room and looks at our shoes he wants to know why theyre broken or why we have no shoes at all he tells us this is a disgrace and hes going to have a raffle to raise money so that we can have strong warm boots for the winter he gives us books of tickets and we swarm all over limerick for leamys school boot fund first prize five pounds five prizes of a pound each eleven boys with no boots get new boots malachy and i dont get any because we have shoes on our feet even if the soles are worn away and we wonder why we ran all over limerick selling tickets so that other boys could get boots fintan slattery says we gain plenary indulgences for works of charity and paddy clohessy says fintan would you ever go and have a good shit for yourself
i know when dad does the bad thing i know when he drinks the dole money and mam is desperate and has to beg at the st vincent de paul society and ask for credit at kathleen oconnells shop but i dont want to back away from him and run to mam how can i do that when im up with him early every morning with the whole world asleep he lights the fire and makes the tea and sings to himself or reads the paper to me in a whisper that wont wake up the rest of the family mikey molloy stole cuchulain the angel on the seventh step is gone someplace else but my father in the morning is still mine he gets the irish press early and tells me about the world hitler mussolini franco he says this war is none of our business because the english are up to their tricks again he tells me about the great roosevelt in washington and the great de valera in dublin in the morning we have the world to ourselves and he never tells me i should die for ireland he tells me about the old days in ireland when the english wouldnt let the catholics have schools because they wanted to keep the people ignorant that the catholic children met in hedge schools in the depths of the country and learned english irish latin and greek the people loved learning they loved stories and poetry even if none of this was any good for getting a job men women and children would gather in ditches to hear those great masters and everyone wondered at how much a man could carry in his head the masters risked their lives going from ditch to ditch and hedge to hedge because if the english caught them teaching they might be transported to foreign parts or worse he tells me school is easy now you dont have to sit in a ditch learning your sums or the glorious history of ireland i should be good in school and some day ill go back to america and get an inside job where ill be sitting at a desk with two fountain pens in my pocket one red and one blue making decisions ill be in out of the rain and ill have a suit and shoes and a warm place to live and what more could a man want he says you can do anything in america its the land of opportunity you can be a fisherman in maine or a farmer in california america is not like limerick a gray place with a river that kills
when you have your father to yourself by the fire in the morning you dont need cuchulain or the angel on the seventh step or anything
at night he helps us with our exercises mam says they call it homework in america but here its exercises the sums the english the irish the history he cant help us with irish because hes from the north and lacking in the native tongue malachy offers to teach him all
the irish words he knows but dad says its too late you cant teach an old dog a new bark before bed we sit around the fire and if we say dad tell us a story he makes up one about someone in the lane and the story will take us all over the world up in the air under the sea and back to the lane everyone in the story is a different color and everything is upside down and backward motor cars and planes go under water and submarines fly through the air sharks sit in trees and giant salmon sport with kangaroos on the moon polar bears wrestle with elephants in australia and penguins teach zulus how to play bagpipes after the story he takes us upstairs and kneels with us while we say our prayers we say the our father three hail marys god bless the pope god bless mam god bless our dead sister and brothers god bless ireland god bless de valera and god bless anyone who gives dad a job he says go to sleep boys because holy god is watching you and he always knows if youre not good
i think my father is like the holy trinity with three people in him the one in the morning with the paper the one at night with the stories and the prayers and then the one who does the bad thing and comes home with the smell of whiskey and wants us to die for ireland
i feel sad over the bad thing but i cant back away from him because the one in the morning is my real father and if i were in america i could say i love you dad the way they do in the films but you cant say that in limerick for fear you might be laughed at youre allowed to say you love god and babies and horses that win but anything else is a softness in the head
day and night were tormented in that kitchen with people emptying their buckets mam says its not the river shannon that will kill us but the stink from that lavatory outside our door its bad enough in the winter when everything flows over and seeps under our door but worse in the warm weather when there are flies and bluebottles and rats
there is a stable next to the lavatory where they keep the big horse from gabbetts coal yard his name is finn the horse and we all love him but the stable man from the coal yard doesnt take proper care of the stable and the stink travels to our house the stink from the lavatory and the stable attracts rats and we have to chase them with our new dog lucky he loves to corner the rats and then we smash them to bits with rocks or sticks or stab them with the hay fork in the stable the horse himself is frightened by the rats and we have to be careful when he rears up he knows were not rats because we bring him apples when we rob an orchard out the country
sometimes the rats escape and run into our house and into the coal hole under the stairs where its pitch dark and you cant see them even when we bring in a candle we cant find them because they dig holes everywhere and we dont know where to look if we have a fire we can boil water and pour it slowly in from the kettle spot and that will drive them out of the hole between our legs and out the door again unless lucky is there to catch them in his teeth and shake the life out of them we expect him to eat the rats but hell leave them in the lane with their guts hanging out and run to my father for a piece of bread dipped in tea people in the lane say thats a peculiar way for a dog to behave but then what would you expect from a dog of the mccourts
the minute theres a sign of a rat or a mention of one mam is out the door and up the lane shed rather walk the streets of limerick forever than stay one minute in a house that has a rat in it and she can
never rest because she knows that with the stable and the lavatory theres always a rat nearby with his family waiting for their dinner
we fight the rats and we fight the stink from that lavatory wed like to keep our door open in the warm weather but you cant when people are trotting down the lane to empty their brimming buckets some families are worse than others and dad hates all of them even though mam tells him its not their fault if the builders a hundred years ago put up houses with no lavatories but this one outside our door dad says the people should empty their buckets in the middle of the night when we are asleep so that we wont be disturbed by the stink
the flies are nearly as bad as the rats on warm days they swarm to the stable and when a bucket is emptied they swarm to the lavatory if mam cooks anything they swarm into the kitchen and dad says its disgusting to think the fly sitting there on the sugar bowl was on the toilet bowl or whats left of it a minute ago if you have an open sore they find it and torment you by day you have the flies by night you have the fleas mam says theres one good thing about fleas theyre clean but flies are filthy you never know where they came from and they carry diseases galore we can chase the rats and kill them
we can slap at the flies and the fleas and kill them but theres nothing we can do about the neighbors and their buckets if were out in the lane playing and we see someone with a bucket we call to our own house bucket coming close the door close the door and whoever is inside runs to the door in warm weather we run to close the door all day because we know which families have the worst buckets there are families whose fathers have jobs and if they get into the habit of cooking with curry we know their buckets will stink to the heavens and make us sick now with the war on and men sending money from england more and more families are cooking with curry and our house is filled with the stink day and night we know the families with the curry we know the ones with the cabbage mam is sick all the time dad takes longer and longer walks into the country and we play outside as much as we can and far from the lavatory dad doesnt complain about the river shannon anymore he knows now the lavatory is worse and he takes me with him to the town hall to complain the man there says mister all i can tell you is you can move dad says we cant afford to move and the man says theres nothing he can do dad says this is not india this is a christian country the lane needs more lavatories the man says do you expect limerick to start building lavatories in houses that are falling down anyway that will be demolished after the war dad says that lavatory could kill us all the man says we live in dangerous times
mam says its hard enough keeping a fire going to cook the christmas dinner but if im going to christmas dinner at the hospital ill have to wash myself from top to bottom she wouldnt give it to sister rita to say i was neglected or ripe for another disease she boils a pot of water early in the morning before mass and nearly scalds the scalp off me she scours my ears and scrubs my skin so hard it tingles she can afford tuppence for the bus out to the hospital but ill have to walk back and that will be good for me because ill be stuffed with food and now she has to get the fire going again for the pigs head and cabbage and floury white potatoes which she got once again through the kindness of the st vincent de paul society and shes determined this will be the last time we celebrate the birth of our lord with pigs head
next year well have a goose or a nice ham and why wouldnt we isnt limerick famous the world over for the ham
sister rita says now would you look at this our little soldier looking so healthy no meat on the bones but still now tell me did you go to mass this morning
i did sister
and did you receive
i did sister
she takes me into an empty ward and tells me sit there on that
chair it wont be long now till i get my dinner she leaves and i wonder if ill be eating with nuns and nurses or will i be in a ward with children having their christmas dinner in awhile my dinner is brought in by the girl in the blue dress who brought me the books she places the tray on the side of a bed and i pull up a chair she frowns at me and screws up her face you she says thats your dinner an im not bringin you any books
the dinner is delicious turkey mashed potatoes peas jelly and custard and a pot of tea the jelly and custard dish looks delicious and i cant resist it so ill have it first theres no one there to notice but when im eating it the girl in the blue dress comes in with bread and says what are you doin
nothing
yes you are youre atin the sweet before the dinner and she runs out calling sister rita sister rita come in quick and the nun rushes in francis are you all right
i am sister
hes not all right sister he do be atin his jelly an custard before his dinner thats a sin sister
ah now dear you run along and ill talk to francis about that
do sister talk to him or all the childer in the hospital will be atin their sweet before their dinner an then where will we be
indeed indeed where will we be run along now
the girl leaves and sister rita smiles at me god love her she doesnt miss a thing even in her confusion we have to be patient with her francis the way shes touched
she leaves and its quiet in that empty ward and when im finished i dont know what to do because youre not supposed to do anything till they tell you hospitals and schools always tell you what to do i wait a long time till the girl in the blue dress comes in for the tray are you finished she says
and i tells
i am
well thats all youre gettin an now you can go home
surely girls who are not right in the head cant tell you go home
wonder if i should wait for sister rita a nurse in the hallway
me sister rita is having her dinner and is not to be bothered its a long walk from union cross to barrack hill and when i get
home my family are up in italy and well into their pigs head and cabbage and floury white potatoes i tell them about my christmas dinner mam wants to know if i had it with the nurses and nuns and she gets a bit angry when i tell her i ate alone in a ward and thats no way to treat a child she tells me sit down and have some pigs head and i force it into my mouth and im so stuffed i have to lie on the bed with my belly sticking out a mile
its early in the morning and theres a motor car outside our door the first one weve ever seen in the lane there are men in suits looking in the door of the stable of finn the horse and there must be something wrong because you never see men with suits in the lane
its finn the horse hes lying on the floor of the stable looking up the lane and theres white stuff like milk around his mouth the stable man who takes care of finn the horse says he found him like that this morning and its strange because hes always up and ready for his feed the men are shaking their heads my brother michael says to one of the men mister whats up with finn
sick horse son go home
the stable man who takes care of finn has the whiskey smell on him he says to michael that horse is a goner we have to shoot him
michael pulls at my hand frank theyre not to shoot him tell them youre big
the stable man says go home boy go home
michael attacks him kicks him scrawbs the back of his hand and the man sends michael flying hould that brother of yours he tells me hould him
one of the other men takes something yellow and brown from a bag goes to finn puts it to his head and theres a sharp crack finn shivers michael screams at the man and attacks him too but the man says the horse was sick son hes better off
the men in suits drive away and the stable man says he has to wait for the lorry to take finn away he cant leave him alone or the rats will be at him he wants to know if wed keep an eye on the horse with our dog lucky while he goes to the pub hes blue mouldy for a pint
no rat has a chance to get near finn the horse the way michael is there with a stick small as he is the man comes back smelling of porter and then theres the big lorry to take the horse away a big lorry with three men and two great planks that slope from the back of the lorry to finns head the three men and the stable man tie ropes around finn and pull him up the planks and the people in the lane yell at the men because of the nails and broken wood in the planks that catch at finn and tear out bits of his hide and streak the planks with bright pink horse blood
ye are destroyin that horse
cant ye have respect for the dead
go easy with that poor horse
the stable man says for the love o jaysus what are ye squawkin
about tis only a dead horse and michael runs at him again with his head down and his small fists flying till the stable man gives him a shove that sends him on his back and mam goes at the stable man in such a rage he runs up the planks and over finns body to escape he comes back drunk in the evening to sleep it off and after he leaves theres a smoldering in the hay and the stable burns down the rats running up the lane with every boy and dog chasing them till they escape into the streets of respectable people
ix
mam says alphie is enough im worn out thats the end of it no more children
dad says the good catholic woman must perform her wifely duties and submit to her husband or face eternal damnation
mam says as long as there are no more children eternal damnation sounds attractive enough to me
what is dad to do theres a war on english agents are recruiting irishmen to work in their munitions factories the pay is good there are no jobs in ireland and if the wife turns her back to you theres no shortage of women in england where the able men are off fighting hitler and mussolini and you can do anything you like as long as you remember youre irish and lower class and dont try to rise above your station
families up and down the lane are getting telegram money orders from their fathers in england they rush to the post office to cash the money orders so they can shop and show the world their good fortune on saturday night and sunday morning the boys get their hair cut on saturdays the women curl their hair with iron tongs hot from the fire theyre very grand now the way they pay sixpence or even a shilling for seats at the savoy cinema where youll meet a better class of people than the lower classes who fill the tuppenny seats in the gods at the lyric cinema and are never done shouting at the screen the kind of people if you dont mind who are liable to cheer on the africans when they throw spears at tarzan or the indians when theyre scalping the united states cavalry the new rich people go home after mass on sundays all airs and stuff themselves with meat and potatoes sweets and cakes galore and they think nothing of drinking their tea from delicate little cups which stand in saucers to catch the tea that overflows and when they lift the cups they stick out their little fingers to show how refined they are some stop going to fish and chip shops altogether because you see nothing in those places but drunken soldiers and night girls and men that drank their dole and their wives screeching at them to come home the brave new rich will be seen at the savoy restaurant or the stella drinking tea eating little buns patting their lips with serviettes if you dont mind coming home on the bus and complaining the service is not what it used to be they have electricity now so they can see things they never saw before and when darkness falls they turn on the new wireless to hear how the war is going they thank god for hitler because if he hadnt marched all over europe the men of ireland would still be at home scratching their arses on the queue at the labour exchange
some families sing
yip aye aidy aye ay aye oh
yip aye aidy aye ay
we dont care about england or france all we want is the german advance
if theres a chill in the air theyll turn on the electric fire for the comfort thats in it and sit in their kitchens listening to the news declaring how sorry they are for the english women and children dying under the german bombs but look what england did to us for eight hundred years
the families with fathers in england are able to lord it over the families that dont at dinnertime and teatime the new rich mothers stand at their doors and call to their children mikey kathleen paddy come in for yeer dinner come in for the lovely leg olamb and the gorgeous green peas and the floury white potatoes
sean josie peggy come in for yeer tea come in at wanst for the fresh bread and butter and the gorgeous blue duck egg what no one else in the lane have

at times like this mam tells us to stay inside we have nothing but bread and tea and she doesnt want the tormenting neighbors to see us with our tongues hanging out suffering over the lovely smells floating up and down the lane she says tis easy to see theyre not used to having anything the way they brag about everything tis a real lowclass mind that will call out the door and tell the world what theyre having for the supper she says tis their way of getting a rise out of us because dad is a foreigner from the north and he wont have anything to do with any of them dad says all that food comes from english money and no luck will come to those who took it but what could you expect from limerick anyway people who profit from hitlers war people who will work and fight for the english he says hell never go over there and help england win a war mam says no youll stay here where theres no work and hardly a lump of coal to boil water for the tea no youll stay here and drink the dole when the humor is on you youll watch your sons going around with broken shoes and their arses hanging out of their trousers every house in the lane has electricity and were lucky if we have a candle god above if i had the fare id be off to england myself for im sure they need women in the factories
dad says a factory is no place for a woman
mam says sitting on your arse by the fire is no place for a man i say to him why cant you go to england dad so we can have
electricity and a wireless and mam can stand at the door and tell the world what were having at dinnertime
he says dont you want to have your father here at home with you
i do but you can come back at the end of the war and we can all go to america
he sighs och aye och aye all right hell go to england after christmas because america is in the war now and the cause must be just hed never go if the americans hadnt gone in he tells me ill have to be the man of the house and he signs up with an agent to work in a factory in coventry which everyone says is the most bombed city in england the agent says theres plenty of work for willing men you can work overtime till you drop and if you save it up mate youll be rockefeller at the end of the war
were up early to see dad off at the railway station kathleen oconnell at the shop knows dad is off to england and money will be flowing back so shes happy to let mam have credit for tea milk sugar bread butter and an egg
an egg
mam says this egg is for your father he needs the nourishment for the long journey before him
its a hardboiled egg and dad peels off the shell he slices the egg five ways and gives each of us a bit to put on our bread mam says dont be such a fool dad says what would a man be doing with a whole egg to himself mam has tears on her eyelashes she pulls her chair over to the fireplace we all eat our bread and egg and watch her cry till she says what are ye gawkin at and turns away to look into the ashes her
bread and egg are still on the table and i wonder if she has any plans for them they look delicious and im still hungry but dad gets up and brings them to her with the tea she shakes her head but he presses them on her and she eats and drinks snuffling and crying he sits opposite her a while silent till she looks up at the clock and says tis time to go he puts on his cap and picks up his bag mam wraps alphie in an old blanket and we set off through the streets of limerick
there are other families in the streets the going away fathers walk ahead the mothers carry babies or push prams a mother with a pram will say to other mothers god above missus you must be fagged out carrying that child sure why dont you stick him into the pram here and rest your poor arms
prams might be packed with four or five babies squalling away because the prams are old and the wheels bockety and the babies are rocked till they get sick and throw up their goody
the men call to each other grand day mick lovely day for the journey joe tis indeed mick arrah we might as well have a pint before we go joe we might as well mick might as well be drunk as the way we are joe
they laugh and the women behind them are teary eyed and red nosed
in the pubs around the railway station the men are packed in drinking the money the agents gave them for travel food theyre having the last pint the last drop of whiskey on irish soil for god knows it might be the last well ever have mick the way the jerries are bombing the bejesus outa england and not a minute too soon after what they did to us and isnt it a tragic thing entirely the way we have to go over there and save the arse of the ancient foe
the women stay outside the pubs talking mam tells mrs meehan the first telegram money order i get ill be in the shop buying a big breakfast so that we can all have our own egg of a sunday morning
i look at my brother malachy did you hear that our own egg of a sunday morning oh god i already had plans for my egg tap it around the top gently crack the shell lift with a spoon a dab of butter down into the yolk salt take my time a dip of the spoon scoop more salt more butter into the mouth oh god above if heaven has a taste it must be an egg with butter and salt and after the egg is there anything in the world lovelier than fresh warm bread and a mug of sweet golden tea
some men are already too drunk to walk and the english agents are paying sober men to drag them out of the pubs and throw them on a great horse drawn float to be hauled to the station and dumped into the train the agents are desperate to get everyone out of the pubs come on men miss this train and youll miss a good job come on men we have the guinness in england we have the jameson now men please men youre drinking your food money and youll get no more
the men tell the agents to kiss their irish arses that the agents are lucky theyre alive lucky theyre not hanging from the nearest lamppost after what they did to ireland and the men sing on mountjoy one monday morning high upon the gallows tree kevin barry gave his young life for the cause of liberty
the train wails in the station and the agents beg the women to get their men out of the pubs and the men stumble out singing and crying and hugging their wives and children and promising to send so much money limerick will be turned into another new york the men climb the station
steps and the women and children call after them kevin love mind yourself and dont be wearing damp shirts
dry your socks michael or the bunions will destroy you entirely paddy go easy on the drink are you listenin paddy
dad dad dont go dad
tommy dont forget to send the money the children are skin and
bones
peter dont forget to be takin the medicine for your weak chest
god help us
larry mind them bloody bombs
christy dont be talkin to them englishwomen theyre full of
diseases
jackie come back sure well manage somehow dont go jackee
jackee oh jesus dont go
dad pats our heads he tells us remember our religious duties but
above all obey our mother he stands before her she has the baby alphie in her arms she says mind yourself he drops the bag and puts his arms around her they stay that way a moment till the baby yelps between them he nods picks up his bag climbs the steps to the station turns to wave and hes gone
back at home mam says i dont care i know it sounds extravagant but im going to light the fire and make more tea for it isnt every day your father goes to england
we sit around the fire and drink our tea and cry because we have no father till mam says dont cry dont cry now that your father is gone to england surely our troubles will be over
surely
mam and bridey hannon sit by the fire upstairs in italy smoking woodbines drinking tea and i sit on the stairs listening we have a father in england so that we can get all we want from kathleen oconnells shop and pay when he starts sending the money in a fortnight mam tells bridey she cant wait to get out of this bloody lane to a place with a decent lavatory that we dont have to share with half the world well all have new boots and coats to keep off the rain so we wont be coming home from school famished well have eggs and rashers on sunday for breakfast and ham and cabbage and potatoes for dinner well have electric light and why shouldnt we werent frank and malachy born to it in america where everyone has it
all we have to do now is wait for two weeks till the telegram boy knocks at the door dad will have to settle into his job in england buy work clothes and get a place to stay so the first money order wont be big three pounds or three pounds ten but soon well be like other families in the lane five pounds a week paying off debts buying new clothes putting something in the savings against the time well pack up and move to england entirely and save there to go to america mam herself could get a job in an english factory making bombs or something and god knows we wouldnt know ourselves with the money pouring in she wouldnt be happy if we grew up with english accents but better an english accent than an empty belly
bridey says it doesnt matter what class of an accent an irishman has for hell never forget what the english did to us for eight hundred long years
we know what saturdays are in the lane we know some families like the downeses across from us get their telegram early because mr downes
is a steady man who knows how to have a pint or two on a friday and go home to his bed we know men like him run to the post office the minute theyre paid so their families wont know a minute of waiting or worry men like mr downes send their sons raf wings to wear on their coats thats what we want and thats what we told dad before he left dont forget the raf badges dad
we see the telegram boys on their bicycles swing into the lane theyre happy telegram boys because the tips they get in the lanes are bigger than anything they get in the grand streets and avenues where rich people will begrudge you the steam of their piss
the families that get the early telegrams have that contented look theyll have all day saturday to enjoy the money theyll shop theyll eat theyll have all day to think about what theyll do that night and thats almost as good as the thing itself because saturday night when you have a few shillings in your pocket is the most delicious night of the week
there are families dont get the telegram every week and you know them by the anxious look mrs meagher has waited at her door every saturday for two months my mother says shed be ashamed of her life to wait at the door like that all the children play in the lane and keep an eye out for the telegram boy hoi telegram boy do you have anything for meagher and when he says no they say are you sure and hell say course im sure i know what i have in my feckin pouch
everyone knows the telegram boys stop coming when the angelus rings at six and darkness brings desperation to the women and children
telegram boy will you look in your pouch again please aw god i did i have nothing for ye
aw god please look our name is meagher will you look
i know bloody well yeer name is meagher and i looked
the children claw at him up on his bicycle and he kicks at them jesus will ye get away from me
once the angelus rings at six in the evening the day is over the ones with the telegrams are having their supper with the electric light blazing away and the ones that didnt get the telegrams have to light candles and see if kathleen oconnell might let them have tea and bread till this time next week when surely with the help of god and his blessed mother the telegram will come
mr meehan at the top of the lane went to england with dad and when the telegram boy stops at meehans we know well be next mam has her coat ready to go to the post office but she wont leave the chair by the fire in italy till she has the telegram in her hand the telegram boy rides down the lane and swings over to downeses he hands them their telegram takes the tip and turns his bicycle around to head back up the lane malachy calls telegram boy do you have something for mccourt ours is coming today the telegram boy shakes his head and rides away
mam puffs on her woodbine well we have all day though id like to do a bit of shopping early before the best hams are gone at barry the butcher she cant leave the fire and we cant leave the lane for fear the telegram boy might come and find no one at home then wed have to wait till monday to cash the money order and that would destroy the weekend entirely wed have to watch the meehans and everyone else parading around in their new clothes and staggering home with eggs and potatoes and sausages for sunday and sailing off to the films on saturday night no we cant move an inch till that telegram boy comes mam says
dont be too worried between noon and two because so many telegram boys go for their dinner and there will surely be a big rush between two and the angelus we dont have a thing to worry about till six we stop every telegram boy we tell them our name is mccourt that this is our first telegram it should be three pounds or more they might have forgotten to put our name on it or our address is he sure is he sure one boy tells us hell inquire at the post office he says he knows what tis like to wait for the telegram because his own father is a drunken oul shit over in england that never sent a penny mam hears him inside and tells us you should never talk about your father like that the same telegram boy comes back just before the angelus at six and tells us he asked mrs oconnell at the post office if they had anything for mccourt all day and they didnt mam turns toward the dead ashes in the fire and sucks at the last bit of goodness in the woodbine butt caught between the brown thumb and the burnt middle finger michael who is only five and wont understand anything till hes eleven like me wants to know if were having fish and chips tonight because hes hungry mam says next week love and he goes back out to play in the lane
you dont know what to do with yourself when the first telegram doesnt come you cant stay out in the lane playing with your brothers all night because everyone else is gone in and youd be ashamed to stay out in the lane to be tormented with smells of sausages and rashers and fried bread you dont want to look at electric light coming through the windows after dark and you dont want to hear the news from the bbc or radio eireann from other peoples wirelesses mrs meagher and her children are gone in and theres only the dim light of a candle from their kitchen theyre ashamed too they stay inside on saturday nights and they dont even go to mass on sunday mornings bridey hannon told mam that mrs meagher is in a constant state of shame over the rags they wear and so desperate she goes down to the dispensary for the public assistance mam says thats the worst thing that could happen to any family its worse than going on the dole its worse than going to the st vincent de paul society its worse than begging on the streets with the tinkers and the knackers its the last thing youd do to keep yourself out of the poor house and the children from the orphanage
theres a sore at the top of my nose between my eyebrows gray and red and itching grandma says dont touch that sore and dont put water near it or itll spread if you broke your arm shed say dont touch that with water itll spread the sore spreads into my eyes anyway and now theyre red and yellow from the stuff that oozes and makes them stick in the morning they stick so hard i have to force my eyelids open with my fingers and mam has to scrub off that yellow stuff with a damp rag and boric powder the eyelashes fall off and every bit of dust in limerick blows into my eyes on windy days grandma tells me i have naked eyes and she says its my own fault all that eye trouble comes from sitting up there at the top of the lane under the light pole in all kinds of weather with my nose stuck in books and the same thing will happen to malachy if he doesnt give over with the reading you can see little michael is getting just as bad sticking his nose in books when he should be out playing like a healthy child books books books says grandma ye will ruin yeer eyes entirely
shes having tea with mam and i hear her whisper the thing to do is give him st anthonys spit
whats that says mam
your fasting spit in the morning go to him before he wakes and spit on his eyes for the spit of a fasting mother has powerful cures in
it
but im always awake before mam i force my eyes open long before
she stirs i can hear her coming across the floor and when she stands over me for the spit i open my eyes god she says your eyes are open
i think theyre getting better
thats good and she goes back to bed
the eyes dont heal and she takes me to the dispensary where the
poor people see doctors and get their medicines its the place to apply for public assistance when a father is dead or disappeared and theres no dole money no wages
there are benches along the walls by the doctors offices the benches are always packed with people talking about their ailments old men and women sit and groan and babies scream and mothers say hush love hush theres a high platform in the middle of the dispensary with a counter circling it chest high when you want anything you stand in a queue before that platform to see mr coffey or mr kane the women in the queue are like the women at the st vincent de paul society they wear shawls and theyre respectful to mr coffey and mr kane because if theyre not they might be told go away and come back next week when its this minute you need the public assistance or a docket to see the doctor mr coffey and mr kane love to have a good laugh with the women theyll decide if youre desperate enough for the public assistance or if youre sick enough to see a doctor you have to tell them in front of everyone whats wrong with you and they often have a good laugh with that theyll say and what is it you want mrs oshea a docket for the doctor is it and what is your trouble mrs oshea a pain is it a touch of the wind maybe or maybe too much cabbage oh the cabbage will do it right enough they laugh and mrs oshea laughs and all the women laugh and say mr coffey and mr kane are funny men theyd give laurel and hardy a run for their money
mr coffey says now woman whats your name angela mccourt sir

how long will he be in doctor
only god knows that i should have seen this child weeks ago there are twenty beds in the ward and there are men and boys with
bandages around their heads black patches on their eyes thick glasses some walk around tapping at beds with sticks a man cries all the time that hell never see again hes too young his children are babies hell never see them again jesus christ oh jesus christ and the nuns are shocked at the way he takes the name of the lord in vain stop that maurice stop the blasphemy you have your health youre alive we all have our problems offer it up and think of the sufferings of our lord on the cross the crown of thorns the nails in his poor hands and feet the wound in his side maurice says oh jesus look down and have pity on me sister bernadette warns him if he doesnt mind his language theyll put him in a ward alone and he says heavenly god and that isnt as bad as jesus christ so shes satisfied
in the morning i have to go downstairs for drops the nurse says sit in this high chair and heres a nice sweet the doctor has a bottle with brown stuff in it he tells me put my head back thats right now open up open your eyes and he pours the stuff into my right eye and its a flame going through my skull the nurse says open the other eye come on be a good boy and she has to force the eyelids open so the doctor can set fire to the other side of my skull she wipes my cheeks and tells me run along upstairs but i can barely see and i want to stick my face into an icy stream the doctor says run along be a man be a good trooper
the whole world is brown and blurry on the stairs the other patients are sitting by their beds with dinner trays and mine is there too but i dont want it with the way my skull is raging i sit by my bed and a boy across the way says hoi dont you want your dinner ill take it and he comes for it
i try to lie on the bed but a nurse says now now no lying on the bed in the middle of the day your case isnt that serious
i have to sit with my eyes closed and everything going brown and black black and brown and im sure i must be having a dream because lord god above is that the little fella with the typhoid little frankie the moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas is that yourself frankie for wasnt i promoted out of the fever hospital thank god where theres every class of disease and you never know what germs you
might be bringing home to the wife in your clothes and whats up with you frankie and the two eyes in your head all gone brown
i have an infection seamus
yerra youll be over that before youre married frankie the eyes need exercise the blink is great value for the eyes i had an uncle with bad eyes and the blink saved him he sat an hour ever day and blinked and it stood to him in the end wound up with powerful eyes so he did
i want to ask him more about the blink and the powerful eyes but he says now do you remember the poem frankie the lovely poem of patricia he stands in the aisle between the beds with his mop and his bucket
and says the highwayman poem and all the patients stop their moaning and the nuns and nurses stand and listen and on and on goes seamus till he comes to the end and everyone goes mad clapping and cheering him and he tells the world he loves that poem hell have it in his head forever no matter where he goes and if it wasnt for frankie mccourt and his typhoid there and poor patricia madigan with the dipteria thats gone god rest her hed never know the poem and there i am famous in the eye ward of the city home hospital and all because of seamus
mam cant come to visit every day its a long way out she doesnt always have the money for the bus and the walk is hard on her corns she thinks my eyes look better though you cant tell with all that brown stuff which looks and smells like iodine and if its anything like iodine it must burn still they say the bitterer the medicine the quicker the cure she gets permission to take me for a walk around the grounds when the weather clears and theres a strange sight mr timoney standing against the wall where the old people are with his eyes raised to the sky i want to talk to him and i have to ask mam because you never know whats right or wrong in a hospital
mr timoney
who is it who do we have
frank mccourt sir
francis ah francis
mam says im his mother mr timoney
well then the two of ye are blessed i have neither kith nor kin
nor macushla my dog and what are you doing in this place francis
i have an infection in my eyes
ah jesus francis not the eyes not the eyes mother of christ
youre too young for that
mr timoney would you like me to read to you
with them eyes francis ah no son save the eyes im beyond
reading in my head i have everything i need i was smart enough to put things in my head in my youth and now i have a library in my head the english shot my wife the irish put down my poor innocent macushla isnt it a joke of a world
mam says terrible world but god is good
indeed missus god made the world its a terrible world but god is good goodbye francis rest your eyes and then read till they fall out of your head we had good times with old jonathan swift didnt we francis
we did mr timoney
mam takes me back to the eye ward she tells me dont be crying over mr timoney hes not even your father besides youll be ruining your eyes
seamus comes to the ward three times a week and brings new poems in his head he says you made patricia sad frankie when you didnt like the one about the owl and the pussycat
im sorry seamus
i have it in my head frankie and ill say it for you if you dont say tis foolish
i wont seamus
he says the poem and everyone in the ward loves it they want the words and he says it three more times till the whole ward is saying the owl and the pussy cat went to sea in a beautiful peagreen boat
they took some honey and plenty of money wrapped up in a fivepound note
the owl looked up to the stars above
and sang to a small guitar
o lovely pussy o pussy my love
what a beautiful pussy you are
you are
you are
what a beautiful pussy you are
they say it along with seamus now and when its finished they cheer and clap and seamus laughs delighted with himself when hes gone with his mop and bucket you can hear them at all hours of the day and night o lovely pussy o pussy my love what a beautiful pussy you are you are you are
what a beautiful pussy you are
then seamus comes with no mop and no bucket and im afraid hes sacked over the poetry but hes smiling and telling me hes off to england to work in a factory and earn decent wages for a change hell work for two months and bring the wife over and god might be pleased to send them children for he has to do something with all the poems in his head and what better than saying them to small ones in memory of that sweet patricia madigan dead of the dipteria
goodbye francis if i had the right fist id write to you but ill get the wife to write when she comes over i might even learn to read and write myself so that the child that comes wont have a fool for a father
i want to cry but you cant cry in the eye ward with brown stuff in your eyes and nurses saying whats this whats this be a man and nuns going on offer it up think of the sufferings of our lord on the cross the crown of thorns the lance in the side the hands and feet torn to bits with nails
im a month in the hospital and the doctor says i can go home even if theres still a bit of infection but if i keep the eyes clean with soap and clean towels and build up my health with nourishing food plenty of beef and eggs ill have a pair of sparkling eyes in no time ha ha
mr downes across the way comes back from england for his mothers funeral he tells mrs downes about my father she tells bridey hannon and bridey tells my mother mr downes says that malachy mccourt is gone pure mad with the drink that he squanders his wages in pubs all over coventry that he sings irish rebel songs which the english dont mind because theyre used to the way the irish carry on about the hundreds of years of suffering but they wont put up with any man that stands up in
a pub and insults the king and queen of england their two lovely daughters and the queen mother herself insulting the queen mother is going beyond the beyonds what did she ever do to anyone that poor old lady time after time malachy drinks away his rent money and winds up sleeping in parks when the landlord throws him out hes a regular disgrace so he is and mr downes is glad mccourt is not a limerickman bringing shame to this ancient city the magistrates in coventry are losing their patience and if malachy mccourt doesnt stop the bloody nonsense hell be kicked out of the country entirely
mam tells bridey she doesnt know what shes going to do with these stories from england she never felt so desperate in her life she can see kathleen oconnell doesnt want to give any more credit at the shop and her own mother barks at her if she asks for the loan of a shilling and the st vincent de paul society want to know when shell stop asking for charity especially with a husband in england shes ashamed of the way we look with the dirty old torn shirts raggedy ganseys broken shoes holes in our stockings she lies awake at night thinking the most merciful thing of all would be to put the four boys in an orphanage so that she could go to england herself and find some type of work where she could bring us all over in a year for the better life there might be bombs but shed prefer bombs anytime to the shame of begging from this one and that one
no no matter what she cant bear the thought of putting us in the orphanage that might be all right if you had the likes of boys town in america with a nice priest like spencer tracy but you could never trust the christian brothers out in glin who get their exercise beating boys and starving the life out of them
mam says theres nothing left but the dispensary and the public assistance the relief and shes ashamed of her life to go and ask for it it means youre at the end of your rope and maybe one level above tinkers knackers and street beggars in general it means you have to crawl before mr coffey and mr kane and thank god the dispensary is at the other end of limerick so that people in our lane wont know were getting the relief
she knows from other women its wise to be there early in the morning when mr coffey and mr kane might be in a good mood if you go late in the morning theyre liable to be cranky after seeing hundreds of men women and children sick and asking for help she will take us with her to prove she has four children to feed she gets us up early and tells us for once in our lives dont wash our faces dont comb our hair dress in any old rag she tells me give my sore eyes a good rub and make them as red as i can for the worse you look at the dispensary the more pity you get and the better your chances of getting the public assistance she complains that malachy michael and alphie look too healthy and youd wonder why on this day of days they couldnt have their usual scabby knees or the odd cut bruise or black eye if we meet anyone in the lane or the streets of limerick we are not to tell them where were going she feels ashamed enough without telling the whole world and wait till her own mother hears
there is a queue already outside the dispensary there are women like mam with children in their arms babies like alphie and children playing on the pavement the women comfort the babies against the cold and scream at the ones playing in case they run into the street and get hit by a motor car or a bicycle there are old men and women huddled
against the wall talking to themselves or not talking at all mam warns us not to wander from her and we wait half an hour for the big door to open a man tells us move inside in proper order and queue up before the platform that mr coffey and mr kane will be there in a minute when they finish their tea in the room beyond a woman complains her children are freezing with the cold and couldnt coffey and kane bloody well hurry up with their tea the man says shes a troublemaker but he wont take her name this time with the cold thats in the morning but if theres another word shell be a sorry woman
mr coffey and mr kane get up on the platform and pay no attention to the people mr kane puts on his glasses takes them off polishes them puts them on looks at the ceiling mr coffey reads papers writes something passes papers to mr kane they whisper to each other they take their time they dont look at us
then mr kane calls the first old man to the platform whats your
name
timothy creagh sir
creagh hah a fine old limerick name you have there
i do sir indeed i do
and what do you want creagh
ah sure i do be havin them pains in me stomach again an id

well now creagh are you sure its not the pints of porter that
are going against your stomach
ah no indeed sir sure i hardly touch the pint at all with the
pains my wife is home in the bed and i have to take care of her too theres great laziness in the world creagh and mr kane says to
the people on the queue did ye hear that ladies great laziness isnt there
and the women say oh there is indeed mr kane great laziness mr creagh gets his docket to see the doctor the queue moves ahead
and mr kane is ready for mam
the public assistance is
tis mr kane
and wheres your husband
oh hes in england but
england is it and where
that what you want woman the relief
is the weekly telegram the big five
pounds
he didnt send us a penny in months mr kane
is that a fact well we know why dont we we know what the men
of ireland are up to in england we know theres the occasional limerickman seen trotting around with a piccadilly tart dont we
he looks out at the people on the queue and they know theyre supposed to say we do mr kane and they know theyre supposed to smile and laugh or things will go hard with them when they reach the platform they know he might turn them over to mr coffey and hes notorious for saying no to everything
mam tells mr kane that dad is in coventry and nowhere near piccadilly and mr kane takes off his glasses and stares at her whats this are we having a little contradiction here
oh no mr kane god no
i want you to know woman that it is the policy here to give no relief to women with husbands in england i want you to know youre
taking the bread from the mouths of more deserving people who stayed in this country to do their bit
oh yes mr kane
and whats your name
mccourt sir
thats not a limerick name where did you get a name like that my husband sir hes from the north
hes from the north and he leaves you here to get the relief from
the irish free state is this what we fought for is it i dont know sir
why dont you go up to belfast and see what the orangemen will do for you ah
i dont know sir
you dont know of course you dont know theres great ignorance in the world
he looks out at the people i said theres great ignorance in the world and the people nod their heads and agree theres great ignorance in the world
he whispers to mr coffey and they look at mam they look at us he tells mam at last that she can have the public assistance but if she gets a single penny from her husband shes to drop all claims and give the money back to the dispensary she promises she will and we leave
we follow her to kathleen oconnells shop to get tea and bread and a few sods of turf for the fire we climb the stairs to italy and get the fire going and its cozy when we have our tea were all very quiet even the baby alphie because we know what mr kane did to our mother

its cold and wet down in ireland but were up in italy mam says we should bring the poor pope up to hang on the wall opposite the window after all hes a friend of the workingman hes italian and theyre a warm weather people mam sits by the fire shivering and we know something is wrong when she makes no move for a cigarette she says she feels a cold coming and shed love to have a tarty drink a lemonade but theres no money in the house not even for bread in the morning she drinks tea and goes to bed
the bed creaks all night with her twistings and turnings and she keeps us awake with her moaning for water in the morning she stays in bed still shivering and we keep quiet if she sleeps long enough malachy and i will be too late for school hours pass and still she makes no move and when i know its well past school time i start the fire for the kettle she stirs and calls for lemonade but i give her a jam jar of water i ask her if shed like some tea and she acts like a woman gone deaf she looks flushed and its odd she doesnt even mention cigarettes
we sit quietly by the fire malachy michael alphie myself we drink our tea while alphie chews the last bit of bread covered with sugar he makes us laugh the way he smears the sugar all over his face and grins at us with his fat sticky cheeks but we cant laugh too much or mam will jump out of the bed and order malachy and me off to school where well be killed for being late we dont laugh long there is no more bread and were hungry the four of us we can get no more credit at
oconnells shop we cant go near grandma either she yells at us all the time because dad is from the north and he never sends money home from england where he is working in a munitions factory grandma says we could starve to death for all he cares that would teach mam a lesson for marrying a man from the north with sallow skin an odd manner and a look of the presbyterian about him
still ill have to try kathleen oconnell once more ill tell her my mother is sick above in the bed my brothers are starving and well all be dead for the want of bread
i put on my shoes and run quickly through the streets of limerick to keep myself warm against the february frost you can look in peoples windows and see how cozy it is in their kitchens with fires glowing or ranges black and hot everything bright in the electric light cups and saucers on the tables with plates of sliced bread pounds of butter jars of jam smells of fried eggs and rashers coming through the windows enough to make the water run in your mouth and families sitting there digging in all smiling the mother crisp and clean in her apron everyone washed and the sacred heart of jesus looking down on them from the wall suffering and sad but still happy with all that food and light and good catholics at their breakfast
i try to find music in my own head but all i can find is my mother moaning for lemonade
lemonade theres a van pulling away from souths pub leaving crates of beer and lemonade outside and there isnt a soul on the street in a second i have two bottles of lemonade up under my jersey and i saunter away trying to look innocent
theres a bread van outside kathleen oconnells shop the back door is open on shelves of steaming newly baked bread the van driver is inside the shop having tea and a bun with kathleen and its no trouble for me to help myself to a loaf of bread its wrong to steal from kathleen with the way shes always good to us but if i go in and ask her for bread shell be annoyed and tell me im ruining her morning cup of tea which shed like to have in peace ease and comfort thank you its easier to stick the bread up under my jersey with the lemonade and promise to tell everything in confession
my brothers are back in bed playing games under the overcoats but they jump when they see the bread we tear at the loaf because were too hungry to slice it and we make tea from this mornings leaves when my mother stirs malachy holds the lemonade bottle to her lips and she gasps till she finishes it if she likes it that much ill have to find more lemonade
we put the last of the coal on the fire and sit around telling stories which we make up the way dad did i tell my brothers about my adventures with the lemonade and bread and i make up stories about how i was chased by pub owners and shopkeepers and how i ran into st josephs church where no one can follow you if youre a criminal not even if you killed your own mother malachy and michael look shocked over the way i got the bread and lemonade but then malachy says it was only what robin hood would have done rob the rich and give to the poor michael says im an outlaw and if they catch me theyll hang me from the highest tree in the peoples park the way outlaws are hanged in films at the lyric cinema malachy says i should make sure im in a state of grace because it might be hard to find a priest to come to my hanging i tell him a priest would have to come to the hanging thats what priests are for
roddy mccorley had a priest and so did kevin barry malachy says there were no priests at the hanging of roddy mccorley and kevin barry because theyre not mentioned in the songs and he starts singing the songs to prove it till my mother groans in the bed and says shut up
alphie the baby is asleep on the floor by the fire we put him into the bed with mam so that hell be warm though we dont want him to catch her disease and die if she wakes up and finds him dead in the bed beside her there will be no end to the lamentations and shell blame me on top of it
the three of us get back into our own bed huddling under the overcoats and trying not to roll into the hole in the mattress its pleasant there till michael starts to worry over alphie getting mams disease and me getting hanged for an outlaw he says it isnt fair because that would leave him with only one brother and everyone in the world has brothers galore he falls asleep from the worry and soon malachy drifts off and i lie there thinking of jam wouldnt it be lovely to have another loaf of bread and a jar of strawberry jam or any kind of jam i cant remember ever seeing a jam van making a delivery and i wouldnt want to be like jesse james blasting my way into a shop demanding jam that would surely lead to a hanging
theres a cold sun coming through the window and im sure it must be warmer outside and wouldnt my brothers be surprised if they woke and found me there with more bread and jam theyd gobble everything and then go on about my sins and the hanging
mam is still asleep though her face is red and theres a strangling sound when she snores
i have to be careful going through the street because its a school day and if guard dennehy sees me hell drag me off to school and mr ohalloran will knock me all over the classroom the guard is in charge of school attendance and he loves chasing you on his bicycle and dragging you off to school by the ear
theres a box sitting outside the door of one of the big houses on barrington street i pretend to knock on the door so that i can see whats in the box a bottle of milk a loaf of bread cheese tomatoes and oh god a jar of marmalade i cant shove all that under my jersey oh god should i take the whole box the people passing by pay me no attention i might as well take the whole box my mother would say you might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb i lift the box and try to look like a messenger boy making a delivery and no one says a word
malachy and michael are beside themselves when they see whats in the box and theyre soon gobbling thick cuts of bread slathered with golden marmalade alphie has the marmalade all over his face and hair and a good bit on his legs and belly we wash down the food with cold tea because we have no fire to heat it
mam mumbles again for lemonade and i give her half the second bottle to keep her quiet she calls for more and i mix it with water to stretch it because i cant be spending my life running around lifting lemonade from pubs were having a fine time of it till mam begins to rave in the bed about her lovely little daughter taken from her and her twin boys gone before they were three and why couldnt god take the rich for a change and is there any lemonade in the house michael wants to know if mam will die and malachy tells him you cant die till a priest comes then michael wonders if well ever have a fire and hot tea again because hes freezing in the bed even with the overcoats left over from
olden times malachy says we should go from house to house asking for turf and coal and wood and we could use alphies pram to carry the load we should take alphie with us because hes small and he smiles and people will see him and feel sorry for him and us we try to wash all the dirt and lint and feathers and sticky marmalade but when we touch him with water he howls michael says hell only get dirty again in the pram so whats the use of washing him michael is small but hes always saying remarkable things like that
we push the pram out to the rich avenues and roads but when we knock on the doors the maids tell us go away or theyll call the proper authorities and its a disgrace to be dragging a baby around in a wreck of a pram that smells to the heavens a filthy contraption that you wouldnt use to haul a pig to the slaughterhouse and this is a catholic country where babies should be cherished and kept alive to hand down the faith from generation to generation malachy tells one maid to kiss his arse and she gives him such a clout the tears leap to his eyes and he says hell never in his life ask the rich for anything again he says theres no use asking anymore that we should go around the backs of the houses and climb over the walls and take what we want michael can ring the front doorbells to keep the maids busy and malachy and i can throw coal and turf over the walls and fill the pram all around alphie
we collect that way from three houses but then malachy throws a piece of coal over a wall and hits alphie and he starts screaming and we have to run forgetting michael still ringing doorbells and getting abuse from maids malachy says we should take the pram home first and then go back for michael we cant stop now with alphie bawling and people giving us dirty looks and telling us were a disgrace to our mother and ireland in general
when were back home it takes a while to dig alphie out from under the load of coal and turf and he wont stop screaming till i give him bread and marmalade im afraid mam will leap from her bed but she only mumbles on about dad and drink and babies dead
malachy is back with michael with stories of his adventures ringing doorbells one rich woman answered the door herself and invited him into the kitchen for cake and milk and bread and jam she asked him all about his family and he told her his father had a big job in england but his mother is in the bed with a desperate disease and calling for lemonade morning noon and night the rich woman wanted to know who was taking care of us and michael bragged we were taking care of ourselves that there was no shortage of bread and marmalade the rich woman wrote down michaels name and address and told him be a good boy and go home to his brothers and his mother in the bed
malachy barks at michael for being such a fool as to tell a rich woman anything shell go now and tell on us and before we know it well have the priests of the world banging on the door and disturbing us
theres the banging on the door already but it isnt a priest its guard dennehy he calls up hello hello is anybody home are you there mrs mccourt
michael knocks on the window and waves at the guard i give him a good kick for himself and malachy thumps him on the head and he yells ill tell the guard ill tell the guard theyre killing me guard theyre thumping and kicking
he wont shut up and guard dennehy shouts at us to open the door i call out the window and tell him i cant open the door because my mother is in bed with a terrible disease
wheres your father
hes in england
well im coming in to talk to your mother
you cant you cant she has the disease we all have the disease
it might be the typhoid it might be the galloping consumption were getting spots already the baby has a lump it could kill
he pushes in the door and climbs the stairs to italy just as alphie crawls out from under the bed covered with marmalade and dirt he looks at him and my mother and us takes off his cap and scratches his head he says jesus mary and joseph this is a desperate situation how did your mother get sick like that
i tell him he shouldnt go near her and when malachy says we might not be able to go to school for ages the guard says well go to school no matter what that were on the earth to go to school the way hes on the earth to make sure we go to school he wants to know if we have any relations and he sends me off to tell grandma and aunt aggie to come to our house
they scream at me and tell me im filthy i try to explain that mam has the disease and im worn out trying to make ends meet keeping the home fires burning getting lemonade for mam and bread for my brothers theres no use telling them about the marmalade for theyll only scream again theres no use telling them about the nastiness of rich people and their maids
they push me all the way back to the lane barking at me and disgracing me on the streets of limerick guard dennehy is still scratching his poll he says look at this a disgrace you wouldnt see the likes of this in bombay or the bowery of new york itself
grandma is wailing at my mother mother o god angela whats up with you in the bed what did they do to you
my mother runs her tongue over her dry lips and gasps for more lemonade
she wants lemonade says michael and we got it for her and bread and marmalade and were all outlaws now frankie was the first outlaw till we went raiding for coal all over limerick
guard dennehy looks interested and takes michael downstairs by the hand and in a few minutes we hear him laughing aunt aggie says thats a disgraceful way to behave with my mother sick in the bed the guard comes back and tells her go for a doctor he keeps covering his face with his cap whenever he looks at me or my brothers desperadoes he says desperadoes
the doctor comes with aunt aggie in his motor car and he has to rush my mother to the hospital with her pneumonia wed all like to go riding in the doctors car but aunt aggie says no ye are all coming to my house till yeer mother comes home from the hospital
i tell her not to bother im eleven and i can easily look after my brothers id be glad to stay at home from school and make sure everyone is fed and washed but grandma screams i will do no such a thing and aunt aggie gives me a thump for myself guard dennehy says im too young yet to be an outlaw and a father but i have a promising future in both departments
get your clothes says aunt aggie ye are coming to my house till yeer mother is out of the hospital jesus above that baby is a disgrace
she finds a rag and ties it around alphies bottom for fear he might shit all over the pram then she looks at us and wants to know why were standing there with our faces hanging out after she told us get our clothes im afraid shell hit me or yell at me when i tell her its all right we have our clothes theyre on us she stares at me and shakes her head here she says put some sugar and water in the childs bottle she tells me i have to push alphie through the streets she cant manage the pram with that bockety wheel that makes it rock back and forth and besides tis a disgraceful looking object shed be ashamed to put a mangy dog in she takes the three old coats from our bed and piles them on the pram till you can hardly see alphie at all
grandma comes with us and barks at me all the way from roden lane to aunt aggies flat in windmill street cant you push that pram properly jesus youre going to kill that child stop goin from side to side or ill give you a good clitther on the gob she wont come into aunt aggies flat she cant stand the sight of us one more minute shes fed up with the whole mccourt clan from the days when she had to send six fares to bring us all back from america dishing out more money for funerals for dead children giving us food every time our father drank the dole or the wages helping angela carry on while that blaguard from the north drinks his wages all over england oh shes fed up so she is and off she goes across henry street with her black shawl pulled up around her white head limping along in her black high laced boots
when youre eleven and your brothers are ten five and one you dont know what to do when you go to someones house even if shes your mothers sister youre told to leave the pram in the hall and bring the baby into the kitchen but if its not your house you dont know what to do once you get into the kitchen for fear the aunt will yell at you or hit you on the skull she takes off her coat and takes it to the bedroom and you stand with the baby in your arms waiting to be told if you take one step forward or one step to the side she might come out and say where are you going and you dont know what to answer because you dont know yourself if you say anything to your brothers she might say who do you think youre talking to in my kitchen we have to stand and be quiet and thats hard when theres a tinkling sound from the bedroom and we know shes on the chamber pot peeing away i dont want to look at malachy if i do ill smile and hell smile and michael will smile and theres danger well start laughing and if we do we wont be able to stop for days at the picture in our heads of aunt aggies big white bum perched on a flowery little chamber pot im able to control myself i wont laugh malachy and michael wont laugh and its easy to see were all proud of ourselves for not laughing and getting into trouble with aunt aggie till alphie in my arms smiles and says goo goo and that sets us off the three of us burst out laughing and alphie grins with his dirty face and says goo goo again till were helpless and aunt aggie roars out of the room pulling her dress down and gives me a thump on the head that sends me against the wall baby and all she hits malachy too and she tries to hit michael but he runs to the other side of her round table and she cant get at him come over here she says and ill wipe that grin off your puss but michael keeps running around the table and shes too fat to catch him ill get you later she says ill warm your arse and you lord muck she says to me put that child down on the floor over there by
the range she puts the old coats from the pram on the floor and alphie lies there with his sugary water and says goo goo and smiles she tells us take off every scrap of our clothes get out to the tap in the backyard and scrub every inch of our bodies we are not to come back into this house till were spotless i want to tell her its the middle of february its freezing outside we could all die but i know if i open my mouth i might die right here on the kitchen floor
were out in the yard naked dousing ourselves with icy water from the tap she opens the kitchen window and throws out a scrub brush and a big bar of brown soap like the one they used on finn the horse she orders us to scrub each others backs and dont stop till she tells us michael says his hands and feet are falling off with the cold but she doesnt care she keeps telling us were still dirty and if she has to come out to scrub us well rue the day another rue i scrub myself harder we all scrub till were pink and our jaws chatter its not enough for aunt aggie she comes out with a bucket and sloshes cold water all over us now she says get inside and dry yeerselves we stand in the little shed next to her kitchen drying ourselves with one towel we stand and shiver and wait because you cant go marching into her kitchen till she tells you we hear her inside starting the fire rattling the poker in the range then yelling at us are ye goin to stand in there all day come in here and put on yeer clothes
she gives us mugs of tea and cuts of fried bread and we sit at the table eating quietly because youre not supposed to say a word unless she tells you michael asks her for a second cut of fried bread and we expect her to knock him off the chair for his cheek but she just grumbles tis far from two cuts of fried bread ye were brought up and gives each of us another cut she tries to feed alphie bread soaked in tea but he wont eat it till she sprinkles it with sugar and when hes finished he smiles and pees all over her lap and were delighted she runs out to the shed to dab at herself with a towel and were able to grin at each other at the table and tell alphie hes the champion baby in the world uncle pa keating comes in the door all black from his job at the gas works oh bejay he says whats this
michael says my mother is in the hospital uncle pa is that so whats up with her
pneumonia says malachy
well now thats better than oldmonia
we dont know what hes laughing at and aunt aggie comes in from the shed and tells him how mam is in the hospital and were to stay with them till she gets out he says grand grand and goes to the shed to wash himself though when he comes back youd never know he touched himself with water at all hes that black
he sits at the table and aunt aggie gives him his supper which is fried bread and ham and sliced tomatoes she tells us get away from the table and stop gawking at him having his tea and tells him to stop giving us bits of ham and tomato he says arrah for jaysus sake aggie the children are hungry and she says tis none of your business theyre not yours she tells us go out and play and be home for bed by halfpast eight we know its freezing outside and wed like to stay in by that warm range but its easier to be in the streets playing than inside with aunt aggie and her nagging
she calls me in later and sends me upstairs to borrow a rubber sheet from a woman who had a child that died the woman says tell your
aunt id like that rubber sheet back for the next child aunt aggie says twelve years ago that child died and she still keeps the rubber sheet fortyfive she is now and if theres another child well have to look for a star in the east malachy says whats that and she tells him mind his own business hes too young
aunt aggie places the rubber sheet on her bed and puts alphie on it between herself and uncle pa she sleeps inside against the wall and uncle pa outside because he has to get up in the morning for work we are to sleep on the floor against the opposite wall with one coat under us and two over she says if she hears a word out of us during the night shell warm our arses and were to be up early in the morning because its ash wednesday and it wouldnt do us any harm to go to mass and pray for our poor mother and her pneumonia
the alarm clock shocks us out of our sleep aunt aggie calls from her bed the three of ye are to get up and go to mass do ye hear me up wash yeer faces and go to the jesuits
her backyard is all frost and ice and our hands sting from the tap water we throw a little on our faces and dry with the towel thats still damp from yesterday malachy whispers our wash was a lick and a promise thats what mam would say
the streets are frosty and icy too but the jesuit church is warm it must be grand to be a jesuit sleeping in a bed with sheets blankets pillows and getting up to a nice warm house and a warm church with nothing to do but say mass hear confessions and yell at people for their sins have your meals served up to you and read your latin office before you go to sleep id like to be a jesuit some day but theres no hope of that when you grow up in a lane jesuits are very particular they dont like poor people they like people with motor cars who stick out their little fingers when they pick up their teacups
the church is crowded with people at seven oclock mass getting the ashes on their foreheads malachy whispers that michael shouldnt get the ashes because he wont be making his first communion till may and it would be a sin michael starts to cry i want the ashes i want the ashes an old woman behind us says what are ye doin to that lovely child malachy explains the lovely child never made his first communion and hes not in a state of grace malachy is getting ready for confirmation himself always showing off his knowledge of the catechism always going on about state of grace he wont admit i knew all about the state of grace a year ago so long ago im starting to forget it the old woman says you dont have to be in a state of grace to get a few ashes on your forehead and tells malachy stop tormenting his poor little brother she pats michael on the head and tells him hes a lovely child and go up there and get your ashes he runs to the altar and when he comes back the woman gives him a penny to go with his ashes
aunt aggie is still in the bed with alphie she tells malachy to fill alphies bottle with milk and bring it to him she tells me to start the fire in the range that theres paper and wood in a box and coal in the coal scuttle if the fire wont start sprinkle it with a little paraffin oil the fire is slow and smoky and i sprinkle it with the paraffin oil it flares up whoosh and nearly takes my eyebrows off there is smoke everywhere and aunt aggie rushes into the kitchen she shoves me away from the range jesus above cant you do anything right youre supposed to open the damper you eejit
i dont know anything about dampers in our house we have a fireplace in ireland downstairs and a fireplace in italy upstairs and no sign of a damper then you go to your aunts house and youre supposed to know all about dampers theres no use telling her this is the first time you ever lit a fire in a range shell just give you another thump on the skull and send you flying its hard to know why grown people get so angry over little things like dampers when im a man i wont go around thumping small children over dampers or anything else now she yells at me look at lord muck standing there would you ever think of opening the window and letting out the smoke of course you wouldnt you have a puss on you like your father from the north do you think now you can boil the water for the tea without burning the house down
she cuts three slices from a loaf smears them with margarine for us and goes back to bed we have the tea and bread and its one morning were glad to go to school where its warm and there are no yelling aunts
after school she tells me sit at the table and write my father a letter about mam in the hospital and how were all at aunt aggies till mam comes home im to tell him were all happy and in the best of health send money food is very dear growing boys eat a lot ha ha alphie the baby needs clothes and nappies
i dont know why shes always angry her flat is warm and dry she has electric light in the house and her own lavatory in the backyard uncle pa has a steady job and he brings home his wages every friday he drinks his pints at souths pub but never comes home singing songs of irelands long woeful history he says a pox on all their houses and he says the funniest thing in the world is that we all have arses that have to be wiped and no man escapes that the minute a politician or a pope starts his blather uncle pa thinks of him wiping his arse hitler and roosevelt and churchill all wipe their arses de valera too he says the only people you can trust in that department are the mahommedans for they eat with one hand and wipe with the other the human hand itself is a sneaky bugger and you never know what its been up to
there are good times with uncle pa when aunt aggie goes to the mechanics institute to play cards fortyfive he says to hell with the begrudgers he gets himself two bottles of stout from souths six buns and a half pound of ham from the shop on the corner he makes tea and we sit by the range drinking it eating our ham sandwiches and buns and laughing over uncle pa and the way he goes on about the world he says i swallowed the gas i drink the pint i dont give a fiddlers fart about the world and its cousin if little alphie gets tired and cranky and cries uncle pa pulls his shirt back from his chest and tells him here have a suck of diddy momma the sight of that flat chest and the nipple shocks alphie and makes him good again
before aunt aggie comes home we have to wash the mugs and clean up so she wont know we were stuffing ourselves with buns and ham sandwiches shed nag uncle pa for a month if she ever found out and thats what i dont understand why does he let her nag him like that he went to the great war he was gassed hes big he has a job he makes the world laugh its a mystery thats what the priests and the masters tell you everything is a mystery and you have to believe what youre told
i could easily have uncle pa for a father wed have great times sitting by the fire in the range drinking tea and laughing over the way he farts and says light a match thats a present from the germans
aunt aggie torments me all the time she calls me scabby eyes she says im the spitting image of my father i have the odd manner i have the sneaky air of a northern presbyterian ill probably grow up and build an altar to oliver cromwell himself ill run off and marry an english tart and cover my house with pictures of the royal family
i want to get away from her and i can think of only one way to make myself sick and go to the hospital i get up in the middle of the night and go to her backyard i can pretend im going to the lavatory i stand out in the open in the freezing weather and hope ill catch pneumonia or the galloping consumption so that ill go to the hospital with the nice clean sheets and the meals in the bed and books brought by the girl in the blue dress i might meet another patricia madigan and learn a long poem i stand in the backyard for ages in my shirt and bare feet looking up at the moon which is a ghostly galleon riding upon cloudy seas and go back to bed shivering hoping ill wake up in the morning with a terrible cough and flushed cheeks but i dont i feel fresh and lively and id be in great form if i could be at home with my mother and brothers
there are days when aunt aggie tells us she cant stand the sight of us another minute get away from me here scabby eyes take alphie out in his pram take your brothers go to the park and play do anything ye like and dont come back till teatime when the angelus is ringing not a minute later do ye hear me not a minute later its cold but we dont care we push the pram up oconnell avenue out to ballinacurra or the rosbrien road we let alphie crawl around in fields to look at cows and sheep and we laugh when the cows nuzzle him i get under the cows and squirt the milk into alphies mouth till hes full and throws it up farmers chase us till they see how small michael and alphie are malachy laughs at the farmers he says hit me now with the child in me arms then he has a great notion why cant we go to our own house and play a while we find twigs and bits of wood in the fields and rush to roden lane there are matches by the fireplace in italy and we have a good fire going in no time alphie falls asleep and soon the rest of us drift off till the angelus booms out of the redemptorist church and we know were in trouble with aunt aggie for being late
we dont care she can yell at us all she wants but we had a grand time out the country with the cows and the sheep and then the lovely fire above in italy
you can tell she never has grand times like that electric light and a lavatory but no grand times
grandma comes for her on thursdays and sundays and they take the bus to the hospital to see mam we cant go because children are not allowed and if we say hows mam they look cranky and tell us shes all right shell live wed like to know when shes getting out of hospital so that we can all go back home but were afraid to open our mouths
malachy tells aunt aggie one day hes hungry and could he have a piece of bread she hits him with a rolled up little messenger of the sacred heart and there are tears on his eyelashes he doesnt come home from school the next day and hes still gone at bedtime aunt aggie says well i suppose he ran away good riddance if he was hungry hed be here let him find comfort in a ditch
next day michael runs in from the street dads here dads here and runs back out and theres dad sitting on the hall floor hugging michael crying your poor mother your poor mother and theres a smell of drink on him aunt aggie is smiling oh youre here and she makes tea and eggs and sausages she sends me out for a bottle of stout for dad and i wonder why shes so pleasant and generous all of a sudden michael says are we going to our own house dad
we are son
alphie is back in the pram with the three old coats and coal and wood for the fire aunt aggie stands at her door and tells us be good boys come back for tea anytime and theres a bad word for her in my head oul bitch its in my head and i cant help it and ill have to tell the priest in confession
malachy isnt in a ditch hes there in our own house eating fish and chips a drunken soldier dropped at the gate of the sarsfield barracks
mam comes home in two days shes weak and white and walks slowly she says the doctor told me keep warm have plenty of rest and nourishing food meat and eggs three times a week god help us those poor doctors dont have a notion of not having dad makes tea and toasts bread for her on the fire he fries bread for the rest of us and we have a lovely night up in italy where its warm he says he cant stay forever he has to go back to work in coventry mam wonders how hell get to coventry without a penny in his pocket hes up early on holy saturday and i have tea with him by the fire he fries four cuts of bread and wraps them in pages of the limerick chronicle two cuts in each coat pocket mam is still in bed and he calls to her from the bottom of the stairs im going now she says all right write when you land my father is going to england and she wont even get out of the bed i ask if i can go with him to the railway station no hes not going there hes going to the dublin road to see if he can get a lift he pats my head tells me take care of my mother and brothers and goes out the door i watch him go up the lane till he turns the corner i run up the lane to see him go down barrack hill and down st josephs street i run down the hill and follow him as far as i can he must know im following him because he turns and calls to me go home francis go home to your mother
in a week theres a letter to say he arrived safely that we are to be good boys attend to our religious duties and above all obey our mother in another week theres a telegram money order for three pounds and were in heaven well be rich there will be fish and chips jelly and custard films every saturday at the lyric the coliseum the carlton the atheneum the central and the fanciest of all the savoy we might even wind up having tea and cakes at the savoy cafÃ© with the nobs and toffs of limerick well be sure to hold our teacups with our little fingers sticking out
the next saturday theres no telegram nor the saturday after nor any saturday forever mam begs again at the st vincent de paul society and smiles at the dispensary when mr coffey and mr kane have their bit of a joke about dad having a tart in piccadilly michael wants to know what a tart is and she tells him its something you have with tea she spends most of the day by the fire with bridey hannon puffing on her woodlbines drinking weak tea the bread crumbs from the morning are always on the table when we come home from school she never washes the
jam jars or mugs and there are flies in the sugar and wherever there is sweetness
she says malachy and i have to take turns looking after alphie taking him out in the pram for a bit of fresh air the child cant be kept in italy from october to april if we tell her we want to play with our pals she might let fly with a right cross to the head that stings the ears
we play games with alphie and the pram i stand at the top of barrack hill and malachy is at the bottom when i give the pram a push down the hill malachy is supposed to stop it but hes looking at a pal on roller skates and it speeds by him across the street and through the doors of lenistons pub where men are having a peaceful pint and not expecting a pram with a dirty faced child saying goo goo goo goo the barman shouts this is a disgrace there must be a law against this class of behavior babies roaring through the door in bockety prams hell call the guards on us and alphie waves at him and smiles and he says all right all right the child can have a sweet and a lemonade the brothers can have lemonade too that raggedy pair and god above tis a hard world the minute you think youre getting ahead a pram comes crashing through the door and youre dishing out sweets and lemonade right and left the two of ye take that child and go home to yeer mother
malachy has another powerful idea that we could go around limerick like tinkers pushing alphie in his pram into pubs for the sweets and lemonade but i dont want mam finding out and hitting me with her right cross malachy says im not a sport and runs off i push the pram over to henry street and up by the redemptorist church its a gray day the church is gray and the small crowd of people outside the door of the priests house is gray theyre waiting to beg for any food left over from the priests dinner
there in the middle of the crowd in her dirty gray coat is my mother
this is my own mother begging this is worse than the dole the st vincent de paul society the dispensary its the worst kind of shame almost as bad as begging on the streets where the tinkers hold up their scabby children give us a penny for the poor child mister the poor child is hungry missus
my mother is a beggar now and if anyone from the lane or my school sees her the family will be disgraced entirely my pals will make up new names and torment me in the schoolyard and i know what theyll say frankie mccourt beggar womans boy scabbyeyed dancing blubbergob jap
the door of the priests house swings open and the people rush with their hands out i can hear them brother brother here brother ah for the love o god brother five children at home brother i can see my own mother pushed along i can see the tightness of her mouth when she snatches at a bag and turns from the door and i push the pram up the street before she can see me
i dont want to go home anymore i push the pram down to the dock road out to corkanree where all the dust and garbage of limerick is dumped and burned i stand a while and look at boys chase rats i dont know why they have to torture rats that are not in their houses id keep going on into the country forever if i didnt have alphie bawling with the hunger kicking his chubby legs waving his empty bottle
mam has the fire going and something boiling in a pot malachy smiles and says she brought home corned beef and a few spuds from
kathleen oconnells shop he wouldnt be so happy if he knew he was the son of a beggar she calls us in from the lane and when we sit at the table its hard for me to look at my mother the beggar she lifts the pot to the table spoons out the potatoes one each and uses a fork to lift out the corned beef
it isnt corned beef at all its a great lump of quivering gray fat and the only sign of corned beef is a little nipple of red meat on top we stare at that bit of meat and wonder who will get it mam says thats for alphie hes a baby hes growing fast he needs it she puts it on a saucer in front of him he pushes it away with his finger then pulls it back he lifts it to his mouth looks around the kitchen sees lucky the dog and throws it to him
theres no use saying anything the meat is gone we eat our potatoes with plenty of salt and i eat my fat and pretend its that nipple of red meat

mam warns us ye are to keep yeer paws out of that trunk for theres nothing in there thats of the slightest interest or any of yeer business
all she has in that trunk is a lot of papers certificates of birth and baptism her irish passport dads english passport from belfast our american passports and her bright red flapper dress with spangles and black frills she brought all the way from america she wants to keep that dress forever to remind herself she was young and dancing
i dont care what she has in the trunk till i start a football team with billy campbell and malachy we cant afford uniforms or boots and billy says how will the world know who we are we dont even have a name
i remember the red dress and a name comes to me the red hearts of limerick mam never opens the trunk so what does it matter if i cut off a piece of the dress to make seven red hearts we can stick on our chests what you dont know wont bother you she always says herself
the dress is buried under the papers i look at my passport picture when i was small and i can see why they call me jap theres a paper that says marriage certificate that malachy mccourt and angela sheehan were joined in holy matrimony on the twentyeighth of march 1930 how could that be i was born on the nineteenth of august and billy campbell told me the father and mother have to be married nine months before theres a sign of a child here i am born into the world in half the time that means i must be a miracle and i might grow up to be a saint with people celebrating the feast of st francis of limerick
ill have to ask mikey molloy still the expert on girls bodies and dirty things in general
billy says if were to be great soccer players we have to practice and were to meet over in the park the boys complain when i hand out the hearts and i tell them if they dont like it they can go home and cut up their own mothers dresses and blouses
we have no money for a proper ball so one of the boys brings a sheeps bladder stuffed with rags we kick the bladder up and down the meadow till there are holes and rags start falling out and we get fed up
kicking a bladder thats hardly there anymore billy says were to meet tomorrow morning which is saturday and go out ballinacurra to see if we can challenge rich crescent college boys to a proper game seven a side he says were to pin our red hearts to our shirts even if theyre red rags
malachy is going home for tea but i cant go because i have to see mikey molloy and find out why i was born in half the time mikey is coming out of his house with his father peter its mikeys sixteenth birthday and his father is taking him to bowless pub for his first pint nora molloy is inside screeching after peter that if they go they can stay gone shes done baking bread shes never going to the lunatic asylum again if he brings that child home drunk shell go to scotland and disappear from the face of the earth
peter tells mikey pay no attention to her cyclops the mothers of ireland are always enemies of the first pint my own mother tried to kill my father with a frying pan when he took me for the first pint
mikey asks peter if i can come with them and have a lemonade
peter tells everyone in the pub that mikey is there for his first pint and when all the men want to stand mikey a pint peter says ah no twould be a terrible thing if he had too much and turned against it entirely
the pints are drawn and we sit against the wall the molloys with their pints and i with my lemonade the men wish mikey all the best in the life to come and wasnt it a gift from god that he fell off that spout years ago and never had the fit since and wasnt it a great pity about that poor little bugger quasimodo dooley carried off with the consumption after all his trouble talking for years like an englishman so he could be on the bbc which is no fit place for an irishman anyway
peter is talking to the men and mikey sipping his first pint whispers to me i dont think i like it but dont tell my father then he tells me how he practices the english accent in secret so that he can be a bbc announcer quasimodos dream he tells me i can have cuchulain back that hes no use to you when youre reading the news on the bbc now that hes sixteen he wants to go to england and if ever i get a wireless that will be him on the bbc home service
i tell him about the marriage certificate how billy campbell said it has to be nine months but i was born in half the time and would he know if i was some class of a miracle
naw he says naw youre a bastard youre doomed
you dont have to be cursing me mikey
im not thats what they call people who arent born inside the
nine months of the marriage people conceived beyond the blanket whats that
whats what
conceived
thats when the sperm hits the egg and it grows and there you are
nine months later
i dont know what youre talking about
he whispers the thing between your legs is the excitement i dont
like the other names the dong the prick the dick the langer so your father shoves his excitement into your mother and theres a spurt and these little germs go up into your mother where theres an egg and that grows into you
im not an egg
you are an egg everyone was an egg once
why am i doomed tisnt my fault im a bastard
all bastards are doomed theyre like babies that werent baptized
theyre sent to limbo for eternity and theres no way out and its not their fault it makes you wonder about god up there on his throne with no mercy for the little unbaptized babies thats why i dont go near the chapel anymore anyway youre doomed your father and mother had the excitement and they werent married so youre not in a state of grace
what am i going to do
nothing youre doomed
cant i light a candle or something
you could try the blessed virgin shes in charge of the doom
but i dont have a penny for the candle
all right all right heres a penny you can give it back when you
get a job a million years from now tis costing me a fortune to be the expert on girls bodies and dirty things in general

a pennorth of cleeves toffee doesnt last forever and when its gone i have to think of going home to a mother who let my father push his
excitement into her so that i could be born in half the time and grow up to be a bastard if she ever says a word about the red dress or anything ill tell her i know all about the excitement and shell be shocked
saturday morning i meet the red hearts of limerick and we wander out the road looking for a football challenge the boys are still grousing that the bits of red dress dont look like hearts till billy tells them if they dont want to play football go home and play with their sisters dolls
there are boys playing football in a field in ballinacurra and billy challenges them they have eight players and we have only seven but we dont mind because one of them has one eye and billy tells us stay on his blind side besides he says frankie mccourt is nearly blind with his two bad eyes and thats worse theyre all togged out in blue and white jerseys and white shorts and proper football boots one of them says we look like something the cat brought in and malachy has to be held back from fighting them we agree to play half an hour because the ballinacurra boys say they have to go to lunch lunch the whole world has dinner in the middle of the day but they have lunch if no one scores in half an hour its a draw we play back and forth till billy gets the ball and goes speeding and dancing up the sideline so fast no one can catch him and in goes the ball for a goal the half hour is nearly up but the ballinacurra boys want another half hour and they manage to score well into the second half hour then the ball goes over the line for touch its our ball billy stands on the touch line with the ball over his head he pretends to look at malachy but throws the ball to me it comes to me as if its the only thing that exists in the whole world it comes straight to my foot and all i have to do is swivel to the left and swing that ball straight into the goal theres a whiteness in my head and i feel like a boy in heaven im floating over the whole field till the red hearts of limerick clap me on the back and tell me that was a great goal frankie you too billy
we walk back along oconnell avenue and i keep thinking of the way the ball came to my foot and surely it was sent by god or the blessed virgin mary who would never send such a blessing to one doomed for being born in half the time and i know as long as i live ill never forget that ball coming from billy campbell that goal
mam meets bridey hannon and her mother going up the lane and they tell her about mr hannons poor legs poor john its a trial for him to cycle home every night after delivering coal and turf all day on the great float for the coal merchants on the dock road hes paid from eight in the morning till half five in the evening though he has to get the horse ready well before eight and settle him for the night well after half five hes up and down on that float all day hoisting bags of coal and turf desperate to keep the bandages in place on his legs so the dirt wont get into the open sores the bandages are forever sticking and have to be ripped away and when he comes home she washes the sores with warm water and soap covers them with ointment and wraps them in clean bandages they cant afford new bandages every day so she keeps washing the old ones over and over till theyre gray
mam says mr hannon should see the doctor and mrs hannon says sure he seen the doctor a dozen times and the doctor says he has to stay off them legs thats all stay off them legs sure how can he stay off them legs he has to work what would we live on if he didnt work
mam says maybe bridey could get some kind of a job herself and bridey is offended dont you know i have a weak chest angela dont you know i had rheumatic fever an i could go at any time i have to be careful
mam often talks about bridey and her rheumatic fever and weak chest she says that one is able to sit here by the hour and complain about her ailments but it doesnt stop her from puffing away on the woodbines
mam tells bridey shes very sorry over the weak chest and its terrible the way her father suffers mrs hannon tells my mother that john is getting worse every day and what would you think mrs mccourt if your boy frankie went on the float with him a few hours a week and helped him with the bags we can barely afford it but frankie could earn a shilling or two and john could rest his poor legs
mam says i dont know hes only eleven and he had that typhoid and the coal dust wouldnt be good for his eyes
bridey says hed be out in the air and theres nothing like fresh air for someone with bad eyes or getting over the typhoid isnt that right frankie
tis bridey
im dying to go around with mr hannon on the great float like a real workingman if im good at it they might let me stay at home from school forever but mam says he can do it as long as it doesnt interfere with school and he can start on a saturday morning
im a man now so i light the fire early on saturday morning and make my own tea and fried bread i wait next door for mr hannon to come out with his bicycle and theres a lovely smell of rashers and eggs coming through the window mam says mr hannon gets the best of food because mrs hannon is as mad about him as she was the day she married him theyre like two lovers out of an american film the way they go on here he is pushing the bicycle and puffing away on the pipe in his mouth he tells me climb up on the bar of his bike and off we go to my first job as a man his head is over mine on the bike and the smell of the pipe is lovely theres a coal smell on his clothes and that makes me sneeze
men are walking or cycling toward the coal yards and ranks flour mills and the limerick steamship company on the dock road mr hannon takes his pipe from his mouth and tells me this is the best morning of all saturday half day well start at eight and be finished by the time the angelus rings at twelve
first we get the horse ready give him a bit of a rub fill the wooden tub with oats and the bucket with water mr hannon shows me how to put on the harness and lets me back the horse into the shafts of the float he says jaysus frankie you have the knack of it
that makes me so happy i want to jump up and down and drive a float the rest of my life
there are two men filling bags with coal and turf and weighing them on the great iron scale a hundredweight in each bag its their job to stack the bags on the float while mr hannon goes to the office for the delivery dockets the bag men are fast and were ready for our rounds mr hannon sits up on the left side of the float and flicks the whip to show where im to sit on the right side its hard to climb up the way the float is so high and packed with bags and i try to get up by climbing the wheel mr hannon says i should never do the likes of that again never put your leg or hand near a wheel when the horse is harnessed in
the shafts a horse might take a notion to go for a walk for himself and there you are with the leg or the arm caught in the wheel and twisted off your body and you looking at it he says to the horse gup ower that and the horse shakes his head and rattles the harness and mr hannon laughs that fool of a horse loves to work he says he wont be rattling his harness in a few hours
when the rain starts we cover ourselves with old coal bags and mr hannon turns his pipe upside down in his mouth to keep the tobacco dry he says the rain makes everything heavier but whats the use of complaining you might as well complain about the sun in africa
we cross the sarsfield bridge for deliveries to the ennis road and the north circular road rich people says mr hannon and very slow to put their hands in their pockets for a tip
we have sixteen bags to deliver mr hannon says were lucky today because some houses get more than one and he doesnt have to be climbing on and off that float destroying his legs when we stop he gets down and i pull the bag to the edge and lay it on his shoulders some houses have areas outside where you pull up a trap door and tip the bag till it empties and thats easy there are other houses with long backyards and you can see mr hannon suffering with his legs when he has to carry the bags from the float to the sheds near the back doors ah jaysus frankie ah jaysus is the only complaint out of him and he asks me to give him a hand to climb back on the float he says if he had a handcart he could wheel the bags from float to house and that would be a blessing but a handcart would cost two weeks wages and who could afford that
the bags are delivered and the sun is out the float is empty and the horse knows his workday is over its lovely to sit on the float looking along the length of the horse from his tail to his head rocking along the ennis road over the shannon and up the dock road mr hannon says the man who delivered sixteen hundredweights of coal and turf deserves a pint and the boy who helped him deserves a lemonade he tells me i should go to school and not be like him working away with the two legs rotting under him go to school frankie and get out of limerick and ireland itself this war will be over some day and you can go to america or australia or any big open country where you can look up and see no end to the land the world is wide and you can have great adventures if i didnt have these two legs id be over in england making a fortune in the factories like the rest of the irishmen like your father no not like your father i hear he left you high and dry eh i dont know how a man in his right mind can go off and leave a wife and family to starve and shiver in a limerick winter school frankie school the books the books the books get out of limerick before your legs rot and your mind collapses entirely
the horse clops along and when we get to the coal yard we feed and water him and give him a rubdown mr hannon talks to him all the time and calls him me oul segosha and the horse snuffles and pushes his nose against mr hannons chest id love to bring this horse home and let him stay downstairs when were up in italy but even if i could get him in the door my mother would yell at me that the last thing we need in this house is a horse
the streets going up from the dock road are too hilly for mr hannon to ride the bicycle and carry me so we walk his legs are sore from the day and it takes a long time to get up to henry street he leans
on the bicycle or sits on the steps outside houses grinding down on the pipe in his mouth
im wondering when ill get the money for the days work because mam might let me go to the lyric cinema if i get home in time with my shilling or whatever mr hannon gives me now were at the door of souths pub and he tells me come in didnt he promise me a lemonade
uncle pa keating is sitting in the pub hes all black as usual and hes sitting next to bill galvin all white as usual snuffling and taking great slugs out of his black pint mr hannon says howre you and sits on the other side of bill galvin and everyone in the pub laughs jaysus says the barman look at that two lumps of coal and a snowball men come in from other parts of the pub to see the two coal black men with the lime white man in the middle and they want to send down to the limerick leader for a man with a camera
uncle pa says what are you doing all black yourself frankie did you fall down a coal mine
i was helping mr hannon on the float
your eyes look atrocious frankie piss holes in the snow tis the coal dust uncle pa
wash them when you go home
i will uncle pa
mr hannon buys me a lemonade gives me the shilling for my
mornings work and tells me i can go home now im a great worker and i can help him again next week after school
on the way home i see myself in the glass of a shop window all black from the coal and i feel like a man a man with a shilling in his pocket a man who had a lemonade in a pub with two coal men and a lime man im not a child anymore and i could easily leave leamys school forever i could work with mr hannon every day and when his legs got too bad i could take over the float and deliver coal to the rich people the rest of my life and my mother wouldnt have to be a beggar at the redemptorist priests house
people on the streets and lanes give me curious looks boys and girls laugh and call out heres the chimney sweep how much do you want for cleaning our chimney did you fall into a coal hole were you burned by the darkness
theyre ignorant they dont know i spent the day delivering hundredweights of coal and turf they dont know im a man
mam is sleeping up in italy with alphie and theres a coat over the window to keep the room dark i tell her i earned a shilling and she says i can go to the lyric i deserve it take tuppence and leave the rest of the shilling on the mantelpiece downstairs so that she can send out for a loaf of bread for the tea the coat suddenly drops from the window and the room is bright mam looks at me god above look at your eyes go downstairs and ill be down in a minute to wash them
she heats water in the kettle and dabs at my eyes with boric acid powder and tells me i cant go to the lyric cinema today or any day till my eyes clear up though god knows when that will be she says you cant be delivering coal with the state of your eyes the dust will surely destroy them
i want the job i want to bring home the shilling i want to be a man
you can be a man without bringing home a shilling go upstairs and lie down and rest your two eyes or its a blind man youll be
i want that job i wash my eyes three times a day with the boric acid powder i remember seamus in the hospital and how his uncles eyes were cured with the blink exercise and i make sure to sit and blink for an hour every day you cant beat the blink for the strong eye he said and now i blink and blink till malachy runs to my mother talking out in the lane with mrs hannon mam something is up with frankie hes upstairs blinking and blinking
she comes running up whats wrong with you im making my eyes strong with the exercise what exercise
the blinking
blinking is not exercise
seamus in the hospital says you cant beat the blink for the strong eye his uncle had powerful eyes from the blinking she says im getting odd and goes back to the lane and her chat with mrs hannon and i blink and bathe my eyes with the boric acid powder in warm water i can hear mrs hannon through the window your little frankie is a godsend to john for tis the climbing up and down on that float that was ruining his legs entirely
mam doesnt say anything and that means she feels so sorry for mr hannon shell let me help him again on his heavy delivery day thursday i wash my eyes three times a day and i blink till i get a pain in my eyebrows i blink in school when the master isnt looking and all the boys in my class are calling me blinky and adding that to the list of names
blinky mccourt beggar womans son scabbyeyed blubber gob dancing
jap
i dont care what they call me anymore as long as my eyes are
clearing up and i have a regular job lifting hundredweights of coal on a float i wish they could see me on thursday after school when im on the float and mr hannon hands me the reins so that he can smoke his pipe in comfort here you are frankie nice and gentle for this is a good horse and he doesnt need to be pulled at
he hands me the whip too but you never need the whip with this horse its all for show and i just flick it at the air like mr hannon or i might knock a fly off the horses great golden rump swinging between the shafts
surely the world is looking at me and admiring the way i rock with the float the cool way i have with the reins and the whip i wish i had a pipe like mr hannon and a tweed cap i wish i could be a real coal man with black skin like mr hannon and uncle pa keating so that people would say there goes frankie mccourt that delivers all the coal in limerick and drinks his pint in souths pub id never wash my face id be black every day of the year even christmas when youre supposed to give yourself a good wash for the coming of the infant jesus i know he wouldnt mind because i saw the three wise men in the christmas crib at the redemptorist church and one of them was blacker than uncle pa keating the blackest man in limerick and if a wise man is black it means that everywhere you go in the world someone is delivering coal
the horse lifts his tail and great lumps of steaming yellow shit drop from his behind i start to pull on the reins so that he can stop and have a bit of comfort for himself but mr hannon says no frankie let him trot they always shit on the trot thats one of the blessings horses have they shit on the trot and theyre not dirty and stinking
like the human race not at all frankie the worst thing in the world is to go into a lavatory after a man that had a feed of pigs feet and a night of pints the stink from that could twist the nostrils of a strong man horses are different all they have is oats and hay and what they drop is clean and natural
i work with mr hannon after school on tuesdays and thursdays and the half day on saturday morning and that means three shillings for my mother though she worries all the time over my eyes the minute i get home she washes them and makes me rest them for half an hour
mr hannon says hell wait near leamys school for me on thursdays after his deliveries on barrington street now the boys will see me now theyll know im a workingman and more than a scabbyeyed blubber gob dancing jap mr hannon says up you get and i climb up on the float like any workingman i look at the boys gawking at me gawking i tell mr hannon if he wants to smoke his pipe in comfort ill take the reins and when he hands them over im sure i hear the boys gasping i tell the horse gup ower that like mr hannon we trot away and i know dozens of leamys boys are committing the deadly sin of envy i tell the horse again gup ower that to make sure everyone heard to make sure they know im driving that float and no one else to make sure theyll never forget it was me they saw on that float with the reins and the whip its the best day of my life better than my first communion day which grandma ruined better than my confirmation day when i had the typhoid
they dont call me names anymore they dont laugh at my scabby eyes they want to know how i got such a good job at eleven years of age and what im paid and if ill have that job forever they want to know if there are any other good jobs going in the coal yards and would i put in a good word for them
then there are big boys of thirteen who stick their faces in mine and say they should have that job because theyre bigger and im nothing but a scrawny little runt with no shoulders they can talk as much as they like i have the job and mr hannon tells me im powerful
there are days his legs are so bad he can hardly walk at all and you can see mrs hannon worries she gives me a mug of tea and i watch her roll up his trouser legs and peel away the dirty bandages the sores are red and yellow and clogged with coal dust she washes them with soapy water and smears them with a yellow ointment she props the legs up on a chair and thats where he stays the rest of the night reading the paper or a book from the shelf above his head
the legs are getting so bad he has to get up an hour earlier in the morning to get the stiffness out to put on another dressing its still dark one saturday morning when mrs hannon knocks at our door and asks me if id go to a neighbor and borrow their handcart to take on the float for mr hannon will never be able to carry the bags today and maybe id just roll them on the handcart for him he wont be able to carry me on his bicycle so i can meet him at the yard with the handcart
the neighbor says anything for mr hannon god bless him
i wait at the gate of the coal yard and watch him cycle toward me slower than ever hes so stiff he can hardly get off the bike and he says youre a great man frankie he lets me get the horse ready though i still have trouble getting on the harness he lets me handle the float out of the yard and into the frosty streets and i wish i could drive forever and never go home mr hannon shows me how to pull the bags to the edge of the float and drop them on the ground so that i can pull them
on to the handcart and push them to the houses he tells me how to lift and push the bags without straining myself and we have the sixteen bags delivered by noon
i wish the boys at leamys could see me now the way i drive the horse and handle the bags the way i do everything while mr hannon rests his legs i wish they could see me pushing the handcart to souths pub and having my lemonade with mr hannon and uncle pa and me all black and bill galvin all white id like to show the world the tips mr hannon lets me keep four shillings and the shilling he gives me for the mornings work five shillings altogether
mam is sitting by the fire and when i hand her the money she looks at me drops it in her lap and cries im puzzled because money is supposed to make you happy look at your eyes she says go to that glass and look at your eyes
my face is black and the eyes are worse than ever the whites and the eyelids are red and the yellow stuff oozes to the corners and out over the lower lids if the ooze sits a while it forms a crust that has to be picked off or washed away
mam says thats the end of it no more mr hannon i try to explain that mr hannon needs me he can barely walk anymore i had to do everything this morning drive the float wheel the handcart with the bags sit in the pub drink lemonade listen to the men discussing who is the best rommel or montgomery
she says shes sorry for mr hannons troubles but we have troubles of our own and the last thing she needs now is a blind son stumbling through the streets of limerick bad enough you nearly died of typhoid now you want to go blind on top of it
and i cant stop crying now because this was my one chance to be a man and bring home the money the telegram boy never brought from my father i cant stop crying because i dont know what mr hannon is going to do on monday morning when he has no one to help him pull the bags to the edge of the float to push the bags into the houses i cant stop crying because of the way he is with that horse he calls sweet because hes so gentle himself and what will the horse do if mr hannon isnt there to take him out if im not there to take him out will that horse fall down hungry for the want of oats and hay and the odd apple
mam says i shouldnt be crying its bad for the eyes she says well see thats all i can tell you now well see
she washes my eyes and gives me sixpence to take malachy to the lyric to see boris karloff in the man they could not hang and have two pieces of cleeves toffee its hard to see the screen with the yellow stuff oozing from my eyes and malachy has to tell me whats happening people around us tell him shut up theyd like to hear what boris karloff is saying and when malachy talks back to them and tells them hes only helping his blind brother they call the man in charge frank goggin and he says if he hears another word out of malachy hell throw the two of us out
i dont mind i have a way of squeezing the stuff out of one eye and clearing it so that i can see the screen while the other eye fills up and i go back and forth squeeze look squeeze look and everything i see is yellow
monday morning mrs hannon is knocking on our door again she asks mam if frank would ever go down to the coal yard and tell the man in the office that mr hannon cant come in today that he has to see a doctor
about his legs that hell surely be in tomorrow and what he cant deliver today he will tomorrow mrs hannon always calls me frank now anyone that delivers hundredweights of coal is not a frankie
the man in the office says humph i think were very tolerant with hannon you whats your name
mccourt sir
tell hannon well need a note from the doctor do you understand
that
i do sir
the doctor tells mr hannon he has to go to the hospital or its a case of gangrene hell have and the doctor wont be responsible the ambulance takes mr hannon away and my big job is gone now ill be white like everyone else in leamys no float no horse no shillings to bring home to my mother
in a few days bridey hannon comes to our door she says her mother would like me to come and see her have a cup of tea with her mrs hannon is sitting by the fire with her hand on the seat of mr hannons chair sit down frank she says and when i go to sit on one of the ordinary kitchen chairs she says no sit here sit here on the chair of himself do you know how old he is frank
oh he must be very old mrs hannon he must be thirtyfive
she smiles she has lovely teeth hes fortynine frank and a man that age shouldnt have legs like that
he shouldnt mrs hannon

i didnt mrs hannon
you were we had two daughters bridey that you know and kathleen

i feel my eyes burning and i dont want her to see me crying especially when i dont know why im crying thats all i do lately is it the job is it mr hannon my mother says oh your bladder is near your eye
i think im crying because of the quiet way mrs hannon is talking and shes talking like that because of mr hannon
like a son she says and im glad he had that feeling his working days are over you know he has to stay at home from this out there might be a cure and if there is sure he might be able to get a job as a watchman where he doesnt have to be lifting and hauling
i wont have a job anymore mrs hannon

thats not a job mrs hannon
youll never have another job like it frank it breaks mr
hannons heart to think of you dragging bags of coal off a float and it breaks your mothers heart and twill destroy your eyes god knows im sorry i ever got you into this for it had your poor mother caught between your eyes and mr hannons legs

theres a letter from dad hes coming home two days before christmas he says everything will be different hes a new man he hopes were good boys obeying our mother attending to our religious duties and hes bringing us all something for christmas
mam takes me to the railway station to meet him the station is always exciting with all the coming and going people leaning from carriages crying smiling waving goodbye the train hooting and calling chugging away in clouds of steam people sniffling on the platform the railway tracks silvering into the distance on to dublin and the world beyond
now its near midnight and cold on the empty platform a man in a railway cap asks us if wed like to wait in a warm place mam says thank you very much and laughs when he leads us to the end of the platform where we have to climb a ladder to the signal tower it takes her a while because shes heavy and she keeps saying oh god oh god
were above the world and its dark in the signal tower except for the lights that blink red and green and yellow when the man bends over the board he says im just having a bit of supper and youre welcome
mam says ah no thanks we couldnt take your supper from you
he says the wife always makes too much for me and if i was up in this tower for a week i wouldnt be able to eat it sure its not hard work looking at lights and pulling on the odd lever
he takes the top off a flask and pours cocoa into a mug here he says to me put yourself outside that cocoa
he hands mam half a sandwich ah no she says surely you could take that home to your children
i have two sons missus and theyre off there fighting in the forces of his majesty the king of england one did his bit with montgomery in africa and the other is over in burma or some other bloody place excuse the language we get our freedom from england and then we fight her wars so here missus take the bit of sandwich
lights on the board are clicking and the man says your train is coming missus
thank you very much and happy christmas
happy christmas to yourself missus and a happy new year too mind yourself on that ladder young fella help your mother
thank you very much sir
we wait again on the platform while the train rumbles into the station carriage doors open and a few men with suitcases step to the platform and hurry toward the gate there is a clanking of milk cans dropped to the platform a man and two boys are unloading newspapers and magazines
there is no sign of my father mam says he might be asleep in one of the carriages but we know he hardly sleeps even in his own bed she says the boat from holyhead might have been late and that would make him miss the train the irish sea is desperate at this time of the year
hes not coming mam he doesnt care about us hes just drunk over there in england
dont talk about your father like that
i say no more to her i dont tell her i wish i had a father like the man in the signal tower who gives you sandwiches and cocoa
next day dad walks in the door his top teeth are missing and theres a bruise under his left eye he says the irish sea was rough and when he leaned over the side his teeth dropped out mam says it wouldnt be the drink would it it wouldnt be a fight
och no angela
michael says you said youd have something for us dad
oh i do
he takes a box of chocolates from his suitcase and hands it to mam
she opens the box and shows us the inside where half the chocolates are
gone
could you spare it she says
she shuts the box and puts it on the mantelpiece well have
chocolates after our christmas dinner tomorrow
mam asks him if he brought any money he tells her times are hard
jobs are scarce and she says is it coddin me you are theres a war on and theres nothing but jobs in england you drank the money didnt you
you drank the money dad

he puts on his cap he has to see a man mam says go see your man
but dont come drunk to this house tonight singing roddy mccorley or anything else
he comes home drunk but hes quiet and passes out on the floor next to mams bed
we have a christmas dinner next day because of the food voucher mam got from the st vincent de paul society we have sheeps head cabbage floury white potatoes and a bottle of cider because its christmas
dad says hes not hungry hell have tea borrows a cigarette from mam she says eat something its christmas
he tells her again hes not hungry but if no one else wants them hell eat the sheeps eyes he says theres great nourishment in the eye and we all make sounds of disgust he washes them down with his tea and smokes the rest of his woodbine he puts on his cap and goes upstairs for his suitcase
mam says where are you going
london
on this day of our lord christmas day
its the best day for travel people in motor cars will always give
the workingman a lift to dublin they think of the hard times of the holy family
and how will you get on the boat to holyhead without a penny in your pocket
the way i came theres always a time when theyre not looking
he kisses each of us on the forehead tells us be good boys obey mam say our prayers he tells mam hell write and she says oh yes the way you always did he stands before her with his suitcase she gets up takes down the box of chocolates and hands them around she puts a chocolate in her mouth and takes it out again because its too hard and she cant chew it i have a soft one and i offer it for the hard one which will last longer its creamy and rich and theres a nut in the middle malachy and michael complain they didnt get a nut and why is it
frank always gets the nut mam says what do you mean always this is the first time we ever had a box of chocolates
malachy says he got the raisin in the bun at school and all the boys said he gave it to paddy clohessy so why couldnt he give us the nut
mam says because tis christmas and he has sore eyes and the nut is good for the sore eyes
michael says will the nut make his eyes better
twill
will it make one eye better or will it make two eyes better
the two eyes i think
malachy says if i had another nut id give it to him for his eyes mam says i know you would
dad watches us a moment eating our chocolates he lifts the latch
goes out the door and pulls it shut
mam tells bridey hannon days are bad but nights are worse and will
this rain ever stop she tries to ease the bad days by staying in bed and letting malachy and me light the fire in the morning while she sits up in the bed passing alphie bits of bread and holding the mug to his mouth for the tea thats in it we have to go downstairs to ireland to wash our faces in the basin under the tap and try to dry ourselves in the old damp shirt that hangs over the back of a chair she makes us stand by the bed to see if we left rings of dirt around our necks and if we did its back down to the tap and the damp shirt when theres a hole in a pair of pants she sits up and patches it with any rag she can find we wear short pants till were thirteen or fourteen and our long stockings always have holes to be darned if she has no wool for the darning and the stockings are dark we can blacken our ankles with shoe polish for the respectability thats in it its a terrible thing to walk the world with skin showing through the holes of our stockings when we wear them week after week the holes grow so big we have to pull the stocking forward under the toes so that the hole in the back is hidden in the shoe on rainy days the stockings are soggy and we have to hang them before the fire at night and hope theyll dry by morning then theyre hard with dirt cake and were afraid to pull them on our feet for fear theyll fall on the floor in bits before our eyes we might be lucky enough to get our stockings on but then we have to block the holes in our shoes and i fight with my brother malachy over any scrap of cardboard or paper in the house michael is only six and he has to wait for anything left over unless mam threatens us from the bed that were to help our small brother she says if ye dont fix yeer brothers shoes an i have to get out of this bed there will be wigs on the green youd have to feel sorry for michael because hes too old to play with alphie and too young to play with us and he cant fight with anyone for the same reasons
the rest of the dressing is easy the shirt i wore to bed is the shirt i wear to school i wear it day in day out its the shirt for football for climbing walls for robbings orchards i go to mass and the confraternity in that shirt and people sniff the air and move away if mam gets a docket for a new one at the st vincent de paul the old shirt is promoted to towel and hangs damp on the chair for months or mam might use bits of it to patch other shirts she might even cut it up and let alphie wear it a while before it winds up on the floor pushed against the bottom of the door to block the rain from the lane
we go to school through lanes and back streets so that we wont meet the respectable boys who go to the christian brothersschool or the rich ones who go to the jesuit school crescent college the christian brothers boys wear tweed jackets warm woolen sweaters shirts ties and shiny new boots we know theyre the ones who will get jobs in the civil service and help the people who run the world the crescent college boys wear blazers and school scarves tossed around their necks and over their shoulders to show theyre cock o the walk they have long hair which falls across their foreheads and over their eyes so that they can toss their quiffs like englishmen we know theyre the ones who will go to university take over the family business run the government run the world well be the messenger boys on bicycles who deliver their groceries or well go to england to work on the building sites our sisters will mind their children and scrub their floors unless they go off to england too we know that were ashamed of the way we look and if boys from the rich schools pass remarks well get into a fight and wind up with bloody noses or torn clothes our masters will have no patience with us and our fights because their sons go to the rich schools and ye have no right to raise your hands to a better class of people so ye dont
you never know when you might come home and find mam sitting by the fire chatting with a woman and a child strangers always a woman and child mam finds them wandering the streets and if they ask could you spare a few pennies miss her heart breaks she never has money so she invites them home for tea and a bit of fried bread and if its a bad night shell let them sleep by the fire on a pile of rags in the corner the bread she gives them always means less for us and if we complain she says there are always people worse off and we can surely spare a little from what we have
michael is just as bad he brings home stray dogs and old men you never know when youll find a dog in the bed with him there are dogs with sores dogs with no ears no tails theres a blind greyhound he found in the park tormented by children michael fought off the children picked up the greyhound that was bigger than himself and told mam the dog could have his supper mam says what supper were lucky if theres a cut of bread in the house michael tells her the dog can have his bread mam says that dog has to go tomorrow and michael cries all night and cries worse in the morning when he finds the dog dead in the bed beside him he wont go to school because he has to dig a grave outside where the stable was and he wants all of us to dig with him and say the rosary malachy says its useless saying prayers for a dog how do you know he was even a catholic michael says of course he was a catholic dog didnt i have him in my arms he cries so hard over the dog mam lets us all stay at home from school were so delighted we dont mind helping michael with the grave and we say three hail marys were not going to stand there wasting a good day off from school saying the rosary for a dead greyhound michael is only six but when he brings old men home he manages to get the fire going and give them tea mam says its driving her crazy to come home and find these old men drinking out of her favorite mug and mumbling and scratching by the fire she tells bridey hannon that michael has a habit of bringing home old men all a bit gone in the head and if he doesnt have a bit of bread for them he knocks on neighbors doors and has no shame begging for it in the end she tells
michael no more old men one of them left us with lice and were plagued
the lice are disgusting worse than rats theyre in our heads and ears and they sit in the hollows of our collarbones they dig into our skin they get into the seams of our clothes and theyre everywhere in the coats we use as blankets we have to search every inch of alphies body because hes a baby and helpless
the lice are worse than the fleas lice squat and suck and we can see our blood through their skins fleas jump and bite and theyre clean and we prefer them things that jump are cleaner than things that squat
we all agree there will be no more stray women and children dogs and old men we dont want any more diseases and infections
michael cries

mam comes back up to italy and sits by the fire wondering where in gods name shell get the money for a weeks rent never mind the arrears shed love a cup of tea but theres no way of boiling the water till malachy pulls a loose board off the wall between the two upstairs rooms mam says well tis off now and we might as well chop it up for the fire we boil the water and use the rest of the wood for the morning tea but what about tonight and tomorrow and ever after mam says one more board from that wall one more and not another one she says that for two weeks till theres nothing left but the beam frame she warns us we are not to touch the beams for they hold up the ceiling and the house itself
oh wed never touch the beams
she goes to see grandma and its so cold in the house i take the hatchet to one of the beams malachy cheers me on and michael claps his hands with excitement i pull on the beam the ceiling groans and down on mams bed theres a shower of plaster slates rain malachy says oh god well all be killed and michael dances around singing frankie broke the house frankie broke the house
we run through the rain to tell mam the news she looks puzzled with michael chanting frankie broke the house till i explain theres a hole in the house and its falling down she says jesus and runs through the streets with grandma trying to keep up
mam sees her bed buried under plaster and slates and pulls at her hair whatll we do at all at all and screams at me for interfering with the beams grandma says ill go to the landlords office and tell them fix this before ye are all drowned entirely
shes back in no time with the rent man he says great god in heaven wheres the other room

grandma says i dont remember a wall and if i dont remember a wall how can i remember a room

mam turns to us do any of ye remember a wall
michael pulls at her hand is that the wall we burned in the fire the rent man says dear god in heaven this beats banagher this

he goes out the door and leaves it open to show what he thinks of us mam says i dont know in gods name what im going to do grandma says well i dont have room for ye but your cousin gerard griffin is living out the rosbrien road in that little house of his mothers and hed surely be able to take ye in till better times come tis all hours of the night but ill go up and see what he says and frank can come with me
she tells me put on a coat but i dont have one and she says i suppose theres no use in asking if ye have an umbrella either come on
she pulls the shawl over her head and i follow her out the door up the lane through the rain to rosbrien road nearly two miles away she knocks on the door of a little cottage in a long row of little cottages are you there laman i know youre in there open the door
grandma why are you calling him laman isnt his name gerard
how would i know do i know why the world calls your uncle pat ab everyone calls this fella laman open the door well go in he might be working overtime
she pushes the door its dark and theres a damp sweet smell in the room this room looks like the kitchen and theres a smaller room next to it theres a little loft above the bedroom with a skylight where the rain is beating there are boxes everywhere newspapers magazines bits of food mugs empty tins we can see two beds taking up all the space in the bedroom a great acre of a bed and a smaller one near the window grandma pokes at a lump in the big bed laman is that you get up will you get up
what what what what
theres trouble angela is gettin evicted with the children an tis delvinout of the heavens they need a bit of shelter till
they get on their feet an i have no room for them you can put them up in the loft if you like but that wouldnt do because the small ones wouldnt be able to climb and theyd fall down an get killed so you go up there an they can move in here
all right all right all right all right
he hoists himself from the bed and theres a whiskey smell he goes to the kitchen and pulls the table to the wall for his climb to the loft
grandma says thats fine now ye can move up here tonight an ye wont have the eviction men coming after ye
grandma tells mam shes going home shes tired and drenched and shes not twentyfive anymore she says theres no need to be taking beds or furniture with all the stuff thats up in laman griffins we put alphie in the pram and pile around him the pot the pan the kettle the jam jars and mugs the pope two bolsters and the coats from the beds we drape the coats over our heads and push the pram through the streets mam tells us be quiet going up the lane or the neighbors will know we got the eviction and there will be shame the pram has a bockety wheel which tilts it and makes it go in different directions we try to keep it straight and were having a great time because it must be after midnight and surely mam wont make us go to school tomorrow were moving so far from leamys school now maybe well never have to go again once we get away from the lane alphie bangs on the pot with the spoon and michael sings a song he heard in a film with al jolson swanee how i love ya how i love ya my dear olswanee he makes us laugh the way he tries to sing in a deep voice like al jolson
mam says shes glad its late and theres no one on the streets to see our shame
once we get to the house we take alphie and everything else from the pram so that malachy and i can run back down to roden lane for the trunk mam says shed die if she lost that trunk and everything in it
malachy and i sleep at opposite ends of the small bed mam takes the big bed with alphie beside her and michael at the bottom everything is damp and musty and laman griffin snores over our heads there are no stairs in this house and that means no angel ever on the seventh step
but im twelve going on thirteen and i might be too old for angels
its still dark when the alarm goes off in the morning and laman griffin snorts and blows his nose and hawks the stuff from his chest the floor creaks under him and when he pisses for ages into the chamber pot we have to stuff our mouths with coats to stop the laughing and mam hisses at us to be quiet he grumbles away above us before he climbs down to get his bicycle and bang his way out the door mam whispers the coast is clear go back to sleep ye can stay at home today
we cant sleep were in a new house we have to pee and we want to explore the lavatory is outside about ten steps from the back door our own lavatory with a door you can close and a proper seat where you can sit and read squares of the limerick leader laman griffin left behind for wiping himself there is a long backyard a garden with tall grass and weeds an old bicycle that must have belonged to a giant tin cans galore old papers and magazines rotting into the earth a rusted sewing machine a dead cat with a rope around his neck that somebody must have thrown over the fence
michael gets a notion in his head that this is africa and keeps asking wheres tarzan wheres tarzan he runs up and down the backyard with no pants on trying to imitate tarzan yodeling from tree to tree malachy looks over the fences into the other yards and tells us they have gardens theyre growing things we can grow things we can have our own spuds and everything
mam calls from the back door see if ye can find anything to start the fire in here
theres a wooden shed built against the back of the house its collapsing and surely we could use some of the wood for the fire mam is
disgusted with the wood we bring in she says its rotten and full of white maggots but beggars cant be choosers the wood sizzles above the burning paper and we watch the white maggots try to escape michael says he feels sorry for the white maggots but we know hes sorry for everything in the world
mam tells us this house used to be a shop that laman griffins mother sold groceries through the little window and thats how she was able to send laman away to rockwell college so that he could wind up as an officer in the royal navy oh he was indeed an officer in the royal navy and heres a picture of him with other officers all having dinner with a famous american film star jean harlow he was never the same after he met jean harlow he fell madly in love with her but what was the use she was jean harlow and he was nothing but an officer in the royal navy and it drove him to drink and they threw him out of the navy now look at him a common laborer for the electricity supply board and a house thats a disgrace youd look at this house and never know there was a human being living in it you can see laman never moved a thing since his mother died and now we have to clean up so that we can live in this place
there are boxes packed with bottles of purple hair oil while mam is out in the lavatory we open a bottle and smear it on our heads malachy says the smell is gorgeous but when mam comes back she says whats that horrible stink and wants to know why our heads are suddenly greasy she makes us stick our heads under the tap outside and dry ourselves with an old towel pulled out from under a pile of magazines called the illustrated london news so old they have pictures of queen victoria and prince edward waving there are bars of pears soap and a thick book called pears encyclopedia which keeps me up day and night because it tells you everything about everything and thats all i want to know
there are bottles of sloans liniment which mam says will come in handy when we get cramps and pains from the damp the bottles say heres the pain wheres the sloans there are boxes of safety pins and bags packed with womens hats that crumble when you touch them there are bags with corsets garters womens high button shoes and different laxatives that promise glowing cheeks bright eyes and a curl in your hair there are letters from general eoin oduffy to gerard griffin esq saying welcome to the ranks of the national front the irish blueshirts that it is a privilege to know a man like gerard griffin is interested in the movement with his excellent education his royal navy training his reputation as a great rugby player on the young munster team that won the national championship the bateman cup general oduffy is forming an irish brigade that will soon sail off to spain to fight with that great catholic generalissimo franco himself and mr griffin would be a powerful addition to the brigade
mam says lamans mother wouldnt let him go she didnt spend all those years slaving away in a little shop to send him to college so that he could go gallivanting off to spain for franco so he stayed at home and got that job digging holes for the poles of the electricity supply board along country roads and his mother was happy to have him home to herself every night but friday when he drank his pint and moaned over jean harlow
mam is happy well have loads of paper for lighting the fire though the wood we burn from that collapsing shed leaves a sickening smell and she worries the white maggots will escape and breed
we work all day moving boxes and bags to the shed outside mam opens all the windows to air the house and let out the smell of the hair oil and the years of no air she says its a relief to be able to see the floor again and now we can sit down and have a nice cup of tea in peace ease and comfort and wont it be lovely when the warm weather comes and we might be able to have a garden and sit outside with our tea the way the english do
laman griffin comes home at six every night but friday has his tea and goes to bed till next morning saturdays he goes to bed at one in the afternoon and stays there till monday morning he pulls the kitchen table over to the wall under the loft climbs up on a chair pulls the chair up to the table climbs up on the chair again catches a leg of the bed pulls himself up if hes too drunk on fridays he makes me climb up for his pillow and blankets and sleeps on the kitchen floor by the fire or falls into bed with me and my brothers and snores and farts all night
when we first moved in he complained over how he gave up his room downstairs for the loft and hes worn out climbing up and down to go to the lavatory in the backyard he calls down bring the table the chair im coming down and we have to clear off the table and pull it to the wall hes fed up hes finished with the climbing hes going to use his mothers lovely chamber pot he lies in bed all day reading books from the library smoking gold flake cigarettes and throwing mam a few shillings to send one of us to the shop so that he can have scones with his tea or a nice bit of ham and sliced tomato then he calls to mam angela this chamber pot is full and she drags chair and table to climb for the chamber pot empty it in the lavatory outside rinse it and climb back to the loft her face gets tight and she says is there anything else your lordship would like this day and he laughs womans work angela womans work and free rent
laman throws down his library card from the loft and tells me get him two books one on angling one on gardening he writes a note to the librarian to say his legs are killing him from digging holes for the electricity supply board and from now on frank mccourt will be getting his books he knows the boy is only thirteen going on fourteen and he knows the rules are strict about allowing children into the adult part of the library but the boy will wash his hands and behave himself and do what hes told thank you
the librarian reads the note and says tis an awful pity about mr griffin hes a true gentleman and a man of great learning you wouldnt believe the books he reads sometimes four a week that one day he took home a book in french french if you dont mind on the history of the rudder the rudder if you dont mind shed give anything for a look inside his head for it must be packed with all sorts of learning packed if you dont mind
she picks out a gorgeous book with colored pictures about english gardens she says i know what he likes in the fishing department and chooses a book called in search of the irish salmon by brigadier general hugh colton oh says the librarian he reads hundreds of books about english officers fishing in ireland ive read some myself out of pure curiosity and you can see why those officers are glad to be in ireland after all they put up with in india and africa and other desperate
places at least the people here are polite were known for that the politeness not running around throwing spears at people
laman lies in the bed reads his books talks down from the loft about the day his legs will heal and hell be out there in the back planting a garden which will be famous far and wide for color and beauty and when hes not gardening hell be roaming the rivers around limerick and bringing home salmon that will make your mouth water his mother left a recipe for salmon thats a family secret and if he had the time and his legs werent killing him hed find it someplace in this house he says now that im reliable i can get a book for myself every week but dont be bringing home filth i want to know what the filth is but he wont tell me so ill have to find out for myself
mam says she wants to join the library too but its a long walk from lamans house two miles and would i mind getting her a book every week a romance by charlotte m brame or any other nice writer she doesnt want any books about english officers looking for salmon or books about people shooting each other theres enough trouble in the world without reading about people bothering fish and each other
grandma caught a chill the night we had the trouble in the house in roden lane and the chill turned into pneumonia they shifted her to the city home hospital and now shes dead
her oldest son my uncle tom thought hed go to england to work like other men in the lanes of limerick but his consumption got worse and he came back to limerick and now hes dead
his wife galway jane followed him and four of their six children had to be put into orphanages the oldest boy gerry ran away and joined the irish army deserted and crossed to the english army the oldest girl peggy went to aunt aggie and lives in misery
the irish army is looking for boys who are musical and would like to train in the army school of music they accept my brother malachy and he goes off to dublin to be a soldier and play the trumpet
now i have only two brothers at home and mam says her family is disappearing before her very eyes

the best time to ask him for anything is friday night when hes in a good mood after his night of drinking and his dinner he brings home the same dinner in his overcoat pockets a big steak dripping blood four potatoes an onion a bottle of stout mam boils the potatoes and fries the steak with sliced onion he keeps his overcoat on sits at the table and eats the steak out of his hands the grease and blood roll down his chin and on to the overcoat where he wipes his hands he drinks his stout and laughs that theres nothing like a great bloody steak of a friday night and if thats the worst sin he ever commits hell float to heaven body and soul ha ha ha

laman says im a good boy and the bike is mine anytime i want it as long as the chamber pot is empty and im there to run to the shop for his cigarettes go to the library for books and do whatever else he wants he says you have a great way with a chamber pot he laughs and mam stares into the dead ashes in the fireplace
its raining so hard one day miss oriordan the librarian says dont go out in that or youll ruin the books youre carrying sit down over there and behave yourself you can read all about the saints while youre waiting
there are four big books butlers lives of the saints i dont want to spend my life reading about saints but when i start i wish the rain would last forever whenever you see pictures of saints men or women theyre always looking up to heaven where there are clouds filled with little fat angels carrying flowers or harps giving praise uncle pa keating says he cant think of a single saint in heaven hed want to sit down and have a pint with the saints in these books are different there are stories about virgins martyrs virgin martyrs and theyre worse than any horror film at the lyric cinema
i have to look in the dictionary to find out what a virgin is i know the mother of god is the virgin mary and they call her that because she didnt have a proper husband only poor old st joseph in the lives of the saints the virgins are always getting into trouble and i dont know why the dictionary says virgin woman usually a young woman who is and remains in a state of inviolate chastity
now i have to look up inviolate and chastity and all i can find here is that inviolate means not violated and chastity means chaste and that means pure from unlawful sexual intercourse now i have to look up intercourse and that leads to intromission which leads to intromittent the copulatory organ of any male animal copulatory leads to copulation the union of the sexes in the art of generation and i dont know what that means and im too weary going from one word to another in this heavy dictionary which leads me on a wild goose chase from this word to that
word and all because the people who wrote the dictionary dont want the likes of me to know anything
all i want to know is where i came from but if you ask anyone they tell you ask someone else or send you from word to word
all these virgin martyrs are told by roman judges they have to give up their faith and accept the roman gods but they say nay and the judges have them tortured and killed my favorite is st christina the astonishing who takes ages to die the judge says cut off her breast and when they do she throws it at him and he goes deaf dumb and blind another judge is brought on the case and he says cut off the other breast and the same thing happens they try to kill her with arrows but they just bounce off her and kill the soldiers who shot them they try to boil her in oil but she rocks in the vat and takes a nap for herself then the judges get fed up and have her head cut off and that does the job the feast of st christina the astonishing is the twentyfourth of july and i think ill keep that for myself along with the feast of st francis of assisi on the fourth of october the librarian says you have to go home now the rain is stopped and when im going out the door she calls me back she wants to write a note to my mother and she doesnt mind one bit if i read it the note says dear mrs mccourt just when you think ireland is gone to the dogs altogether you find a boy sitting in the library so absorbed in the lives of the saints he doesnt realize the rain has stopped and you have to drag him away from the aforesaid lives i think mrs mccourt you might have a future priest on your hands and i will light a candle in hopes it comes true i remain yours truly catherine oriordan asst librarian
hoppy ohalloran is the only master in leamys national school who ever sits thats because hes the headmaster or because he has to rest himself from the twisting walk that comes from the short leg the other masters walk back and forth in the front of the room or up and down the aisles and you never know when youll get a whack of a cane or a slap of a strap for giving the wrong answer or writing something sloppy if hoppy wants to do anything to you he calls you to the front of the room to punish you before three classes
there are good days when he sits at the desk and talks about america he says my boys from the frozen wastes of north dakota to the fragrant orange groves of florida americans enjoy all climates he talks about american history if the american farmer with flintlock and musket could wrest from the english a continent surely we warriors ever can recover our island
if we dont want him tormenting us with algebra or irish grammar all we have to do is ask him a question about america and that gets him so excited he might go on for the whole day
he sits at his desk and recites the tribes and chiefs he loves arapaho cheyenne chippewa sioux apache iroquois poetry my boys poetry and listen to the chiefs kicking bear rainintheface sitting bull crazy horse and the genius geronimo
in seventh class he hands out a small book a poem that goes on for pages and pages the deserted village by oliver goldsmith he says that this seems to be a poem about england but it is a lament for the poets native land our own native land ireland we are to get this poem by heart twenty lines a night to be recited every morning six boys are called to the front of the room for reciting and if you miss a line you are slapped twice on each hand he tells us put the books under the desks
and the whole class chants the passage on the schoolmaster in the village
beside yon straggling fence that skirts the way with blossomed furze unprofitably gay
there in his noisy mansion skilled to rule
the village master taught his little school
a man severe he was and stern to view i knew him well and every truant knew
full well the boding tremblers learned to trace the days disaster in his morning face
full well they laughed with counterfeited glee at all his jokes for many a joke had he
full well the busy whisper circling round conveyed the dismal tidings when he frowned
he always closes his eyes and smiles when we reach the last lines of the passage yet he was kind or if severe in aught the love he bore to learning was in fault
the village all declared how much he knew
twas certain he could write and cipher too lands he could measure terms and tides presage and even the story ran that he could gauge
in arguing too the parson owned his skill for even though vanquished he could argue still while words of learned length and thundering sound amazed the gazing rustics ranged around
and still they gazed and still the wonder grew that one small head could carry all he knew
we know he loves these lines because theyre about a schoolmaster about him and hes right because we wonder how one small head could carry all he knows and we will remember him in these lines he says ah boys boys you can make up your own minds but first stock them are you listening to me stock your minds and you can move through the world resplendent clarke define resplendent
i think its shining sir
pithy clarke but adequate mccourt give us a sentence with pithy
clarke is pithy but adequate sir
adroit mccourt you have a mind for the priesthood my boy or politics think of that
i will sir
tell your mother come and see me
i will sir
mam says no i could never go near mr ohalloran i dont have a
decent dress or a proper coat what does he want to see me for i dont know
well ask him
i cant hell kill me if he says bring your mother you have to bring your mother or out comes the stick
she comes to see him and he talks to her in the hallway he tells her that her son frank must continue school he must not fall into the
messenger boy trap that leads nowhere take him up to the christian brothers tell them i sent you tell them he is a bright boy and ought to be going to secondary school and beyond that university
he tells her he did not become headmaster of leamys national school to preside over an academy of messenger boys
mam says thank you mr ohalloran
i wish mr ohalloran would mind his own business i dont want to go to the christian brothers i want to quit school forever and get a job get my wages every friday go to the pictures on saturday nights like everyone
a few days later mam tells me give my face and hands a good wash were going to the christian brothers i tell her i dont want to go i want to work i want to be a man she tells me stop the whining im going to secondary school and well all manage somehow im going to school if she has to scrub floors and shell practice on my face
she knocks on the door at the christian brothers and says she wants to see the superior brother murray he comes to the door looks at my mother and me and says what
mam says this is my son frank mr ohalloran at leamys says hes bright and would there be any chance of getting him in here for secondary school
we dont have room for him says brother murray and closes the door in our faces
mam turns away from the door and its a long silent walk home she takes off her coat makes tea sits by the fire listen to me she says are you listening
i am
thats the second time a door was slammed in your face by the church
is it i dont remember
stephen carey told you and your father you couldnt and closed the door in your face do you remember that
i do
and now brother murray slams the door in your face i dont mind i want to get a job
her face tightens and shes angry you are never to
be an altar boy
let anybody
slam the door in your face again do you hear me
she starts to cry by the fire oh god i didnt bring ye into the
world to be a family of messenger boys
i dont know what to do or say im so relieved i dont have to
stay in school for five or six more years im free
im thirteen going on fourteen and its june the last month of school forever mam takes me to see the priest dr cowpar about getting a job as telegram boy the supervisor in the post office mrs oconnell says do you know how to cycle and i lie that i do she says i cant start till im fourteen so come back in august
mr ohalloran tells the class its a disgrace that boys like mccourt clarke kennedy have to hew wood and draw water he is disgusted by this free and independent ireland that keeps a class system foisted on us by the english that we are throwing our talented children on the dungheap
you must get out of this country boys go to america mccourt do you hear me
i do sir
priests come to the school to recruit us for the foreign missions redemptorists franciscans holy ghost fathers all converting the distant heathen i ignore them im going to america till one priest catches my attention he says he comes from the order of the white fathers missionaries to the nomadic bedouin tribes and chaplains to the french foreign legion
i ask for the application
i will need a letter from the parish priest and a physical examination by my family doctor the parish priest writes the letter on the spot he would have been glad to see me go last year the doctor says whats this
thats an application to join the white fathers missionaries to the nomadic tribes of the sahara and chaplains to the french foreign legion
oh yeh french foreign legion is it do you know the preferred form of transportation in the sahara desert
trains
no its the camel do you know what a camel is
it has a hump it has more than a hump it has a nasty mean
disposition and its teeth are green with gangrene and it bites do you know where it bites
in the sahara
no you omadhaun it bites your shoulder rips it right off leaves you standing there tilted in the sahara how would you like that eh and what class of a spectacle youd be strolling down the street lopsided in limerick what girl in her right mind will look at an exwhite father with one miserable scrawny shoulder and look at your eyes theyre bad enough here in limerick in the sahara theyll fester and rot and fall out of your head how old are you
thirteen
go home to your mother
its not our house and we dont feel free in it the way we did in
roden lane up in italy or down in ireland when laman comes home he wants to read in his bed or sleep and we have to be quiet we stay in the streets till after dark and when we come inside theres nothing to do but go to bed and read a book if we have a candle or paraffin oil for the lamp
mam tells us go to bed shell be after us in a minute as soon as she climbs to the loft with lamans last mug of tea we often fall asleep before she goes up but there are nights we hear them talking grunting moaning there are nights when she never comes down and michael and alphie have the big bed to themselves malachy says she stays up there because its too hard for her to climb down in the dark
hes only twelve and he doesnt understand
im thirteen and i think theyre at the excitement up there
i know about the excitement and i know its a sin but how can it be
a sin if it comes to me in a dream where american girls pose in swimming suits on the screen at the lyric cinema and i wake up pushing and pumping its a sin when youre wide awake and going at yourself the way the boys talked about it in leamys schoolyard after mr odea roared the sixth commandment at us thou shalt not commit adultery which means impure thoughts impure words impure deeds and thats what adultery is dirty things in general
one redemptorist priest barks at us all the time about the sixth commandment he says impurity is so grave a sin the virgin mary turns her face away and weeps
and why does she weep boys she weeps because of you and what you are doing to her beloved son she weeps when she looks down the long dreary vista of time and beholds in horror the spectacle of limerick boys defiling themselves polluting themselves interfering with themselves abusing themselves soiling their young bodies which are the temples of the holy ghost our lady weeps over these abominations knowing that every time you interfere with yourself you nail to the cross her beloved son that once more you hammer into his dear head the crown of thorns that you reopen those ghastly wounds in an agony of thirst he hangs on the cross and what is he offered by those perfidious romans a lavatory sponge plunged into vinegar and gall and thrust into his poor mouth a mouth that moves rarely except to pray to pray even for you boys even for you who nailed him to that cross consider our lords suffering consider the crown of thorns consider a small pin driven into your skull the agony of the piercing consider then twenty thorns driven into your head reflect meditate on the nails tearing his hands his feet could you endure a fraction of that agony take that pin again that mere pin force it into your side enlarge that sensation a hundredfold and you are penetrated by that awful lance oh boys the devil wants your souls he wants you with him in hell and know this that every time you interfere with yourself every time you succumb to the vile sin of self abuse you not only nail christ to the cross you take another step closer to hell itself retreat from the abyss boys resist the devil and keep your hands to yourself
i cant stop interfering with myself i pray to the virgin mary and tell her im sorry i put her son back on the cross and ill never do it again but i cant help myself and swear ill go to confession and after that surely after that ill never never do it again i dont want to go to hell with devils chasing me for eternity jabbing me with hot pitchforks
the priests of limerick have no patience with the likes of me i go to confession and they hiss that im not in a proper spirit of repentance that if i were id give up this hideous sin i go from church to church looking for an easy priest till paddy clohessy tells me theres one in the dominican church whos ninety years old and deaf as a turnip every few weeks the old priest hears my confession and mumbles that i should pray for him sometimes he falls asleep and i dont have the heart to wake him up so i go to communion the next day without penance or absolution its not my fault if priests fall asleep on me and surely im in a state of grace just for going to confession then one day the little panel in the confession box slides back and its not my man at all its a young priest with a big ear like a seashell hell surely hear everything
bless me father for i have sinned its a fortnight since my last confession
and what have you done since then my child
i hit my brother i went on the mooch from school i lied to my mother
yes my child and what else
i â€“ i  i did dirty things father
ah my child was that with yourself or with another or with some class of beast
some class of beast i never heard of a sin like that before this priest must be from the country and if he is hes opening up new worlds to me
the night before im to go to killaloe laman griffin comes home drunk and eats a great bag of fish and chips at the table he tells mam boil water for tea and when she says she has no coal or turf he yells at her and calls her a great lump living free under his roof with her pack of brats he throws money at me to go to the shop for a few sods of turf and wood for kindling i dont want to go i want to hit him for the way he treats my mother but if i say anything he wont let me have the bicycle tomorrow after ive waited three weeks
when mam gets the fire going and boils the water i remind him of his promise to loan me the bike
did you empty the chamber pot today
oh i forgot ill do it this minute
he shouts you didnt empty my damn chamber pot i promise you the
bike i give you tuppence a week to run messages for me and empty the chamber pot and you stand there with your thick gob hanging out and tell me you didnt do it
im sorry i forgot ill do it now
you will will you and how do you think youll get up to the loft are you going to pull the table out from under my fish and chips
mam says sure he was at school all day and he had to go to the doctor for his eyes
well you can bloody well forget about the bicycle you didnt live up to the bargain
but he couldnt do it says mam
he tells her shut up and mind her own business and she goes quiet by the fire he goes back to his fish and chips but i tell him again you promised me i emptied that chamber pot and did your messages for three weeks
shut up and go to bed
you cant tell me go to bed youre not my father and you promised
me
im telling you as sure as god made little apples that if i get
up from this table youll be calling for your patron saint you promised me
he pushes the chair back from the table he stumbles toward me and sticks his finger between my eyes im telling you shut your gob scabby
eyes
i wont you promised me
he punches my shoulders and when i wont stop moves to my head my
mother jumps up crying and tries to pull him away he punches and kicks me into the bedroom but i keep saying you promised me he knocks me to my mothers bed and punches till i cover my face and head with my arms
ill kill you you little shit
mam is screaming and pulling at him till he falls backward into the kitchen she says come on oh come on eat your fish and chips hes only a child hell get over it i hear him go back to his chair and pull it to the table
i hear him snuffle and slurp when he eats and drinks hand me the matches he says by jesus i need a fag after that theres a putput sound when he puffs on the cigarette and a whimper from my mother
he says im going to bed and with the drink in him it takes him a while to climb the chair to the table pull up the chair climb to the loft the bed squeaks under him and he grunts when he pulls off his boots and drops them to the floor
i can hear mam crying when she blows into the globe of the paraffin oil lamp and everything goes dark after what happened shell surely want to get into her own bed and im ready to go to the small one against the wall instead theres the sound of her climbing the chair the table the chair crying up into the loft and telling laman griffin hes only a boy tormented with his eyes and when laman says hes a little shit and i want him out of the house she cries and begs till theres whispering and grunting and moaning and nothing
in awhile theyre snoring in the loft and my brothers are asleep around me i cant stay in this house for if laman griffin comes at me again ill take a knife to his neck i dont know what to do or where to go
i leave the house and follow the streets from the sarsfield barracks to the monument cafÃ© i dream of how ill get back at laman some day ill go to america and see joe louis ill tell him my troubles and hell understand because he comes from a poor family hell show me how to build up my muscles how to hold my hands and use my feet hell show me how to dig my chin into my shoulder the way he does and how to let go with a right uppercut that will send laman flying ill drag laman to the graveyard at mungret where his family and mams family are buried and ill cover him with earth all the way to his chin so that he wont be able to move and hell beg for his life and ill say end of the road laman youre going to meet your maker and hell beg and beg while i trickle dirt on his face till its covered completely and hes gasping and asking god for forgiveness for not giving me the bike and punching me all over the house and doing the excitement with my mother and ill be laughing away because hes not in a state of grace after the excitement and hes going to hell as sure as god made little apples as he used to say himself
the streets are dark and i have to keep an eye out in case i might be lucky like malachy long ago and find fish and chips dropped by drunken soldiers theres nothing on the ground if i find my uncle ab sheehan he might give me some of his friday night fish and chips but they tell me in the cafÃ© he came and went already im thirteen now so i dont call him uncle pat anymore i call him ab or the abbot like everybody else surely if i go to grandmas house hell give me a piece of bread or something and maybe hell let me stay the night i can tell him ill be working in a few weeks delivering telegrams and getting big tips at the post office and ready to pay my own way
hes sitting up in bed finishing his fish and chips dropping to the floor the limerick leader they were wrapped in wiping his mouth and hands with the blanket he looks at me that face is all swole did you fall on that face
i tell him i did because theres no use telling him anything else he wouldnt understand he says you can stay in me mothers bed tonight you cant walk the streets with that face and them two red eyes in your head
he says theres no food in the house not a scrap of bread and when he falls asleep i take the greasy newspaper from the floor i lick the front page which is all advertisements for films and dances in the city i lick the headlines i lick the great attacks of patton and montgomery in france and germany i lick the war in the pacific i lick the obituaries and the sad memorial poems the sports pages the market prices of eggs butter and bacon i suck the paper till there isnt a smidgen of grease
i wonder what ill do tomorrow
xiv
in the morning the abbot gives me the money to go to kathleen oconnells for bread margarine tea milk he boils water on the gas ring and tells me i can have a mug of tea and go aisy with the sugar im not a millionaire you can have a cut o bread but dont make it too thick
its july and school is over forever in a few weeks ill be delivering telegrams at the post office working like a man in the weeks im idle i can do anything i like get up in the morning stay in bed take long walks out the country like my father wander around limerick if i had the money id go over to the lyric cinema eat sweets see errol flynn conquering everyone in sight i can read the english and irish papers the abbot brings home or i can use the library cards of laman griffin and my mother till im found out
mam sends michael with a milk bottle of warm tea a few cuts of bread smeared with dripping a note to say laman griffin isnt angry anymore and i can come back michael says are you coming home frankie
no
ah do frankie come on
i live here now im never going back
but malachy is gone to the army and youre here and i have no big
brother all the boys have big brothers and i only have alphie hes not even four and cant talk right
i cant go back im never going back you can come here any time you like
his eyes glint with tears and that gives me such a pain in my heart i want to say all right ill come with you im only saying that i know ill never be able to face laman griffin again and i dont know if i can look at my mother i watch michael go up the lane with the sole of his shoe broken and clacking along the pavement when i start that job at the post office ill buy him shoes so i will ill give him an egg and take him to the lyric cinema for the film and the sweets and then well go to naughtons and eat fish and chips till our bellies are sticking out a mile ill get money some day for a house or a flat with electric light and a lavatory and beds with sheets blankets pillows like the rest of the world well have breakfast in a bright kitchen with flowers dancing in a garden beyond delicate cups and saucers eggcups eggs soft in the yolk and ready to melt the rich creamery butter a teapot with a cozy on it toast with butter and marmalade galore well take our time and listen to music from the bbc or the american armed forces network ill buy proper clothes for the whole family so our arses wont be hanging out of our pants and we wont have the shame the thought of the shame brings a pain
in my heart and starts me sniffling the abbot says whats up with you didnt you have your bread didnt you have your tay what more do you want tis an egg youll be lookin for next
theres no use talking to someone who was dropped on his head and sells papers for a living
he complains he cant be feeding me forever and ill have to get my own bread and tea he doesnt want to come home and find me reading in the kitchen with the electric lightbulb blazing away he can read numbers so he can and when he goes out to sell papers he reads the electric meter so hell know how much i used and if i dont stop turning on that light hell take the fuse out and carry it in his pocket and if i put another fuse in hell have the electricity pulled out altogether and go back to gas which was good enough for his poor dead mother and will surely suit him for all he does is sit up in the bed to eat his fish and chips and count his money before he goes to sleep
i get up early like dad and go on long walks into the country i walk around the graveyard in the old abbey at mungret where my mothers relations are buried and i go up the boreen to the norman castle at carrigogunnell where dad brought me twice i climb to the top and ireland is spread out before me the shannon shining its way to the atlantic dad told me this castle was built hundreds of years ago and if you wait for the larks to stop their singing over there you can hear the normans below hammering and talking and getting ready for battle once he brought me here in the dark so that we could hear norman and irish voices down through the centuries and i heard them i did
sometimes im up there alone on the heights of carrigogunnell and there are voices of norman girls from olden times laughing and singing in french and when i see them in my mind im tempted and i climb to the very top of the castle where once there was a tower and there in full view of ireland i interfere with myself and spurt all over carrigogunnell and fields beyond
thats a sin i could never tell a priest climbing to great heights and going at yourself before all of ireland is surely worse than doing it in a private place with yourself or with another or with some class of a beast somewhere down there in the fields or along the banks of the shannon a boy or a milkmaid might have looked up and seen me in my sin and if they did im doomed because the priests are always saying that anyone who exposes a child to sin will have a millstone tied around his neck and be cast into the sea
still the thought of someone watching me brings on the excitement again i wouldnt want a small boy to be watching me no no that would surely lead to the millstone but if there was a milkmaid gawking up shed surely get excited and go at herself though i dont know if girls can go at themselves when they dont have anything to go at no equipment as mikey molloy used to say
i wish that old deaf dominican priest would come back so that i could tell him my troubles with the excitement but hes dead now and ill have to face a priest wholl go on about the millstone and the doom
doom thats the favorite word of every priest in limerick
i walk back along oconnell avenue and ballinacurra where people have their bread and milk delivered early to their doorsteps and surely theres no harm if i borrow a loaf or a bottle with every intention of giving it back when i get my job at the post office im not stealing im borrowing and thats not a mortal sin besides i stood on top of a
castle this morning and committed a sin far worse than stealing bread and milk and if you commit one sin you might as well commit a few more because you get the same sentence in hell one sin eternity a dozen sins eternity
might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb as my mother would say i drink the odd pint of milk and leave the bottle so that the milkman wont be blamed for not delivering i like milkmen because one of them gave me two broken eggs which i swallowed raw with bits of shells and all he said id grow up powerful if i had nothing else but two eggs in a pint of porter every day everything you need is in the egg and everything you want is in the pint
some houses get better bread than others it costs more and thats what i take i feel sorry for the rich people who will get up in the morning and go to the door and find their bread missing but i cant let myself starve to death if i starve ill never have the strength for my telegram boy job at the post office which means ill have no money to put back all that bread and milk and no way of saving to go to america and if i cant go to america i might as well jump into the river shannon its only a few weeks till i get my first wages in the post office and surely these rich people wont collapse with the hunger till then they can always send the maid out for more thats the difference between the poor and the rich the poor cant send out for more because theres no money to send out for more and if there was they wouldnt have a maid to send its the maids i have to worry about i have to be careful when i borrow the milk and the bread and theyre at the front doors polishing knobs knockers and letter boxes if they see me theyll be running to the woman of the house oh madam madam theres an urchin beyant thats makin off with all the milk and bread
beyant maids talk like that because theyre all from the country mullingar heifers says paddy clohessys uncle beef to the heels and they wouldnt give you the steam of their piss
i bring home the bread and even if the abbot is surprised he doesnt say where did you get it because he was dropped on his head and that knocks the curiosity out of you he just looks at me with his big eyes that are blue in the middle and yellow all around and slurps his tea from the great cracked mug his mother left behind he tells me thats me mug and dont be drinkin your tay oush of ish
oush of ish thats the limerick slum talk that always worried dad he said i dont want my sons growing up in a limerick lane saying oush of ish its common and lowclass say out of it properly
and mam said i hope it keeps fine for you but youre not doing much to get us oush of ish
out beyond ballinacurra i climb orchard walls for apples if theres a dog i move on because i dont have paddy clohessys way of talking to them farmers come at me but theyre always slow in their rubber boots and even if they jump on a bicycle to chase me i jump over walls where they cant take a bike
the abbot knows where i got the apples if you grow up in the lanes of limerick youre bound to rob the odd orchard sooner or later even if you hate apples you have to rob orchards or your pals will say youre a sissy
i always offer the abbot an apple but he wont eat it because of the scarcity of teeth in his head he has five left and he wont risk leaving them in an apple if i cut the apple into slices he still wont
eat it because thats not the proper way to eat an apple thats what he says and if i say you slice bread before you eat it dont you he says apples is apples and bread is bread
thats how you talk when youre dropped on your head
michael comes again with warm tea in a milk bottle and two cuts of fried bread i tell him i dont need it anymore tell mam im taking care of myself and i dont need her tea and fried bread thank you very much michael is delighted when i give him an apple and i tell him come every second day and he can have more that stops him from asking me to go back to laman griffins and im glad it stops his tears
theres a market down in irishtown where the farmers come on saturdays with their vegetables hens eggs butter if im there early theyll give me a few pennies for helping unload their carts or motor cars at the end of the day theyll give me vegetables they cant sell anything crushed bruised or rotten in parts one farmers wife always gives me cracked eggs and tells me fry them eggs tomorrow when you come back from mass in a state of grace for if you ate them eggs with a sin on your sowl theyll stick in your gullet so they will
shes a farmers wife and thats how they talk
im not much better than a beggar now myself the way i stand at the doors of fish and chip shops when theyre closing in hopes they might have burnt chips left over or bits of fish floating around in the grease if theyre in a hurry the shop owners will give me the chips and a sheet of paper for wrapping
the paper i like is the news of the world its banned in ireland but people sneak it in from england for the shocking pictures of girls in swimming suits that are almost not there then there are stories of people committing all kinds of sins you wouldnt find in limerick getting divorces committing adultery
adultery i still have to find out what that word means look it up in the library im sure its worse than what the masters taught us bad thoughts bad words bad deeds i take my chips home and get into bed like the abbot if he has a few pints taken he sits up eating his chips from the limerick leader and singing the road to rasheen  i eat my chips i lick the news of the world i lick the stories about people doing shocking things i lick the girls in their bathing suits and when theres nothing left to lick i look at the girls till the abbot blows out the light and im committing a mortal sin under the blanket
i can go to the library any time with mams card or laman griffins ill never be caught because laman is too lazy to get out of bed on a saturday and mam will never go near a library with the shame of her clothes
miss oriordan smiles the lives of the saints are waiting for you frank volumes and volumes butler ohanlon baring gould ive told the head librarian all about you and shes so pleased shes ready to give you your own grownup card isnt that wonderful
thanks miss oriordan
im reading all about st brigid virgin february first she was so beautiful that men from all over ireland panted to marry her and her father wanted her to marry someone important she didnt want to marry anyone so she prayed to god for help and he caused her eye to melt in her head so that it dribbled down her cheek and left such a great welt the men of ireland lost interest
then theres st wilgefortis virgin martyr july twentieth her mother had nine children all at the same time four sets of twins and wilgefortis the odd one all winding up martyrs for the faith wilgefortis was beautiful and her father wanted to marry her off to the king of sicily wilgefortis was desperate and god helped her by allowing a beard and a mustache to grow on her face which made the king of sicily think twice but sent her father into such a rage he had her crucified beard and all
st wilgefortis is the one you pray to if youre an englishwoman with a troublesome husband
the priests never tell us about virgin martyrs like st agatha february fifth february is a powerful month for virgin martyrs sicilian pagans ordered agatha to give up her faith in jesus and like all the virgin martyrs she said nay they tortured her stretched her on the rack tore her sides with iron hooks burned her with blazing torches and she said nay i will not deny our lord they crushed her breasts and cut them off but when they rolled her over hot coals it was more than she could bear so she expired giving praise
virgin martyrs always died singing hymns and giving praise not minding one bit if lions tore big chunks from their sides and gobbled them on the spot
how is it the priests never told us about st ursula and her eleven thousand maiden martyrs october twentyfirst her father wanted her to marry a pagan king but she said ill go away for awhile three years and think about it so off she goes with her thousand noble ladiesin waiting and their companions ten thousand they sailed around for awhile and traipsed through various countries till they stopped in cologne where the chief of the huns asked ursula to marry him nay she said and the huns killed her and the maidens with her why couldnt she say yes and save the lives of eleven thousand virgins why did virgin martyrs have to be so stubborn
i like st moling an irish bishop he didnt live in a palace like the bishop of limerick he lived in a tree and when other saints visited him for dinner they would sit around on branches like birds having a grand time with their water and dry bread he was walking along one day and a leper said hoy st moling where are you going im going to mass says st moling well id like to go to mass too so why dont you hoist me up on your back and carry me st moling did but he no sooner had the leper up on his back than the leper started to complain your hair shirt he said is hard on my sores take it off st moling took off the shirt and off they went again then the leper says i need to blow my nose st moling says i dont have any class of a handkerchief use your hand the leper says i cant hold on to you and blow my nose at the same time all right says st moling you can blow into my hand that wont do says the leper i barely have a hand left with the leprosy and i cant hold on and blow into your hand if you were a proper saint youd twist around here and suck the stuff out of my head st moling didnt want to suck the lepers snot but he did and offered it up and praised god for the privilege
i could understand my father sucking the bad stuff out of michaels head when he was a baby and desperate but i dont understand why god wanted st moling to go around sucking the snot out of lepers heads i dont understand god at all and even if id like to be a saint and have
everyone adore me id never suck the snot of a leper id like to be a saint but if thats what you have to do i think ill stay the way i am
still im ready to spend my life in this library reading about virgins and virgin martyrs till i get into trouble with miss oriordan over a book someone left on the table the author is lin yÃ¼tang anyone can tell this is a chinese name and im curious to know what the chinese talk about its a book of essays about love and the body and one of his words sends me to the dictionary turgid he says the male organ of copulation becomes turgid and is inserted into the receptive female orifice
turgid the dictionary says swollen and thats what i am standing there looking at the dictionary because i know now what mikey molloy was talking about all along that were no different from the dogs that get stuck in each other in the streets and its shocking to think of all the mothers and fathers doing the likes of this
my father lied to me for years about the angel on the seventh step
miss oriordan wants to know what word im looking for she always looks worried when im at the dictionary so i tell her im looking for canonize or beatific or any class of a religious word
and whats this she says this is not the lives of the saints
she picks up lin yÃ¼tang and starts reading the page where i left the book face down on the table
mother o god is this what you were reading i saw this in your hand
well iionly wanted to see if the chinese if the chinese ah had any saints
oh indeed you did this is disgraceful filth no wonder the chinese are the way they are but what could you expect of slanty eyes and yellow skin and you now that i look at you have a bit of the slanty eye yourself you are to leave this library at once
but im reading the lives of the saints
out or ill call the head librarian and shell have the guards on you out you should be running to the priest and confessing your sins out and before you go hand me the library cards of your poor mother and mr griffin i have a good mind to write to your poor mother and i would if i thought it wouldnt destroy her entirely lin yÃ¼tang indeed out
theres no use trying to talk to librarians when theyre in that state you could stand there for an hour telling them all youve read about brigid and wilgefortis and agatha and ursula and the maiden martyrs but all they think about is one word on one page of lin yÃ¼tang
the peoples park is behind the library its a sunny day the grass is dry and im worn out begging for chips and putting up with librarians who get into a state over turgid and im looking at the clouds drifting above the monument and drifting off myself all turgid till im having a dream about virgin martyrs in bathing suits in the news of the world pelting chinese writers with sheeps bladders and i wake up in a state of excitement with something hot and sticky pumping out of me oh god my male organ of copulation sticking out a mile people in the park giving me curious looks and mothers telling their children come over here love come away from that fella someone should call the guards on him
the day before my fourteenth birthday i see myself in the glass in grandmas sideboard the way i look how can i ever start my job at the post office everything is torn shirt gansey short pants stockings and my shoes are ready to fall off my feet entirely relics of oul
decency my mother would call them if my clothes are bad im worse no matter how i drench my hair under the tap it sticks out in all directions the best cure for standing up hair is spit only its hard to spit on your own head you have to let go with a good one up in the air and duck to catch it on your poll my eyes are red and oozing yellow there are matching red and yellow pimples all over my face and my front teeth are so black with rot ill never be able to smile in my life
i have no shoulders and i know the whole world admires shoulders when a man dies in limerick the women always say grand man he was shoulders that big and wide he wouldnt come in the door for you had to come in sideways when i die theyll say poor little divil died without a sign of a shoulder i wish i had some sign of a shoulder so that people would know i was at least fourteen years of age all the boys in leamys had shoulders except for fintan slattery and i dont want to be like him with no shoulders and knees worn away from prayer if i had any money left id light a candle to st francis and ask him if theres any chance god could be persuaded to perform a miracle on my shoulders or if i had a stamp i could write to joe louis and say dear joe is there any chance you could tell me where you got your powerful shoulders even though you were poor
i have to look decent for my job so i take off all my clothes and stand naked in the backyard washing them under the tap with a bar of carbolic soap i hang them on grandmas clothesline shirt gansey pants stockings and pray to god it wont rain pray theyll be dry for tomorrow which is the start of my life
i cant go anywhere in my pelt so i stay in bed all day reading old newspapers getting excited with the girls in the news of the world and thanking god for the drying sun the abbot comes home at five and makes tea downstairs and even though im hungry i know hell grumble if i ask him for anything he knows the one thing that worries me is he might go to aunt aggie and complain im staying in grandmas house and sleeping in her bed and if aunt aggie hears that shell come over and throw me into the street
he hides the bread when hes finished and i can never find it you would think that one who was never dropped on his head would be able to find the hidden bread of one who was dropped on his head then i realize if the bread is not in the house he must take it with him in the pocket of the overcoat he wears winter and summer the minute i hear him clumping from the kitchen to the backyard lavatory i run downstairs pull the loaf from the pocket cut off a thick slice back into the pocket up the stairs and into bed he can never say a word never accuse me youd have to be a thief of the worst class to steal one slice of bread and no one would ever believe him not even aunt aggie besides shed bark at him and say what are you doing anyway going around with a loaf of bread in your pocket thats no place for a loaf of bread
i chew the bread slowly one mouthful every fifteen minutes will make it last and if i wash it down with water the bread will swell in my belly and give me the full feeling
i look out the back window to make sure the evening sun is drying my clothes other backyards have lines with clothes that are bright and colorful and dance in the wind mine hang from the line like dead dogs
the sun is bright but its cold and damp in the house and i wish i had something to wear in the bed i have no other clothes and if i touch anything of the abbots hell surely run to aunt aggie all i can find in
the wardrobe is grandmas old black woolen dress youre not supposed to wear your grandmothers old dress when shes dead and youre a boy but what does it matter if it keeps you warm and youre in bed under the blankets where no one will ever know the dress has the smell of old dead grandmother and i worry she might rise from the grave and curse me before the whole family and all assembled i pray to st francis ask him to keep her in the grave where she belongs promise him a candle when i start my job remind him the robe he wore himself wasnt too far from a dress and no one ever tormented him over it and fall asleep with the image of his face in my dream
the worst thing in the world is to be sleeping in your dead grandmothers bed wearing her black dress when your uncle the abbot falls on his arse outside souths pub after a night of drinking pints and people who cant mind their own business rush to aunt aggies house to tell her so that she gets uncle pa keating to help her carry the abbot home and upstairs to where youre sleeping and she barks at you what are you doin in this house in that bed get up and put on the kettle for tea for your poor uncle pat that fell down and when you dont move she pulls the blankets and falls backward like one seeing a ghost and yelling mother o god what are you doin in me dead mothers dress
thats the worst thing of all because its hard to explain that youre getting ready for the big job in your life that you washed your clothes theyre drying abroad on the line and it was so cold you had to wear the only thing you could find in the house and its even harder to talk to aunt aggie when the abbot is groaning in the bed me feet is like a fire put water on me feet and uncle pa keating is covering his mouth with his hand and collapsing against the wall laughing and telling you that you look gorgeous and black suits you and would you ever straighten your hem you dont know what to do when aunt aggie tells you get out of that bed and put the kettle on downstairs for tea for your poor uncle should you take off the dress and put on a blanket or should you go as you are one minute shes screaming what are you doin in me poor mothers dress the next shes telling you put on that bloody kettle i tell her i washed my clothes for the big job
what big job
telegram boy at the post office
she says if the post office is hiring the likes of you they must be
in a desperate way altogether go down and put on that kettle
the next worse thing is to be out in the backyard filling the
kettle from the tap with the moon beaming away and kathleen purcell from next door perched up on the wall looking for her cat god frankie mccourt what are you doin in your grandmothers dress and you have to stand there in the dress with the kettle in your hand and explain how you washed your clothes which are hanging there on the line for all to see and you were so cold in the bed you put on your grandmothers dress and your uncle pat the abbot fell down and was brought home by aunt aggie and her husband pa keating and she drove you into the backyard to fill this kettle and youll take off this dress as soon as ever your clothes are dry because you never had any desire to go through life in your dead grandmothers dress
now kathleen purcell lets out a scream falls off the wall forgets the cat and you can hear her giggling into her blind mother mammy mammy wait till i tell you about frankie mccourt abroad in the backyard in his dead grandmothers dress you know that once kathleen purcell gets
a bit of scandal the whole lane will know it before morning and you might as well stick your head out the window and make a general announcement about yourself and the dress problem
by the time the kettle boils the abbot is asleep from the drink and aunt aggie says she and uncle pa will have a drop of tea themselves and she doesnt mind if i have a drop myself uncle pa says on second thought the black dress could be the cassock of a dominican priest and he goes down on his knees and says bless me father for i have sinned aunt aggie says get up you oul eejit and stop makin a feck of religion then she says and you what are you doin in this house
i cant tell her about mam and laman griffin and the excitement in the loft i tell her i was thinking of staying here a while because of the great distance from laman griffins house to the post office and as soon as i get on my feet well surely find a decent place and well all move on my mother and brothers and all
well she says thats more than your father would do
xv
its hard to sleep when you know the next day youre fourteen and starting your first job as a man the abbot wakes at dawn moaning would i ever make him some tay and if i do i can have a big cut of bread from the half loaf in his pocket which he was keeping there out of the way of the odd rat and if i look in grandmas gramophone where she used to keep the records ill find a jar of jam
he cant read he cant write but he knows where to hide the jam
i bring the abbot his tea and bread and make some for myself i put on my damp clothes and get into the bed hoping that if i stay there the clothes will dry from my own heat before i go to work mam always says its the damp clothes that give you the consumption and an early grave the abbot is sitting up telling me he has a terrible pain in his head from a dream where i was wearing his poor mothers black dress and she flying around screaming sin sin tis a sin he finishes his tea and falls into a snore sleep and i wait for his clock to say halfpast eight time to get up and be at the post office at nine even if the clothes are still damp on my skin
on my way out i wonder why aunt aggie is coming down the lane she must be coming to see if the abbot is dead or needing a doctor she says what time do you have to be at that job
nine
all right
she turns and walks with me to the post office on henry street she
doesnt say a word and i wonder if shes going to the post office to denounce me for sleeping in my grandmothers bed and wearing her black dress she says go up and tell them your aunt is down here waiting for you and youll be an hour late if they want to argue ill go up and argue
why do i have to be an hour late
do what youre bloody well told
there are telegram boys sitting on a bench along a wall there are
two women at a desk one fat one thin the thin one says yes my name is frank mccourt miss and im here to start work
what kind of work would that be now
telegram boy miss
the thin one cackles oh god i thought you were here to clean the
lavatories

thin woman

the telegram boys along the wall are laughing i dont know why but i feel my face turning hot i tell the women thank you and on the way out i hear the thin one jesus above maureen who dragged in that specimen and they laugh along with the telegram boys
aunt aggie says well and i tell her i dont start till monday she says my clothes are a disgrace and what did i wash them in
carbolic soap
they smell like dead pigeons and youre making a laughingstock of the whole family
she takes me to roches stores and buys me a shirt a gansey a pair of short pants two pairs of stockings and a pair of summer shoes on sale she gives me two shillings to have tea and a bun for my birthday she gets on the bus to go back up oconnell street too fat and lazy to walk fat and lazy no son of her own and still she buys me the clothes for my new job
i turn toward arthurs quay with the package of new clothes under my arm and i have to stand at the edge of the river shannon so that the whole world wont see the tears of a man the day hes fourteen
monday morning im up early to wash my face and flatten my hair with water and spit the abbot sees me in my new clothes jaysus he says is it gettin married you are and goes back to sleep
mrs oconnell the fat woman says well well arent we the height of fashion and the thin one miss barry says did you rob a bank on the weekend and theres a great laugh from the telegram boys sitting on the bench along the wall
im told to sit at the end of the bench and wait for my turn to go out with telegrams some telegram boys in uniforms are the permanent ones who took the exam they can stay in the post office forever if they like take the next exam for postman and then the one for clerk that lets them work inside selling stamps and money orders behind the counter downstairs the post office gives permanent boys big waterproof capes for the bad weather and they get two weeks holiday every year everyone says these are good jobs steady and pensionable and respectable and if you get a job like this you never have to worry again in your whole life so you dont
temporary telegram boys are not allowed to stay in the job beyond the age of sixteen there are no uniforms no holidays the pay is less and if you stay out sick a day you can be fired no excuses there are no waterproof capes bring your own raincoat or dodge the raindrops
mrs oconnell calls me to her desk to give me a black leather belt and pouch she says theres a great shortage of bicycles so ill have to walk my first batch of telegrams im to go to the farthest address
first work my way back and dont take all day shes long enough in the post office to know how long it takes to deliver six telegrams even by foot im not to be stopping in pubs or bookies or even home for a cup of tea and if i do ill be found out im not to be stopping in chapels to say a prayer if i have to pray do it on the hoof or on the bicycle if it rains pay no attention deliver the telegrams and dont be a sissy
one telegram is addressed to mrs clohessy of arthurs quay and that couldnt be anyone but paddys mother
is that you frankie mccourt she says god i wouldnt know you youre that big come in will you
shes wearing a bright frock with flowers all over and shiny new shoes there are two children on the floor playing with a toy train on the table there is a teapot cups with saucers a bottle of milk a loaf of bread butter jam there are two beds over by the window where there were none before the big bed in the corner is empty and she must know what im wondering hes gone she says but hes not dead gone t england with paddy have a cup o tay an a bit o bread you need it god help us you look like one left over from the famine itself ate that bread an jam an build yourself up paddy always talked about you and dennis my poor husband that was in the bed never got over the day your mother came an sang the song about the kerry dancing hes over in england now making sandwiches in a canteen and sending me a few bob every week youd wonder what the english are thinking about when they take a man that has the consumption and give him a job making sandwiches paddy has a grand job in a pub in cricklewood which is in england dennis would still be here if it wasnt for paddy climbin the wall for the tongue
tongue
dennis had the craving so he did for a nice sheeps head with a bit of cabbage and a spud so up with me to barry the butcher with the last few shillings i had i boiled that head an sick an all as he was dennis couldnt wait for it to be done he was a demon there in the bed callin for the head an when i gave it to him on the plate he was delighted with himself suckin the marrow outa every inch of that head then he finishes an he says mary where is the tongue
what tongue says i
the tongue of this sheep every sheep is born with a tongue that lets him go ba ba ba and theres a great lack of tongue in this head go up to barry the butcher and demand it
so up with me to barry the butcher and he said that bloody sheep came in here bleatinancryinso much we cut the tongue from her and thrun it to the dog who gobbled it up and ever since ba bas like a sheep and if he doesnt quit ill cut his tongue and throw it to the cat
back i go to dennis and he gets frantic in the bed i want that tongue he says all the nourishment is in the tongue and what do you think happens next but my paddy that was your friend goes up to barry the butcher after dark climbs the wall cuts the tongue of a sheeps head thats on a hook on the wall and brings it back to his poor father in the bed of course i have to boil that tongue with salt galore and dennis god love him ates it lies back in the bed a minute throws back the blanket and stands out on his two feet announcing to the world that consumption or no consumption hes not going to die in that bed if hes going to die at all it might as well be under a german bomb with him
making a few pounds for his family instead of whining in the bed there beyond
she shows me a letter from paddy hes working in his uncle anthonys pub twelve hours a day twentyfive shillings a week and every day soup and a sandwich hes delighted when the germans come over with the bombs so that he can sleep while the pub is closed at night he sleeps on the floor of the hallway upstairs he will send his mother two pounds every month and hes saving the rest to bring her and the family to england where theyll be much better off in one room in cricklewood than ten rooms in arthurs quay shell be able to get a job no bother youd have to be a sad case not to be able to get a job in a country thats at war especially with yanks pouring in and spending money right and left paddy himself is planning to get a job in the middle of london where yanks leave tips big enough to feed an irish family of six for a week
mrs clohessy says we have enough money for food and shoes at last thanks be to god and his blessed mother youll never guess who paddy met over there in england fourteen years of age an workin like a man brendan kiely the one ye used to call question workin he is an savin so he can go an join the mounties an ride all over canada like nelson eddy singin ill be callin you ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh if it wasnt for hitler wed all be dead an isnt that a terrible thing to say and hows your poor mother frankie

at the end of the week mrs oconnell hands me the first wages of
my life a pound my first pound i run down the stairs and up to oconnell street the main street where the lights are on and people are going home from work people like me with wages in their pockets i want them to know im like them im a man i have a pound i walk up one side of oconnell street and down the other and hope theyll notice me they dont i want to wave my pound note at the world so theyll say there he goes frankie mccourt the workingman with a pound in his pocket
its friday night and i can do anything i like i can have fish and chips and go to the lyric cinema no no more lyric i dont have to sit up in the gods anymore with people all around me cheering on the indians killing general custer and the africans chasing tarzan all over the jungle i can go to the savoy cinema now pay sixpence for a seat down front where theres a better class of people eating boxes of chocolates and covering their mouths when they laugh after the film i can have tea and buns in the restaurant upstairs
michael is across the street calling me hes hungry and wonders if theres any chance he could go to the abbots for a bit of bread and stay there for the night instead of going all the way to laman griffins i tell him he doesnt have to worry about a bit of bread well go to the coliseum cafÃ© and have fish and chips all he wants lemonade galore and then well go to see yankee doodle dandy with james cagney and eat two big bars of chocolate after the film we have tea and buns and we sing
and dance like cagney all the way to the abbots michael says it must be great to be in america where people have nothing else to do but sing and dance hes half asleep but he says hes going there some day to sing and dance and would i help him go and when hes asleep i start thinking about america and how i have to save money for my fare instead of squandering it on fish and chips and tea and buns ill have to save a few shillings from my pound because if i dont ill be in limerick forever im fourteen now and if i save something every week surely i should be able to go to america by the time im twenty there are telegrams for offices shops factories where theres no hope of a tip clerks take the telegrams without a look at you or a thank you there are telegrams for the respectable people with maids along the ennis road and the north circular road where theres no hope of a tip maids are like clerks they dont look at you or say thank you there are telegrams for the houses of priests and nuns and they have maids too even if they say poverty is noble if you waited for tips from priests or nuns youd die on their doorstep
there are telegrams for people miles outside the city farmers with muddy yards and dogs who want to eat your legs there are telegrams for rich people in big houses with gate lodges and miles of land surrounded by walls the gatekeeper waves you in and you have to cycle for miles up long drives past lawns flower beds fountains to reach the big house if the weather is fine people are playing croquet the protestant game or strolling around talking and laughing all decked out in flowery dresses and blazers with crests and golden buttons and youd never know there was a war on there are bentleys and rollsroyces parked outside the great front door where a maid tells you go around to the servants entrance dont you know any better
people in the big houses have english accents and they dont tip telegram boys
the best people for tips are widows protestant ministers wives and the poor in general widows know when the telegram money order is due from the english government and they wait by the window you have to be careful if they ask you in for a cup of tea because one of the temporary boys scrawby luby said an old widow of thirtyfive had him in for tea and tried to take down his pants and he had to run out of the house though he was really tempted and had to go to confession the next saturday he said it was very awkward hopping up on the bike with his thing sticking out but if you cycle very fast and think of the sufferings of the virgin mary youll go soft in no time
protestant ministers wives would never carry on like scrawby lubys old widow unless theyre widows themselves christy wallace who is a permanent telegram boy and ready to be a postman any day says protestants dont care what they do even if theyre ministers wives theyre doomed anyway so what does it matter if they have a bit of a romp with a telegram boy all the telegram boys like protestant ministers wives they might have maids but they answer doors themselves and say one moment please and give you sixpence id like to talk to them and ask them how it feels to be doomed but they might get offended and take back the sixpence
the irishmen working in england send their telegram money orders on friday nights and all day saturday and thats when we get the good tips the minute we deliver one batch were out with another
the worst lanes are in the irishtown off high street or mungret street worse than roden lane or okeeffes lane or any lane i lived in there are lanes with channels running down the middle mothers stand at doors and yell gardyloo when they empty their slop buckets children make paper boats or float matchboxes with little sails on the greasy water
when you ride into a lane the children call out heres the telegram boy heres the telegram boy they run to you and the women wait at the door if you give a small child a telegram for his mother hes the hero of the family little girls know theyre supposed to wait till the boys get their chance though they can get the telegram if they have no brothers women at the door will call to you that they have no money now but if youre in this lane tomorrow knock on the door for your tip god bless you an all belongin to you
mrs oconnell and miss barry at the post office tell us every day our job is to deliver telegrams and nothing else we are not to be doing things for people going to the shop for groceries or any other kind of message they dont care if people are dying in the bed they dont care if people are legless lunatic or crawling on the floor we are to deliver the telegram and thats all mrs oconnell says i know everything ye do everything for the people of limerick have their eye on ye and there are reports which i have here in my drawers
a fine place to keep reports says toby mackey under his breath
but mrs oconnell and miss barry dont know what its like in the lane when you knock on a door and someone says come in and you go in and theres no light and theres a pile of rags on a bed in a corner the pile saying who is it and you say telegram and the pile of rags tells you would you ever go to the shop for me im starving with the hunger and id give me two eyes for a cup of tea and what are you going to do say im busy and ride off on your bike and leave the pile of rags there with a telegram money order thats pure useless because the pile of rags is helpless to get out of the bed to go to the post office to cash the bloody money order
what are you supposed to do
youre told never never go to the post office to cash one of those money orders for anyone or youll lose your job forever but what are you supposed to do when an old man that was in the boer war hundreds of years ago says his legs are gone and hed be forever grateful if youd go to paddy considine in the post office and tell him the situation and paddy will surely cash the money order and keep two shillings for yourself grand boy that you are paddy considine says no bother but dont tell anyone or id be out on my arse and so would you son the old man from the boer war says he knows you have telegrams to deliver now but would you ever come back tonight and maybe go to the shop for him for he doesnt have a thing in the house and hes freezing on top of it he sits in an old armchair in the corner covered with bits of blankets and a bucket behind the chair that stinks enough to make you sick and when you look at that old man in the dark corner you want to get a hose with hot water and strip him and wash him down and give him a big feed of rashers and eggs and mashed potatoes with loads of butter salt and onions
i want to take the man from the boer war and the pile of rags in the bed and put them in a big sunny house in the country with birds chirping away outside the window and a stream gurgling
mrs spillane in pump lane off careys road has two crippled twin children with big blond heads small bodies and bits of legs that dangle
over the edges of the chairs they look into the fire all day and say wheres daddy they speak english like everybody else but they babble away to one another in a language they made up hung sup tea tea sup hung mrs spillane says that means when are we getting our supper she tells me shes lucky if her husband sends four pounds a month and shes beside herself with the abuse she gets from the dispensary over him being in england the children are only four and theyre very bright even if they cant walk or take care of themselves if they could walk if they were any way normal shed pack up and move to england out of this godforsaken country that fought so long for freedom and look at the state of us de valera in his mansion above in dublin the dirty oul bastard and the rest of the politicians that can all go to hell god forgive me the priests can go to hell too and i wont ask god to forgive me for saying the likes of that there they are the priests and the nuns telling us jesus was poor and tis no shame lorries driving up to their houses with crates and barrels of whiskey and wine eggs galore and legs of ham and they telling us what we should give up for lent lent my arse what are we to give up when we have lent all year long
i want to take mrs spillane and her two blond crippled children and put them in that house in the country with the pile of rags and the man from the boer war and wash everyone and let them all sit in the sun with the birds singing and the streams gurgling
i cant leave the pile of rags alone with a useless money order because the pile is an old woman mrs gertrude daly all twisted with every class of disease you can get in a limerick lane arthritis rheumatism falling hair a nostril half gone from her jabbing at it with her finger and you wonder what kind of a world is it when this old woman sits up from the rags and smiles at you with teeth that gleam white in the dark her own teeth and perfect
thats right she says me own teeth and when i rot in the grave theyll find me teeth a hundred years from now all white an shiny an ill be declared a saint
the telegram money order three pounds is from her son it has a message happy birthday mammy your fond son teddy she says a wonder he can spare it the little shit trottin around with every tart in piccadilly she asks if id ever do her a favor and cash the money order and get her a little baby powers whiskey at the pub a loaf of bread a pound of lard seven potatoes one for each day of the week would i boil

abbots before the walk home to laman griffins on rainy days he says

when mam comes looking for him i dont know what to say to her i dont know how to look at her and i keep my eyes off to one side she says hows the job as if nothing ever happened in laman griffins and i say grand as if nothing ever happened in laman griffins if the rain is too heavy for her to go home she stays in the small room upstairs with alphie she goes back to lamans the next day but michael stays and soon shes moving in herself bit by bit till she stops going to lamans altogether
the abbot pays the rent every week mam gets the relief and the food dockets till someone informs on her and shes cut off from the dispensary shes told that if her son is bringing in a pound a week thats more than some families get on the dole and she should be grateful he has a job now i have to hand over my wages mam says a pound is that all you get for riding around in all kinds of weather this would be four dollars in america four dollars and you couldnt feed a cat for four dollars in new york if you were delivering telegrams for western union in new york youd be earning twentyfive dollars a week and living in luxury she always translates irish money into american so that she wont forget and tries to convince everyone times were better over there some weeks she lets me keep two shillings but if i go to a film or buy a secondhand book theres nothing left i wont be able to save for my fare and ill be stuck in limerick till im an old man of twentyfive
malachy writes from dublin to say hes fed up and doesnt want to spend the rest of his life blowing a trumpet in the army band hes home in a week and complains when he has to share the big bed with michael alphie and me he had his own army cot up there in dublin with sheets and blankets and a pillow now hes back to overcoats and a bolster that sends up a cloud of feathers when you touch it mam says pity about you im sorry for your troubles the abbot has his own bed and my mother has the small room were all together again no laman tormenting us we make tea and fried bread and sit on the kitchen floor the abbot says youre not supposed to be sitting on kitchen floors what are tables and chairs for he tells mam that frankie is not right in the head and mam says well all catch our death from the damp of the floor we sit on the floor and sing and mam and the abbot sit on chairs she sings are you lonesome tonight and the abbot sings the road to rasheen and we still dont know what his song is about we sit on the floor and tell stories about things that happened things that never happened and things that will happen when we all go to america
there are slow days at the post office and we sit on the bench and talk we can talk but we are not to laugh miss barry says we should be grateful were getting paid to sit there bunch of idlers and streetboys that we are and that there is to be no laughing getting paid for sitting and chatting is no laughing matter and the first titter out of any of us and out we go till we come to our senses and if the tittering continues well be reported to the proper authorities
the boys talk about her under their breath toby mackey says what that oul bitch needs is a good rub o the relic a good rub o the brush her mother was a streetwalking flaghopper and her father escaped from a lunatic asylum with bunions on his balls and warts on his wank
there is laughing along the bench and miss barry calls to us i warned ye against the laughing mackey what is it youre prattling about over there

toby mackey is a temporary telegram boy like me he saw a film
called the front page and now he wants to go to america some day and be a tough newspaper reporter with a hat and a cigarette he keeps a notebook in his pocket because a good reporter has to write down what happens facts he has to write down facts not a lot of bloody poetry which is all you hear in limerick with men in pubs going on about our great sufferings under the english facts frankie he writes down the number of telegrams he delivers and how far he travels we sit on the bench making sure we dont laugh and he tells me that if we deliver forty telegrams a day thats two hundred a week and thats ten thousand a year and twenty thousand in our two years at the job if we cycle one hundred and twentyfive miles in a week thats thirteen thousand miles in two years and thats halfway around the world frankie and no wonder there isnt a scrap of flesh on our arses
toby says nobody knows limerick like the telegram boy we know every avenue road street terrace mews place close lane jasus says toby there isnt a door in limerick we dont know we knock on all kinds of doors iron oak plywood twenty thousand doors frankie we rap kick push we ring and buzz bells we shout and whistle telegram boy telegram boy we drop telegrams in letter boxes shove them under doors throw them over the transom we climb in windows where people are bedridden we fight off every dog who wants to turn us into dinner you never know whats going to happen when you hand people their telegrams they laugh and sing and dance and cry and scream and fall down in a weakness and you wonder if theyll wake up at all and give you the tip its not a bit like delivering telegrams in america where mickey rooney rides around in a film called the human comedy and people are pleasant and falling over themselves to give you a tip inviting you in giving you a cup of tea and a bun
toby mackey says he has facts galore in his notebook and he doesnt give a fiddlers fart about anything and thats the way id like to be myself
mrs oconnell knows i like the country telegrams and if a day is sunny she gives me a batch of ten that will keep me away all morning and i dont have to return till after the dinner hour at noon there are fine autumn days when the shannon sparkles and the fields are green and glinting with silver morning dew smoke blows across fields and theres the sweet smell of turf fires cows and sheep graze in the fields and i wonder if these are the beasts the priest was talking about i wouldnt be surprised because theres no end to the bulls climbing on cows rams on sheep stallions on mares and they all have such big things it makes me break out in a sweat to look at them and i feel sorry for all the female creatures in the world who have to suffer like that though i wouldnt mind being a bull myself because they can do what they like and its never a sin for an animal i wouldnt mind going at myself here but you never know when a farmer might come along the road driving cows and sheep to a fair or to another field raising his stick and bidding you good day young fella grand morning thank god and his blessed mother a farmer that religious might be offended if he saw you breaking the sixth commandment forninst his field horses like to stick their heads over fences and hedges to see whats passing by and i stop and talk to them because they have big eyes and long noses that show how intelligent they are sometimes two birds will be singing to each other across a field and i have to stop and listen to them and if i stay long enough more birds will join till every tree and bush is alive with birdsong if theres a stream gurgling under a bridge on the road birds singing and cows mooing and lambs baaing thats better than any band in a film the smell of dinner bacon and cabbage wafting from a farmhouse makes me so weak with the hunger i climb into a field and stuff myself with blackberries for half an hour i stick my face into the stream and drink icy water thats better than the lemonade in any fish and chip shop
when im finished delivering the telegrams theres enough time to go to the ancient monastery graveyard where my mothers relations are buried the guilfoyles and the sheehans where my mother wants to be buried i can see from here the high ruins of carrigogunnell castle and theres plenty of time to cycle there sit up on the highest wall look at the shannon flowing out to the atlantic on its way to america and dream of the day ill be sailing off myself
the boys at the post office tell me im lucky to get the carmody family telegram a shilling tip one of the biggest tips youll ever get in limerick so why am i getting it im the junior boy they say well sometimes theresa carmody answers the door she has the consumption and theyre afraid of catching it from her shes seventeen in and out of the sanatorium and shell never see eighteen the boys at the post office say sick people like theresa know theres little time left and that makes them mad for love and romance and everything everything thats what the consumption does to you say the boys at the post office
i cycle through wet november streets thinking of that shilling tip and as i turn into the carmody street the bicycle slides out from under me and i skid along the ground scraping my face and tearing open the back of my hand theresa carmody opens the door she has red hair she had green eyes like the fields beyond limerick her cheeks are bright pink and her skin is a fierce white she says oh youre all wet and bleeding
i skidded on my bike
come in and ill put something on your cuts
i wonder should i go in i might get the consumption and that will be the end of me i want to be alive when im fifteen and i want the shilling tip come in youll perish standing there
she puts on the kettle for the tea then she dabs iodine on my cuts and i try to be a man and not whimper she says oh youre a great bit of a man go into the parlor and dry yourself before the fire look why dont you take off your pants and dry them on the screen of the fire
ah no
ah do
i will
i drape my pants over the screen i sit there watching the steam
rise and i watch myself rise and i worry she might come in and see me in my excitement
there she is with a plate of bread and jam and two cups of tea lord she says you might be a scrawny bit of a fellow but thats a fine boyo you have there
she puts the plate and the cups on a table by the fire and there they stay with her thumb and forefinger she takes the tip of my excitement and leads me across the room to a green sofa against the wall and all the time my head is filled with sin and iodine and fear of consumption and the shilling tip and her green eyes and shes on the sofa dont stop or ill die and shes crying and im crying for i dont know whats happening to me if im killing myself catching consumption from her mouth im riding to heaven im falling off a cliff and if this is a sin i dont give a fiddlers fart
we take our ease on the sofa a while till she says dont you have more telegrams to deliver and when we sit up she gives a little cry oh im bleeding
whats up with you
i think its because its the first time
i tell her wait a minute i bring the bottle from the kitchen and
splash the iodine on her injury she leaps from the sofa dances around the parlor like a wild one and runs into the kitchen to douse herself with water after she dries herself she says lord youre very innocent youre not supposed to be pouring iodine on girls like that
i thought you were cut
for weeks after that i deliver the telegram sometimes we have the excitement on the sofa but there are other days she has the cough and you can see the weakness on her she never tells me she has the weakness she never tells me she has the consumption the boys at the post office say i must have been having a great time with the shilling tip and theresa carmody i never tell them i stopped taking the shilling tip i never tell them about the green sofa and the excitement i never tell them of the pain that comes when she opens the door and i can see the weakness on her and all i want to do then is make tea for her and sit with my arms around her on the green sofa
one saturday im told to deliver the telegram to theresas mother at her job in woolworths i try to be casual mrs carmody i always deliver the telegram to your i think your daughter theresa
yes shes in the hospital
is she in the sanatorium
i said shes in the hospital
shes like everyone else in limerick ashamed of the tb and she
doesnt give me a shilling or any kind of tip i cycle out to the
sanatorium to see theresa they say you have to be a relation and you have to be adult i tell them im her cousin and ill be fifteen in august they tell me go away i cycle to the franciscan church to pray for theresa st francis would you please talk to god tell him it wasnt theresas fault i could have refused that telegram saturday after saturday tell god theresa was not responsible for the excitement on the sofa because thats what the consumption does to you it doesnt matter anyway st francis because i love theresa i love her as much as you love any bird or beast or fish and will you tell god take the consumption away and i promise ill never go near her again
the next saturday they give me the carmody telegram from halfway up the street i can see the blinds are drawn i can see the black crepe wreath on the door i can see the white purplelined mourning card i can see beyond the door and walls where theresa and i tumbled naked and wild on the green sofa and i know now she is in hell and all because of me
i slip the telegram under the door and cycle back down to the franciscan church to beg for the repose of theresas soul i pray to every statue to the stained glass windows the stations of the cross i swear ill lead a life of faith hope and charity poverty chastity and obedience
next day sunday i go to four masses i do the stations of the cross three times i say rosaries all day i go without food and drink and wherever i find a quiet place i cry and beg god and the virgin mary to have mercy on the soul of theresa carmody
on monday i follow the funeral to the graveyard on my post office bicycle i stand behind a tree a distance from the grave mrs carmody weeps and moans mr carmody snuffles and looks puzzled the priest recites the latin prayers and sprinkles the coffin with holy water
i want to go to the priest to mr and mrs carmody i want to tell them how im the one who sent theresa to hell they can do whatever they like with me abuse me revile me throw grave dirt at me but i stay behind the tree till the mourners leave and the grave diggers fill in the grave
frost is already whitening the fresh earth on the grave and i think of theresa cold in the coffin the red hair the green eyes i cant understand the feelings going through me but i know that with all the people who died in my family and all the people who died in the lanes around me and all the people who left i never had a pain like this in my heart and i hope i never will again
its getting dark i walk my bicycle out of the graveyard i have telegrams to deliver
xvi
mrs oconnell gives me telegrams to deliver to mr harrington the englishman with the dead wife that was born and bred in limerick the boys at the post office say sympathy telegrams are a waste of time people just cry and moan with the grief and they think theyre excused from the tip theyll ask you if youd like to come in for a look at the departed and a prayer by the bed that wouldnt be so bad if they offered you a drop of sherry and a ham sandwich oh no theyre happy to get your prayer but youre only a telegram boy and youre lucky if you get a
dry biscuit older boys at the post office say you have to play your cards right to get the grief tip if youre asked in to say a prayer you have to kneel by the corpse give a powerful sigh bless yourself drop your forehead to the bedclothes so they wont see your face let your shoulders shake like one collapsing with sorrow hold on to the bed with your two hands as if theyre going to have to tear you away to deliver the rest of your telegrams make sure your cheeks are glinting with tears or the spit you dabbed on and if you dont get a tip after all that push the next batch of telegrams under the door or fire them over the transom and leave them to their grief
this isnt my first time delivering telegrams to the harrington house mr harrington is always away on business for the insurance company and mrs harrington is generous with the tip but shes gone and mr harrington answers the doorbell his eyes are red and he sniffles he says are you irish

into my mouth
he collapses into a chair oh god god what am i to do must rest
a moment
my stomach heaves i rush to the window stick my head out and
throw up he leaps from the chair and charges me
you you god blast you to hell you vomited on my wifes rosebush he lunges at me misses falls to the floor i climb out the
window hang on to the ledge hes at the window grabbing at my hands i let go drop to the rosebush into the ham sandwich and sherry ive just thrown up im pricked by rose thorns stung my ankle is twisted hes at the window barking come back here you irish runt hell report me to the post office he hits me in the back with the whiskey bottle pleads will you not watch one hour with me
he pelts me with sherry glasses whiskey glasses assorted ham sandwiches items from his wifes dressing table powders creams brushes
i climb on my bike and wobble through the streets of limerick dizzy with sherry and pain mrs oconnell attacks me seven telegrams one address and youre gone all day
i was i was
you was you was drunk is what you was drunk is what you are reeking oh we heard that nice man rang mr harrington lovely englishman that sounds like james mason lets you in to say a prayer for his poor wife and next thing youre out the window with the sherry and the ham your poor mother what she brought into the world
he made me eat the ham drink the sherry
made you jesus thats a good one made you mr harrington is a refined englishman and there is no reason for him to lie and we dont want your kind in this post office people that cant keep their hands off the ham and sherry so hand in your telegram pouch and bicycle for your days are done in this post office
but i need the job i have to save and go to america
america sad day when america lets in the likes of you
i hobble through the streets of limerick id like to go back and
throw a brick through mr harringtons window no respect for the dead ill go across the sarsfield bridge and out the riverbank where i can lie down somewhere in the bushes i dont know how i can go home and tell my mother i lost my job have to go home have to tell her cant stay out the riverbank all night shed be frantic
mam begs the post office to take me back they say no they never heard the likes telegram boy mauling corpse telegram boy fleeing scene with ham and sherry he will never set foot in the post office again no
she gets a letter from the parish priest take the boy back says the parish priest oh yes father indeed says the post office theyll
let me stay till my sixteenth birthday not a minute longer besides says mrs oconnell when you think of what the english did to us for eight hundred years that man had no right to complain over a little ham and sherry compare a little ham and sherry to the great famine and where are you if my poor husband was alive and i told him what you did hed say you struck a blow frank mccourt struck a blow
every saturday morning i swear ill go to confession and tell the priest of my impure acts at home on lonely boreens around limerick with cows and sheep gawking on the heights of carrigogunnell with the world looking up
ill tell him about theresa carmody and how i sent her to hell and that will be the end of me driven from the church
theresa is a torment to me every time i deliver a telegram to her street every time i pass the graveyard i feel the sin growing in me like an abscess and if i dont go to confession soon ill be nothing but an abscess riding around on a bicycle with people pointing and telling each other there he is theres frankie mccourt the dirty thing that sent theresa carmody to hell
i look at people going to communion on sundays everyone in a state of grace returning to their seats with god in their mouths peaceful easy ready to die at any moment and go straight to heaven or go home to their rashers and eggs without a worry in the world
im worn out from being the worst sinner in limerick i want to get rid of this sin and have rashers and eggs and no guilt no torment i want to be ordinary
the priests tell us all the time that gods mercy is infinite but how can any priest give absolution to someone like me who delivers telegrams and winds up in a state of excitement on a green sofa with a girl dying of the galloping consumption
i cycle all around limerick with telegrams and stop at every church i ride from redemptorists to jesuits to augustinians to dominicans to franciscans i kneel before the statue of st francis of assisi and beg him to help me but i think hes too disgusted with me i kneel with people in the pews next to confessionals but when my turn comes i cant breathe my heart pounds my forehead turns cold and clammy and i run from the church
i swear ill go to confession at christmas i cant easter i cant weeks and months pass and its a year since theresa died ill go on her anniversary but i cant im fifteen now and i pass churches without stopping ill have to wait till i go to america where there are priests like bing crosby in going my way who wont kick me out of the confessional like limerick priests
i still have the sin in me the abscess and i hope it doesnt kill me entirely before i see the american priest
theres a telegram for an old woman mrs brigid finucane she says how old are you by
fifteen and a half mrs finucane
young enough to make a fool of yourself and ould enough to know better are you shmart by are you anyway intelligent
i can read and write mrs finucane
arrah there are people above in the lunatic asylum can read and write can you write a letter
i can
she wants me to write letters to her customers if you need a suit or dress for your child you can go to her she gives you a ticket to a shop and they give you the clothes she gets a discount and charges you the full price and interest on top you pay her back weekly some of her customers fall behind in their payments and they need threatening letters she says ill give you threepence for every letter you write and another threepence if it brings a payment if you want the job come here on thursday and friday nights and bring your own paper and envelopes
im desperate for that job i want to go to america but i have no money for paper and envelopes next day im delivering a telegram to woolworths and there is the answer a whole section packed with paper and envelopes i have no money so i have to help myself but how two dogs save the day for me two dogs at the door of woolworths stuck together after the excitement they yelp and run in circles customers and sales clerks giggle and pretend to be looking someplace else and while theyre busy pretending i slip paper and envelopes under my sweater out the door and off on my bike far from stuck dogs
mrs finucane looks suspicious thats very fancy stationery you have there by is that your mothers youll give that back when you get the money wont you by
oh i will
from now on im never to come to her front door theres a lane behind her house and im to come in the back door for fear someone might see me
in a large ledger she gives me the names and addresses of six customers behind in their payments threaten em by frighten the life out of em
my first letter
dear mrs obrien
inasmuch as you have not seen fit to pay me what you owe me i may be forced to resort to legal action theres your son michael parading around the world in his new suit which i paid for while i myself have barely a crust to keep body and soul together i am sure you dont want to languish in the dungeons of limerick jail far from friends and family
i remain yours in litigious anticipation mrs brigid finucane she tells me thats a powerful letter by better than anything youd read in the limerick leader that word inasmuch thats a holy terror of a word what does it mean
i think it means this is your last chance
i write five more letters and she gives me money for stamps on my way to the post office i think why should i squander money on stamps when i have two legs to deliver the letters myself in the dead of night when youre poor a threatening letter is a threatening letter no matter how it comes in the door
i run through the lanes of limerick shoving letters under doors praying no one will see me
the next week mrs finucane is squealing with joy four of em paid oh sit down now and write more by put the fear of god in em
week after week my threatening letters grow sharper and sharper i begin to throw in words i hardly understand myself
dear mrs obrien
inasmuch as you have not succumbed to the imminence of litigation in our previous epistle be advised that we are in consultation with our barrister above in dublin
next week mrs obrien pays she came in tremblin with tears in her eyes by and she promised shed never miss another payment
on friday nights mrs finucane sends me to a pub for a bottle of sherry youre too young for sherry by you can make yourself a nice cup of tea but you have to use the tea leaves left over from this morning no you cant have a piece of bread with the prices theyre charging bread is it next thing youll be asking for an egg
she rocks by the fire sipping her sherry counting the money in the purse on her lap entering payments in her ledger before she locks everything in the trunk under her bed upstairs after a few sherries she tells me what a lovely thing it is to have a little money so you can leave it to the church for masses to be said for the repose of your soul it makes her so happy to think of priests saying masses for her years and years after shes dead and buried
sometimes she falls asleep and if the purse drops to the floor i help myself to an extra few shillings for the overtime and the use of all the big new words there will be less money for the priests and their masses but how many masses does a soul need and surely im entitled to a few pounds after the way the church slammed doors in my face they wouldnt let me be an altar boy a secondary school pupil a missionary with the white fathers i dont care i have a post office savings account and if i keep writing successful threatening letters helping myself to the odd few shillings from her purse and keeping the stamp money ill have my escape money to america if my whole family dropped from the hunger i wouldnt touch this money in the post office
often i have to write threatening letters to neighbors and friends of my mother and i worry they might discover me they complain to mam that oul bitch finucane below in irishtown sent me a threatening letter what kind of a demon outa hell would torment her own kind with a class of a letter that i cant make head nor tail of anyway with words never heard on land or sea the person that would write that letter is worse than judas or any informer for the english
my mother says anyone that writes such letters should be boiled in oil and have his fingernails pulled out by blind people
im sorry for their troubles but theres no other way for me to save the money for america i know that someday ill be a rich yank and send home hundreds of dollars and my family will never have to worry about threatening letters again

she whispers to miss barry and they look at me and shake their heads

she keeps talking past me again to the boys on the bench

xvii
i dont know why mrs oconnell had to shame me before the whole world and i dont think im too good for the post office or anything else how could i with my hair sticking up pimples dotting my face my eyes red and oozing yellow my teeth crumbling with the rot no shoulders no flesh on my arse after cycling thirteen thousand miles to deliver twenty thousand telegrams to every door in limerick and regions beyond
mrs oconnell said a long time ago she knew everything about every telegram boy she must know about the times i went at myself on top of carrigogunnell milkmaids gawking little boys looking up
she must know about theresa carmody and the green sofa how i got her into a state of sin and sent her to hell the worst sin of all worse than carrigogunnell a thousand times she must know i never went to confession after theresa that im doomed to hell myself
a person that commits a sin like that is never too good for the post office or anything else
the barman at souths remembers me from the time i sat with mr hannon bill galvin uncle pa keating black white black he remembers my father how he spent his wages and his dole while singing patriotic songs and making speeches from the dock like a condemned rebel
and what is it youd like says the barman
im here to meet uncle pa keating and have my first pint
oh begod is that a fact hell be here in a minute and sure
theres no reason why i shouldnt draw his pint and maybe draw your first pint is there now
there isnt sir
uncle pa comes in and tells me sit next to him against the wall the barman brings the pints uncle pa pays lifts his glass tells the men in the pub this is my nephew frankie mccourt son of angela sheehan the sister of my wife having his first pint heres to your health and long life frankie may you live to enjoy the pint but not too much
the men lift their pints nod drink and there are creamy lines on their lips and mustaches i take a great gulp of my pint and uncle pa tells me slow down for the love o jasus dont drink it all theres more where that came from as long as the guinness family stays strong and healthy
i tell him i want to stand him a pint with my last wages from the post office but he says no take the money home to your mother and you can stand me a pint when you come home from america flushed with success and the heat from a blonde hanging on your arm
the men in the pub are talking about the terrible state of the world and how in gods name hermann goering escaped the hangman an hour before the hanging the yanks are over there in nuremberg declaring they dont know how the nazi bastard hid that pill was it in his ear up his nostril up his arse surely the yanks looked in every hole and cranny of every nazi they captured and still hermann wiped their eye there you are it shows you can sail across the atlantic land in normandy bomb germany off the face of the earth but when alls said and done they cant find a little pill planted in the far reaches of goerings fat arse
uncle pa buys me another pint its harder to drink because it fills me and makes my belly bulge the men are talking about
concentration camps and the poor jews that never harmed a soul men women children crammed into ovens children mind you what harm could they do little shoes scattered everywhere crammed in and the pub is misty and the voices fading in and out uncle pa says are you all right youre as white as a sheet he takes me to the lavatory and the two of us have a good long piss against the wall which keeps moving back and forth i cant go into the pub again cigarette smoke stale guinness goerings fat arse small shoes scattered cant go in again good night uncle pa thanks and he tells me go straight home to my mother straight home oh he doesnt know about the excitement in the loft or the excitement on the green sofa or me in such a state of doom that if i died now id be in hell in a wink
uncle pa goes back to his pint im out on oconnell street and why shouldnt i take the few steps to the jesuits and tell all my sins this last night ill be fifteen i ring the bell at the priestshouse and a big man answers yes i tell him i want to go to confession father he says im not a priest dont call me father im a brother

he says ring this bell again and ill break your hand
jesuit brothers are not supposed to talk like that theyre supposed to be like our lord not walking the world threatening peoples hands

laman griffin oul drunkard with the snotty nose and his loft and people climbing up there with him
she walks away from me and i follow her upstairs to the small room she turns leave me alone leave me alone and i keep barking at her
laman griffin laman griffin till she pushes me get out of this room and i slap her on the cheek so that tears jump in her eyes and theres a small whimpering sound from her youll never have the chance to do that again and i back away from her because theres another sin on my long list and im ashamed of myself
i fall into my bed clothes and all and wake up in the middle of the night puking on my pillow my brothers complaining of the stink telling me clean up im a disgrace i hear my mother crying and i want to tell her im sorry but why should i after what she did with laman griffin
in the morning my small brothers are gone to school malachy is out looking for a job mam is at the fire drinking tea i place my wages on the table by her elbow and turn to go she says do you want a cup of tea

she calls up the lane after me you should have something in your
stomach but i give her my back and turn the corner without answering i still want to tell her im sorry but if i do ill want to tell her shes the cause of it all that she should not have climbed to the loft that night and i dont give a fiddlers fart anyway because im still writing threatening letters for mrs finucane and saving to go to america
i have the whole day before i go to mrs finucane to write the threatening letters and i wander down henry street till the rain drives me into the franciscan church where st francis stands with his birds and lambs i look at him and wonder why i ever prayed to him no i didnt pray i begged
i begged him to intercede for theresa carmody but he never did a thing stood up there on his pedestal with the little smile the birds the lambs and didnt give a fiddlers fart about theresa or me
im finished with you st francis moving on francis i dont know why they ever gave me that name id be better off if they called me malachy one a king the other a great saint why didnt you heal theresa why did you let her go to hell you let my mother climb to the loft you let me get into a state of doom little childrens shoes scattered in concentration camps i have the abscess again its in my chest and im hungry
st francis is no help he wont stop the tears bursting out of my two eyes the sniffling and choking and the god oh gods that have me on my knees with my head on the back of the pew before me and im so weak with the hunger and the crying i could fall on the floor and would you please help me god or st francis because im sixteen today and i hit my mother and sent theresa to hell and wanked all over limerick and the county beyond and i dread the millstone around my neck
there is an arm around my shoulders a brown robe click of black rosary beads a franciscan priest

he doesnt help me anymore
but you love him dont you

then tell him well sit here and youll tell him the things that

i talk to st francis and tell him about margaret oliver eugene my father singing roddy mccorley and bringing home no money my father sending no money from england theresa and the green sofa my terrible sins on carrigogunnell why couldnt they hang hermann goering for what he did to the little children with shoes scattered around concentration camps the christian brother who closed the door in my face the time they wouldnt let me be an altar boy my small brother michael walking up the lane with the broken shoe clacking my bad eyes that im ashamed of the jesuit brother who closed the door in my face the tears in mams eyes when i slapped her
father gregory says would you like to sit and be silent perhaps pray a few minutes
his brown robe is rough against my cheek and theres a smell of soap he looks at st francis and the tabernacle and nods and i suppose hes talking to god then he tells me kneel gives me absolution tells me say three hail marys three our fathers three glory bes he tells me god forgives me and i must forgive myself that god loves me and i must love myself for only when you love god in yourself can you love all gods creatures
but i want to know about theresa carmody in hell father
no my child she is surely in heaven she suffered like the martyrs in olden times and god knows thats penance enough you can be sure the sisters in the hospital didnt let her die without a priest
are you sure father
i am my child
he blesses me again asks me to pray for him and im happy
trotting through the rainy streets of limerick knowing theresa is in heaven with the cough gone
monday morning and its dawn in the railway station newspapers and magazines are piled in bundles along the platform wall mr mccaffrey is there with another boy willie harold cutting the twine on the bundles counting entering the count in a ledger english newspapers and the irish times have to be delivered early magazines later in the morning we count out the papers and label them for delivery to shops around the city
mr mccaffrey drives the van and stays at the wheel while willie and i run into shops with bundles and take orders for the next day add or drop in the ledger after the papers are delivered we unload the magazines at the office and go home to breakfast for fifty minutes
when i return to the office there are two other boys eamon and peter already sorting magazines counting and stuffing them into news agents boxes along the wall small orders are delivered by gerry halvey on his messenger bicycle big orders in the van mr mccaffrey tells me stay in the office so that i can learn to count magazines and enter them in the ledger the minute mr mccaffrey leaves eamon and peter pull out a drawer where they hide cigarette butts and light up they cant believe i dont smoke they want to know if theres something wrong with me the bad eyes or the consumption maybe how can you go out with a girl if you dont smoke peter says wouldnt you be a right eejit if you were going out the road with the girl and she asked you for a fag and you said you didnt smoke wouldnt you be a right eejit then how would you ever get her into a field for a bit of a feel eamon says tis what my father says about men who dont drink theyre not to be trusted peter says if you find a man that wont drink or smoke thats a man thats not even interested in girls and youd want to keep your hand over the hole of your arse thats what youd want to be doing
they laugh and that brings on the cough and the more they laugh the more they cough till theyre holding on to one another banging one another between the shoulder blades and wiping tears from their cheeks when the fit passes we pick out english and american magazines and look at the advertisements for womens underwear brassieres and panties and long nylon stockings eamon is looking at an american magazine called see with pictures of japanese girls who keep the soldiers happy so far away from home and eamon says he has to go to the lavatory and when he does peter gives me a wink you know what hes up to in there dont you and sometimes mr mccaffrey gets into a state when boys linger in the lavatory interfering with themselves and wasting the valuable time for which easons is paying them and on top of it putting their immortal souls in danger mr mccaffrey wont come right out and say stop that wanking because you cant accuse someone of a mortal sin unless you have proof sometimes he goes snooping in the lavatory when a boy comes out he comes back himself with the threatening look and tells the boys ye are not to be looking at those dirty magazines from foreign parts ye are to count them and put them in the boxes and thats all
eamon comes back from the lavatory and peter goes in with an american magazine colliers that has pictures of girls in a beauty contest eamon says do you know what hes doing in there at himself five times a day he goes in every time a new american magazine comes in with the womens underwear he goes in never done going at himself borrows magazines to take home unbeknownst to mr mccaffrey and god knows what he does with himself and the magazines all night if he fell dead in there the jaws of hell would open wide
id like to get into the lavatory myself when peter comes out but i dont want them saying there he goes new boy first day on the job already at himself wont light up a fag oh no but wanks away like an oul billygoat
mr mccaffrey returns from van delivery and wants to know why all the magazines arent counted out bundled and ready to go peter tells him we were busy teaching the new boy mccourt god help us he was a
bit slow with the bad eyes you know but we kept at him and now hes getting faster
gerry halvey the messenger boy wont be in for a week because hes entitled to his holidays and he wants to spend the time with his girlfriend rose whos coming back from england im the new boy and i have to be messenger boy while hes gone cycling around limerick on the bicycle with the big metal basket in front he shows me how to balance papers and magazines so that the bicycle wont tip over with me in the saddle and a lorry passing by that will run over me and leave me like a piece of salmon in the road he saw a soldier once that was run over by an army lorry and thats what he looked like salmon
gerry is making a last delivery at easons kiosk at the railway station at noon on saturday and thats handy because i can meet him there to get the bicycle and he can meet rose off the train we stand at the gate waiting and he tells me he hasnt seen rose in a year shes over there working in a pub in bristol and he doesnt like that one bit because the english are forever pawing the irish girls hands up under the skirts and worse and the irish girls are afraid to say anything for fear of losing their jobs everyone knows irish girls keep themselves pure especially limerick girls known the world over for their purity who have a man to come back to like gerry halvey himself hell be able to tell if she was true to him by her walk if a girl comes back after a year with a certain class of a walk thats different from the one she went away with then you know she was up to no good with the englishmen dirty horny bastards that they are
the train hoots into the station and gerry waves and points to rose coming toward us from the far end of the train rose smiling away with her white teeth and lovely in a green dress gerry stops waving and mutters under his breath look at the walk on her bitch hoor street walker flaghopper trollop and runs from the station rose walks up to me was that gerry halvey you were standing with

of course im here and i ride away on the messenger bicycle with the sign on the basket that says easons wondering about the way hes kissing her now and the terrible things he said about her in the station and wondering how peter in the office could tell mr mccaffrey a barefaced lie about me and my eyes when all the time he and eamon were looking at girls in their underwear and then going at themselves in the lavatory
mr mccaffrey is in a terrible state in the office where were you great god above in heaven does it take you all day to cycle from the railway station we have an emergency here and we should have halvey but hes gone off on his friggin holidays god forgive the language and youll have to cycle around as fast as you can good thing you were a telegram boy that knows every inch of limerick and go to every bloody shop thats a customer and walk right in grab whatever copies you see of john olondons weekly tear out page sixteen and if anyone bothers you tell them tis government orders and theyre not to interfere in government business and if they lay a finger on you theyre liable to arrest imprisonment and a large fine now go for gods sake and bring back every page sixteen you tear out so that we can burn them here in the fire
every shop mr mccaffrey

im jumping on the bike and eamon runs down the steps hey mccourt wait listen dont give him all the page sixteens when you come back

whats birth control

im about to push away on the bike when mr mccaffrey runs down the steps hold on mccourt well go in the van eamon you come with us
what about peter
leave him hell wind up with a magazine in the lavatory anyway mr mccaffrey talks to himself in the van nice bloody how do you
do ringing down here from dublin on a fine saturday to send us tearing around limerick ripping pages out of an english magazine when i could be at home with a cup of tea and a nice bun and a read of the irish press with my feet up on a box under the picture of the sacred heart nice bloody how do you do entirely
mr mccaffrey runs into every shop with us behind him he grabs the magazines hands each of us a pile and tells us start tearing shop owners scream at him what are ye doing jesus mary and holy st joseph is it pure mad ye are put back them magazines or ill call the guards
mr mccaffrey tells them government orders maam there is filth in john olondon this week thats not fit for any irish eyes and we are here to do gods work what filth
what filth show me the filth before ye go mutilatin the magazines i wont pay easons for these magazines so i wont
maam we dont care at easons wed rather lose large amounts than have the people of limerick and ireland corrupted by this filth
what filth
cant tell you come on boys
we throw the pages on the floor of the van and when mr mccaffrey
is in a shop arguing we stuff some into our shirts there are old magazines in the van and we tear and scatter them so that mr mccaffrey will think theyre all page sixteen from john olondon
the biggest customer for the magazine mr hutchinson tells mr mccaffrey get to hell out of his shop or hell brain him get away from them magazines and when mr mccaffrey keeps on tearing out pages mr hutchinson throws him into the street mr mccaffrey yelling that this is a catholic country and just because hutchinson is a protestant that doesnt give him the right to sell filth in the holiest city in ireland mr hutchinson says ah kiss my arse and mr mccaffrey says see boys see what happens when youre not a member of the true church
some shops says theyve already sold all their copies of john olondon and mr mccaffrey says oh mother ogod whats going to become of us all who did ye sell them to
he demands the names and address of the customers who are in danger of losing their immortal souls from reading articles on birth control he will go to their houses and rip out that filthy page but the shopkeepers say tis saturday night mccaffrey and getting dark and would you ever take a good running jump for yourself
on the way back to the office eamon whispers to me in the back of the van i have twentyone pages how many do you have i tell him fourteen but i have over forty and im not telling him because you never have to tell the truth to people who lie about your bad eyes mr mccaffrey tells us bring in the pages from the van we scoop up everything on the floor and hes happy sitting at his desk at the other end of the office ringing dublin to tell them how he stormed through
shops like gods avenger and saved limerick from the horrors of birth control while he watches a dancing fire of pages that have nothing to do with john olondons weekly
monday morning i cycle through the streets delivering magazines and people see the easons sign on the bike and stop me to see if theres any chance they could get their hands on a copy of john olondons weekly theyre all rich looking people some in motor cars men with hats collars and ties and two fountain pens in their pockets women with hats and little bits of fur dangling from their shoulders people who have tea at the savoy or the stella and stick out their little fingers to show how well bred they are and now want to read this page about birth control
eamon told me early in the day dont sell the bloody page for less than five shillings i asked him if he was joking no he wasnt everyone in limerick is talking about this page and theyre dying to get their hands on it
five shillings or nothing frankie if theyre rich charge more but thats what im charging so dont be going around on your bicycle and puttin me out of business with low prices we have to give peter something or hell be running to mccaffrey and spilling the beans
some people are willing to pay seven shillings and sixpence and im rich in two days with over ten pounds in my pocket minus one for peter the snake who would betray us to mccaffrey i put eight pounds in the post office for my fare to america and that night we have a big supper of ham tomatoes bread butter jam mam wants to know if i won the sweepstakes and i tell her people give me tips shes not happy im a messenger boy because thats the lowest you can drop in limerick but if it brings in ham like this we should light a candle in gratitude she doesnt know the money for my fare is growing in the post office and shed die if she knew what i was earning from writing threatening letters
malachy has a new job in the stockroom of a garage handing out parts to mechanics and mam herself is taking care of an old man mr sliney out in the south circular road while his two daughters go off to work every day she tells me if im delivering papers out there to come to the house for tea and a sandwich the daughters will never know and the old man wont mind because hes only half conscious most of the time worn out from all his years in the english army in india
she looks peaceful in the kitchen of this house in her spotless apron everything clean and polished around her flowers bobbing in the garden beyond birds chirping away music from radio eireann on the wireless she sits at the table with a pot of tea cups and saucers plenty of bread butter cold meats of all kinds i can have any class of a sandwich but all i know is ham and brawn she doesnt have any brawn because thats the kind of thing youd find people eating in lanes not in a house on the south circular road she says the rich wont eat brawn because its what they scoop off floors and counters in bacon factories and you never know what youre getting the rich are very particular about what they stick between two slices of bread over in america brawn is called head cheese and she doesnt know why
she gives me a ham sandwich with juicy slices of tomato and tea in a cup with little pink angels flying around shooting arrows at other little flying angels who are blue and i wonder why they cant make teacups and chamber pots without all kinds of angels and maidens cavorting in the glen mam says thats the way the rich are they love
the bit of decoration and wouldnt we if we had the money shed give her two eyes to have a house like this with flowers and birds abroad in the garden and the wireless playing that lovely warsaw concerto or the dream of olwyn and no end of cups and saucers with angels shooting arrows
she says she has to look in on mr sliney hes so old and feeble he forgets to call for the chamber pot
chamber pot you have to empty his chamber pot
of course i do theres a silence here because i think were remembering the cause of all our troubles laman griffins chamber pot but that was a long time ago and now its mr slineys chamber pot which is no harm because shes paid for this and hes harmless when she comes back she tells me mr sliney would like to see me so come in while hes awake
hes lying in a bed in the front parlor the window blocked with a black sheet no sign of light he tells my mother lift me up a bit missus and pull back that bloody thing off the window so i can see the boy he has long white hair down to his shoulders mam whispers he wont let anyone cut it he says i have me own teeth son would you credit that do you have your own teeth son
i do mr sliney
ah i was in india you know me and timoney up the road bunch of limerick men in india do you know timoney son

whisper in your ear what i want to tell you is never smoke another mans pipe

halvey goes off to england with rose and i have to stay on the messenger bike all through the winter its a bitter winter ice everywhere and i never know when the bike will go out from under me and send me flying into the street or onto the pavement magazines and papers scattered shops complain to mr mccaffrey that the irish times is coming in decorated with bits of ice and dog shit and he mutters to us thats the way that paper should be delivered protestant rag that it is
every day after my deliveries i take the irish times home and read it to see where the danger is mam says its a good thing dad isnt here hed say is this what the men of ireland fought and died for that my own son is sitting there at the kitchen table reading the freemason paper
there are letters to the editor from people all over ireland claiming they heard the first cuckoo of the year and you can read between the lines that people are calling each other liars there are reports about protestant weddings and pictures and the women always look lovelier than the ones we know in the lanes you can see protestant women have perfect teeth although halveys rose had lovely teeth
i keep reading the irish times and wondering if its an occasion of sin though i dont care as long as theresa carmody is in heaven not
coughing i dont go to confession anymore i read the irish times and thetimes of london because that tells me what the king is up to every day and what elizabeth and margaret are doing
i read english womens magazines for all the food articles and the answers to womens questions peter and eamon put on english accents and pretend theyre reading from english womens magazines
peter says dear miss hope im going out with a fellow from ireland named mccaffrey and he has his hands all over me and his thing pushing against my belly button and im demented not knowing what to do i remain yours anxiously miss lulu smith yorkshire
eamon says dear lulu if this mccaffrey is that tall that hes pushing his yoke against your belly button i suggest you find a smaller man who will slip it between your thighs surely you can find a decent short man in yorkshire
dear miss hope i am thirteen years old with black hair and something terrible is happening and i cant tell anyone not even my mother im bleeding every few weeks you know where and im afraid ill be found out miss agnes tripple little biddleonthetwiddle devon
dear agnes you are to be congratulated you are now a woman and you can get your hair permed because you are having your monthlies do not fear your monthlies for all englishwomen have them they are a gift of god to purify us so that we can have stronger children for the empire soldiers to keep the irish in their place in some parts of the world a woman with a monthly is unclean but we british cherish our women with the monthlies oh we do indeed
in the springtime theres a new messenger boy and im back in the office peter and eamon drift off to england peter is fed up with limerick no girls and youre driven to yourself wank wank wank thats all we ever do in limerick there are new boys im senior boy and the job is easier because im fast and when mr mccaffrey is out in the van and my work is done i read the english irish american magazines and papers day and night i dream of america
malachy goes to england to work in a rich catholic boys boarding school and he walks around cheerful and smiling as if hes the equal of any boy in the school and everyone knows when you work in an english boarding school youre supposed to hang your head and shuffle like a proper irish servant they fire him for his ways and malachy tells them they can kiss his royal irish arse and they say thats the kind of foul language and behavior youd expect he gets a job in the gas works in coventry shoveling coal into the furnaces like uncle pa keating shoveling coal and waiting for the day he can go to america after me
xviii
im seventeen eighteen going on nineteen working away at easons writing threatening letters for mrs finucane who says shes not long for this world and the more masses said for her soul the better shell feel she puts money in envelopes and sends me to churches around the city to knock on priests doors hand in the envelopes with the request for masses she wants prayers from all the priests but the jesuits she says theyre useless all head and no heart thats what they should
have over their door in latin and i wont give them a penny because every penny you give a jesuit goes to a fancy book or a bottle of wine
she sends the money she hopes the masses are said but shes never sure and if shes not sure why should i be handing out all that money to priests when i need the money to go to america and if i keep back a few pounds for myself and put it in the post office who will ever know the difference and if i say a prayer for mrs finucane and light candles for her soul when she dies wont god listen even if im a sinner long past my last confession
ill be nineteen in a month all i need is a few pounds to make up the fare and a few pounds in my pocket when i land in america
the friday night before my nineteenth birthday mrs finucane sends me for the sherry when i return she is dead in the chair her eyes wide open and her purse on the floor wide open i cant look at her but i help myself to a roll of money seventeen pounds i take the key to the trunk upstairs i take forty of the hundred pounds in the trunk and the ledger ill add this to what i have in the post office and i have enough to go to america on my way out i take the sherry bottle to save it from being wasted
i sit by the river shannon near the dry docks sipping mrs finucanes sherry aunt aggies name is in the ledger she owes nine pounds it might have been the money she spent on my clothes a long time ago but now shell never have to pay it because i heave the ledger into the river im sorry ill never be able to tell aunt aggie i saved her nine pounds im sorry i wrote threatening letters to the poor people in the lanes of limerick my own people but the ledger is gone no one will ever know what they owe and they wont have to pay their balances i wish i could tell them im your robin hood
another sip of the sherry ill spare a pound or two for a mass for mrs finucanes soul her ledger is well on its way down the shannon and out to the atlantic and i know ill follow it someday soon
the man at oriordans travel agency says he cant get me to america by air unless i travel to london first which would cost a fortune he can put me on a ship called the irish oak which will be leaving cork in a few weeks he says nine days at sea september october best time of the year your own cabin thirteen passengers best of food bit of a holiday for yourself and that will cost fiftyfive pounds do you have it
i do
i tell mam im going in a few weeks and she cries michael says will we all go some day
we will
alphie says will you send me a cowboy hat and a thing you throw that comes back to you
michael tells him thats a boomerang and youd have to go all the way to australia to get the likes of that you cant get it in america
alphie says you can get it in america yes you can and they argue about america and australia and boomerangs till mam says for the love o jesus yeer brother is leaving us and the two of ye are there squabbling over boomerangs will ye give over
mam says well have to have a bit of party the night before i go they used to have parties in the old days when anyone would go to america which was so far away the parties were called american wakes because the family never expected to see the departing one again in this
life she says tis a great pity malachy cant come back from england but well be together in america someday with the help of god and his blessed mother
on my days off from work i walk around limerick and look at all the places we lived the windmill street hartstonge street roden lane rosbrien road little barrington street which is really a lane i stand looking at theresa carmodys house till her mother comes out and says what do you want i sit at the graves of oliver and eugene in the old st patricks burying ground and cross the road to st lawrences cemetery where theresa is buried wherever i go i hear voices of the dead and i wonder if they can follow you across the atlantic ocean
i want to get pictures of limerick stuck in my head in case i never come back i sit in st josephs church and the redemptorist church and tell myself take a good look because i might never see this again i walk down henry street to say goodbye to st francis though im sure ill be able to talk to him in america
now there are days i dont want to go to america id like to go to oriordans travel agency and get back my fiftyfive pounds i could wait till im twentyone and malachy can go with me so that ill know at least one person in new york i have strange feelings and sometimes when im sitting by the fire with mam and my brothers i feel tears coming and im ashamed of myself for being weak at first mam laughs and tells me your bladder must be near your eye but then michael says well all go to america dad will be there malachy will be there and well all be together and she gets the tears herself and we sit there the four of us like weeping eejits
mam says this is the first time we ever had a party and isnt it a sad thing altogether that you have it when your children are slipping away one by one malachy to england frank to america she saves a few shillings from her wages taking care of mr sliney to buy bread ham brawn cheese lemonade and a few bottles of stout uncle pa keating brings stout whiskey and a little sherry for aunt aggies delicate stomach and she brings a cake loaded with currants and raisins she baked herself the abbot brings six bottles of stout and says thats all right frankie ye can all drink it as long as i have a bottle or two for meself to help me sing me song
he sings the road to rasheen  he holds his stout closes his eyes and song comes out in a high whine the words make no sense and everyone wonders why tears are seeping from his shut eyes alphie whispers to me why is he crying over a song that makes no sense
i dont know
the abbot ends his song opens his eyes wipes his cheeks and tells us that was a sad song about an irish boy that went to america and got shot by gangsters and died before a priest could reach his side and he tells me dont be gettin shot if youre not near a priest
uncle pa says thats the saddest song he ever heard and is there any chance we could have something lively he calls on mam and she says ah no pa sure i dont have the wind
come on angela come on one voice now one voice and one voice
only
all right ill try
we all join in the chorus of her sad song
a mothers love is a blessing no matter where you roam keep her while you have her
youll miss her when shes gone
uncle pa says one song is worse than the one before and are we turning this night into a wake altogether is there any chance someone would sing a song to liven up the proceedings or will he be driven to drink with the sadness
oh god says aunt aggie i forgot the moon is having an eclipse abroad this minute
we stand out in the lane watching the moon disappear behind a round black shadow uncle pa says thats a very good sign for you going to america frankie
no says aunt aggie tis a bad sign i read in the paper that the moon is practicing for the end of the world
oh end of the world my arse says uncle pa tis the beginning for frankie mccourt hell come back in a few years with a new suit and fat on his bones like any yank and a lovely girl with white teeth hangin from his arm
mam says ah no pa ah no and they take her inside and comfort her with a drop of sherry from spain
its late in the day when the irish oak sails from cork past kinsale and cape clear and dark when lights twinkle on mizen head the last of ireland ill see for god knows how long
surely i should have stayed taken the post office examination climbed in the world i could have brought in enough money for michael and alphie to go to school with proper shoes and bellies well filled we could have moved from the lane to a street or even an avenue where houses have gardens i should have taken that examination and mam would never again have to empty the chamber pots of mr sliney or anyone else
its too late now im on the ship and there goes ireland into the night and its foolish to be standing on this deck looking back and thinking of my family and limerick and malachy and my father in england and even more foolish that songs are going through my head roddy mccorley goes to die and mam gasping oh the days of the kerry dancing with poor mr clohessy hacking away in the bed and now i want ireland back at least i had mam and my brothers and aunt aggie bad as she was and uncle pa standing me my first pint and my bladder is near my eye and heres a priest standing by me on the deck and you can see hes curious
hes a limerickman but he has an american accent from his years in los angeles he knows how it is to leave ireland did it himself and never got over it you live in los angeles with sun and palm trees day in day out and you ask god if theres any chance he could give you one soft rainy limerick day
the priest sits beside me at the table of the first officer who tells us ships orders have been changed and instead of sailing to new york were bound for montreal
three days out and orders are changed again we are going to new york after all
three american passengers complain goddam irish cant they get it straight
the day before we sail into new york orders are changed again we are going to a place up the hudson river called albany
the americans say albany goddam albany why the hell did we have to sail on a goddam irish tub goddam
the priest tells me pay no attention all americans are not like that
im on deck the dawn we sail into new york im sure im in a film that it will end and lights will come up in the lyric cinema the priest wants to point out things but he doesnt have to i can pick out the statue of liberty ellis island the empire state building the chrysler building the brooklyn bridge there are thousands of cars speeding along the roads and the sun turns everything to gold rich americans in top hats white ties and tails must be going home to bed with the gorgeous women with white teeth the rest are going to work in warm comfortable offices and no one has a care in the world
the americans are arguing with the captain and a man who climbed aboard from a tugboat why cant we get off here why do we have to sail all the goddam way to goddam albany
the man says because youre passengers on the vessel and the captain is the captain and we have no procedures for taking you ashore
oh yeah well this is a free country and were american citizens
is that a fact well youre on an irish ship with an irish captain and youll do what he goddam tells you or swim ashore
he climbs down the ladder tugboat chugs away and we sail up the hudson past manhattan under the george washington bridge past hundreds of liberty ships that did their bit in the war moored now and ready to rot
the captain announces the tide will force us to drop anchor overnight opposite a place called the priest spells it for me poughkeepsie the priest says thats an indian name and the americans say goddam poughkeepsie
after dark a small boat putputs to the ship and an irish voice calls up hello there bejasus i saw the irish flag so i did couldnt believe me two eyes hello there
he invites the first officer to go ashore for a drink and bring a friend and you too father bring a friend
the priest invites me and we climb down a ladder to the small boat with the first officer and the wireless officer the man in the boat says his name is tim boyle from mayo god help us and we docked there at the right time because theres a bit of a party and were all invited he takes us to a house with a lawn a fountain and three pink birds standing on one leg there are five women in a room called a living room the women have stiff hair spotless frocks they have glasses in their hands and theyre friendly and smile with perfect teeth one says come right in just in time for the pawty
pawty thats the way they talk and i suppose ill be talking like that in a few years
tim boyle tells us the girls are having a bit of a time while their husbands are away overnight hunting deer and one woman betty says yeah buddies from the war that war is over nearly five years and they cant get over it so they shoot animals every weekend and drink rheingold till they cant see goddam war excuse the language fawder
the priest whispers to me these are bad women we wont stay here long
the bad women say whatcha like to drink we got everything whats your name honey
frank mccourt
nice name so you take a little drink all the irish take a little drink you like a beer
yes please gee so polite i like the irish my grandmother was half irish so that makes me half quarter i dunno my name is frieda so heres your beer honey
the priest sits at the end of a sofa which they call a couch and two women talk to him betty asks the first officer if hed like to see the house and he says oh i would because we dont have houses like this in ireland another woman tells the wireless officer he should see what they have growing in the garden you wouldnt believe the flowers frieda asks me if im okay and i tell her yes but would she mind telling me where the lavatory is
the what
lavatory
oh you mean the bathroom right this way honey down the hall thanks
she pushes in the door turns on the light kisses my cheek and
whispers shell be right outside if i need anything
i stand at the toilet bowl firing away and wonder what id need at
a time like this and if this is a common thing in america women waiting outside while you take a splash
i finish flush and go outside she takes my hand and leads me into a bedroom puts down her glass locks the door pushes me down on the bed shes fumbling at my fly damn buttons dont you have zippers in ireland she pulls out my excitement climbs up on me slides up and down up and down jesus im in heaven and theres a knock on the door the priest frank are you in there frieda putting her finger to her lips and her eyes rolling to heaven frank are you in there father would you ever take a good running jump for yourself and oh god oh theresa do you see whats happening to me at long last i dont give a fiddlers fart if the pope himself knocked on this door and the college of cardinals gathered gawking at the windows oh god the whole inside of me is gone into her and she collapses on me and tells me im wonderful and would i ever consider settling in poughkeepsie
frieda tells the priest i had a bit of a dizziness after going to the bathroom thats what happens when you travel and youre drinking a strange beer like rheingold which she believes they dont have in ireland i can see the priest doesnt believe her and i cant stop the way the heat is coming and going in my face he already wrote down my mothers name and address and now im afraid hell write and say your fine son spent his first night in america in a bedroom in poughkeepsie romping with a woman whose husband was away shooting deer for a bit of relaxation after doing his bit for america in the war and isnt this a fine way to treat the men who fought for their country
the first officer and the wireless officer return from their tours of the house and the garden and they dont look at the priest the women tell us we must be starving and they go into the kitchen we sit in the living room saying nothing to each other and listening to the women whispering and laughing in the kitchen the priest whispers to me again bad women bad women occasion of sin and i dont know what to say to him
the bad women bring out sandwiches and pour more beer and when we finish eating they put on frank sinatra records and ask if anyone would like to dance no one says yes because youd never get up and dance with bad women in the presence of a priest so the women dance with each other and laugh as if they all had little secrets tim boyle drinks whiskey and
falls asleep in a corner till frieda wakes him and tells him take us back to the ship when were leaving frieda leans toward me as if she might kiss my cheek but the priest says good night in a very sharp way and no one shakes hands as we walk down the street to the river we hear the women laughing tinkling and bright in the night air
we climb the ladder and tim calls to us from his little boat mind yourselves going up that ladder oh boys oh boys wasnt that a grand night good night boys and good night father
we watch his little boat till it disappears into the dark of the pough keepsie riverbank the priest says good night and goes below and the first officer follows him
i stand on the deck with the wireless officer looking at the lights of america twinkling he says my god that was a lovely night frank isnt this a great country altogether
