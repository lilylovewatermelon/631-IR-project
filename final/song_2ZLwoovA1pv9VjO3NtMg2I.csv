hear the lonesome whippoorwill
he sounds too blue to fly
the midnight train is whining low
im so lonesome i could cry
i never seen a night so long
when time goes crawling by
the moon just went behind a cloud
to hide its face and cry

chorus
well maybe the night is cold
but together they fade
like the shadow that ran up to the hills
trying to fix her wings
theres a saint and a sinner
and forever the missing day
where the winners and losers feel the same
who knows what tomorrow brings

verse 2
did you ever see a robin weep
when leaves begin to die
that means hes lost the will to live
im so lonesome i could cry
the silence of a falling star
lights up a purple sky
and as i wonder where you are
im so lonesome i could cry
you might also likechorus
well maybe the night is cold
but together they fade
like the shadow that ran up to the hills
trying to fix her wings
theres a saint and a sinner
and forever the missing day
where the winners and losers feel the same
who knows what tomorrow brings

verse 3
hear the lonesome whippoorwill
he sounds too blue to fly
the midnight train is whining low
im so lonesome i could cry
im so lonesome i could cry
im so lonesome i could cry1embed"
