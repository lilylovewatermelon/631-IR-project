long nights in the trap it got a nigga sick
it got a nigga this far

but be clear

verse 1
i just pulled up to td in i8

im from a town where we pour the henny in double cups
its enough henny for all of us
we getting money we mix the buscemi with all of the fendi designer stuff

top down in the wraith baddie giving me face
ap from a touch down i just pulled from a chase
shout out my lawyer he just beat my case
