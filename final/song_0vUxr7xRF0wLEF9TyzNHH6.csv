i cant explain
cant quite put my finger on it
the difference that makes us so different
weve said everything
our words only betrayed us
nothing is left nothing was left unsaid

chorus
this time i have nothing left to lose
im stuck the second hand wont move
its about time that i speak my mind
its about time about time to find
pieces of me i have lost
without any choice i move on
hey time youre no friend of mine
hey time youre no friend of mine

verse 2
you cover yourself you cover your skin
you cover yourself like you cover your sins
please untie my hands
im a sinner im a man
i ask for one minute to make you understand

chorus
this time i have nothing left to lose
im stuck the second hand wont move
its about time that i speak my mind
its about time about time to find
pieces of me i have lost
without any choice i move on
hey time youre no friend of mine
hey time youre no friend of mine

will you be there
to catch me when i stumble when i fall
when i fall
its so very clear
you left me when i had no one at all
no one at all
who will be there
to catch me to catch me when i stumble when i fall
when i fall
its so very clear
you left me you left me with no one at all
no one at all

chorus
this time i have nothing left to lose
im stuck the second hand wont move
its about time that i speak my mind
its about time about time to find
pieces of me i have lost
without any choice i move on
hey time youre no friend of mine
hey time youre no friend of mine

outro
no friend of mine
time youre no friend of mine
youre no friend of mine
hey time youre no friend of mine
hey time youre no friend of mine
the pieces of me i have lost
without any choice i move on
time
time youre no friend of mineembed"
