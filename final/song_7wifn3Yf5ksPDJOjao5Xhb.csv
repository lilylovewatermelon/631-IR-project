a baby moonlight hits the spotlight
im on my flight to take you away
im feeling so free youre making me crazy
thats what you do thats what you do lets go now

prechorus
lickety split
a girl in a bit as she falls in a pit saying hello darling
twisted insanity fallen humanity
all i want is some tranquility
do you hear me do you hear me
well cmon boy

chorus
uh cmon and take me to the other side
im blown away when i look into your eyes
im so in love
i think im gonna crash and get whiplash whiplash whiplash
its up to you and i dont wanna give you clues

so dont look back
or else were gonna crash and get whiplash whiplash whiplash

like the first kiss with a sweet list
of some love songs oh yeah so sexy life is sassy sassy sassy
and with this melody falling over me
it makes me weak so damn weak so lets go now
