instrumental intro

verse 1
shes an extraordinary girl
in an ordinary world
and she cant seem to get away
he lacks the courage in his mind
like a child left behind
like a pet left in the rain

chorus
shes all alone again
wiping the tears from her eyes
some days he feels like dying
she gets so sick of crying

verse 2
she sees the mirror of herself
an image she wants to sell
to anyone willing to buy
he steals the image in her kiss
from her hearts apocalypse
from the one called whatsername

wiping the tears from her eyes
some days he feels like dying
she gets so sick of crying

part ii letterbomb

intro  kathleen hanna
nobody likes you
everyone left you
theyre all out without you
having fun
verse 1
where have all the bastards gone
the underbelly stacks up ten high
the dummy failed the crash test
collecting unemployment checks
like a flunkie only along for the ride

where have all the riots gone
as the citys motto gets pulverized
whats in love is now in debt
on your birth certificate
so strike the fucking match to light this fuse

prechorus
the town bishops an extortionist
and he dont even know that you exist
standing still when its do or die
you better run for your fucking life

chorus
its not over till youre underground
its not over before its too late
this citys burnin
its not my burden
its not over before its too late
theres nothing left to analyze

bridge
where will all the martyrs go when the virus cures itself
and where will we all go when its too late

ad lib
and dont look back

middle eight
youre not the jesus of suburbia
the st jimmy is a figment of
your fathers rage and your mothers love
made me the idiot america

chorus 2
its not over till youre underground
its not over before its too late
this citys burnin
its not my burden
its not over before its too late

outro
she said i cant take this place
im leaving it behind
well she said i cant take this town
im leaving you tonight1embed"
