confusing stars for satellites
i never dreamed that youd be mine
but here we are were here tonight

if everyone loved and nobody lied
if everyone shared and swallowed their pride
then wed see the day when nobody died

we realize how small we are
if they could love like you and me
imagine what the world could be
