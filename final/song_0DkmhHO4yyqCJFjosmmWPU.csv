i feel insane every single time im asked to compromise
cause im afraid and stuck in my ways
and thats the way it stays
so how long did i expect love to outweigh ignorance
by that look on your face i may have forced the scale to tip
prechorus
im not insane im not insane
im not insane im not not insane
chorus
mother come back to me its almost easy
said it all come back again its almost easy

verse 2
shame pulses through my heart from the things ive done to you
its hard to face but the fact remains that this is nothing new
i left you bound and tied with suicidal memories
selfish beneath the skin but deep inside im not insane

prechorus
im not insane im not insane
im not insane im not not insane

chorus
mother come back to me its almost easy
said it all come back again its almost easy
youll learn your lesson come back to me its almost easy
but first youll fall come back again its almost easy
