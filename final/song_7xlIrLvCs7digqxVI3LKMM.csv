ive been the needle and the thread
weaving figure eights and circles round your head
i try to laugh but cry instead
patiently wait to hear the words youve never said

prechorus
fumbling through your dresser drawer
forgot what i was looking for
try to guide me in the right direction
making use of all this time
keeping everything inside
close my eyes and listen to you crying

chorus
im lifting you up
im letting you down
im dancing til dawn
im fooling around
im not giving up
im making your love
this citys made us crazy and we must get out
oh yeah

verse 2
this is not goodbye she said
it is just time for me to rest my head
she does not walk she runs instead
down these jagged streets and into my bed
