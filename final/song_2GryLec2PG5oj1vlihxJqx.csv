stripped of life alone
in the midst of something that i
want to play with your evil inside
wanting letting go of what never could be again
lost and alone
imprisoned now inside your mind
with the way you tried
to destroy me again
you were waiting and living for no one
with the way you tried
to completely refuse all your life

prechorus
feed on your nothing
youll never live up to me

chorus
awaken you
with a little evil inside
feed on your nothing
you’ll never live up to me
i’ve stricken you
i don’t want to live with the lie
feed on your nothing
and you’ll never live up to me

i’ve stricken you
feed on your nothing
and you’ll never live up to me

verse 1 reprise
stripped of life alone
in the midst of something that i
want to play with your evil inside
wanting letting go of what never could be again
lost and alone
imprisoned now inside your mind
with the way you tried
to destroy me again
you were waiting and living for no one
with the way you tried
to completely refuse all your life

prechorus
feed on your nothing
youll never live up to me

chorus
awaken you
with a little evil inside
feed on your nothing
you’ll never live up to me
i’ve stricken you
i don’t want to live with the lie
feed on your nothing
and you’ll never live up to me
awaken you ooh no
can’t live up to me
i’ve stricken you
can’t live up to me

watching the whole thing just wash away
making me long
making you strong

chorus

with a little evil inside
feed on your nothing
you’ll never live up to me

i don’t want to live with the lie
feed on your nothing
and you’ll never live up to me
