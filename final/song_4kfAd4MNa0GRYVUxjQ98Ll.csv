chorus
that place in my mind
is that space that you call mine
that place in my mind
is that space that you call mine

verse
where have i been all this time
lost in sliding fatal decline
ive been waiting for this to unfold but
the pieces are only as good as the whole
severed myself from my old life
cut off the only thing that was bright
what if i never saw you again
id die right next to you in the end

chorus
that place in my mind
is that space that you call mine
that place in my mind
is that space that you call mine

i wont let you walk away
without hearing what i have to say
without hearing what i have to say
without hearing what i have to say6embed"
