little children like to cha cha cha
they like to cha cha cha
they like to cha cha cha

i took my baby to the hop last night
and much to my surprise
when we got there she hit me with the news
right between the eyes

well she said she couldt do the cha cha cha
she said she couldnt do the cha cha cha
she couldnt cha cha cha
she couldnt cha cha cha
my baby couldnt do the cha cha cha

i told her not to worry
theyll play some other dance
but we sat there for an hour and a half
and we never got the chance

cause every song they played was the cha cha cha
every song that played was the cha cha cha
it was the cha cha cha
it was the cha cha cha
every number was the cha cha cha
you might also likei told her not to worry
theres only one thing we can do
baby if youll let me take you by the hand
im going to teach this dance to you

and then i taught her one two cha cha cha
three four cha cha cha
and up now cha cha cha
back now cha cha cha
turn now cha cha cha
back now cha cha cha
i taught my baby how to cha cha cha

we kept on dancing
and was i surprised for you see
after we practiced for a little while
she was doing it better than me

now my baby loves to do the cha cha cha
she loves to do the cha cha cha
she loves to cha cha cha
she loves to cha cha cha
my baby loves to do the cha cha cha

now here we go one two cha cha cha
three four cha cha chaembed"
