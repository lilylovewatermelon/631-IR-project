when the rain is blowing in your face
and the whole world is on your case
i could offer you a warm embrace
to make you feel my love

verse 2
when the evening shadows and the stars appear
and there is no one there to dry your tears
i could hold you for a million years
to make you feel my love

bridge 1
i know you havent made your mind up yet
but i will never do you wrong
ive known it from the moment that we met
no doubt in my mind where you belong

verse 3
id go hungry id go black and blue
id go crawling down the avenue
know theres nothing that i wouldnt do
to make you feel my love

the storms are raging on the rollin sea
and on the highway of regret
the winds of change are blowing wild and free

nothing that i wouldnt do
go to the ends of the earth for you
to make you feel my love
