the iv and your hospital bed
this was no accident this was a therapeutic chain of events

verse
this is the scent of dead skin on a linoleum floor
this is the scent of quarantine wings in a hospital
its not so pleasant and its not so conventional
it sure as hell aint normal but we deal we deal
the anesthetic never set in and im wondering where
the apathy and urgency is that i thought i phoned in
its not so pleasant and its not so conventional
and it sure as hell aint normal but we deal we deal

prechorus
just sit back just sit back
just sit back and relax
just sit back just sit back
just sit back and relapse again

chorus
cant take the kid from the fight take the fight from the kid
sit back relax sit back relapse again bababadoh
cant take the kid from the fight take the fight from the kid
just sit back just sit back

youre a regular decorated emergency
the bruises and contusions will remind me what you did when you wake
youve earned your place atop the icus hall of fame
the camera caught you causing a commotion on the gurney again
