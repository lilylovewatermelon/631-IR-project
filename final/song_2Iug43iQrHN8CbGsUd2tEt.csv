clenched teeth no words
all this distance taking its toll
speaking volumes
silence screaming over your words

prechorus
i never did you right i know that
too many sleepless nights i own that
i said it time and time i know that
i wanna try again

chorus
can we start over
can we start over
can we start over
before its over over

verse 2
cold nights cold sheets
one more lonely empty hotel room
what id give to
find my way back into you

prechorus
i never did you right and i know that
too many sleepless nights i own that
i said it time and time i know that
i wanna try again

before its over over
can we start over
can we get closer
can we start over
before its over over
