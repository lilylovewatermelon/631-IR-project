why did you let him get away
after the staring what did you say
treatin me bold and cold as ice
screamed in my face then pulled your knife
she should have spied down his skin
now its my job to get revenge
why did you let him get away
why did you let him get away

so sad regret it

no ones sleepin
nobody should be grievin this way
you should have told her
nobody ever showed her bout us
no ones sleepin
