verse 1
runnin up this money been a breeze phew
flew her in she fuck me ’til she leave uh
she done fell in love im sellin dreams
i done fell in love with buyin’ jeans jeans
hate i found a love for sippin lean
hellcat faster than a demon new gwagen with no key
put baguettes in my ap i aint on playin about they beef
niggas know i play for keeps treat my brothers like they me
had to make myself a boss it aint no nigga workin me
i invest a couple mil and let my money work for me
know they hate the way it happened probably somewhere cursin me
i don’t know nothing ’bout no killin all i know is murder beats
i got rich and understand my next three cars gon’ be a lease
i aint never losin sleep about no beef i roll in peace
i put diamonds in my teeth came from grindin in the streets
get a load and break it down and sell it all and then repeat it
pray to god for all the dawgs behind the wall they need they freedom free y’all
when i be on tv and perform i hope they see me see me
once its up its stuck we get over on niggas not get even
forgiato rims on my dually i ride diesel
only rock amiris with my team not no diesel
got some niggas up in philly play with birds like they eagles
she keep sayin im the man that shit boostin up my ego
still in atlanta sellin bags like they legal im just sayin yeah

how you try to run off with the wave and you aint surfin
gave em all the drip them niggas still acted thirsty
i aint even counted up to see what im worth yet

i cant even hold you i been gettin loaded
devil on my shoulders
god got my back so i keep on rollin yeah

verse 2
