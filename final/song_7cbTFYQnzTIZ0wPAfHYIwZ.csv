its mc and yj
another hit ok
we lookin fly takin off
saw us on a runway
on any given sunday monday tuesday
they try to confuse me
i never let em use me

verse 1 mariah carey
i was a girl you was the man
i was too young to understand
i was naive i just believed
everything that you told me
said you were strong protecting me
then i found out that you were weak
keeping me there under your thumb
cause you were scared that id become much
more than you could handle
shining like a chandelier
that decorated every room inside
the private hell we built
and i dealt with it
like a kid i wished i could fly away but instead

prechorus mariah carey
i kept my tears inside
cause i knew if i started id keep cryin
for the rest of my life with you
i finally built up the strength to walk away
dont regret it but i still live with the side effects
see mariah carey liveget tickets as low as 104you might also likechorus mariah carey
waking up scared some nights
still dreaming about them violent times
still a little protective bout the people that i let inside
still a little defensive thinkin folks be tryin to run my life
still a little depressed inside
i fake a smile and deal with the side effects ohoh ohohohoh
side effects ohoh ohohohohoh
side effects ohoh ohohohohoh
side effects ohoh ohohohohoh

verse 2 mariah carey
vacant inside no one was there
couldnt be real had to keep quiet
once in a while put up a fight
its just too much night after night
after a while i would just lie
you was dead wrong said you was right
did what i could just to survive
couldnt believe this was my life
flickering like a candle
doing my best to handle sleeping with the enemy
aware that he was smothering every last part of me
so i broke away and finally found the strength to leave

prechorus mariah carey
kept the tears inside
cause i knew if i started id keep crying
for the rest of my life with you
i finally built up the strength to walk away
dont regret it but i still live with the side effects
chorus mariah carey  young jeezy
waking up scared some nights
still dreaming about them violent times
still a little protective bout the people that i let inside
still a little defensive thinkin folks be tryin to run my life
still a little depressed inside
i fake a smile and deal with the side effects ohoh ohohohoh
side effects ohoh ohohohohoh
side effects ohoh ohohohohoh

hey hey hey lets go

verse 3 young jeezy
hey magnifical or should i say magnificent yeah
aint nothing worth your happiness
and i aint caring who youre with
misery loves company
so we aint tryna hang with yall
hurt you if you let em in
gotta keep your circle small
keep tryin to play apology
i tell him i aint bowlin though
think they want me outta here
i tell em i aint goin though
side effects be drowsiness loneliness
how is this
i think the call it hateration
what can you prescribe for this
bridge mariah carey
forgive but i cant forget
every day i deal with this
i live with the side effects
but i aint gon let them get the best of me i forgive
forgive but i cant forget my
every day i deal with this
i live with the side effects
but i aint gon let them get the best of me hey oh

prechorus mariah carey
i kept my tears inside
cause i knew if i started id keep crying
for the rest of my life with you
i finally built up the strength to walk away
the strength to walk away
dont regret it but i still live with the side effects

chorus mariah carey
waking up scared some nights hey hey
still dreaming about them violent times said i still wake up
still a little protective about the people that i let inside cryin
still a little defensive thinkin folks be tryin to run my life
still a little depressed inside
i fake a smile and deal with the side effects ohoh ohohohoh
