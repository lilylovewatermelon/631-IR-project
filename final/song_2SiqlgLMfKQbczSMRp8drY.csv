im just a normal boy
that sank when i fell overboard
my ship would leave the country
but id rather swim ashore
without a life vest id be stuck again
wish i was much more masculine
maybe then i could learn to swim
like fourteen miles away
now floating up and down
i spin colliding into sound
like whales beneath me diving down
im sinking to the bottom of my
everything that freaks me out
the lighthouse beam has just run out
im cold as cold as cold can be
be

chrous
i want to swim away but dont know how
sometimes it feels just like im falling in the ocean
let the waves up take me down
let the hurricane set in motion yeah
let the rain of what i feel right now come down
let the rain come down
see blue october liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likeverse 2
where is the coastguard
i keep looking each direction
for a spotlight give me something
i need something for protection
maybe flotsam junk will do just fine
the jetsam sunk im left behind
im treading for my life believe me
how can i keep up this breathing
not knowing how to think
i scream aloud begin to sink
my legs and arms are broken down
with envy for the solid ground
im reaching for the life within me
how can one man stop his ending
i thought of just your face
relaxed and floated into space

chorus
i want to swim away but dont know how
sometimes it feels just like im falling in the ocean
let the waves up take me down
let the hurricane set in motion yeah
let the rain of what i feel right now come down
let the rain come down
verse 3
now waking to the sun
i calculate what i had done
like jumping from the bow yeah
just to prove that i knew how yeah
its midnights late reminder of
the loss of her the one i love
my will to quickly end it all
set front row in my need to fall
into the ocean end it all
into the ocean end it all
into the ocean end it all
into the ocean end it all

refrain
into the ocean goodbye end it all goodbye
into the ocean goodbye end it all goodbye
into the ocean goodbye end it all goodbye

chorus
i want to swim away but dont know how
sometimes it feels just like im falling in the ocean
let the waves up take me down
let the hurricane set in motion yeah
let the rain of what i feel right now come down
let the rain come down
outro
into space
i thought of just your face17embed"
