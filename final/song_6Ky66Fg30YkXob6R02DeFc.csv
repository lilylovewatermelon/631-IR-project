if women come a dime a dozen i ain’t got a penny
some guys are getting way too much some guys don’t get any
but if i had a nickel for every time i’d had enough
i’d still be busted and heartbroken still be trying to fall in love

verse 1
i fell in love with linda she didn’t love me back
i went crazy over chrissy she went crazy over jack
maria down in mexico my spanish mona lisa
tried to fly her back to texas but she did not have a visa

chorus
if women come a dime a dozen i ain’t got a penny
some guys are getting way too much some guys don’t get any
but if i had a nickel for every time i’d had enough
i’d still be busted and heartbroken still be trying to fall in love

verse 2
bought renee a dozen roses all she did was make me beg
displayed my love for donna with a tattoo on my leg
there’s a tree where me and carla carved our names with a pocket knife
but like our love it burned down with a lightning strike

chorus
if women come a dime a dozen i ain’t got a penny
some guys are getting way too much some guys don’t get any
but if i had a nickel for every time i’d had enough
i’d still be busted and heartbroken still be trying to fall in love

why does everybody say there’s lots of fish out in the sea
when i’m swimming after women they’re all laid up on the beach

chorus
if women come a dime a dozen i ain’t got a penny
some guys are getting way too much some guys don’t get any
but if i had a nickel for every time i’d had enough
i’d still be busted and heartbroken still be trying to fall in love
yeah busted and heartbroken still be trying to fall in loveembed"
