did you see the movie is over
i guess we missed the last half
layin here in this bed together
me kissin you you kissin me back
its getting late cant you see
i should get up and leave
if i dont you know where its goin

chorus
but youre givin me that look baby
that says youre up to no good maybe
and youre whispering into my neck
leavin thoughts inside my head
well now since you put it that way
if i need to ill go darlin
but what if i stay
what if i stay

verse 2
here comes that sun through the window
feels like we just got to sleep
but the way you look on that pillow
dont you know its killin me yeah
its getting early cant ya see
i should get up and leave
if i dont you know where its goin

but youre givin me that look baby
that says youre up to no good maybe
and youre whispering into my neck
leavin thoughts inside my head
well now since you put it that way
if i need to ill go darlin
but what if i stay wrapped up in your arms

chorus
cause lovin you babys been pretty perfect so far
and youre givin me that look
the one that says youre up to no good yeah
and now youre whispering into my neck
leavin thoughts inside my head
well now since you put it that way
i should probably go darlin
but what if i stay
what if i stay
oh what if i stay2embed"
