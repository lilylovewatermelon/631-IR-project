denied he fathered a child
there is a lot of good that comes with celebrity you know that
there is also a pretty white hot spotlight
and you found yourself under it recently some headlines
to set the record straight none of it is true
do you know this woman
never met the woman so
no okay well obviously this is what comes along with uh
life in the fast lane as they say

verse 1
she said she met me on the tour
she keeps knocking on my door
she wont leave me leave me alone
this girl she wouldnt stop
almost had to call the cops
she was schemin ooh she was wrong

prechorus
cause she wanted all my attention
and she was dragging my name through the dirt
she was dying for my affection
she got mad cause i didn’t give it to her im talking to you
