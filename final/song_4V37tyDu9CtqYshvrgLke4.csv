if things were different we were young
skinny dipping having fun i remember
back in 1991 when the story first begun i remember i remember

verse 1
all of these shelves holding the things ive done
i knew myself before i knew anyone i did i did
and cause we all chew gum we all have fun with water guns
ladadadadada dadadumdumdum
then we all grew up shit got tough shit just wasnt simple enough no

chorus
and whenever the sun came out we played
we didnt want to get older we didnt want to get older
we would run on the block all night and day
we didnt want to get older

verse 2
what a mistake saying the way i felt
id say my main influence is myself
and cause i started young i learned a ton i didnt run
ladadadadadada
i was scared as fuck and out of touch and i was still testing my luck oh

chorus
and whenever the sun came out we played
we didnt want to get older we didnt want to get older
we would run on the block all night and day
we didnt want to get older we didnt want to get older
and whenever the sun came out we played
we didnt want to get older we didnt want to get older
i left myself in the alleyway
