mama cried when i went off to college
daddy cried when i came back home
my room was just the way i left it
but the boy who lived there was gone
went back to pike central high school
for the hometown football game
sat in the stands with my old friends
telling stories but it just wasn’t the same

prechorus
sometimes i miss the good ol days
but i know they brought me to to this place

chorus
ohoh ohoh
all my life i’ve been waiting for this moment
ohoh ohoh
all my life i’ve been waiting for this moment

verse 2
it’s been ten years of chasing this crazy drеam
tryna make it big some how
i’ve been high and low and inbеtween
but i won’t let it get me down no

don’t need to know how this will all turn out
i’m wide awake in the here and now

chorus
ohoh ohoh
all my life i’ve been waiting for this moment
ohoh ohoh
all my life i’ve been waiting for this moment

bridge
you build a life kids and wife
and you punch the clock every day punch the clock every day
still waiting for your ship to come in
and you hope that it’s on its way hope that its on its way
well it ain’t on its way
no it’s here today
i’ve been waiting been waiting

chorus
ohoh ohoh
all my life i’ve been waiting for this moment
ohoh ohoh
all my life i’ve been waiting for this moment

ohoh ohoh

ohoh ohoh
all my life i’ve been waiting for this momentembed"
