my father said dont be so scared
driving home all alone youre in a hospital bed
i closed my eyes ignored the signs
tried to wake up from a dream its not working this time

chorus ned russin
if i said your name twentyseven times
would that bring you back to life
if i said your name twentyseven times
would that bring you back to life

do you remember your lucky number
your superstition has me buried six feet under

chorus ned russin
if i said your name twentyseven times
would that bring you back to life
if i said your name twentyseven times
would that bring you back to life
