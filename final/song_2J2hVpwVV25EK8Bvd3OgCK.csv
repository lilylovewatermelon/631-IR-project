dont mess with my boy
dont mess with my man

dont mess with my man
dont mess with my boy
get your hands off my man

he told your ass not once but twice
you should have took his advice and left the man alone
you still drive by here every night
youre not wrapped too tight
you let your mind explode

you had you had your chance your chance
and you lost a good man good man
i know i know its sad its sad
thinkin bout what you had
if you if you was smart was smart
keep that ass out of my car
next timenext time see me see me
i wont be a lady nono

dont mess with my man
dont mess with my boy
dont mess with my man
dont mess with my man
dont mess with my boy
keep your hands off my man
you might also likeyou bitched at him all night all day
you constantly complained till you drove the man away
always saying something said he wasnt good for nothing
so tell me why the hell you stalking
youre dismissed now get to walking

you had you had your chance your chance
and you lost a good man good man
i know i know its sad its sad
thinking bout what you had
if you if you was smartwas smart
keep that ass out of my car
next time next time see me see me
i wont be a lady nono
