this is the way you left me im not pretending
no hope no love no glory no happy ending
this is the way that we love like its forever
then live the rest of our life but not together

verse 1 mika
wake up in the mornin stumble on my life
cant get no love without sacrifice
if anything should happen i guess i wish you well
mm a little bit of heaven but a little bit of hell

prechorus mika
this is the hardest story that ive ever told
no hope or love or glory happy endings gone forever more

chorus mika
i feel as if im wasted
and im wastin every day

refrain ida falk winland
this is the way you left me im not pretending
no hope no love no glory no happy ending
this is the way that we love like its forever
then live the rest of our life but not together
see mika liveget tickets as low as 37you might also likeverse 2 mika
two oclock in the mornin somethings on my mind
cant get no rest keep walkin around
if i pretend that nothin ever went wrong
i can get to my sleep i can think that we just carried on

prechorus mika
this is the hardest story that ive ever told
no hope or love or glory happy endings gone forever more

chorus mika
i feel as if im wasted
and im wastin every day
oh i feel as if im wasted
this is the way you left me im not pretending
no hope no love no glory no happy ending
and im wastin every day
this is the way that we love like its forever
then live the rest of our life but not together
