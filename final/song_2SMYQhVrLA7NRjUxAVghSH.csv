there you go
youre always so right
its all a big show
its all about you
you think you know
what everyone needs
you always take time
to criticize me

prechorus 1
it seems like every day
i make mistakes
i just cant get it right
its like im the one
you love to hate
but not today

chorus
so shut up shut up shut up
dont wanna hear it
get out get out get out
get out of my way
step up step up step up
youll never stop me
nothing you say today
is gonna bring me down
