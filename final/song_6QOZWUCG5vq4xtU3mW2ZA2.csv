three four

verse 1
your grandpa died when you were nine
they said he had lost his mind
you have learned way too soon
you should never trust the pantaloon

verse 2
now its your turn to be alone
find a wife and build yourself a home
you have learned way too soon
that your dad is now the pantaloon

chorus
you are tired you are hurt
a moth ate through your favorite shirt
and all your friends fertilize the ground you walk
lose your mind

bridge
hes seen too many stare downs
between the sun and the moon
in the morning air how
he used to hustle all the people
walking through the fairgrounds
hes been around so long
hes changed his meaning of a chair now
because a chair now
is like a tiny island in the sea of all the people
who glide across the very surface
that made his bones feeble
the end cant come soon enough
but is it too soon
either way he cant deny
he is a pantaloon
you might also likechorus
you are tired you are hurt
a moth ate through your favorite shirt
and all your friends fertilize the ground you walk
lose your mind

verse 3
you like to sleep alone
its colder than you know
cause your skin is so
used to colder bones
its warmer in the morning
than what it is at night
your bones are held together
by your nightmares and your frights

chorus
you are tired you are hurt
a moth ate through your favorite shirt
and all your friends they fertilize the ground you walk
so lose your mind

chorus
you are tired you are hurt
a moth ate through your favorite shirt
and all your friends they fertilize the ground you walk
lose your mind44embed"
