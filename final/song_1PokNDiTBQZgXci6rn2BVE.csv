yeah
yeah girl
can you hear that its playing our song
are you sleepy take a nap
youre not afraid of the dark are you

verse 1
you hear the beat as it makes ya not want to go to sleep
i knock on dakotas door its locked so i go to creep
round the back with binoculars not cause i wanna peep
but because im hungry she smells like tacos i wanna eat
visions of hot chocolaty marshmallows all so sweet
with sugar plums oh look
here comes marshall hes on your street
hes placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet
now walk on em hes dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek
like a thanksgiving turkey a holiday ham
cinnamon sprinkled on toast strawberry marmalade jam
flavor my favorite graham crackers with jonbenét rams
i guess a modernday jack the ripper is all that i am

chorus
my music box
cause when the lights are off i see the girls asleep
my music box
but i can hear you my love you keep calling me
my music box
although were worlds apart you mean the world to me
my music box my music box
so once you call i come i will answer
my music box
cause when the lights are off i see the girls asleep
my music box
i hear my music box playing a song for me
my music box
so wont you twirl around and do a whirl for me
my music box my music box
and would you be my private little dancer

i almost look comatose who wants to be sober gross
i foam like a doberman mouth open i overdose
put coke up my nostrils in both my holes then i plug my nose
my pupils quadruple in size eyes are so bugged i know
i put on my mothers makeup get naked and run around
wavin the gun around i think im down to a hundred pounds
theres thunder i wonder how come it rains but the sun is out
the devils upset with his wife they must be sluggin it out
i must be buggin the fuck out but what the fuck about
voices are leading me up to the attic i love my house
they pull and they tug my blouse the sound of a music box
comes from inside a toy chest but what do i do its locked
i pick it and open it but its stuffed full of human parts
i dig til i find it i wind it up and the tune just starts
its playing a song so beautiful and the room is dark
the moon is full i smell a funeral guess ill loom in the park

chorus
my music box
cause when the lights are off i see the girls asleep
my music box
but i can hear you my love you keep calling me
my music box
although were worlds apart you mean the world to me
my music box my music box
so once you call i come i will answer
my music box
cause when the lights are off i see the girls asleep
my music box
i hear my music box playing a song for me
my music box
so wont you twirl around and do a whirl for me
my music box my music box
and would you be my private little dancer
verse 3
im fixated on asphyxiatin and breakin
this little chicks neck like a pixy stick
the sick satanworshippin bitches get horse whippings
im in the back through the back door slippin
through the crack leavin the corpse drippin
the mortician of love sent from above
forced entry the more wenchy the more stingy i become
been doing this for more than a quartercentury im just numb
am i dreaming is it real someone pinch me on the buns
the time has come to tie her up gotta roll me the ladder
ive had enough of the chatter
climb up to the window look at her
then climb in slow to shatter her brain matter and batter her
with a bat a matter of fact that will splatter her
but before i do that ill have a chat to flatter her
give her two compliments back to back like tabitha
im your secret admirer im back to ravish ya
so strong is your fight but youre no match for dracula
prolonging her plight as i go back to stabbin her
dismember her limbs simple as that cadaver her
zoom in with the lens then pan back the camera
stand back cause here comes your man jack so pamela

chorus
my music box
cause when the lights are off i see the girls asleep
my music box
but i can hear you my love you keep calling me
my music box
although were worlds apart you mean the world to me
my music box my music box
so once you call i come i will answer
my music box
cause when the lights are off i see the girls asleep
my music box
i hear my music box playing a song for me
my music box
so wont you twirl around and do a whirl for me
my music box my music box
and would you be my private little dancer68embed"
