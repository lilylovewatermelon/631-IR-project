i had a tension i had a ten
i was a better honey so i did it again
thought my intentions were better
tried to put mind over matter
i lost my edge on things when i lost my head

prechorus 1
hey thats what they say
dont you know they aint never going to help you anyway

chorus
and its a get together to tear it apart
gave my middle finger a brand new start
i got a greeting cant say what its all about
but my middle finger is going to carry it out

verse 2
i got attention i had a pen
i made history honey and got please do it again
but there is no chance im going to do it again
if you missed it the first time
then its nine to ten that you will again
and were back at the end
back at the end all over again

chorus
and its a get together to tear it apart

but my middle finger is going to carry it out
