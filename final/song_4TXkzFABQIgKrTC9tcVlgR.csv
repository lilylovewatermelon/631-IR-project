i remember when you were talking about flying me out
i remember how it was easy to pick me out of the crowd
but i guess i just remember when

verse
i remember when you were happy just to walk me to my car
i remember every song you wrote me and how it touched my heart
but i guess i just remember when

verse
i remember when you told your brother and the way it made you feel
i remember telling my brothers i think this thing is real
but i guess i just remember when

verse
i remember when i would see you and the way youd look at me
i remember way before these casual greetings on the street
but i guess i just remember when

outro
i cant help but to remember when
and i wonder if you remember whensee faye webster liveget tickets as low as 47you might also like2embed"
