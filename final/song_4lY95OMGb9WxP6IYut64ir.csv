regrets collect like old friends
here to relive your darkest moments
i can see no way i can see no way
and all of the ghouls come out to play
and every demon wants his pound of flesh
but i like to keep some things to myself
id like to keep my issues drawn
its always darkest before the dawn

verse 1
and ive been a fool and ive been blind
i can never leave the past behind
i can see no way i can see no way
im always dragging that horse around
all of his questions such a mournful sound
tonight im gonna bury that horse in the ground
cause i like to keep my issues drawn
but its always darkest before the dawn

chorus
shake it out shake it out
shake it out shake it out ohwoah
shake it out shake it out
shake it out shake it out ohwoah
and its hard to dance with a devil on your back
so shake him off ohwoah

cause i like to keep my issues drawn
its always darkest before the dawn
