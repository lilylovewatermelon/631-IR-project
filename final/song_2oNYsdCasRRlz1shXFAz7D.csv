yeah yo

verse 1 mike shinoda  chester bennington
you were that foundation
never gonna be another one no
i followed so taken
so conditioned i could never let go
then sorrow then sickness
then the shock when you flip it on me
so hollow so vicious
so afraid i couldnt let myself see
ohohoh that i could never be held
back or up no i hold myself
check the rep yep you know mine well
forget the rest let them know my hell
ohohoh there and back yet my soul aint sell
kept respect up the best they fell
let the rest be the tale they tell
that i was there sayin

chorus chester bennington
in these promises broken deep below
each word gets lost in the echo
so one last lie i can see through
this time i finally let you go go go

test my will test my heart
let me tell you how the odds gonna stack up
yall go hard i go smart
hows that workin out for yall in the back huh
ive seen that frustration
been crossed and lost and told no
and ive come back unshaken
let down and lived and let go
ohohoh so you can let it be known
i dont hold back i hold my own
i cant be mapped i cant be cloned
i cant cflat it aint my tone
ohohoh i cant fall back i came too far
hold myself up and love my scars
let the bells ring wherever they are
cause i was there sayin

chorus chester bennington
in these promises broken deep below
each word gets lost in the echo
so one last lie i can see through
this time i finally let you go

postchorus chester bennington

no you can tell em all now
i dont back up i dont back down
i dont fold up and i dont bow
i dont roll over dont know how
i dont care where the enemies are
cant be stopped all i know go hard
wont forget how i got this far
for every time sayin

chorus chester bennington
in these promises broken deep below
each word gets lost in the echo
so one last lie i can see through
this time i finally let you go go go go go go go go
