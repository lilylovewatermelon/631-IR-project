so here you are in your borrowed car
kicking rocks around looking at your shoes
its the same old you
tell me where you been and where youre going to
where were you last night boy listen up when im talking to you
its the same old you

prechorus
another lonely night
with that same old whiskey morning

chorus
its the same old you
when you get to drinking
the same old you
when youre on the town
the same old you
in church on sunday
getting high when the sun goes down

well this time i done some thinking
and i think im done with you
cause until i get to leaving
its just the same old me too

well your mamas gonna cry her eyes
there aint gonna be no wedding day
whats she gonna say
when i tell her how i had no choice
the same old you couldnt even raise your voice
and ask me to stay
i wouldnt anyway

bridge
so you can keep your ring
and ill keep my daddys name

chorus
its the same old you
when you get to drinking
the same old you
when youre on the town
the same old you
in church on sunday
getting high when the sun goes down

this time ive done some thinking
and i think im done with you
cause until i get to leaving
its just the same old me too
