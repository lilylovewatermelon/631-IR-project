six bottles went down the drain
one hours a waste of time
i’d ask if you feel the same
still pushing that chance to try
your breath in this cool room chill
long hair that blows side to side
you speak and make time stand still
and each time you walk right on by

chorus tom delonge
like violence you have me forever and after
like violence you kill me forever and after

verse 2 tom delonge mark hoppus
can’t count all the eyes that stare
can’t count all the things they see
she kills with no life to spare
just victims are left to bleed
one drink and the pain goes down
soft shadows lay by her feet
lay soft as you slowly drown
lay still as you fall asleep fall asleep

chorus tom delonge
like violence you have me forever and after
like violence you kill me forever and after
and after and after
and after and after

like violence you have me forever and after
like violence you kill me like violence you have me
forever and after like violence you kill me
like violence you kill me like violence
a certain look in your eyes when you open your eyes
who’ll stand by your side so watch my eyes
watch em turn while you go change curtains down
when all their skill was cut and i bled
there were forces of john jones i can’t make you happy
it seems all i ever do is try you could never cut me
deep enough to leave a scar
so take this gift it’s something to save

chorus tom delonge
like violence you have me forever and after
like violence you kill me forever and after
like violence you have me forever and after
like violence you kill me forever and after14embed"
