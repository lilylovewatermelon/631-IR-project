catch me as i fall
say youre here and its all over now
speaking to the atmosphere
no ones here and i fall into myself
this truth drives me
into madness

prechorus
i know i can stop the pain ah
if i will it all away ah
if i will it all away

chorus
dont turn away
dont give in to the pain
dont try to hide
though theyre screaming your name
dont close your eyes
god knows what lies behind them
dont turn out the light
never sleep never die

verse 2
im frightened by what i see
but somehow i know that theres much more to come ah ah
immobilized by my fear
and soon to be blinded by tears

i can stop the pain ah
if i will it all away ah

chorus
dont turn away
dont give in to the pain
dont try to hide
and though theyre screaming your name
dont close your eyes
god knows what lies behind them
dont turn out the light
never sleep never die

bridge
fallen angels at my feet
whispered voices at my ear
death before my eyes
lying next to me i fear
she beckons me shall i give in
upon my end shall i begin
forsaking all ive fallen for
i rise to meet the end i rise to meet the end
