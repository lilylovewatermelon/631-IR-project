theres a memory of how we used to be
that i can see through the flames
i am hypnotized as i fantasize
forgetting lies and pain
but i cant go back

prechorus
the ashes call my name

chorus
pouring the fuel fanning the flames
breaking the habit and melting the chains
embracing the fear chasing the fight
the glow of the fire will light up the night
the bridges are burning the heats on my face
making the past an unreachable place
pouring the fuel fanning the flames
i know this is the point of no return

verse 2
its uncontrollable such a beautiful desire
theres something sinister about the way it hurts
when i watch it burn higher and higher
because i cant go back

the ashes call my name

chorus
pouring the fuel fanning the flames
breaking the habit and melting the chains
embracing the fear chasing the fight
the glow of the fire will light up the night
the bridges are burning the heats on my face
making the past an unreachable place
pouring the fuel fanning the flames
i know this is the point of no return

bridge
i wont turn around
i wont turn around
i wont turn around

chorus
pouring the fuel fanning the flames
breaking the habit and melting the chains
embracing the fear chasing the fight
the glow of the fire will light up the night
the bridges are burning the heats on my face
making the past an unreachable place
pouring the fuel fanning the flames
i know this is the point of no return
this is the point of no return
this is the point of no returnembed"
