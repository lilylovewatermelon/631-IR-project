i only meant to love you dont you know it babe
why couldnt you be contented with the love i gave
ive given you my heart and now you want my mind
your love scares me to death girl its the choking kind

verse 2
you can kill a man with bullets poison or a knife
but it hurts him more to take his pride and run his life
whatever it is you want girl i hope you find
but that hat dont fit my head cause its the choking kind

verse 3
when you fall in love again girl take a tip from me
if you dont like the peaches walk on by the tree
find what you want and keep it treat it sweet and kind
but let it breathe dont make your love the choking kindyou might also likeembed"
