parked in the dark in your parents car
take her by the hand gaze in her eyes
feel the first flutter of them butterflies

thats what lovell get ya
dont let anybody tell you different
ive been in and out enough to vouch
thats what lovell get ya

youre impressin her daddy kissing up to her mom
saving up money for the senior prom
runnin wide open when she slams on the brakes
next thing you know you got your first heartache

thats what lovell get ya
dont let anybody tell you different
ive been in and out enough to vouch
thats what lovell get ya

itll get ya thinkin aint love sweet
when shes finally willin and you just cant wait
itll get ya in might deep
that first time you ever go all the way
itll get ya house payments on a thirty year plan
get behind the wheel of your first mini van
a wife and two kids a boy and a girl
hot feet walkin around disney world
thats what lovell get ya
dont let anybody tell you different
ive been in and out enough to vouch
thats what love
thats what lovell get ya
dont let any fool tell you different
ive been in and out enough to vouch
thats what lovell get ya
yeah thats what lovell get ya
oh thats what lovell get yasee joe nichols liveget tickets as low as 57you might also likeembed"
