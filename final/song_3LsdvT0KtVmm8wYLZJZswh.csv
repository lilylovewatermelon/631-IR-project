im circling the drain
with all my problems in hand
well ive got a pretty good hand id say
but these new caskets crack the same
the first few stones are the worst
they fall in unnoticed
and scare you for more than theyre worth
and all at once you will not hear your own words

verse 2 jake ewald
closet weather at best and youre a victim
you say were all in the basket
but oh its so fun to remind us
over and over again
we dug our own graves
times awasting so now i must be leaving
we sealed our own fate
im crawling outside the same way that i creeped in
we dug our own graves
and the rain falls down and its heavy on my eyelids
we sealed our own fate
pulled to the ground down the fucking drain

hook jake ewald
maybe its just my luck
but i got a spotless record
maybe its harder to stay
and we got it all wrong from the start
maybe its all in the cards
or just an excuse for playing
maybe its all in our hearts
maybe i dont know what im saying
you might also likeverse 3 jake ewald
im circling the drain
but im picking these bones up
cause man they dont live there today
and i dont want to hear the fibers crack
cause god knows id rather die than be dying
its not a cliché—no sir
it is a logical preference cause the way things were this year
makes me think how good it all could be
and how well it could end

hook jake ewald
maybe its just my luck
but i got a spotless record
maybe its harder to stay
and we got it all wrong from the start
maybe its all in the cards
or just an excuse for playing
maybe its all in our hearts
maybe i don’t know what im saying
but im saying it anyway2embed"
