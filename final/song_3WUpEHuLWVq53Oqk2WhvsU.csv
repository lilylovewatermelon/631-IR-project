the time has come for colds and overcoats
were quiet on the ride
were all just waiting to get home
another week away my greatest fear
i need the smell of summer i need its noises in my ears
if looks could really kill
then my profession would be staring
know we do this cause we care not for the thrill
collect calls to home
tell them that i realize that everyone who lives will someday die and die alone

chorus
and we wont let you in
though were down and out
no we wont let you in
you win you win you win

verse 2
i wrote more postcards than hooks
i read more maps than books
feel like every chance to leave is another chance i should have took
every minute is a mile
ive never felt so hollow
im an old abandoned church with broken pews and empty aisles
my secrets for a buck
watch me as i cut myself wide open on this stage
yes i am paid to spill my guts
i wont see home til spring
oh i would kill for the atlantic but i am paid to make girls panic while i sing
you might also likechorus
and we wont let you in
though were down and out
no we wont let you in
and we wont let you in
we dont want what isnt ours
we wont let you in
you win you win you win

bridge
and the coastline is quiet
while were quietly losing control
and were silent but sure we invented the cure
that will wash out my memories of her
the harpoon is loaded the cage is lowered
the water is red
like you like you

chorus
and we wont let you in
though were down and out
no we wont let you in
and we wont let you in
we dont want what isnt ours
we wont let you in
you win you win you win4embed"
