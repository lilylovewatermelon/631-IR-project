throw your dollar bills and leave your thrills all here with me
and speak but dont pretend i wont defend you anymore you see
it aches in every bone
ill die alone but not for you
my eyes dont need to see that ugly thing
i know its me you fear
if you want me hold me back

chorus
frail the skin is dry and pale
the pain will never fail
and so we go back to the remedy
clip the wings that get you high
just leave em where they lie
and tell yourself youll be the death of me

verse 2
i dont need a friend i need to mend so far away
so come sit by the fire and play a while
but you cant stay too long
it aches in every bone
ill die alone but not for pleasure
i see my heart explode
its been eroded by the weather here
if you want me hold me back

frail the skin is dry and pale the pain will never fail
and so we go back to the remedy
clip the wings that get you high just leave em where they lie
and tell yourself youll be the death of me
frail the skin is dry and pale the pain will never fail
and so we go back to the remedy
clip the wings that get you high just leave em where they lie
and tell yourself youll be the death of me

bridge
hold your eyes closed take me in
hold your eyes closed take me in

chorus
frail the skin is dry and pale the pain will never fail
and so we go back to the remedy
clip the wings that get you high just leave em where they lie
and tell yourself youll be the death of me
frail the skin is dry and pale the pain will never fail
and so we go back to the remedy
clip the wings that get you high just leave em where they lie
and tell yourself youll be the death of me8embed"
