all i ever wanted was to find someone
but holdin it together is the hardest part
no one said life gets in the way
that our plans may change but our hearts remain
you stand in the doorway holdin’ me
feeling the tension you beg and plead
not to go away again
and then she said

chorus brian burkheiser
every time you leave i lose a little piece of me
and every time we speak words dont do it justice
its just us from here here
and that’s when she said
every time you leave i lose a little piece of me

verse 2 delaney jane
all i ever wanted was to find someone
but finishing the puzzle is the hardest part
every day wishin you could stay
cause our minds may change but our hearts remain
you stand in the doorway holding me
lost in the moment i cant believe
you gotta go away again
hear me when i say
see i prevail liveget tickets as low as 72you might also likechorus brian burkheiser

cause if you ever start to hesitate
and you feel the weight it starts to break
we’re not the same
know that this means everything to me
oh to me oh to me oh to me oh to me

bridge brian burkheiser and delaney jane
