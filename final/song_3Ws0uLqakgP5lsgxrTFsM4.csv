yeah i loved her too hard she left me here with this guitar
you can try stealing my heart its already gone
you can tell something is wrong just leave me alone
i dont even know where to start im just done
used to being in my room with you
now youre gone i only see you through the phone now where did you go
i shouldve never told you leave me alone i guess you took it to the heart
yeah lets go

chorus
its just me and this guitar playing this song
you can try stealing my heart its already gone
you can tell something is wrong just leave me alone
i dont even know where to start im just done
used to being in my room with you now youre gone
oh i only see you through a phone now where did you go
i shouldve never told you leave me alone
i guess you took it to the heart when i said leave me a—

verse
sweat going down to my balls im having withdrawals
its crazy baby all of my scars shaped in hearts
lamborghini urus ferraris extra cars
if you start bringing up love im bringing my gun
i never knew id make it this far it feels bizarre
but you know my energy large like a quran
and you know i work too hard i came too far
im happy im still alive
cause half of my niggas they either died or in the system
then if i aint start rapping i swear to god id have been with them
i baguetteed out my watches im a timeless ass nigga
i was creepin on the low yeah im a doggy ass nigga
but im an honest nigga i can only lie when it comes to snitchin
i hold grudges with my bitches if you lie i wont forgive you
just dont go tell nobody about those times that i was with you
you got my shoulder to lean on if you want to cry fuck a tissue
in and out of love so many fucking times i dont get it
i could get on some gangsta shit then turn the vibe sentimental
you say you front on my nigga and he aint ride wrong nigga
swear its way too many hoes that be dying over bitches yeah
yeah lets go
