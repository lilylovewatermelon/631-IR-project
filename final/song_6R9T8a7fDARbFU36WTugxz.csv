you know that restaurant on highway 1
with the key lime pie that song the sand and the sun
where we ran in our bare feet
built a castle on the beach
just the wind the rocks the waves and you and me

chorus kenny chesney
i cant go there
cause thats just too much us
i cant go there
i still feel your touch
theres places in my heart and head
that feel as empty as our bed
so most nights i dont even walk upstairs
cause i cant go there

verse 2 kenny chesney
remember san francisco on that cable car
our reflection in the window of that store
how we danced the night away
with the lights out on the bay
then wound up in a blanket on the floor

chorus kenny chesney
i cant go there
cause friscos too much us
i cant go there
i still feel your touch
now theres places in my heart and head
that still feel as empty as our bed
so most nights i dont even walk upstairs
cause i cant go there
see kenny chesney liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likebridge kenny chesney
if it was only florida or california
maybe i could let myself move on
but its everywhere weve been
and everywhere i turn
i cant love again
because ive learned

chorus 2 kenny chesney  tim mcgraw
that i cant go there
its something i cant do
i cant go there
ill run into you
i cant go there
when the sun shines when it rains
christmas parties football games
i cant go there
winter summer fall or spring
i see you in everything
i cant go there
its too much us
i cant go there1embed"
