you were the mother of three girls so sweet
who stormed through your turnstile and climbed to the street
but after conception your body lay cold
and withered through autumn and you found yourself old

refrain
can you tell me why you have been so sad

verse 2
he took a lover on a faraway beach
while you arranged flowers and chose color schemes

refrain
can you tell me why you have been so sad
can you tell me why you have been so sad

the girls were all there they traded their vows
the youngest one glared with furrowed brows
they tenderly kissed then cut the cake
the bride then tripped and broke the vase
the one you thought would spend the years
so perfectly placed below the mirror
arriving late you clean the debris
and walked into the angry sea
and it felt just like falling in love again
and it felt just like falling in love again
