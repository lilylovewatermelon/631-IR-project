on the edge of dark theres the brightest light
a burning light on the edge of dark
where no one can tell they’re worlds apart
well live with dark just take the ride

heavyhearted but my burdens light
i just wanna live and learn how to fly

sink or swim im not scared to die

verse 3 michael mcdonald
wake up and dream tear down the wall
of all you believe that might not be true
long as love lies waiting there
just hold your face into the light
though right now you might not know why
long as love lies waiting
they ain’t know our way baby

chorus thundercat
let me show you show you the way
on the edge of dark theres the brightest light
a burning light on the edge of dark
where no one can tell theyre worlds apart
well live with dark just take the ride
