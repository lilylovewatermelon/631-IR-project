my sexchange operation got botched
my guardian angel fell asleep on the watch
now all i got is a barbie dollcrotch
i got an angry inch

refrain
six inches forward and five inches back

i got an angry inch

verse 2
im from the land where you still hear the cries
i had to get out to sever all ties
i changed my name and assumed a disguise
i got an angry inch

refrain
six inches forward and five inches back
i got a
i got an angry inch

chorus
six inches forward and five inches back
the train is coming and im tied to the track
i try to get up but i cant get no slack
i got an angry inch angry inch angry inch
my mother made my tits out of clay
my boyfriend told me that hed take me away
they dragged me to the doctor one day
ive got an angry inch

six inches forward and five inches back
i got a
i got an angry inch

interlude
a long story short
when i woke up from the operation
i was bleeding down there
bleeding from the gash between my legs
my first day as a woman
and already its that time of the month
but two days later
the hole closed up and the wound healed
and i was left with a one inch mound of flesh
where my penis used to be
where my vagina never was
a one inch mound of flesh
with a scar running down it
like a sideways grimace
on an eyeless face
it was just a little bulge
it was an angry inch

chorus
six inches forward and five inches back
the train is coming and im tied to the track
i try to get up but i cant get no slack
i got an angry inch angry inch angry inch
six inches forward and five inches back
stay undercover til the night turns to black
i got my inch and im set to attack
i got an angry inch angry inch angry inchembed"
