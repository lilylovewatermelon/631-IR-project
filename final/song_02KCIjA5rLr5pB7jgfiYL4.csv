i got it stuck in a bind
i dont even know why
it sucks to even try
but i wont try anymore
she took the afternoon train
to find a different plane
but life down the drains
better than being ignored

prechorus
i think im taking a vacation now
im on holiday
and maybe i wont rest
until ive thrown it all away
ive got it down

chorus
im gonna feel sorry for myself
i want to blame it on everyone else
i want to be selfcentered
and make everybody feel sorry for me
yeah

verse 2
she sent a postcard again
she said she had a new friend
i hope that by the end
he throws her heart on the floor
she said hes really okay
i really hope that hes gay
its not a nice thing to say
but i dont care anymore

chorus

bridge
my leg fell asleep cause you laid on it
theres no reason to dwell on it
its just not worth it
remember a year ago
when we played in the snow
now get out of my head get out of my head

and make everybody feel sorry for me
feel sorry sorry sorry
