well i parked my car in the driveway
somewhere around one am
worn out from the road with a big heavy load
on my mind what a week it had been
then i stumbled into the kitchen
and i saw that little red light
blinking at me from my message machine
then i knew it would be alright
because she said

chorus
baby come over tonight
im a little bit lonely
baby come hold me tonight
im a little bit lonely

verse 2
now it didnt take me a second til i knew
the right thing to do
i picked up the phone and said baby im home
ill be there in a minute or two
i stole some of my neighbors daisies
grabbed an old bottle of wine
she dont call me much but i know when she does
that im in for one helluva time
when she says
see billy currington liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likechorus
baby come over tonight
im a little bit lonely
baby come hold me tonight
im a little bit lonely
baby come over tonight
im a little bit lonely
baby come hold me tonight
im a little bit lonely

verse 3
yeah everybody needs a little love sometimes
yeah who am i to leave you hanging high and dry
no baby not tonight
nononono
not tonight now baby

chorus
baby come over tonight
im a little bit lonely
baby come hold me tonight
im a little bit lonely
baby come over tonight
im a little bit lonely
baby come hold me tonight
im a little bit lonely
outro
so come on baby
said ill be there in a minute or two
and i brought those daises and that red wine
we had one hell of a time
yeah yeah yeahembed"
