you keep your distance i cant deny you
i got the feeling cant satisfy you
i got your picture on the wall
i got the picture long gone
you keep your wishes ill keep my feelings
there goes another one that kept me breathing
im waiting for you i know youre leaving
ill still adore you you never need me

chorus scott weiland
hold on ive found another way to let you go away
hold on youve found another way to bleed my soul away

verse 2 fred durst
the things you told me to hear you speak
im burning slowly im growing weak
you bring me closer to yesterday
yesterdays a million miles away
why cant you hear me why cant i sleep
and i dont understand what keeps me breathing
im waiting for you i know youre leaving
ill still adore you youll never need me

hook scott weiland  fred durst
