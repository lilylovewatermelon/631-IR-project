im a long country mile from bein in style
dirty hat and cowboy boots
i cut my teeth on them old outlaw songs
my daddy used to listen to
guess its in my genes
i gotta be me

verse 2
yeah i say what i think
but sometimes i drink
and when i do i drink too much
wind up on my back
eye shinin black
and i know its all because bad as it might be
hey i gotta be me

chorus
you can wind me up and dine me
you can polish up and shine me
but the real things gonna shine through
it aint always pretty but the cowboy in me
couldnt change if he wanted to

verse 3
yeah i had a girl
her name was pearl
i think shes up in arkansas
she raised her voice and gave me a choice
tween singin in a honkytonk or a job
as you can see i gotta be me

but the real things gonna shine through
it aint always pretty but the cowboy in me
couldnt change if he wanted to

outro
yeah im a rusty old truck

tween the lexus and the coupe deville
