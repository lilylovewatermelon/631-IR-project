you a roughneck im a cutthroat
youre a tough  guy thats enough jokes
then the sun die the night is young though
the diamonds still shine in the rough ho

money over bitches and above hoes
that is still my favorite love quote
put the gun inside what the fuck for
i sleep with the gun and she dont snore
what the fuck yo where the love go
trade the ski mask for the muzzle
its a blood bath where the suds go
its a swizz beat there the drums go
if shes iffy there the drugs go
if she sip lean doublecup toast

verse 2 lil wayne
get the fuck though i dont bluff bro
i come out the scuffle without a scuff woah
puff puff bro i dont huff though
yellow diamonds up close catch a sunstroke
at your front door with a gun stowed
knock knock whos there is how it wont go
this the jungle so have the utmost
for the nutzos and we nuts so
what the fuck bro its where im from bro
we grow up fast we roll up slow
we throw up gang signs she throw up dope
dreadlock hang down like you dun know
put the green in the bag like a lawnmower
hair trigger pulled back like a cornrow
extra clip in the stash like a console
listenin to bono you listen to donald
what the fuck bro where the love go
swizzy he the chef i like my lunch gross
just look up bro there the scuds go
i see the shovel but where did bruh go
hmm to the unknown
only way he comin back is through his unborns
if you see whats in my bag think im a drug lord
its empty when i give it back now wheres the uproar
chorus lil wayne
what the fuck though where the love go
five four three two i let one go
bow get the fuck though i dont bluff bro
aimin at your head like a buffalo
what the fuck though where the love go
five four three two i let one go
bow get the fuck though i dont bluff bro
aimin at your head like a buffalo39embed"
