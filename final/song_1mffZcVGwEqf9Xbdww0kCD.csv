she was sneakin up her sundress showing off her tatty
she said i like your ride maybe you could be my caddy
what you say you pick us up a sixpack of natty
aww nice
she had a sweet little southern twang
said we dont have to talk about forever things
for tonight maybe we could just hang like a pair of dice

prechorus
said whatever girl you know im down
i was thinkin we could crush this town

chorus
like a beer can in a truck bed
on a slow ride in the sunset hey
bouncin down a small town street
lets pop the top right off this thing
i need a cold drink cause youre a hot mess
let the night do what it does best hey
shake me up and baby turn me loose
i just wanna roll around with you
like a beer can in a truck bed

verse 2
i said girl you got your shades on looking like youre famous
we could turn this little one horse into vegas
holdin you is like im holdin all the aces
i cant lose

she said come on boy pour it on
she didnt know that i was already gone

chorus
like a beer can in a truck bed
on a slow ride in the sunset hey
bouncin down a small town street
lets pop the top right off this thing
i need a cold drink cause youre a hot mess
let the night do what it does best hey
shake me up and baby turn me loose
i just wanna roll around with you
like a beer can in a truck bed
yeah
