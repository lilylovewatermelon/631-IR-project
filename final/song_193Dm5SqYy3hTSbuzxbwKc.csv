break the news—youre walking out
to be a good man for someone else
sorry i was never good like you
stood on my chest and kept me down
hated hearing my name on the lips of a crowd
did my best to exist just for you

prechorus
bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
now shes gonna play and sing and lock you in her heart
bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark

chorus
i am my mothers child ill love you til my breathing stops
ill love you til you call the cops on me
but in our darkest hours i stumbled on a secret power
ill find a way to be without you babe

verse 2
i still feel you now and then
slow like pseudoephedrine
when you see me will you say ive changed
i ride the subway read the signs
i let the seasons change my mind
i love it here since i’ve stopped needing you

bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
now shes gonna play and sing and lock you in her heart
bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark

chorus
i am my mothers child ill love you til my breathing stops
ill love you til you call the cops on me
but in our darkest hours i stumbled on a secret power

i am my mothers child ill love you til my breathing stops
ill love you til you call the cops on me
but in our darkest hours i stumbled on a secret power
ill find a way to be without you babe82embed"
