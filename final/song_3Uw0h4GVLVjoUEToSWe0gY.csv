young with too much cash watch how i came up fast
they say im next to get it
they bring your name up last
and while i made it splash rappers came and passed
but still i ask myself
how long does famous last yeah but i aint worried about it tonight
how long does famous last blow all this cash i might
how long does famous last tell them welcome to the good life
how long does famous last
how long does famous last

verse 1
im addicted to this lifestyle
never going back to no basic shit
when we on tour every nights wild
thinking about the days we werent making shit
spending everything just to make it back
saying everything never take it back
so if you dont fuck with me im okay with that
im okay with that okay with that
in a black shirt and some faded jeans
been around the world in these apcs
working non stop trying to take the keys
off the lot next week spending 80 gs
intro my floor to your ladys knees
always on tour cause im making cheese
michigan in february is 8 degrees
and the fans waiting outside could maybe freeze
yeah smoking on killa
never going on unless your team is strong
yeah finally making skrilla
everywhere i go bring my team along

yeah now im almost famous
still right here with the oldest faces
swear i came up from the coldest places
young man gets everything he goes and chases
aw man

chorus
young with too much cash watch how i came up fast
they say im next to get it
they bring your name up last
and while i made it splash rappers came and passed
but still i ask myself
how long does famous last yeah but i aint worried about it tonight
how long does famous last blow all this cash i might
how long does famous last tell them welcome to the good life
how long does famous last
how long does famous last

verse 2
im trying to marry kate upton
blow this money too quickly
to them squares who trying to hate fuck them
you cant catch me i move too swiftly
im always going through customs
when i leave im knowing you miss me
we run through bottles like nothin
like im tryna drown in this whiskey
indulge in everything we wish
we drink it straight with no mixers
got bitch drinks if you squeamish
at the after parties no pictures
my bag of trees looks greenish
got a bad bitch to roll swishers
this lifestyles the sweetest
man im shining now just like fixtures
yeah do it for my city
everywhere i go bro i rep the bay
yeah tell you its a pity
but hating fucks always got shit to say uh
prechorus
cause im almost famous
still right here with the oldest faces
swear i came up from the coldest places
young man gets everything he goes and chases
aw man

chorus
young with too much cash watch how i came up fast
they say im next to get it
they bring your name up last
and while i made it splash rappers came and passed
but still i ask myself
how long does famous last yeah but i aint worried about it tonight
how long does famous last blow all this cash i might
