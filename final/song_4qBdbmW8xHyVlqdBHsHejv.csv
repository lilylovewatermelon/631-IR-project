i call the shots im a coach
i came to kill like a zoe
im only feeding my folks
climb to the top like a rope
chokers all round my neck ima choke
we cleaning this money with soap
with this bread i stack every loaf
talk to god aint losing no hope
dont give up
dont give up
i hope you dont give up
dont give up no

verse 1
they call me gunna the goat
keep me a gun and i tote
niggas be doin the most
cant go out sad with you hoes
i gotta stick to the code
i water my money then grow it
shit big and its bout to explode
tesla got suicide doors
yes im reaching my goals
its a check every one of my shows
had the handmaid tailor my clothes
its a pay day nigga you owe
lot of diamonds on me im cold
i got fashion on me like vogue
whole lotta drip better leave me alone
my bitch got pink toes
i dont wanna leave it alone
i wanna fuck when i want
got the piece flooded with stones
baby not runnin me home
my brother dead and gone
we was just livin wrong
sip out the pain in the morning

i heard that you had a drought
i made it ship make it bounce
every day i smoke more than an ounce
money machine let it count
clothes that can dress up a house
we loyal you in our you out
i ran up my bag like a sprout
trust me i know what its bout
fed screams and im out
get the racks and you bustin it down

every day ima drip to the ground

we cleaning this money with soap
with this bread i stack and reload

dont give up
dont give up
i hope you dont give up
