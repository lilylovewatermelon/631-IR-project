therell be fire on the mountain
i had a revelation last night
divine inspiration from the other side
of what its going to take to right all this wrong
we need a country music jesus to come and save us all
we need a second coming worse than bad
some longhaired hippie prophet preaching from the book of johnny cash
a sheep among the wolves there standing tall
we need a country music jesus to come and save us all

chorus
therell be fire on the mountain
therell be revival and banging drums
therell be screaming and therell be shouting
when my country music jesus comes

verse 2
weve had our believers in the past
and they gave us a message that would last
they built our house on a foundation of stone
god send a country music jesus to come and save us all

chorus
therell be fire on the mountain
therell be revival and banging drums
therell be screaming and therell be shouting
when my country music jesus comes
therell be fire on the mountain
therell be revival and banging drums
therell be screaming and therell be shouting
when my country music jesus comes
when my country music jesus comessee eric church liveget tickets as low as 200you might also like1embed"
