ive played heart strings before but not in your key
you tell me youre waiting for someone but you haven’t heard no
youve broken promises to me so fuck your word
and again and again you’re breaking me down
let me in let me in from the dark of this town

why am i  bitter bitter bitter
why am i always led astray
its gonna get better better better
id always hear you say
tell me i’m great again and ill love you more
ride high fake confidence right down to my core
strike a nerve like an airstrike raid all under my skin
ill wear a mask to cover myself in the shape of a grin
and again and again you’re breaking me down
let me in let me in from the dark of this town

why am i bitter bitter bitter
why am i always led astray
its gonna get better better better
