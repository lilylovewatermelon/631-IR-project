i remember when
i remember i remember when i lost my mind
there was something so pleasant about that place
even your emotions have an echo in so much space mmm
and when youre out there without care
yeah i was out of touch
but it wasnt because i didnt know enough
i just knew too much mm

chorus 1
does that make me crazy
does that make me crazy
does that make me crazy
possibly

verse 2
and i hope that you are having the time of your life
but think twice thats my only advice mm
come on now who do you
who do you who do you who do you think you are
ha ha ha bless your soul
you really think youre in control

chorus 2
well i think youre crazy
i think youre crazy
i think youre crazy

my heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on the limb
and all i remember is thinkin i wanna be like them mmhmm

and its no coincidence ive come
and i can die when im done

chorus 3

maybe youre crazy
