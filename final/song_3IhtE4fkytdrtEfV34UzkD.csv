betty i wont make assumptions
about why you switched your homeroom but
i think its cause of me
betty one time i was riding on my skateboard
when i passed your house
its like i couldnt breathe

prechorus
you heard the rumors from inez
you cant believe a word she says
most times but this time it was true
the worst thing that i ever did
was what i did to you

chorus
but if i just showed up at your party
would you have me would you want me
would you tell me to go fuck myself
or lead me to the garden
in the garden would you trust me
if i told you it was just a summer thing
im only seventeen i dont know anything
but i know i miss you

verse 2
betty i know where it all went wrong
your favorite song was playing
from the far side of the gym
i was nowhere to be found
i hate the crowds you know that
plus i saw you dance with him

you heard the rumors from inez
you cant believe a word she says
most times but this time it was true
the worst thing that i ever did
was what i did to you

chorus
but if i just showed up at your party
would you have me would you want me
would you tell me to go fuck myself
or lead me to the garden
in the garden would you trust me
if i told you it was just a summer thing
im only seventeen i dont know anything
but i know i miss you

bridge
i was walking home on broken cobblestones
just thinking of you when she pulled up like
a figment of my worst intentions
she said james get in lets drive
those days turned into nights
slept next to her but
i dreamt of you all summer long
verse 3
betty im here on your doorstep
and i planned it out for weeks now
but its finally sinkin in
betty right now is the last time
i can dream about what happens when
you see my face again

prechorus
the only thing i wanna do
is make it up to you
so i showed up at your party
yeah i showed up at your party

chorus
yeah i showed up at your party
will you have me will you love me
will you kiss me on the porch
in front of all your stupid friends
if you kiss me will it be just like i dreamed it
will it patch your broken wings
im only seventeen i dont know anything
but i know i miss you

outro
standing in your cardigan
kissin in my car again
stopped at a streetlight
you know i miss you94embed"
