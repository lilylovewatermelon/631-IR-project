wait a minute
i think i left my conscience on your front doorstep oh oh
wait a minute
i think i left my consciousness in the sixth dimension
but im here right now right now
right now right now
just sitting in a cloud oh wow
im here right now right now with you oh wow oh wow
right now with you
i dont even care
i’ll run my hands through your hair
you wanna run your fingers through mine
but my dreads too thick and thats alright

chorus
hold on wait a minute
feel my hearts intention oh
hold on wait a minute
i left my consciousness in the sixth dimension
left my soul in his vision
lets go get it oh oh
lets go get it oh oh

verse 2
some things dont work
some things are bound to be
some things they hurt
and they tear apart me
you left your diary at my house
and i read those pages do you really love me baby
some things dont work
some things are bound to be
some things they hurt
and they tear apart me
but i broke my word and you were bound to see
and i cried at the curb
when you first said oel ngati kameie

i left my consciousness in the sixth dimension
left my soul in his vision
lets go get it oh oh

some just rather say goodbye bye

left my soul in his vision
