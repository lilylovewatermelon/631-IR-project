i dont want to talk to you anymore
im afraid of what i might say
i bite my tongue everytime you come around
cause blood in my mouth beats blood on the ground

verse 1
hand over my heart i swear ive tried
everything i could within all my power
two weeks and one hour i slaved
and now ive got nothing to show
oh if only youd grow taller than a brick wall
from now on im going to start holding my breath
when you come around and you flex that fake grin
cause something inside me has said more than twice
that breathing less air beats breathing you in

chorus
i dont want to talk to you anymore
im afraid of what i might say
i bite my tongue everytime you come around
cause blood in my mouth beats blood on the ground

verse 2
hand over my mouth im earning the right to my silence
in quiet discerning between ego and timing
good judgment is once again proving to me
that its still worth its weight in gold
from now on im gonna be so much more wary
when you start to speak and my warm blood starts to boil
seeing you is like pulling teeth
and hearing your voice is like chewing tin foil oh yeah
see incubus liveget tickets as low as 55you might also likechorus
i dont want to talk to you anymore
im afraid of what i might say
i bite my tongue everytime you come around
cause blood in my mouth beats blood on the ground

bridge
high fives to better judgment
by saying less today i will gain more gain more
low twos to you my my fickle friend
youâ€™ve brought the art of silent war

chorus
i dont want to talk to you anymore
im afraid of what i might say
i bite my tongue everytime you come around
cause blood in my mouth beats blood on the ground6embed"
