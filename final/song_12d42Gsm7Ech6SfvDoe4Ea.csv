in the depths of my mind i laid sleeping
well i had such a dream when i woke i was weeping
the vision i saw danced around me
and my heart saw the things that my eyes couldnt see

prechorus
oh the sun crashed down to the ground
the moon rose up to the sky blood red
all the dead climbed up out from their graves
they fell to their knees as the stars started screaming

chorus
come one come all come see and believe in
the truth will shine if you open your eyes
and youll see it move as it moves on the masses
the weak will rise and give birth to the sky
and give birth to the sky

verse 2
no it didnt stop there it consumed me
and it crushed me with joy as its beauty swept through me
i was moved by the weight of it all
ive been touched by the light yes i know what i saw

prechorus
oh the sun crashed down to the ground
the moon rose up to the sky blood red
all the dead climbed up out from their graves
they fell to their knees as the stars started screaming
see cage the elephant liveget tickets as low as 399you might also likechorus
come one come all come see and believe in
the truth will shine if you open your eyes
and youll see it move as it moves on the masses
the weak will rise and give birth to the sky
and give birth to the sky

interlude
ha ha ha ha ha oh

bridge
i saw the dreamers dreaming i heard the people singing
the dinosaurs are dying the mind controls subsiding
i saw a new path beaten free thinkers freely thinking
cant stop a thought from breathing it moves like fire

prechorus
the sun crashed down to the ground
the moon rose up to the sky blood red
all the dead climbed up out from their graves
they fell to their knees as the stars started screaming

chorus
come one come all come see and believe in
the truth will shine if you open your eyes
and youll see it move as it moves on the masses
the weak will rise and give birth to the sky
and give birth to the sky ooh2embed"
