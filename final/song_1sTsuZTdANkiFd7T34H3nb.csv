i did my best to notice
when the call came down the line
up to the platform of surrender
i was brought but i was kind
and sometimes i get nervous
when i see an open door
close your eyes clear your heart

cut the cord

chorus
are we human
or are we dancer
my sign is vital
my hands are cold
and im on my knees
looking for the answer
are we human
or are we dancer

verse 2
pay my respects to grace and virtue
send my condolences to good
give my regards to soul and romance
they always did the best they could
and so long to devotion
