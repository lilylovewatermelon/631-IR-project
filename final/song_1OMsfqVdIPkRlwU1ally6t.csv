i like mondays now
had the time around
my dawn your sunset’s beating down

i like mondays now
you’re weak and weeded out
flat of the land you’re burning out

prechorus
if you wanna stay if you wanna stay if you wanna stay
if you wanna stay if you wanna stay

chorus
wake up
you’re losing ground
wake up
you’re gagged and bound
wake up
we’ll turn things ‘round
wake up
right and right again

know you can do better
if we pull together
do you think i’m clever
do you
right and right again
verse
if you hold your rank
you’ll have me to thank
and you break new rules go spread the news

i know i can be forward i know i can be forward
in a way too awkward in a way too awkward
if i can’t convince i will confuse

prechorus
if you wanna stay if you wanna stay if you wanna stay
gonna have to come to bed

chorus
wake up
you’re losing ground
wake up
you’re gagged and bound
wake up
we’ll turn things ‘round
wake up
right and right again

know you can do better
if we pull together
do you think i’m clever
do you
right and right again
instrumental

right and right again

chorus
wake up
you’re losing ground
wake up
you’re gagged and bound
wake up
we’ll turn things ‘round
wake up
right and right again

know you can do better
if we pull together
do you think i’m clever
do you
right and right againyou might also likeembed"
