your heart is carved in stone
and apathy flows in your veins
when flesh falls from the bone
youve taken all you can take

prechorus
you can take
all you can take
you can take

chorus
dont believe in anyone
cause theyll fail you so much more
deep inside the venom is burning
lover

verse 2
when stink fades into smell
the liquor has washed you away
when face cracks into smile
youve taken all you can take

prechorus
you can take
all you can take
you can take
see seether liveget tickets as low as 105you might also likechorus
dont believe in anyone
cause theyll fail you so much more
deep inside the venom is burning
lover

bridge
you can take
ill give in
you cant break
whats broken
your mistake
ill rest my body in the ground

chorus
dont believe in anyone
cause theyll fail you so much more
deep inside the venom is burning
lover

outro
dont believe in anyone
curse the day that you were born
cant deny the enemys taken over
