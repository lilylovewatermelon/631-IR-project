all we do right is make love
and we both know now that ain’t enough

chorus
ain’t gonna beg you to stay
aint gotta ask you whats wrong
ain’t no reason running after something already gone
take off your leavin dress
let’s do what we do best
i guess everybody’s got their way of moving on
girl rest your head one more time in my bed
love me like you loved me when you loved me
and you didn’t have to try
let’s lay down tonight
and kiss tomorrow goodbye

verse 2
baby who we are just didn’t work
but maybe we can leave with something out of all this hurt

chorus
ain’t gonna beg you to stay
ain’t gotta ask you what’s wrong
ain’t no reason running after something already gone
take off your leavin dress
let’s do what we do best
i guess everybody’s got their way of moving on
girl rest your head one more time in my bed
love me like you loved me when you loved me
and you didn’t have to try
let’s lay down tonight
and kiss tomorrow goodbye
