cam erlim is that it
oh no cam rellim haha
cam rellim at your service with these verses

verse 1
ayo im park bench chillin burger patty grillin
everybody love to say my name is rumpelstiltskin
call up wolfgang puck tell him come and bring a meal in
my stomach full ill go against the world like scott pilgrim
way above the buildin bungee jumpin down
they say im gettin trendy like i come after a pound sign
hashtag mac this aint backpack rap
give a fuck bout what you sayin after platinumplated plaques
take it back cookin on them hoes you can make a casserole
mad that i can rap so well and everything all factual
aint worth it if not laughable im off the wall as racquetball
dick that keep your girl awake all night they call it adderall
youngin on his grind workin harder than your dad work
black shirt rellim cam thats my name said backwards
ask first hell nah treat em like a bellhop
let em hold my bags and give a tip for that ass boy

chorus
im too old to be chillin at the playground
say im too old to be chillin at the playground
never be too old to be chillin at the playground
shorty come and kick it at the swings at the swings
im way too old to be chillin at the playground
say im too old to be chillin at the playground
cops comin muthafucker stay down
girl ill be waitin at the swings hey at the swings

ayo im blue park slidin gocart drivin
got this rap shit down to a science
my louis belt way nicer than orions confined to an assignment
you wont finish in the kitchen like appliance
is just a muthafuckin kid say my head is gettin big
no thats my ego trippin somewhere where they need a skislope
rockin in the fall like a peacoat freaks with a deep throat
students run the class yall should keep notes
drunk then im hard to understand don vito
ace in the casino im robert de niro
i be low key though young nino with my jeans low heh
your girl love it when i speak slow she go woman moans
you can hear the way shes moanin
started back at midnight at it til the mornin
wake up with some mornin wood
hit it before work yeah im sure she would
all my female fans like im sure its good haha

chorus
im too old to be chillin at the playground
say im too old to be chillin at the playground
never be too old to be chillin at the playground
shorty come and kick it at the swings at the swings
im way too old to be chillin at the playground
say im too old to be chillin at the playground
cops comin muthafucker stay down
girl ill be waitin at the swings at the swings2embed"
