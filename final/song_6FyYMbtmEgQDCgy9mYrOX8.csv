used to dream of driving foreigns had to grab one
of all my mamas children im the bad one i admit that
god gone have to call and tell me to give yo shit back
i was thuggin way before tony put trevor on a shit bag

verse 1 lil baby  pooh shiesty
lil juan got killed it hit me been my nigga since elementary
justin tried to make me go half on buddy lawyer i wasnt wit it
all these niggas do is brag but go out bad i just dont get it
they be poppin on the gram but they cant pop out in my city
every charged i had dismissed
swallow my kids you dont get no kiss
ion play games but a nigga send blitz
everything change when a nigga get rich
glock with a switch how a nigga gone miss
made you that now a nigga tryna diss
some of this shit im just never gone get
ion fuck around i can still get bricks
foes to the grave i aint never gone switch
where the fuck im gon go
she got everything young coco
i just gave my hood some more hope
we just sold another truckload
bought her everythin in soho
she cant keep me on the low low
you know im a big bill
you know i got big drill ayy yuh yup

two fns sittin up in my lap cant even control the wheel
i gotta start actin more like a rapper and stop tryna kill
some niggas wit me caught a body keep it solid wit me still
play wit us i bet you call it off
they know big shiest take beef for real
then the more i get to flashin get to crashin i aint tryna chill
yo bitch gon drop her panties
diamonds dancin im just standin still
i used to go zip shit up for a ten
now its gone cost a mil
niggas dont never wanna put in work
pick up my chop know how i do
if you spot shiesty with baby
we slidin round wit four carbons full
but them niggas just tired of gettin bullied we is not into it
when i see all them views watchin
wait til i put you up in a wood
911 we got eyes on em bitches overstood
i pull up shootin up in yo projects say i cant go to my hood
brr
brr brr
ayy yuh

chorus lil baby
used to dream of driving foreigns had to grab one
of all my mamas children im the bad one i admit that
god gone have to call and tell me to give yo shit back
i was thuggin way before tony put trevor on a shit bagembed"
