verse 1
you youve got your head in a screen
and i i’m trying to get your attention
you appear as a child with your heart on your sleeve
but you’re acting exactly as you do in my dreams
i said you you are not what you seem
and you’re finding out that

chorus
falling down can feel strange
no one remembers your name
you’re losing the game
that’s the thing about trust
it’s always the same
sad story again
you lose all your friends
that’s the thing about trust

verse 2
you you got your head in a sling
yeah and i im trying to give you salvation
you appear as a devil
like a wolf in the woods
but youre acting exactly as we expected you would
i said you you hear the words that i sing its a shock to the system
