water grey
through the windows up the stairs
chilling rain
like an ocean everywhere

prechorus chester bennington
dont want to reach for me do you
i mean nothing to you
the little things give you away
and now there will be no mistaking
the levees are breakin

was someone to truly look up to you
and six feet underwater i do

verse 2 chester bennington

washed away
as a nation simply stares

dont want to reach for me do you
i mean nothing to you
the little things give you away
but now there will be no mistakin
the levees are breakin

and six feet underwater i do
all youve ever wanted
was someone to truly look up to you
