before you hedge those bets youve placed against me
be reticent of fortunes they foretell
your verbal defecation i cant wash away despite myself
your vanity it seems has served you well

youre so quick to choose the path walked by the righteous
so you can go and nest among the weak
the innocent observers will refuse to find the lie within
renew the disappointment of the meek

youre no jesus christ
youre no jesus christ

put the gun in my mouth and pull the trigger
i feel so alive here
put the gun in my mouth that tastes so bitter
i feel so alive here
youre no jesus christ
youre no jesus christ

chorus
you keep taking over i keep rolling over
i cant take it anymore
you keep taking over i keep rolling over
i cant take it anymore

before you hedge those bets you placed against me

your verbal defecation i cant wash away despite myself
your vanity it seems has served you well

chorus
you keep taking over i keep rolling over
i cant take it anymore
you keep taking over i keep rolling over

i cant take it anymoreembed"
