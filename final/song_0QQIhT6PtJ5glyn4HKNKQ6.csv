all the pretty girls like samuel
oh he really doesnt share
though its more than he can handle
life is anything but fair life is anything but fair

verse 2
just as soon as they turn older
hell come and sweep them off their feet
its only making me feel smaller
all the hidden love beneath

chorus
so wont you lay me wont you lay me down
wont you lay me wont you lay me down
wont you lay me wont you lay me down
wont you lay me wont you lay me down

bridge
all alone alone again
no one lends a helping hand
i have waited i have waited
takes a toll ones foolish pride
how long before i see the light
i have waited i have waited for you to lay me down

sail on by sail on by for now
they play naked in the water
you know its hard heaven knows ive tried
but it just keeps getting harder

chorus
so wont you lay me wont you lay me down
wont you lay me wont you lay me down
wont you lay me wont you lay me down
wont you lay me wont you lay

wont you lay me oh wont you lay me down
oh wont you lay me say wont you lay me down
wont you lay me down
