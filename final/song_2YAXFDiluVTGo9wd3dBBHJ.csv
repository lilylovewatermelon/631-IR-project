verse 2 jayz  mike shinoda
look what you made me do look what i made for you
knew if i paid my dues how will they pay you
when you first come in the game they try to play you
then you drop a couple of hits look how they wave to you look how they wave to you
from marcy to madison square
to the only thing that matters in just a matter of years yeah
as fate would have it jays status appears
to be at an alltime high perfect time to say goodbye
when i come back like jordan
wearin the 45 it aint to play games with you
its to aim at you probably maim you
if i owe you im blowin you to smithereens
cocksucker take one for your team
and i need you to remember one thing one thing
i came i saw i conquered
from record sales to soldout concerts
so motherfucker if you want this encore
i need you to scream til your lungs get sore come on
verse 3 chester bennington  mike shinoda
im tired of being what you want me to be
feeling so faithless lost under the surface
dont know what youre expecting of me
put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow
every step that i take is another mistake to you
caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow
and every second i waste is more than i can take

chorus chester bennington  jayz
ive become so numb i cant feel you there
become so tired so much more aware
im becoming this all i want to do
is be more like me and be less like you
ive become so numb
can i get a encore do you want more more more more
ive become so numb
so for one last time i need yall to roar
one last time i need yall to roarembed"
