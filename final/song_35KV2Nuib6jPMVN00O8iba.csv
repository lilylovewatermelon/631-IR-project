believe it or not
believe it or not
chorus charlie wilson  kid cudi
make no mistake girl i still love you
make no mistake girl i still love you
make no mistake girl i still love you
make no mistake girl i still love you

verse kanye west  slick rick
take the top off let the sun come in the lord still shines on you
whoa for all my dogs that stayed down we up again again
oh i got dirt on my name i got white on my beard
i had debt on my books its been a shakyass year
let me make this clear so all yall see
i dont take advice from people less successful than me
hah aint no love lost but the gloves off
and we up in this bitch until they turn the club off
had to tell the dogs turn the snubs off
plus they already mad that the cubs lost
believe it or not these two wrongsll right you
believe it or not i was too grown in high school
believe it or not the true soul of ice cube
too close to snipe you truth told i like you
too bold to type you too rich to fight you
calm down you light skin

make no mistake girl i still love you
believe it or not the lord still shines on you
make no mistake girl i still love you no way
