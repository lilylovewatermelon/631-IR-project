i been waitin wide awake for the waves to come and take
take me right to you
one hundred bottles of the good shit couldnt even bring you back
what am i to do
feel like im circlin a drain all i see is the remains of an ugly truth of an ugly truth
one hundred models i could follow all the way to hell and back but they cant replace you they cant replace you

oh oh oh ohh
oh oh oh ohh
oh oh oh ohh ohh
oh oh oh ohh

oh oh oh ohh ohh

verse 1
i was puttin on for you like a jersey
what i didnt know then couldnt hurt me
never thought that youd go and do me dirty
left me in the cold but on the inside i was burnin
but thats just the way it goes
wish that i could have control
everybody dies alone
and i aint dead yet
see post malone liveget tickets as low as 186you might also likerefrain
say my prayers but i lost faith a long time ago a long time ago
dream nightmares
i guess were gettin used to losin hope guess were losing hope
i dont even wonder why you dont answer when i call your name
are you on the other side will you save us
or will you run away

chorus 2
im still waitin wide awake for the waves to come and take
take me right to you take me right to you
one hundred vials of denial i know they wont bring you back
what am i to do what am i to do
you’re my alibi and motive when im lyin to myself what an ugly truth what an ugly truth
we’re no strangers to the flame
we will never be the same if we make it through and we can make it through

verse 2
my back is up against the wall
but i used to feel invincible
yeah it was us against the world
but somehow someway the tables turned
i remember back then
played my cards right you were my best hand
still you keep me guessin
wonder if ill ever get the message
refrain
say my prayers but i lost faith a long time ago a long time ago
dream nightmares
i guess were gettin used to losin hope guess were losing hope
i dont even wonder why you dont answer when i call your name
are you on the other side will you save us
or will you run away

outro
are you on the other side will you save us
or will you run away40embed"
