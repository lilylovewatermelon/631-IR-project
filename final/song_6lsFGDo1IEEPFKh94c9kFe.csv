meet the latest graduate of king’s college
i prob’ly shouldn’t brag but dag i amaze and astonish
the scholars say i got the same virtuosity and brains as my pops
the ladies say my brain’s not where the resemblance stops
i’m only nineteen but my mind is older
gotta be my own man like my father but bolder
i shoulder his legacy with pride
i used to hear him say
that someday
i would—

ensemble
blow us all away

philip
ladies i’m lookin for a mr george eacker
made a speech last week our fourth of july speaker
he disparaged my father’s legacy in front of a crowd
i can’t have that i’m making my father proud
martha
i saw him just up broadway a couple of blocks
he was goin’ to see a play

philip
well i’ll go visit his box
you might also likedolly
god you’re a fox

philip
and y’all look pretty good in ya’ frocks
how ‘bout when i get back we all strip down to our socks
both
ok
company
blow us all away

philip
george
george
shh

philip
george

george
shh i’m tryin’ to watch the show

philip
ya’ shoulda watched your mouth before you
talked about my father though
george
i didn’t say anything that wasn’t true
your father’s a scoundrel and so it seems are you

ensemble
ooooooooooh

philip
it’s like that

george
yeah i don’t fool around
i’m not your little schoolboy friends

philip
see you on the dueling ground
that is unless you wanna step outside and go now

george
i know where to find you piss off
i’m watchin’ this show now

shh

philip
pops if you had only heard the shit he said about you
i doubt you would have let it slide and i was not about to—
hamilton
slow down

philip
i came to ask you for advice this is my very first duel
they don’t exactly cover this subject in boarding school

hamilton
did your friends attempt to negotiate a peace

philip
he refused to apologize we had to let the peace talks cease

hamilton
where is this happening

philip
across the river in jersey

hamiltonphilip
everything is legal in new jersey…

hamilton
alright so this is what you’re gonna do
stand there like a man until eacker is in front of you
when the time comes fire your weapon in the air
this will put an end to the whole affair

philip
but what if he decides to shoot then i’m a goner

hamilton
no he’ll follow suit if he’s truly a man of honor
to take someone’s life that is something you can’t shake
philip your mother can’t take another heartbreak

philip
father—

hamilton
promise me you don’t want this
young man’s blood on your conscience

philip
okay i promise

hamilton
come back home when you’re done
take my guns be smart make me proud son

philip
my name is philip
i am a poet
i’m a little nervous but i can’t show it
i’m sorry i’m a hamilton with pride
you talk about my father i cannot let it slide
mister eacker how was the rest of your show

george
i’d rather skip the pleasantries
let’s go
grab your pistol

philip
confer with your men
the duel will commence after we count to ten

ensemble
count to ten

philip
look ‘em in the eye aim no higher
summon all the courage you require
then slowly and clearly aim your gun towards the sky—

male ensemble
one two three four

full ensemble
five six seven—13embed"
