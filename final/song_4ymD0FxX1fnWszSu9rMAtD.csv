cream five five five stars cream up in the
rock rock rockstars

chorus jesse rutherford
if i had it my way i would sing all day
and never say a word to you
if i had it my way i would laugh all night
and never feel a shade of blue
if i had it my way i would be fine
wouldnt be thinking all the time
i could just do mhm whatever i want to mhm
i would be free to do whatever i want to
yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah

verse 1 ghostface killah
yeah yo if i had it my way the high way
supreme clientele 365 days in the telly
five stars rockstars laughing with dirt
me and osiris son putting in work
mornings in the mosh afternoons at the juice bar
bentley coup√© maybach haters i rebuke yall
little who call cigar may be a preroll
fake room service knocking at the door they wanted migos
if my way i would play the reverend al green
with super fly playing on a 90 inch screen
every chain would have rocks the size of gumballs
and my house would have basquiats hung on the walls
my way like sinatra little butter on the matzah
nothing but cream up in the crib i mean lots of
rubber bands stack private securities
smelting down gold 24k for the purity

if i had it my way every day would feel like friday
no cell phones would vibrate
clutch on this sm58 everything moving at my pace
focus on the path that i pave for myself
i aint worry bout noone else
nothing but a vision in my lane
all bffs in myspace all vvs my top eight
free bitch to do what i want to

bridge jesse rutherford  ghostface killah
hey hey rock rockstars
hey

chorus jesse rutherford
if i had it my way i would sing all day

i could just do mhm whatever i want to mhm
i would be free to do whatever i want to
