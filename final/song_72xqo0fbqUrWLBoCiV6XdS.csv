girl you and me aint talking much
i just slam the door and leave in my truck
there aren’t nothing left for us i think enoughs enough
i look down see your name there on my phone
then i hit ignore and just drive on
weve been living like this too long
and there aint no reason to turn around baby you can have it all

chorus
i aint i aint coming back
ive already been there done that
and im done with you messing with my mind
the last times the last time baby
i can only change who i am so much
and all i can give is all my love
and my love aint never been enough
so i aren’t coming back
ive been there done that

verse 2
street by street and town after little town
feels like im on the right road now
i bet youre probably wondering how i could just walk out
i put you high up as i could
and i know ive done everything i should
to try to make a bad thing good
i guess it just took too long for me to see
we werent meant to be

i aint i aint coming back
ive already been there done that
and im done with you messing with my mind
the last times the last time baby
i can only change who i am so much
and all i can give is all my love
and my love aint never been enough
so i aint coming back
ive been there done that

bridge
ill wake up and ill start to second guess myself
and ill crave your touch oh but i know too well

chorus
that i aint i aint coming back
ive already been there done that
and im done with you messing with my mind
the last times the last time baby
i can only change who i am so much
and all i can give is all my love
and my love aint never been enough
so i aint coming back
no i aint coming back
ive been there done that1embed"
