verse juice wrld
uh acidic a bunch of bad habits with bad magic
cant disappear and reappear in the same sentence im bad at it
the mad hatter the perc packer
the mom thrasher
the perc mixed with the syrup turn me into a contractor
a straight tweak so high i cant speak
been three weeks i still havent met my peak
like i could be someone other than myself
like i could find a little heaven up in my hell
yeah i know it never ever end well
yeah i know i always fall victim to a rich spell
uh like abracadabra
the flow so raw forgot to grab magnums
been rawdoggin bitches ever since i went platinum
i feel like hell full of bad bitches
wonder if its room in heaven for savages
my lifes a canvas im paintin in blood like a cannibal
rip off his head and i salvage it huh
a little too graphic
at least you niggas know that i still got the passion
of someone who dont got shit but the clothes on they back
and its been that way since way back since
like im a killer or somethin
these niggas lipsyncin like milli vanilli or somethin
im like lil wayne i got a millimillimilli or somethin i guess
im rich in broke pockets bountiful
my souls empty so deep ten feet
you might also likeinterlude juice wrld
times ten feet
fuck love its gon take more to convince me that you with me
and not against me
where im from we load it up
pop out and turn niggas into mincemeat

follies on a tuesday not one but two
not one stack or two
look at all the cash i blew
follies on a tuesday not one but two
not one stack or two
look at all the cash i blew
strippers out in vegas new orleans too
booties just dont shake like priscillas do
follies on a tuesday not one but two
not one stack or two
look at all the cash i blew
follies on a tuesday not one but two
not one stack or two
look at all the cash i blew
strippers out in vegas new orleans too
booties just dont shake like priscillas do

booties just dont shake like priscillas do25embed"
