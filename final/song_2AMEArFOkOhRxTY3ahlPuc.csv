cherish
two circular hues of blue with a gray shade
so captivating
more than you know
false perceptions
that brought forth these questions of
truth love and hope
now that youre injuring
ill carry you with me just
please hold on

hook
disappear and dissolve
a weakening wall
will one day fall
its wise to sever our loss
i redefine pulse
through your iris

verse 2
loves not all lost
but its nailed to my cross
and crucified all that ive held on
to be awaiting
anticipating a touch such as yours
false affection
a spawn of neglecting
of love lust hoax
please understand me
that now where youre standing
is closer then id hoped
