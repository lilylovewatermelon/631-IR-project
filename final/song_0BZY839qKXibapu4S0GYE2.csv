walcott dont you know that its insane
dont you want to get out of cape cod
out of cape cod tonight
walcott mystic seaport is that way
dont you know that your life could be lost
out of cape cod tonight

verse 2
walcott dont you know that its insane
dont you want to get out of cape cod
out of cape cod tonight
walcott the bottleneck is a shit show
hyannisport is a ghetto
out of cape cod tonight

the lobsters claw is sharp as knives
evil feasts on human lives
the holy roman empire roots for you

verse 3
walcott all the way to new jersey
all the way to the garden state
out of cape cod tonight
