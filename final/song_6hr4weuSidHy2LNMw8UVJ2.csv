i i been gone
been gone too long singing my songs on the road
another town one more show and im coming home
dont give a damn what these keys are for
im gonna knock down that front door and

chorus
ima find out what that house is made of
been too many nights since its felt us make love
i wanna rock some sheetrock knock some pictures off the wall
love you baby like a wrecking ball

verse 2
you look at you
send me one more shot sitting on a bathroom sink
damn you really turn me on painting your toenails pink
easy baby before you say
but if i can make it just one more day and

chorus
that old house is gonna be shaking
i hope those bricks and boards can take it
but i wont be surprised if the whole damn place just falls
im gonna rock you baby like a wrecking ball
see eric church liveget tickets as low as 200you might also likethat old house is gonna be shaking
rafter rocking foundation quaking
crash right through the front door back you up against the wall
love you baby
take it right there baby
rock you baby like a wrecking ball13embed"
