right here right now i put the offer out
i dont wanna chase you down but i know you see it
you run with me and i can cut you free
out of the drudgery and walls you keep in
so trade that typical for somethin colorful
and if its crazy live a little crazy
you can play it sensible a king of conventional
or you can risk it all and see

chorus hugh jackman
dont you wanna get away
from the same old part you gotta play
cause i got what you need so come with me and take the ride
itll take you to the other side
cause you can do like you do or you can do like me
stay in the cage or youll finally take the key
oh damn suddenly youre free to fly
itll take you to the other side

verse 2 zac efron
okay my friend you want to cut me in
well i hate to tell you but it just wont happen
so thanks but no i think im good to go
cause i quite enjoy the life you say im trapped in
now i admire you and that whole show you do
youre onto somethin really its somethin
but i live among the swells and we dont pick up peanut shells
ill have to leave that up to you
you might also likechorus zac efron
dont you know that im okay
with this uptown part i get to play
cause i got what i need and i dont wanna take the ride
i dont need to see the other side
so go and do like you do im good to do like me
aint in a cage so i dont need to take the key
oh damn cant you see im doin fine
i dont need to see the other side

bridge hugh jackman  zac efron
now is this really how you like to spend your days
whiskey and misery and parties and plays
if i were mixed up with you id be the talk of the town
disgraced and disowned another one of the clowns
but you would finally live a little finally laugh a little
just let me give you the freedom to dream
and itll wake you up and cure your achin
take your walls and start em breakin
now thats a deal that seems worth takin
but i guess ill leave that up to you

verse 3 zac efron  hugh jackman
well its intriguing but to go would cost me greatly
so what percentage of the show would i be taking
fair enough youd want a piece of all the action
id give you seven we could shake and make it happen
i wasnt born this morning eighteen would be just fine
why not just go ahead and ask for nickels on the dime
fifteen
id do eight
twelve
maybe nine
ten
chorus both zac efron hugh jackman
dont you wanna get away
to a whole new part youre gonna play
cause i got what you need so come with me and take the ride
to the other side
so we can do like i do so if you do like me
forget the cage cause we know how to make the key
oh damn suddenly were free to fly
were goin to the other side

outro zac efron hugh jackman both
so if you do like i do to the other side
so if you do like me were goin to the other side
cause if we do were goin to the other side
were goin to the other side56embed"
