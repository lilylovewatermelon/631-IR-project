wanna hear some funky dixieland
pretty mama come on take me by the hand
by the hand by the hand by the hand

verse 1
hey did you hear about the one that got away
they say he looked left she turned right
meant to be together but not that night
its when fates running late we tend to make mistakes
we go round and round from love to love
its either way too much or not enough

prechorus 1
give me lazy days with nothing better to do
than singing old black water keep on rolling while i wait for you

chorus 1
i dont care if it rains ill be just fine
im leaving the ghosts behind until
i got you i got you
youre the sun through my window warming my skin
oh you i got you hey

verse 2
then when one of them was taken the other one was waiting
for the next big thing to bring them to the gates of heaven
or maybe just a late night in vegas
its true thats what we do when were going down swinging
then coming up singing the blues
wearing out my shoes
chasing new faces to get to you
see train liveget tickets as low as 24you might also likeprechorus 2
driving home on a summer night
singing old black water keep on rolling til the time is right

chorus 2
i dont care if it rains ill be just fine
sit back enjoy the ride until
i got you i got you
youre the sun through my window warming my skin
oh you i got you
like sonny and cher except ill be there for you
i got you let old black water bring us together

mississippi moon wont you keep on shining on me
