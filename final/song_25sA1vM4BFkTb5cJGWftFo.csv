youve got your mother and your brother
every other undercover telling you what to say what to say
you think im stupid but the truth is that its cupid baby
lovin you has made me this way

prechorus 1
so before you point your finger
get your hands off of my trigger
oh yeah
you need to know this situations getting old
and now the more you talk the less i can take oh

im looking for attention not another question
should you stay or should you go
well if you dont have the answer
why you still standin here
hey hey hey hey

verse 2
i waited here for you like a kid waiting after school
so tell me how come you never showed never showed
i gave you everything and never asked for anything
and look at me im all alone alone
