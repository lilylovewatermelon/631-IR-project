now those might be the saddest
big old baby blues i ever seen
how did i know youd been crying
baby you got makeup running down your cheek
youre just a queen looking for a crown
lost when you stumbled over some silly clown

chorus
take that frown
turn it upside down
cause you never know who might be
falling in love with your smile

verse 2
a broken heart thats on the mend
takes a little time i realise
and right now you wouldnt know
true love if it looked you in the eye
girl i did my best i really tried to make you grin
and before i say goodbye im gonna tell you again

chorus
take that frown
turn it upside down
cause you never know who might be
falling in love with your smile
you might also likeinstrumental break

chorus
take that frown
turn it upside down
cause you never know who might be
falling in love with your smile

outro
those might be the saddest
big old baby blues i ever seenembed"
