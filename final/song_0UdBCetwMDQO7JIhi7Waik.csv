she told me not to step on the cracks
i told her not to fuss and relax
well her pretty little face stopped me in my tracks

prechorus
but now she sleeps with one eye open
thats the price shell pay

verse 2
i took a knife and cut out her eye
i took it home and watched it wither and die
well shes lucky that i didnt slip her a smile

prechorus
thats why she sleeps with one eye open oh
but thats the price shell pay

chorus
i said hey girl with one eye
get your filthy fingers out of my pie
i said hey girl with one eye
ill cut your little heart out cause you made me cry

verse 3
i slipped my hand under her skirt
i said dont worry its not gonna hurt
oh my reputations kind of clouded with dirt
