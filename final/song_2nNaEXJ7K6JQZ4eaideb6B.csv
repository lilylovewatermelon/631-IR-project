home was never home to me at anytime
every front door found me open i would find the back door open
there just had to be an exit for the running kind

within me theres a prison surrounding me alone
as real as any dungeon with its walls of stone
i know runnings not the answer but runnings been my nature
and the thing in me that keeps me moving on

i was born the running kind leaving always on my mind
home was never home to me at anytime
every front door found me open i would find the back door open
there just had to be an exit for the running kindyou might also likeembed"
