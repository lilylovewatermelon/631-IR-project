i wont shut you out anymore
im letting go of this killing floor
so embrace yourself for the first time in your days
so save yourself for the first time in your ways

prechorus
trust yourself its harsh out there
hear my words ive always cared

chorus
please be brave
cause i need your faith

verse 2
im paranoid in many ways
were muddled up in a muddled haze
so mould yourself to save a sense of your soul
dont scold yourself take heed and gain control

prechorus
trust yourself its harsh out there
hear my words ive always cared

chorus
please be brave
cause i need your faith
please be brave
cause i need your faith
