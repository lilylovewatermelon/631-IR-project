verse 1
youve been alone
youve been afraid
ive been a fool in so many ways
but i would change my life if you thought you might try to love me

so please give me another chance to write you another song
and take back those things ive done
cause ill give you my heart if you would let me start all over again

im just a man who had heaven and earth in the palm of his hand
but i threw it away
so now i stand here today askin forgiveness
and if you could
