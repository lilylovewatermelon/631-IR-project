she was working a summer job
sellin tshirts towels and sunblock
a midwest girl who couldnt live without the beach
i was a local boy who worked next door
never seen a smile like hers before
she put her feet up on the dash of my old jeep
it was henna tattoos tank tops and ray bans
and hearts drawn in the sand

chorus
cause summer flings aint meant to last
they always burn too hot too fast
you dont talk about it cause you both understand
you get drunk on those boardwalk days
that pretty buzzed look on her face
and it fades away just like a seaside tan
and hearts drawn in the sand

verse 2
sit out on the saint johns pier
she drank wine and i drank beer
and when we saw a boat light blink wed make a wish
then wed take a walk where the waves hit your feet
shed lean right in close to me
and i could taste the sun and salt on her lips
and that day would wash away when the tide came in
like hearts drawn in the sand

cause summer flings aint meant to last
they always burn too hot too fast
you dont talk about it cause you both understand
you get drunk on those boardwalk days
that pretty buzzed look on her face
and it fades away just like a seaside tan
and hearts drawn in the sand

outro
yeah you get drunk on those boardwalk days
and that pretty buzzed look on her face
and it fades away just like a seaside tan
and hearts drawn in the sandembed"
