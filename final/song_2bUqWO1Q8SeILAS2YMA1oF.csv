child of burning time
child of burning time

verse 1
my only consolation is all lies
the apex of my consequence is dying here tonight
winter hasnt ended and it always looks like rain
i cant remember anything anything
inside the absolution we succumb
and appetites are bittersweet i think im going numb
a chance to give up avarice has marked my one regret
the child of burning time is gone he hasnt come back yet

verse 2
before i tell my story please consider who i am
i missed my window years ago im doing all i can
a tragedy is commonplace but in the end they go away
my skin is still the only stain im left to wear in shame

prechorus
i cut my name into my heart
ill tear it all apart

chorus
i beg you burn me away
i wont become your hero just to fight the life i saved
burn me away
i wont give up tomorrow just to lose it all today

ill burn away
ill burn away
ill burn away
ill burn away

verse 3
my isolation is my course
the effect it has on life itself is a cancer on its source
i rue the moments spent between the fetish and the flame
until this war is over i wont ever lose my rage

prechorus
i cut my name into my soul
i guess ill never know

chorus
i beg you burn me away
i wont become your hero just to fight the life i saved
burn me away
i wont give up tomorrow just to lose it all today
burn me away
i wont become your hero just to fight the life i saved
burn me away
i wont give up tomorrow just to lose it all lose it all today3embed"
