i still remember the night you tried to kiss me through the window
i tried to settle for the taste of touching glass over the sound of answering machines
because i love the way your voice it says its gonna get back to me someday oh oh
as i brace my knees you hold me down with your eyes

chorus
and someday ill drive close both my eyes
well swim in circles in the blue lights

verse 2
its gonna be the best day of my life
and oh my god youll never be as beautiful without me
beauty needs an animal to breathe
and baby youll be alright as long as im not
so do that dance in the dark
sharpen your teeth and bite as hard as you want

chorus
and someday ill drive close both my eyes
well swim in circles in the blue lights
and i just want to fade away into the sky under the sea
a million kisses underwater as we walk into the ocean ocean ocean
oh no

breakdown
and this is gonna be the best day of my life
a celebration of an ending
come on
see pierce the veil liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likeverse 3
and do you really trust your tongue or did you bury the taste
and is this fantasy real or is it all homemade
and did you call me last night just cause you couldnt get laid
ladies and gentlemen i introduce the selfish machine

bridge
yeah thats fucking right
do you think youre the only one afraid
do you think youre the only one afraid
do you think youre the only one afraid of this machine ooh
afraid

chorus
and someday ill drive close both my eyes
ill be your breath if you can be mine
and i just want to fade away into the sky under the sea
a million kisses underwater as we walk into the ocean waves

outro
oh no oh woah one two one two three four
and do you see me at all under the tall waves
and do you see me at all
ladada dada dada da
dadada dadada
ah dadadada da16embed"
