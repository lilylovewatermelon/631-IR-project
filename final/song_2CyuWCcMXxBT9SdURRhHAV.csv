where did i go wrong
ohhh
ohhhhh
girl when you went away
you took a part of me and
you told me not to wait
you said you want to be free
but i thought wed be together
never thought that id be here alone
i used to think you would never
youd never leave our happy home

i thought that we were fine
and everything was cool
but maybe i was blind
maybe i was being the fool
cause i didnt see this comin
didnt know that you would walk away
so im searching for the answers
and maybe you can just tell me

where did i go wrong
and how can i make it right
tell me where did i go wrong
you know i wanna make it right
and make you come back it me
you might also likealthough were miles apart
im still here missing you and
you know youre in my heart
you know im wanting you
and i can still remember
all the joy that you have brought to me
and i thought wed stay together
now im here just wondering

where did i go wrong
and how can i make it right
tell me where did i go wrong
you know i wanna make it right
and make you come back to me

you know youll always be there in my heart
i still think about you everyday think about you everyday
i never thought that wed be apart
didnt realize i pushed you away
now i think i would do anything
just to have you again
and i keep wondering  wondering

where did i go wrong
and how can i make it right
tell me where did i go wrong
you know i wanna make it right
and make you come back to meembed"
