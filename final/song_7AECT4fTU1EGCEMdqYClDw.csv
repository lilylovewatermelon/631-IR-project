if you wanna fall
baby you know who to call
you can always fall into me
if you wanna hang
girl you know it aint no thang
you can hang like a peach on a tree

verse 1
you can be the gin and tonic on my lips when
everybody else goes home
i could be the throwback record with a slow back
beat that you dont wanna turn off

chorus
if youre gonna get drunk
if youre gonna stay home
if youre gonna take a ride
dont take it alone no
if youre gonna lay around in a tshirt
watchin nothin on the tv
if youre gonna do anything
do it with me
come on come on
do it with me
come on come on
