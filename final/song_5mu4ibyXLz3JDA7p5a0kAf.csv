someday she wants a big ol house
sittin on a big ol hill
and a milelong treelined driveway
for her big ol coupe deville
yeah someday she wants a big ol bank account
with too much to spend

bridge
but right now
all she wants is a man

chorus
with a big ol heart
who can love her like nobody can
big ol kisses that go on and on
and never end
with a big ol smile
hell fill her world with laughter
size matters
size matters

verse 2
someday she wants a big o ring
with a big ol rock that shines
and a big ol walkin closet
with shoes of every kind
yeah someday she wants a big ol boat
she can lay around gettin a tan

all she wants is a man

chorus
with a big ol heart
who can love her like nobody can
big ol kisses that go on and on
and never end
with a big ol smile
hell fill her world with laughter
