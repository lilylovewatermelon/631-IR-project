maybe nothing else will ever be so clear
or maybe thats only my fear
if just for one day i wish i could disappear
just take me far from here

prechorus
maybe id find out nothing new
maybe id end up just like you

chorus
theres no solution no solution
give me truth to my conviction
is my own confusion my confusion
reality or fiction am i out of my mind

verse 2
this constant pressure that keeps hanging over me
it makes me feel so empty
its more than anything that i could ever be
what else could you take from me

prechorus

bridge
it took me so long to find out
its right there in front of me
too close to see what i thought was true
i see right through whats killing you

chorus
theres no solution i can see
give me truth to my conviction
is my own confusion that i feel
reality or fiction am i out of my mind

outro
so maybe nothing else will ever be so clear
or maybe thats only my fear am i out of my mind
