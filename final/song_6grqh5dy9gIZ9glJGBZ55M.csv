tommy got off at the texaco
came busting in to normas cafe
said come on man we gotta go yeah
you know how those party girls hate to wait
filled up his daddys trunk with ice and beer and
yeah he was always stealing the old mans car
radio never came in too clear
so id bang out one on my piece of junk guitar

chorus
yeah we ruled from the blacktop
to the levee where the party never stopped
yeah there was power in the night
the spirit was alive when we would sing
ah shananananananana
when we were kings
when we were kings

verse 2
sitting around the fire one night tommy called my name
i turned around he said hey what do you think
had his arm around the prettiest girl id ever seen
he kissed her hard and took another drink
i said you must be an angel putting up with this guy
she laughed and said play me some rolling stone
i couldnt let that chance go by
yeah i i sang you cant always get what you want
see brooks  dunn liveget tickets as low as 30you might also likechorus
yeah we ruled from the blacktop
to the levee where the party never stopped
yeah there was power in the night
the spirit was alive when we would sing
ah shananananananana
when we were kings
when we were kings

verse 3
yeah that was the fall of 69
i guess uncle sam was hedging his bet
tommys number came up he said hey ill be fine
ill teach em a lesson theyll never forget
angel and i went to wave goodbye
i guess we always thought wed see him again
you know i took her out after that a couple of times but
we always just wound up talking bout him

chorus
yeah we ruled from the blacktop
to the levee where the party never stopped
yeah there was power in the night
the spirit was alive when we would sing
ah shananananananana
