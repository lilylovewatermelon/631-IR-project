so its mike p versus chef trez
i gave smack that are you for real face
aight bet
since you chef why dont tell me how this meal mil taste
to create a wave to serve you thatd be cool chef
but in the kitchen you gonna always be second to cook
you aint sous tsu chef
for those who oppose my presence presentsmy gift from me to you
they done lied to ima lie to you
you praying to the east
leave it to me to help you to see the truth
ill rip heads off son for cats with drive thinking they need a roof
so treat my personal space like a secret and well keep it between me and you
it hurts and you thought mike p would be feasible
they gave you a plate thinking you eat
and my hand shout out the bottom like beetlejuice
i aint black and white suited for crazy shit
slay ya bitch its kid games
two hands to her face soon as i peek a boo
its chess moves and you sound pawn
which means you opposition to a bishop
i feel philly these cats but just dont choke until you a round off
and to it assist a row cyssero of rappers its so backwards
i mean why help em up when i can just bomb on a man thats self destructive
is your soul bold
stone cold ya headll hit the can
arms out for acting yellow here
tell trez to get a cab
in your moms crib while shes showering playing demolition man
wesley snipes shell be staring at old weapons through the glass
think white men cant jump metal in my hand
woody harrelson trez this shit never gonna jam
pussy you get the same right twice deja vu setting
cookout chef will get his bell rung like the food ready
dude deadly dig a grave and ditch a wack fuck
they knew i bombing on chef like the kitchen backed up
i dont rap with a mind attached
playing atomic attack chef tie aprons right
so ill put a strap behind his back
what you present to the table aint appealing face facts
you cant cook for shit chef i shouldve sent the plate back
fist to guns ill still take life with a pound out
any knife will put a clown down
try to air mike ill lace up on a loud mouth
mike p turn into mike jai white with a roundhouse
ill deck a goon crescent moon
you dont even know hot to close a round out
but as soon as i found i was going at trez
i asked the world for energy to start throwing at trez
you wanna go cool goku if i drop the ball ill throw it at trez
what i got to put in super sayan or somethin
to leave a spirit bomb you got to make every round go over the head
and dont gas up the tank
ill give em all the boom he dont play right
i call an audible
i twist caps i cant pour out but the 40 do
im onto you break into your house  start sorting through
i left the crib looking angry fans shorty room
and you league hop
man you like a relief pitcher
you fuckin fiend how you left the bullpen to pitch that bullshit to another team
i should bring that shit to his house
jurassic park youll see jackson sat down with a cig sig in his mouth
i got a plan now therell be a man down
i leave to south park i told ikekyle leave this bro cold wit a can mouth
you fryin chef lets see how it pan out
i jay blac we can get it shakin in front of the cam im tired of hand outs
mac10 i aint only rappin for the moment
got a bad bitch tell her whine im attracted to the motions
had her back bent threw a condom on lit candles for the aroma
kick the door like im strapped in ill clap you in a coma
madness
you gettin shot or grazed thats goin past your clique
you thought this would be a pro test protest take a knee you gettin kaepernicked
and you just got engaged to yo girl well thats a savage trick

but im up to speed demon did well but he did not get you
but its all bad cause now you got issues
its in my human nature
yall gave mike jack son you shouldve known i can rock with you

then blow his brains to god put his mind in a peaceful place meditation
she was cuffin the sack goin sidetoside like she egyptian
you aint like that bar it wasnt a crazy written
you took a cold ass haymaker and started thinkin gay shit
aight you trippin well its different fam
aim two guns at his head i click the cans
your head will get rocked between two fifth thats the egyptian dance
im armed peep sneak by him wit the large piece
on my tip toes gotta creep slow so he dont hear the soft squeeze gotta get close
caught bro off of broad street went behind mike wit the metal like im givin an award speech

you think you could rock t in the ring and bring death after
well ima champ this wont be a loss or a tie im the best bastard

blue fist kung fu shit

rum nitty the only time ya id mikes fake on stage
boy i used to put drugs on the menus hella weight copped
tay roc i almost pushed drugz in the venues
i said i brought metal for poor situations im a cheap bastard

old pistol shoot like a new pistol its remastered
blow ya brains on ya bitch turn the girl of ya dreams into a dream catcher
ya boo can see the top guy

im crouched down two arms together like im tryin to freeze somethin
but its mike p god shockin gift im bringin thunder

i swear since i got decked in my first battle ive hated punchers
nigga fuck you

im just gonna punch this whole fuckin round to remind you
why try to mix wit the chef
throat shot mark henry hell dread missin his neck
or different approach given him wreck
ill let two blast off bad cough
thats a pound in front of his mouth and a fifth to his chest
pay respect when you face the chef
they wasnt gon put you on this shit sucka
you couldnt smoke and fry day friday so they removed you he chris tucker
you wasnt ready for day he proved you was a wack writer
yall remember pokemon well its crazy
you wanted url to send a quill cyndaquil but ya plan backfired
but niggas say im low key petty and childish and thats annoyin me
so ill go to his house like a lil kid with a new toy to see
break in hear mike in the bathroom here goes the lil boy in me
shots fly through the door now its p pee all over the toiletseat
i say my pen different like i was surrounded by guns and drugs dont get shit twisted
sub wit the white thats a mac wit the cane im big pimpin
the ogs forced that fat ass chopper in my hand like you wit the shits grip it
now im smokey in friday see how they set me up with these big bitches
who confused this guy
got him thinkin he can kill me off the league well you can try
but this shot for both of us determines what happens next its do or die
aww fuck it the deuce arrives
you got two 2s better shoot wit pride
as soon as he raise both his head get popped he crucified
clip sparker yellow tape ya gang right well it gets darker
im automatic no missed targets
this yellow bitch will get caught wit a mac mack miss parker
abuse blocks tool pops smooth shot
henny sippers get wet up comin after hours ours like skinny dippers
this risky nigga you can get popped my crew really killers
we hella deep like a couple midgets thats too two many mini niggas
this square is hatin he think he over the head but very basic
a rim grazin dunker yeah we give you your props but you barely made it
get mad ill air and blaze it
dum dums jim carrey made it
a bald head make it hard for mike to move gary payton
i fought wit lions tigers and bears but you dont think that the chef is above you
you cant war wit animals he denzel in training day police pulice losin respect in the jungle
this flow bull but ima continue what mike started
they say i should try barkin against mike before im slaughtered
look at that now the chef cookin fast its a light order
you ordered lyt but that watts was too bright on that lyt order
take the lights off ya im darker the night crawler
say goodnight partner
im cuttin ya life shorter
get ya brains pushed back
you cant see the gun try harder
cause the fo fo still steel in reach like my father
are you fuckin clueless nigga these shits we clutchin ruthless
and i will rob you for everything you got dont be fuckin stupid
hit his block like yo thats mike ps crib then rush into it
spot him and snatch mike mic up quick yo cut the music
ave battled him and took off right after abusin him
i mean smack gave you chances but battles you kept losin em
i seen a window of opportunity get mike to agree so i can reach a bigger stage then ruin him
see he just like a mic he aint been official unless another rapper usin him

round 3 mike p
quick question yo
ah when fans think trez what yall think
tight lines scheming great king bossin buckin heads eager to be the best veteran
yeah thats weird because when i think trez i think
night time sneezing aching coughing stuffy head fever so you can rest medicine
i went from fly quill to nyquil
maybe its me
can yall imagine trez puttin a baby to sleep
like how you wanna sleep baby i dont stop wit the harm
youll get the bye bye ba ba in ya mouth pass the sock to ya mom
youll get laid down in the crib wit metal over ya top wit the charms
or the bald head come over the shoulder after you get rocked wit these arms awwww
boy im leo on the balcony im dishin out these upper case ls
that dumb talk will get a tagged tongue get this sucka fake 12s
you jaw jap and ill shove a tec down
gunll blow muppet show you wont hear a word comin out of chef mouth
you cant grab the moment off of raps alone trez act the boldest
i grab the boulders throw em bat at ya shoulder
bad ass who jokin cause static trez matics trez i return to bad habits trez
soon as you stress me out im goin back to smokin
bam a left cross to his head he got his dome hooked
bam the impact of the four done got his ho shook
bang the meat slid off the ribs like it was slow cooked
bang he passed wit his eyes closed thats called a no look
not done i took blood from his head and did his boo greasy
slapped a hand print on that ass too easy
she didnt recognize the bald head i thought she knew beasley
chin shot turn your whole cheek red now she glueazy
aye boy stop it you lost conscious you shouldve got black balled norbes blocked it
cold world trez and you a false prophet
now my biggest fans get to see guard dropping career clocked in
time runs out while michael koor watches
and before im one step closer to be on nome poppin
i cracked open a small door to put your poor stock in
said youll never lose to a white boy stop it
til this white boy punched you outta the ring bernard hopkins
box nobody holdin michael down
i flash back like puttin cards in a bike wheel to get the motorcycle sound
you couldnt last throwin hands your chef t man is drunk
the right hand coneheads youll go to sleep standin up
i got power now since i was the rookie myself
youre here literally because of me trez i booked it myself
this a mirror match yeah til i took a look at myself
and pushed chef to the side like ill cook it myself
i had my sights on trez i followed him for weeks at a distance
got a mold out of his door made a key for the entrance
waited for nightfall it came so i creepily entered
had a secret treat for dawg you know sneaked in a biscuit
the fo fo surprisingly low caught him and his queen in the kitchen
he said mike pulice i said police put the beam to his missus
and said chef trez bro are you seein the mission
he said my bad my bad its pulice and not p
oooh you think its a difference
boy i molly crooks i carry the heat that riley took
im an annunaki i followed the hammurabi book
get ya shit pushed back one blink and his body took
six shots chef on the floor like he was drinkin while he cook
bad wreckage you can peep past records
look at the vinyl chef youve been to all these cookin comps meet the final chef
this the end of my third and the start of ya downward spiral
chef get cracked with cognac henny everywhere wanna be viral chef

round 3 chef trez
i say how you the best wit rhymin when you not electrifyin
need new wiring i battled dudes went to war wit plenty crews
and improved tryin shit never lose
i got iron skin ive been to new environments
i walked through the doors ready for work are you hiring
the police blast rounds at a black crowd til one of layin flat down
but yall accept police in this sport so im mad now
i get violated in the streets for lookin like a hoodlum every time yall pass round
so let me return the favor now police pulice get the pat down
oh mike p has moments dude that is just bogus
no matter what he brought nothin he do gonna help my opponent
but what he does have on this battle eminem one shot and you gonna lose yourself in the moment
but the same angles every battle thats wild weak
you not real but they dont buy it mikes fake canal street
kill the chef body trez mike 30 child please
im in front of mike tryin to make a soul lift im al green
my type great this guy type fake
why fly my way to get a kill these rounds hittin home the driveby way
vampire we seen you die by day
my only question what the fuck is a moment to a nigga wit a highlight tape
lets go then wear a vest or protect yo chin
you aint a real shooter you just rap bout it
them fairy tales gon end
you hold a gun like when you shoot thats a hell on then
thats like basketball coach said when you shoot keep ya elbow in
and you said you used to slit ya wrists right see you a sucka nigga
thats white boy shit to the max p and they aint fuckin witcha
but my question how you on stage talkin like a fuckin killer
bitch you couldnt kill yourself how you gon body another nigga
sad part is youll do anything so you dont get neglected
but you say i battle too much well i dont expect for you to respect it
i got homies locked up some of this battle money gets sent to them corrections
cause they wouldnt be calling collect if i wasnt makin collections
i do this shit so they can see the exit
know theres ways to beat oppression
write down your thoughts and rhyme keep a positive mind to beat depression
you was strung out at one point so even i hope you see the message
i receive my blessings yall nerds might not like it but the streets accept it
i go through shit 247 the struggle had me out my mind young
so i face my problems night and day why would i run
sleep is the cousin of death so ill sleep when my time done
cause id rather have bags under my eyes than be inside one
aint no snappin on the beast this aint them niggas you battled who just be rhymin
now you rappin wit a leash
you mike p im mike lowry thats a bad boy that will black on the police pulice
i be wild as shit a young nigga doin this and my talent sick
im 22 a grown ass man but dont try me like a child and shit
yall gave blood a chance to mix wit p pee like some symptoms after dialysis
well tryin to nap on me got him wrapped up thats sleep paralysis
lets talk about your career against haixan you was an average guy
against tink you lost but held ya own with some massive lines
daylyt taught you a lesson thats expected aint that surpised
but then you played ricky thought it was gon be an easy walk but aint make it out that ave alive
and if you cant stand the heat stay the fuck outta the kitchen
i done cooked another nigga1embed"
