i just woke up from a fuzzy dream
you never would believe the things that i have seen
i looked in the mirror and i saw your face
you looked right through me you were miles away

prechorus
all my dreams they fade away
ill never be the same
if you could see me the way you see yourself
i cant pretend to be someone else

chorus
you always love me more miles away
i hear it in your voice were miles away
youre not afraid to tell me miles away
i guess were at our best when were miles away
so far away so far away so far away so far away
so far away so far away so far away so far away

verse 2
when no ones around then i have you here
i begin to see the picture it becomes so clear
you always have the biggest heart
when were six thousand miles apart
see madonna liveget tickets as low as 50you might also likeprechorus
too much of no sound
uncomfortable silence can be so loud
those three words are never enough
when its long distance love

chorus
you always love me more miles away
i hear it in your voice were miles away
youre not afraid to tell me miles away
i guess were at our best when were miles away
so far away so far away so far away so far away
so far away so far away so far away so far away

bridge
im alright dont be sorry but its true
when im gone youll realize
that im the best thing that happened to you

breakdown
you always love me more miles away
i hear it in your voice were miles away
youre not afraid to tell me miles away
i guess were at our best when were miles away

chorus
you always love me more miles away
i hear it in your voice were miles away
youre not afraid to tell me miles away
i guess were at our best when were miles away
outro
so far away so far away so far away so far away
so far away so far away so far away so far away
so far away so far away so far away so far away
so far away so far away so far away so far away
so far away so far away so far away so far away3embed"
