im lookin like im gonna get it you prolly dont get it
i come in your house with a microphone
lookin like im bout to set up a show in your kitchen
im out of my mind but i feel like im in it
if i never make it dont make any difference
im still gonna kill it you know what the deal is
aint never no chillin when im in the buildin
nf is a monster i am a villain
my music is sick and you dont know what ill is
you better get back i dont write any filler
i write what i feel and im feelin a million
so you better shh be quiet you hear it
im bout to lose it
im on a whole different level of music
dont treat me like i have no clue how to do this
you better rethink what youre thinkin and move it
now picture me writin when i was a kid
tryna make it in music i think it is crazy
i spent all my money on studio time
tryna get on my music so people could play it
ima keep it one hundred my music was terrible
learned to get better the more that i made it
go back to my moments album most of you people
you prolly dont know what im sayin hold up
what youre witnessin now dont try to figure me out
i grab on that microphone jawin the crowd
they was laughin at me who they laughin at now huh
i laugh at myself some people they lookin like wow
the moment you told me that you was a rapper
i couldnt believe it you believe it now
step in the booth and i murder it
you never heard of a rapper that kill it like i do
i sleep on the couch in the studio
stay up till three in the morning and write till i get more
the moment i wake up i feel like i dont even sleep
and im ready to put out my record
which thank you for buyin maybe you burned it
but either way im gonna wreck it
i look at the industry look what it did to me
youll never make it if you never grind
you put a whole lot of money into it
you better be ready to give it your time
i look at the past awful years of my life
and i promise you i have been givin it mine
try to keep up with this im not a puppet
no string on my back im one of a kind
music is changing no way to tame this
i am an artist look what i painted
hang up the caution tape im dangerous
does anyone know where my brain is
rappers are comfortable knowin theyre famous
but i really dont care what your name is
and i really dont care if im nameless
yall just drivin around i know where my lane is
cocky nah im competitive
this is a job for me its adrenaline
dont try to box me in i am mayweather
i come in the ring my punches are way better
i never drink but i live in these bars
the moment you blink is the moment you lost
say you a king who put you in charge
dont care what you think ill break in your car
climb on the top of it sound the alarm
and wake up the neighborhood rap in your yard
and carry the speakers on both of my arms
till you keep sleepin on me im at large
enough with the jokes i aint jokin
you come in a session with me ima show you what dope is
and when i say dope i aint talkin bout smokin
im talkin bout music that has an emotion
i look at this mic its part of my family
take it away im comin to find you
ive been through a lot in my life
and its hard to get people to listen when no ones behind you
and then capitol came in the picture and gave me a shot
and look at it now
i look at the team im dealin with agh
these people aint playin around
lookin back i gotta laugh
i was in a whole different place a year ago
i look at the math i look at the map
and thank you god i swear its a miracle
and im sorry but i gotta leave
but man this track was beautiful
the least i can do if i murder a beat
is take the time to go to its funeral hahasee nf liveget tickets as low as 65you might also like88embed"
