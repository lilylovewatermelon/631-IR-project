middle fingers up if you dont give a fuck
im sick to death of swallowing every single thing im fed
middle fingers up if you dont give a fuck
you think youre changing anything question everything

verse 1
the world is a shit tip your children are fucked
the ones you think guard you are out for your blood
well our minds are battered and washed out with static
but what exactly do you think youre gonna do

prechorus
united well fail divided well fall
were fucked but youre making it worse
united well fail divided well fall
give up cause youre making it so much worse

chorus
middle fingers up if you dont give a fuck
im sick to death of swallowing every single thing im fed
middle fingers up if you dont give a fuck
you think youre changing anything question everything

verse 2
oh give me a break you deluded illinformed
selfserving pricks
if you really believe in the words that you preach
get off your screens and onto the streets
there will be no peaceful revolution
no war without blood
you can say im just a fool that stands for nothing
well to that i say youre a cunt
you might also likebreakdown
kick it

prechorus
united well fail united well fail
divided well fall divided well fall
united well fail
were fucked but youre making it worse

chorus
middle fingers up if you dont give a fuck
im sick to death of swallowing every single thing im fed
middle fingers up if you dont give a fuck
you think youre changing anything question everything
middle fingers up if you dont give a fuck
im sick to death of swallowing every single thing im fed
middle fingers up if you dont give a fuck
you think youre changing anything question everything19embed"
