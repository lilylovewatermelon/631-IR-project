there goes my baby my wholesome lady
hold me down if my whole world went crazy
thats what she spoke just what she said
now thats a joke that talk is dead

the door i keep it open just in case she come back
cant deal with the emotions to the point im sad
and i know my hearts broken but ive got so attached
baby come back i wont get no sleep
she more than i want and all that i need
locked up my heart and threw away the key so so
and when my baby come back im crossing my ts
dotting my is and now i cant eat
out of my mind and thats how its gonna be so so
