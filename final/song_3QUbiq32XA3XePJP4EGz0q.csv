the city is my jungle gym
look at this big great world that were living in
theres lots of fun to be had on these streets
we can take a ride just you and me
its a jungle gym
its a jungle gym

trolley cars and buses too
all the big kids going to school
im going to get a treat from the ice cream man
catch me catch me if you can

chorus
its a jungle gym
the citys nitty gritty but its so much fun
we can take a ride go tell everyone
its a jungle gym
its a jungle gym

sha la la la la la la la la la

verse 2
these streets have got a rhythm
its a funky beat
the more i find inside the city
the more i find in me
its a jungle gym
its a jungle gym
see jack johnson liveget tickets as low as 95you might also likemovie theatres and museums
fishing in the pond
abcs 123s bring your friends along
flying kites way up high into the blue sky
we can take a ride
just you and i
its a jungle gym
its a jungle gym

sha la la la la la la la la la
sha la la la la la la la la la

chorus
the citys nitty gritty but its so much fun
we can take a ride
go tell everyone
its a jungle gym
its a jungle gymembed"
