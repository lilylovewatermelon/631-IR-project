woah i get rid of all the smoke like ozium
shorty got that real jelly yeah petroleum
niggas actin like my kids and they be older than him
cant believe they killed skiney i really growed up with him
ima leave a lot of niggas covered in roses for him
spray the witness i aint leavin no jehovah for them
won a grammy and i couldnt even show it to him
put my face inside a line up niggas know that im him
anybody speakin on my brothers got stepped on
pull up from the three like stеphen
and the coupe baldhеaded like the other stephon
put my kids in private school so they could get they prep on
think my heart made out of teflon
what what think my heart bulletproof
you aint got a mask i can show you what a hoodie do
pull the string tight til your eyelids covered too
i think they on the left roll the window hit the lights boom
everybody wish they switched sides when we comin through
everybody wish they was inside when we comin through
i pray that you aint on the other side when we comin through
ptsd and i mean it
nigga johnny got killed and i seen it
i cant fight with these demons
top shotta nigga i got gunfire for these demons
hope you know you gotta stand on all that shit you been tweetin
took some real niggas from me i could kill the whole world and i still wont be even
i be thinkin bout my brothers while im shoppin in neimans
real gangster when im gone carve my name in the cement
watch these hoes when you rich they play games with the semen
trials and tribulations i face them
prosecutors probably wanna case him
see my opps i jump out and chase them
i aint charleston white nigga ill never mace them
love for all my artists nigga ill never mase them
shit thats probably why they hate him
tryna get my brother out of jail im like hey kim
cut from a different cloth he never let it break him
look at my advance it make me wonder would i make them
but i own my masters so i cant do shit but thank them
video visits he be smilin on facetime
passionate im talkin with my hands these aint gang signs
you dont know larry tayman or cj you aint one of mine
braids on my neck nigga i aint got no hang time
nigga i aint got no kickit for you
i dont wanna make friends
i dont wanna make amends
im chasin ms
