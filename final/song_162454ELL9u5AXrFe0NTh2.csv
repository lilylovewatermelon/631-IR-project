 the tenants have organized themselves into a body and resolved not to pay any more rent until they can be redressed of their grievances    the tenants now assume the right of doing to their landlord as he has for a long time done with them viz as they please

you need not think this to be childrens play  if you come out in your official capacity  i would not pledge for your safe return  a tenant

when a deputy arrived in the farming area with writs demanding the rent farmers suddenly appeared assembled by the blowing of tin horns they seized his writs and burned them

that december a sheriff and a mounted posse of five hundred rode into the farm country but found themselves in the midst of shrieking tin horns eighteen hundred farmers blocking their path six hundred more blocking their rear all mounted armed with pitchforks and clubs the sheriff and his posse turned back the rear guard parting to let them through

this was the start of the antirenter movement in the hudson valley described by henry christman in tin horns and calico it was a protest against the patroonship system which went back to the 1600s when the dutch ruled new york a system where as christman describes it a few families intricately intermarried controlled the destinies of three hundred thousand people and ruled in almost kingly splendor near two million acres of land

the tenants paid taxes and rents the largest manor was owned by the rensselaer family which ruled over about eighty thousand tenants and had accumulated a fortune of 41 million the landowner as one sympathizer of the tenants put it could swill his wine loll on his cushions fill his life with society food and culture and ride his barouche and five saddle horses along the beautiful river valley and up to the backdrop of the mountain

by the summer of 1839 the tenants were holding their first mass meeting the economic crisis of 1837 had filled the area with unemployed seeking land on top of the layoffs accompanying the completion of the erie canal after the first wave of railroad building ended that summer the tenants resolved we will take up the ball of the revolution where our fathers stopped it and roll it to the final consummation of freedom and independence of the masses

certain men in the farm country became leaders and organizers smith boughton a country doctor on horseback ainge devyr a revolutionary irishman devyr had seen monopoly of land and industry bring misery to the slumdwellers of london liverpool and glasgow had agitated for change had been arrested for sedition and fled to america he was invited to address a fourth of july rally of farmers in rensselaerville where he warned his listeners if you permit unprincipled and ambitious men to monopolize the soil they will become masters of the country in the certain order of cause and effect

thousands of farmers in rensselaer country were organized into antirent associations to prevent the landlords from evicting they agreed on calico indian costumes symbol of the boston tea party and recalling original ownership of the soil the tin horn represented an indian call to arms soon ten thousand men were trained and ready

organizing went on in county after county in dozens of towns along the hudson handbills appeared

attention
antirenters awake arouse
strike till the last armed foe expires
strike for your altars and your fires
strike for the green graves of your sires
god and your happy homes
sheriffs and deputy sheriffs trying to serve writs on farmers were surrounded by calicoclad riders who had been summoned by tin horns sounding in the countrysidethen tarred and feathered the new york herald once sympathetic now deplored the insurrectionary spirit of the mountaineers

one of the most hated elements of the lease gave the landlord the right to the timber on all the farms a man sent onto a tenants land to gather wood for the landlord was killed tension rose a farm boy was killed mysteriously no one knew by whom but dr boughton was jailed the governor ordered artillerymen into action and a company of cavalry came up from new york city

petitions for an antirent bill signed by 25000 tenants were put before the legislature in 1845 the bill was defeated a kind of guerrilla war resumed in the country between bands of indians and sheriffs posses boughton was kept in jail seven months four and a half months of that in heavy irons before being released on bail fourth of july meetings in 1845 attended by thousands of farmers pledged continued resistance

when a deputy sheriff tried to sell the livestock of a farmer named moses earle who owed 60 rent on 160 stony acres there was a fight and the deputy was killed similar attempts to sell livestock for rent payments were thwarted again and again the governor sent three hundred troops in declaring a state of rebellion existed and soon almost a hundred antirenters were in jail smith boughton was brought to trial he was charged with taking papers from a sheriff but declared by the judge to have in fact committed high treason rebellion against your government and armed insurrection and sentenced to life imprisonment

those indians found to be armed and disguised at moses earles farm where the deputy had been killed were declared by the judge to be guilty of murder and the jury was so instructed all were found guilty and the judge sentenced four to life imprisonment and two to be hanged two of the leaders were told to write letters urging the antirenters to disband as their only chance to escape heavy sentences they wrote the letters

the power of the law thus crushed the antirent movement it was intended to make clear that farmers could not win by fightingthat they must confine their efforts to voting to acceptable methods of reform in 1845 the antirenters elected fourteen members to the state legislature governor silas wright now commuted to life imprisonment the two death sentences and asked the legislature to give relief to the tenants to end the feudal system in the hudson valley proposals to break up the huge estates on the death of the owners were defeated but the legislature voted to make illegal the selling of tenant property for nonpayment of rent a constitutional convention that year outlawed new feudal leases

the next governor elected in 1846 with antirent support had promised to pardon the antirent prisoners and he did throngs of farmers greeted them on their release court decisions in the 1850s began to limit the worst features of the manorial system without changing the fundamentals of landlordtenant relations

sporadic farmer resistance to the collection of back rents continued into the 1860s as late as 1869 bands of indians were still assembling to thwart sheriffs acting for a rich valley landowner named walter church in the early 1880s a deputy sheriff trying to dispossess a farmer on behalf of church was killed by shotgun fire by this time most leases had passed into the hands of the farmers in three of the main antirent counties of twelve thousand farmers only two thousand remained under lease

the farmers had fought been crushed by the law their struggle diverted into voting and the system stabilized by enlarging the class of small landowners leaving the basic structure of rich and poor intact it was a common sequence in american history

around the time of the antirenter movement in new york there was excitement in rhode island over dorrs rebellion as marvin gettleman points out in the dorr rebellion it was both a movement for electoral reform and an example of radical insurgency it was prompted by the rhode island charters rule that only owners of land could vote

as more people left the farm for the city as immigrants came to work in the mills the disfranchised grew seth luther selfeducated carpenter in providence and spokesman for working people wrote in 1833 the address on the right of free suffrage denouncing the monopoly of political power by the mushroom lordlings sprigs of nobility    small potato aristocrats of rhode island he urged noncooperation with the government refusing to pay taxes or to serve in the militia why he asked should twelve thousand working people in rhode island without the vote submit to five thousand who had land and could vote

thomas dorr a lawyer from a welltodo family became a leader of the suffrage movement working people formed the rhode island suffrage association and in the spring of 1841 thousands paraded in providence carrying banners and signs for electoral reform going outside the legal system they organized their own peoples convention and drafted a new constitution without property qualifications for voting

in early 1842 they invited votes on the constitution fourteen thousand voted for it including about five thousand with propertytherefore a majority even of those legally entitled to vote by the charter in april they held an unofficial election in which dorr ran unopposed for governor and six thousand people voted for him the governor of rhode island in the meantime got the promise of president john tyler that in the case of rebellion federal troops would be sent there was a clause in the us constitution to meet just that kind of situation providing for federal intervention to quell local insurrections on request of a state government
ignoring this on may 3 1842 the dorr forces held an inauguration with a great parade of artisans shopkeepers mechanics and militia marching through providence the newly elected peoples legislature was convened dorr led a fiasco of an attack on the state arsenal his cannon misfiring dorrs arrest was ordered by the regular governor and he went into hiding outside the state trying to raise military support

despite the protests of dorr and a few others the peoples constitution kept the word white in its clause designating voters angry rhode island blacks now joined the militia units of the law and order coalition which promised that a new constitutional convention would give them the right to vote

when dorr returned to rhode island he found several hundred of his followers mostly working people willing to fight for the peoples constitution but there were thousands in the regular militia on the side of the state the rebellion disintegrated and dorr again fled rhode island

martial law was declared one rebel soldier captured was blindfolded and put before a firing squad which fired with blank bullets a hundred other militia were taken prisoner one of them described their being bound by ropes into platoons of eight marched on foot 16 miles to providence threatened and pricked by the bayonet if we lagged from fatigue the rope severely chafing our arms the skin off mine    no water till we reached greenville  no food until the next day and after being exhibited were put into the state prison

a new constitution offered some reform it still gave overrepresentation to the rural areas limited the vote to property owners or those who paid a onedollar poll tax and would let naturalized citizens vote only if they had 134 in real estate in the elections of early 1843 the law and order group opposed by former dorrites used intimidation of state militia of employees by employers of tenants by landlords to get out their vote it lost in the industrial towns but got the vote of the agrarian areas and won all major offices

dorr returned to rhode island in the fall of 1843 he was arrested on the streets of providence and tried for treason the jury instructed by the judge to ignore all political arguments and consider only whether dorr had committed certain overt acts which he never denied committing found him guilty whereupon the judge sentenced him to life imprisonment at hard labor he spent twenty months in jail and then a newly elected law and order governor anxious to end dorrs martyrdom pardoned him

armed force had failed the ballot had failed the courts had taken the side of the conservatives the dorr movement now went to the us supreme court via a trespass suit by martin luther against law and order militiamen charging that the peoples government was the legitimate government in rhode island in 1842 daniel webster argued against the dorrites if people could claim a constitutional right to overthrow an existing government webster said there would be no more law and no more government there would be anarchy

in its decision the supreme court established luther v borden 1849 a longlasting doctrine it would not interfere in certain political questions to be left to executive and legislature the decision reinforced the essentially conservative nature of the supreme court that on critical issues war and revolutionit would defer to the president and congress

the stories of the antirenter movement and dorrs rebellion are not usually found in textbooks on united states history in these books given to millions of young americans there is little on class struggle in the nineteenth century the period before and after the civil war is filled with politics elections slavery and the race question even where specialized books on the jacksonian period deal with labor and economic issues they center on the presidency and thus perpetuate the traditional dependency on heroic leaders rather than peoples struggles

andrew jackson said he spoke for the humble members of society the farmer mechanics and laborers  he certainly did not speak for the indians being pushed off their lands or slaves but the tensions aroused by the developing factory system the growing immigration required that the government develop a mass base of support among whites jacksonian democracy did just that

politics in this period of the 1830s and 1840s according to douglas miller a specialist in the jacksonian period the birth of modern america had become increasingly centered around creating a popular image and flattering the common man miller is dubious however about the accuracy of that phrase jacksonian democracy

parades picnics and campaigns of personal slander characterized jacksonian politicking but although both parties aimed their rhetoric at the people and mouthed the sacred shibboleths of democracy this did not mean that the common man ruled america the professional politicians corning to the fore in the twenties and thirties though sometimes selfmade were seldom ordinary both major parties were controlled largely by men of wealth and ambition lawyers newspaper editors merchants industrialists large landowners and speculators dominated the democrats as well as the whigs

jackson was the first president to master the liberal rhetoricto speak for the common man this was a necessity for political victory when the vote was being demandedas in rhode islandby more and more people and state legislatures were loosening voting restrictions as another jacksonian scholar robert remini the age of jackson says after studying electoral figures for 1828 and 1832
jackson himself enjoyed widespread support that ranged across all classes and sections of the country he attracted farmers mechanics laborers professionals and even businessmen and all this without jackson being clearly pro or antilabor pro or antibusiness pro or antilower middle or upper class it has been demonstrated that he was a strikebreaker jackson sent troops to control rebellious workers on the chesapeake and ohio canal yet at different times  he and the democrats received the backing of organized labor

it was the new politics of ambiguityspeaking for the lower and middle classes to get their support in times of rapid growth and potential turmoil the twoparty system came into its own in this time to give people a choice between two different parties and allow them in a period of rebellion to choose the slightly more democratic one was an ingenious mode of control like so much in the american system it was not devilishly contrived by some master plotters it developed naturally out of the needs of the situation remini compares the jacksonian democrat martin van buren who succeeded jackson as president with the austrian conservative statesman metternich like metternich who was seeking to thwart revolutionary discontent in europe van buren and similar politicians were attempting to banish political disorder from the united states by a balance of power achieved through two wellorganized and active parties

the jacksonian idea was to achieve stability and control by winning to the democratic party the middling interest and especially  the substantial yeomanry of the country by prudent judicious wellconsidered reform that is reform that would not yield too much these were the words of robert rantoul a reformer corporation lawyer and jacksonian democrat it was a forecast of the successful appeal of the democratic partyand at times the republican partyin the twentieth century

such new forms of political control were needed in the turbulence of growth the possibility of rebellion now there were canals railroads the telegraph in 1790 fewer than a million americans lived in cities in 1840 the figure was 11 million new york had 130000 people in 1820 a million by 1860 and while the traveler alexis de tocqueville had expressed astonishment at the general equality of condition among the people he was not very good at numbers his friend beaumont said and his observation was not in accord with the facts according to edward pessen a historian of jacksonian society jacksonian america

in philadelphia workingclass families lived fiftyfive to a tenement usually one room per family with no garbage removal no toilets no fresh air or water there was fresh water newly pumped from the schuylkill river but it was going to the homes of the rich

in new york you could see the poor lying in the streets with the garbage there were no sewers in the slums and filthy water drained into yards and alleys into the cellars where the poorest of the poor lived bringing with it a typhoid epidemic in 1837 typhus in 1842 in the cholera epidemic of 1832 the rich fled the city the poor stayed and died

these poor could not be counted on as political allies of the government but they were therelike slaves or indiansinvisible ordinarily a menace if they rose there were more solid citizens however who might give steady support to the systempaidpaid workers landowning farmers also there was the new urban whitecollar worker born in the rising commerce of the time described by thomas cochran and william miller the age of enterprise

dressed in drab alpaca hunched over a high desk this new worker credited and debited indexed and filed wrote and stamped invoices acceptances bills of lading receipts adequately paid he had some extra money and leisure time he patronized sporting events and theaters savings banks and insurance companies he read days new york sun or bennetts heraldthe penny press supported by advertising filled with police reports crime stories etiquette advice for the rising bourgeoisie 

this was the advance guard of a growing class of whitecollar workers and professionals in america who would be wooed enough and paid enough to consider themselves members of the bourgeois class and to give support to that class in times of crisis

the opening of the west was being helped by mechanization of the farm iron plows cut plowing time in half by the 1850s john deere company was turning out ten thousand plows a year cyrus mccormick was making a thousand mechanical reapers a year in his factory in chicago a man with a sickle could cut half an acre of wheat in a day with a reaper he could cut 10 acres

turnpikes canals and railroads were bringing more people west more products east and it became important to keep that new west tumultuous and unpredictable under control when colleges were established out west eastern businessmen as cochran and miller say were determined from the start to control western education edward everett the massachusetts politician and orator spoke in 1833 on behalf of giving financial aid to western colleges

let no boston capitalist then let no man who has a large stake in new england   think that he is called upon to exercise his liberality at a distance toward those in whom he has no concern  they ask you to give security to your own property by diffusing the means of light and truth throughout the region where so much of the power to preserve or to shake it resides   

the capitalists of the east were conscious of the need for this security to your own property as technology developed more capital was needed more risks had to be taken and a big investment needed stability in an economic system not rationally planned for human need but developing fitfully chaotically out of the profit motive there seemed to be no way to avoid recurrent booms and slumps there was a slump in 1837 another in 1853 one way to achieve stability was to decrease competition organize the businesses move toward monopoly in the mid1850s price agreements and mergers became frequent the new york central railroad was a merger of many railroads the american brass association was formed to meet ruinous competition it said the hampton county cotton spinners association was organized to control prices and so was the american iron association

another way to minimize risks was to make sure the government played its traditional role going back to alexander hamilton and the first congress of helping the business interests state legislatures gave charters to corporations giving them legal rights to conduct business raise money at first special charters then general charters so that any business meeting certain requirements could incorporate between 1790 and 1860 2300 corporations were chartered

railroad men traveled to washington and to state capitals armed with money shares of stock free railroad passes between 1850 and 1857 they got 25 million acres of public land free of charge and millions of dollars in bondsloansfrom the state legislatures in wisconsin in 1856 the lacrosse and milwaukee railroad got a million acres free by distributing about 900000 in stocks and bonds to fiftynine assemblymen thirteen senators the governor two years later the railroad was bankrupt and the bonds were worthless

in the east mill owners had become powerful and organized by 1850 fifteen boston families called the associates controlled 20 percent of the cotton spindleage in the united states 39 percent of insurance capital in massachusetts 40 percent of banking resources in boston

in the schoolbooks those years are filled with the controversy over slavery but on the eve of the civil war it was money and profit not the movement against slavery that was uppermost in the priorities of the men who ran the country as cochran and miller put it

webster was the hero of the northnot emerson parker garrison or phillips webster the tariff man the land speculator the corporation lawyer politician for the boston associates inheritor of hamiltons coronet the great object of government said he is the protection of property at home and respect and renown abroad for these he preached union for these he surrendered the fugitive slave

they describe the boston rich

living sumptuously on beacon hill admired by their neighbors for their philanthropy and their patronage of art and culture these men traded in state street while overseers ran their factories managers directed their railroads agents sold their water power and real estate they were absentee landlords in the most complete sense uncontaminated by the diseases of the factory town they were also protected from hearing the complaints of their workers or suffering mental depression from dismal and squalid surroundings in the metropolis art literature education science flowered in the golden day in the industrial towns children went to work with their fathers and mothers schools and doctors were only promises a bed of ones own was a rare luxury

ralph waldo emerson described boston in those years there is a certain poorsmell in all the streets in beacon street and mount vernon as well as in the lawyers offices and the wharves and the same meanness and sterility and leaveallhopebehind as one finds in a boot manufacturers premises the preacher theodore parker told his congregation money is this day the strongest power of the nation

the attempts at political stability at economic control did not quite work the new industrialism the crowded cities the long hours in the factories the sudden economic crises leading to high prices and lost jobs the lack of food and water the freezing winters the hot tenements in the summer the epidemics of disease the deaths of childrenthese led to sporadic reactions from the poor sometimes there were spontaneous unorganized uprisings against the rich sometimes the anger was deflected into racial hatred for blacks religious warfare against catholics nativist fury against immigrants sometimes it was organized into demonstrations and strikes

jacksonian democracy had tried to create a consensus of support for the system to make it secure blacks indians women and foreigners were clearly outside the consensus but also white working people in large numbers declared themselves outside

the full extent of the workingclass consciousness of those yearsas of any yearsis lost in history but fragments remain and make us wonder how much of this always existed underneath the very practical silence of working people in 1827 an address  before the mechanics and working classes  of philadelphia was recorded written by an unlettered mechanic probably a young shoemaker who said

we find ourselves oppressed on every handwe labor hard in producing all the comforts of life for the enjoyment of others while we ourselves obtain but a scanty portion and even that in the present state of society depends on the will of employers

frances wright of scotland an early feminist and utopian socialist was invited by philadelphia workingmen to speak on the fourth of july 1829 to one of the first citywide associations of labor unions in the united states she asked if the revolution had been fought to crush down the sons and daughters of your countrys industry under  neglect poverty vice starvation and disease she wondered if the new technology was not lowering the value of human labor making people appendages to machines crippling the minds and bodies of child laborers

later that year george henry evans a printer editor of the workingmans advocate wrote the working mens declaration of independence among its list of facts submitted to candid and impartial fellow citizens

l the laws for levying taxes are    operating most oppressively on one class of society
3 the laws for private incorporation are all partial   favoring one class of society to the expense of the other  
6 the laws   have deprived nine tenths of the members of the body politics who are not wealthy of the equal means to enjoy life liberty and the pursuit of happiness  the lien law in favor of the landlords against tenants  is one illustration among innumerable others

evans believed that all on arriving at adult age are entitled to equal property

a citywide trades union in boston in 1834 including mechanics from charlestown and women shoe binders from lynn referred to the declaration of independence

we hold   that laws which have a tendency to raise any peculiar class above their fellow citizens by granting special privileges are contrary to and in defiance of those primary principles

our public system of education which so liberally endows those seminaries of learning which  are only accessible to the wealthy while our common schools  are so illy provided for  thus even in childhood the poor are apt to think themselves inferior  

in his book most uncommon jacksonians edward pessen says the leaders of the jacksonian labor movement were radicals   how else describe men who believed american society to be torn with social conflict disfigured by the misery of the masses and dominated by a greedy elite whose power over every aspect of american life was based on private property

episodes of insurrection of that time have gone unrecorded in traditional histories such was the riot in baltimore in the summer of 1835 when the bank of maryland collapsed and its depositors lost their savings convinced that a great fraud had taken place a crowd gathered and began breaking the windows of officials associated with the bank when the rioters destroyed a house the militia attacked killing some twenty people wounding a hundred the next evening other houses were attacked the events were reported in niles weekly register an important newspaper of that time

last night sunday at dark the attack was renewed upon reverdy johnsons house there was now no opposition it was supposed that several thousand people were spectators of the scene the house was soon entered and its furniture a very extensive law library and all its contents were cast forth a bonfire made of them in front of the house the whole interior of the house was torn out and cast upon the burning pile the marble portico in front and a great portion of the front wall were torn down by about 11 oclock  they proceeded to that of the mayor of the city jesse hunt esq broke it open took out the furniture and burnt it before the door  

during those years trade unions were forming philip foners history of the labor movement in the us tells the story in rich detail the courts called them conspiracies to restrain trade and therefore illegal as when in new york twentyfive members of the union society of journeymen tailors were found guilty of conspiracy to injure trade riot assault battery the judge levying fines said in this favored land of law and liberty the road to advancement is open to all every american knows that or ought to know that he has no better friend than the laws and that he needs no artificial combination for his protection they are of foreign origin and i am led to believe mainly upheld by foreigners

a handbill was then circulated throughout the city

the rich against the poor
judge edwards the tool of the aristocracy against the people mechanics and working men a deadly blow has been struck at your liberty they have established the precedent that workingmen have no right to regulate the price of labor or in other words the rich are the only judges of the wants of the poor man

at city hall park 27000 people gathered to denounce the court decision and elected a committee of correspondence which organized three months later a convention of mechanics farmers and working men elected by farmers and working people in various towns in new york state the convention met in utica drew up a declaration of independence from existing political parties and established an equal rights party

although they ran their own candidates for office there was no great confidence in the ballot as a way of achieving change one of the great orators of the movement seth luther told a fourth of july rally we will try the ballot box first if that will not effect our righteous purpose the next and last resort is the cartridge box and one sympathetic local newspaper the albany microscope warned

remember the regretted fate of the workingmenthey were soon destroyed by hitching teams and rolling with parties they admitted into their ranks broken down lawyers and politicians they became perverted and were unconsciously drawn into a vortex from which they never escaped

the crisis of 1837 led to rallies and meetings in many cities the banks had suspended specie paymentsrefusing to pay hard money for the bank notes they had issued prices rose and working people already hardpressed to buy food found that flour that had sold at 562 a barrel was now 12 a barrel pork went up coal went up in philadelphia twenty thousand people assembled and someone wrote to president van buren describing it

this afternoon the largest public meeting i ever saw assembled in independence square it was called by placards posted through the city yesterday and last night it was projected and carried on entirely by the working classes without consultation or cooperation with any of those who usually take the lead in such matters the officers and speakers were of those classes it was directed against the banks

in new york members of the equal rights party often called the locofocos announced a meeting bread meat rent and fuel their prices must come down the people will meet in the park rain or shine at 4 oclock pm on monday afternoon all friends of humanity determined to resist monopolists and extortioners are invited to attend the commercial register a new york newspaper reported on the meeting and what followed

at 4 oclock a concourse of several thousands had convened in front of the city hall  one of these orators  is reported to have expressly directed the popular vengeance against mr eh hart who is one of our most extensive flour dealers on commission fellow citizens he exclaimed mr hart has now 53000 barrels of flour in his store let us go and offer him eight dollars a barrel and if he does not take it

a large body of the meeting moved off in the direction of mr harts store    the middle door had been forced and some twenty or thirty barrels of flour or more rolled into the streets and the heads staved in at this point of time mr hart himself arrived on the ground with a posse of officers from the police the officers were assailed by a portion of the mob in dey street their staves wrested from them and shivered to pieces  

barrels of flour by dozens fifties and hundreds were tumbled into the street from the doors and thrown in rapid succession from the windows  about one thousand bushels of wheat and four or five hundred barrels of flour were thus wantonly and foolishly as well as wickedly destroyed the most active of the destructionists were foreignersindeed the greater part of the assemblage was of exotic origin but there were probably five hundred or a thousand others standing by and abetting their incendiary labors

amidst the falling and bursting of the barrels and sacks of wheat numbers of women were engaged like the crones who strip the dead in battle filling the boxes and baskets with which they were provided and their aprons with flour and making off with it

night had now closed upon the scene but the work of destruction did not cease until strong bodies of police arrived followed soon afterward by detachments of troops  

this was the flour riot of 1837 during the crisis of that year 50000 persons onethird of the working class were without work in new york city alone and 200000 of a population of 500000 were living as one observer put it in utter and hopeless distress

there is no complete record of the meetings riots actions organized and disorganized violent and nonviolent which took place in the midnineteenth century as the country grew as the cities became crowded with working conditions bad living conditions intolerable with the economy in the hands of bankers speculators landlords merchants

in 1835 fifty different trades organized unions in philadelphia and there was a successful general strike of laborers factory workers hookbinders jewelers coal heavers butchers cabinet workers for the tenhour day soon there were tenhour laws in pennsylvania and other states but they provided that employers could have employees sign contracts for longer hours the law at this time was developing a strong defense of contracts it was pretended that work contracts were voluntary agreements between equals

weavers in philadelphia in the early 1840smostly irish immigrants working at home for employersstruck for higher wages attacked the homes of those refusing to strike and destroyed their work a sheriffs posse tried to arrest some strikers but it was broken up by four hundred weavers armed with muskets and sticks

soon however antagonism developed between these irish catholic weavers and nativeborn protestant skilled workers over issues of religion in may 1844 there were protestantcatholic riots in kensington a suburb of philadelphia nativist antiimmigrant rioters destroyed the weavers neighborhoods and attacked a catholic church middleclass politicians soon led each group into a different political party the nativists into the american republican party the irish into the democratic party party politics and religion now substituting for class conflict

the result of all this says david montgomery historian of the kensington riots was the fragmentation of the philadelphia working class it thereby created for historians the illusion of a society lacking in class conflict while in reality the class conflicts of nineteenthcentury america were as fierce as any known to the industrial world

the immigrants from ireland fleeing starvation there when the potato crop failed were coming to america now packed into old sailing ships the stories of these ships differ only in detail from the accounts of the ships that earlier brought black slaves and later german italian russian immigrants this is a contemporary account of one ship arriving from ireland detained at grosse isle on the canadian border

on the 18th of may 1847 the urania from cork with several hundred immigrants on board a large proportion of them sick and dying of the shipfever was put into quarantine at grosse isle this was the first of the plaguesmitten ships from ireland which that year sailed up the st lawrence but before the first week of june as many as eightyfour ships of various tonnage were driven in by an easterly wind and of that enormous number of vessels there was not one free from the taint of malignant typhus the offspring of famine and of the foul shiphold a tolerably quick passage occupied from six to eight weeks  

who can imagine the horrors of even the shortest passage in an emigrant ship crowded beyond its utmost capacity of stowage with unhappy beings of all ages with fever raging in their midst  the crew sullen or brutal from very desperation or paralyzed with terror of the plaguethe miserable passengers unable to help themselves or afford the least relief to each other onefourth or one third or onehalf of the entire number in different stages of the disease many dying some dead the fatal poison intensified by the indescribable foulness of the air breathed and rebreathed by the gasping sufferersthe wails of children the ravings of the delirious the cries and groans of those in mortal agony

  there was no accommodation of any kind on the island    sheds were rapidly filled with the miserable people  hundreds were literally flung on the beach left amid the mud and stones to crawl on the dry land how they could  many of these  gasped out their last breath on that fatal shore not able to drag themselves from the slime in which they lay 

it was not until the 1st of november that the quarantine of grosse isle was closed upon that barren isle as many as 10000 of the irish race were consigned to the gravepit  

how could these new irish immigrants themselves poor and despised become sympathizers with the black slave who was becoming more and more the center of attention the subject of agitation in the country indeed most workingclass activists at this time ignored the plight of blacks ely moore a new york trade union leader elected to congress argued in the house of representatives against receiving abolitionist petitions racist hostility became an easy substitute for class frustration

on the other hand a white shoemaker wrote in 1848 in the awl the newspaper of lynn shoe factory workers

 we are nothing but a standing army that keeps three million of our brethren in bondage   living under the shade of bunker hill monument demanding in the name of humanity our right and withholding those rights from others because their skin is black is it any wonder that god in his righteous anger has punished us by forcing us to drink the bitter cup of degradation

the anger of the city poor often expressed itself in futile violence over nationality or religion in new york in 1849 a mob largely irish stormed the fashionable astor place opera house where an english actor william charles macready was playing macbeth in competition with an american actor edwin forrest who was acting the same role in another production the crowd shouting burn the damn den of aristocracy charged throwing bricks the militia were called out and in the violence that followed about two hundred people were killed or wounded

another economic crisis came in 1857 the boom in railroads and manufacturing the surge of immigration the increased speculation in stocks and bonds the stealing corruption manipulation led to wild expansion and then crash by october of that year 200000 were unemployed and thousands of recent immigrants crowded into the eastern ports hoping to work their way back to europe the new york times reported every ship for liverpool now has all the passengers she can carry and multitudes are applying to work their passage if they have no money to pay for it

in newark new jersey a rally of several thousand demanded the city give work to the unemployed and in new york fifteen thousand people met at tompkins square in downtown manhattan from there they marched to wall street and paraded around the stock exchange shouting we want work that summer riots occurred in the slum areas of new york a mob of five hundred attacked the police one day with pistols and bricks there were parades of the unemployed demanding bread and work looting shops in november a crowd occupied city hall and the us marines were brought in to drive them out

of the countrys work force of 6 million in 1850 half a million were women 330000 worked as domestics 55000 were teachers of the 181000 women in factories half worked in textile mills

they organized women struck by themselves for the first time in 1825 they were the united tailoresses of new york demanding higher wages in 1828 the first strike of mill women on their own took place in dover new hampshire when several hundred women paraded with banners and flags they shot off gunpowder in protest against new factory rules which charged fines for coming late forbade talking on the job and required church attendance they were forced to return to the mill their demands unmet and their leaders were fired and blacklisted

in exeter new hampshire women mill workers went on strike turned out in the language of that day because the overseer was setting the clocks back to get more time from them their strike succeeded in exacting a promise from the company that the overseers would set their watches right

the lowell system in which young girls would go to work in the mills and live in dormitories supervised by matrons at first seemed beneficent sociable a welcome escape from household drudgery or domestic service lowell massachusetts was the first town created for the textile mill industry it was named after the wealthy and influential lowell family but the dormitories became prisonlike controlled by rules and regulations the supper served after the women had risen at four in the morning and worked until seven thirty in the evening often consisted merely of bread and gravy

so the lowell girls organized they started their own newspapers they protested against the weaving rooms which were poorly lit badly ventilated impossibly hot in the summer damp and cold in the winter in 1834 a cut in wages led the lowell women to strike proclaiming union is power our present object is to have union and exertion and we remain in possession of our own unquestionable rights    but the threat of hiring others to replace them brought them back to work at reduced wages the leaders were fired

the young women determined to do better next time organized a factory girls association and 1500 went on strike in 1836 against a raise in boardinghouse charges harriet hanson was an elevenyearold girl working in the mill she later recalled

i worked in a lower room where i had heard the proposed strike fully if not vehemently discussed i had been an ardent listener to what was said against this attempt at oppression on the part of the corporation and naturally i took sides with the strikers when the day came on which the girls were to turn out those in the upper rooms started first and so many of them left that our mill was at once shut down then when the girls in my room stood irresolute uncertain what to do  i who began to think they would not go out after all their talk became impatient and started on ahead saying with childish bravado i dont care what you do i am going to turn out whether anyone else does or not and i marched out and was followed by the others

as i looked back at the long line that followed me i was more proud than i have ever been since   

the strikers marched through the streets of lowell singing they held out a month but then their money ran out they were evicted from the boardinghouses and many of them went back to work the leaders were fired including harriet hansons widowed mother a matron in the boardinghouse who was blamed for her childs going out on strike

resistance continued one mill in lowell herbert gutman reports discharged twentyeight women for such reasons as misconduct disobedience impudence levity and mutiny meanwhile the girls tried to hold on to thoughts about fresh air the country a less harried way of life one of them recalled i never cared much for machinery i could not see into their complications or feel interested in them  in sweet june weather i would lean far out of the window and try not to hear the unceasing clash of sound inside

in new hampshire five hundred men and women petitioned the amoskeag manufacturing company not to cut down an elm tree to make space for another mill they said it was a beautiful and goodly tree representing a time when the yell of the red man and the scream of the eagle were alone heard on the hanks of the merrimack instead of two giant edifices filled with the buzz of busy and wellremunerated industry

in 1835 twenty mills went on strike to reduce the workday from thirteen and a half hours to eleven hours to get cash wages instead of company scrip and to end fines for lateness fifteen hundred children and parents went out on strike and it lasted six weeks strikebreakers were brought in and some workers went back to work but the strikers did win a twelvehour day and nine hours on saturday that year and the next there were 140 strikes in the eastern part of the united states

the crisis that followed the 1837 panic stimulated the formation in 1845 of the female labor reform association in lowell which sent thousands of petitions to the massachusetts legislature asking for a tenhour day finally the legislature decided to hold public hearings the first investigation of labor conditions by any governmental body in the country eliza hemingway told the committee of the air thick with smoke from oil lamps burning before sunup and after sundown judith payne told of her sickness due to the work in the mills but after the committee visited the millsfor which the company prepared by a cleanup jobit reported your committee returned fully satisfied that the order decorum and general appearance of things in and around the mills could not be improved by any suggestion of theirs or by any act of the legislature

the report was denounced by the female labor reform association and they worked successfully for the committee chairmans defeat at the next election though they could not vote but not much was done to change conditions in the mills in the late 1840s the new england farm women who worked in the mills began to leave them as more and more irish immigrants took their place

company towns now grew up around mills in rhode island connecticut new jersey pennsylvania using immigrant workers who signed contracts pledging everyone in the family to work for a year they lived in slum tenements owned by the company were paid in scrip which they could use only at company stores and were evicted if their work was unsatisfactory

in paterson new jersey the first of a series of mill strikes was started by children when the company suddenly put off their dinner hour from noon to 100 pm the children marched off the job their parents cheering them on they were joined by other working people in the town carpenters masons machinistswho turned the strike into a tenhourday struggle after a week however with the threat of bringing in militia the children returned to work and their leaders were fired soon after trying to prevent more trouble the company restored the noon dinner hour

it was the shoemakers of lynn massachusetts a factory town northeast of boston who started the largest strike to take place in the united states before the civil war lynn had pioneered in the use of sewing machines in factories replacing shoemaker artisans the factory workers in lynn who began to organize in the 1830s later started a militant newspaper the awl in 1844 four years before marx and engelss communist manifesto appeared the awl wrote

the division of society into the producing and the nonproducing classes and the fact of the unequal distribution of value between the two introduces us at once to another distinctionthat of capital and labor  labor now becomes a commodity antagonism and opposition of interest is introduced in the community capital and labor stand opposed

the economic crisis of 1857 brought the shoe business to a halt and the workers of lynn lost their jobs there was already anger at machinestitching replacing shoemakers prices were up wages were repeatedly cut and by the fall of 1859 men were earning 3 a week and women were earning 1 a week working sixteen hours a day

in early 1860 a mass meeting of the newly formed mechanics association demanded higher wages when the manufacturers refused to meet with their committees the workers called a strike for washingtons birthday that morning three thousand shoemakers met in the lyceum hall in lynn and set up committees of 100 to post the names of scabs to guard against violence to make sure shoes would not be sent out to be finished elsewhere

in a few days shoeworkers throughout new england joined the strikein natick newburyport haverhill marblehead and other massachusetts towns as well as towns in new hampshire and maine in a week strikes had begun in all the shoe towns of new england with mechanics associations in twentyfive towns and twenty thousand shoeworkers on strike newspapers called it the revolution at the north the rebellion among the workmen of new england beginning of the conflict between capital and labor

one thousand women and five thousand men marched through the streets of lynn in a blizzard carrying banners and american flags women shoebinders and stitchers joined the strike and held their own mass meeting a new york herald reporter wrote of them they assail the bosses in a style which reminds one of the amiable females who participated in the first french revolution a huge ladies procession was organized the women marching through streets high with snowdrifts carrying signs american ladies will not be slaves   weak in physical strength but strong in moral courage we dare battle for the right shoulder to shoulder with our fathers husbands and brothers ten days after that a procession often thousand striking workers including delegations from salem marblehead and other towns men and women marched through lynn in what was the greatest demonstration of labor to take place in new england up to that time

police from boston and militia were sent in to make sure strikers did not interfere with shipments of shoes to be finished out of the state the strike processions went on while city grocers and provisions dealers provided food for the strikers the strike continued through march with morale high but by april it was losing force the manufacturers offered higher wages to bring the strikers back into the factories but without recognizing the unions so that workers still had to face the employer as individuals

most of the shoeworkers were nativeborn americans alan dawley says in his study of the lynn strike class and community they did not accept the social and political order that kept them in poverty however much it was praised in american schools churches newspapers in lynn he says articulate activist irish shoe and leather workers joined yankees in flatly rejecting the myth of success irish and yankee workers jointly  looked for labor candidates when they went to the polls and resisted strikebreaking by local police trying to understand why this fierce class spirit did not lead to independent revolutionary political action dawley concludes that the main reason is that electoral politics drained the energies of the resisters into the channels of the system

dawley disputes some historians who have said the high rate of mobility of workers prevented them from organizing in revolutionary ways he says that while there was a high turnover in lynn too this masked the existence of a virtually permanent minority who played the key role in organizing discontent he also suggests that mobility helps people see that others are in similar conditions he thinks the struggle of european workers for political democracy even while they sought economic equality made them classconscious american workers however had already gained political democracy by the 1830s and so their economic battles could be taken over by political parties that blurred class lines

even this might not have stopped labor militancy and the rise of class consciousness dawley says if not for the fact that an entire generation was sidetracked in the 1860s because of the civil war northern wage earners who rallied to the union cause became allied with their employers national issues took over from class issues at a time when scores of industrial communities like lynn were seething with resistance to industrialism national politics were preoccupied with the issues of war and reconstruction and on these issues the political parties took positions offered choices obscured the fact that the political system itself and the wealthy classes it represented were responsible for the problems they now offered to solve

classconsciousness was overwhelmed during the civil war both north and south by military and political unity in the crisis of war that unity was weaned by rhetoric and enforced by arms it was a war proclaimed as a war for liberty but working people would be attacked by soldiers if they dared to strike indians would be massacred in colorado by the us army and those daring to criticize lincolns policies would be put in jail without trialperhaps thirty thousand political prisoners

still there were signs in both sections of dissent from that unity anger of poor against rich rebellion against the dominant political and economic forces

in the north the war brought high prices for food and the necessities of life prices of milk eggs cheese were up 60 to 100 percent for families that had not been able to pay the old prices one historian emerson fite social and industrial conditions in the north during the civil war described the war situation employers were wont to appropriate to themselves all or nearly all of the profits accruing from the higher prices without being willing to grant to the employees a fair share of these profits through the medium of higher wages

there were strikes all over the country during the war the springfield republican in 1863 said that the workmen of almost every branch of trade have had their strikes within the last few months and the san francisco evening bulletin said striking for higher wages is now the rage among the working people of san francisco unions were being formed as a result of these strikes philadelphia shoemakers in 1863 announced that high prices made organization imperative

the headline in finchers trades review of november 21 1863 the revolution in new york was an exaggeration but its list of labor activities was impressive evidence of the hidden resentments of the poor during the war

the upheaval of the laboring masses in new york has startled the capitalists of that city and vicinity  

the machinists are making a hold stand  we publish their appeal in another column

the city railroad employees struck for higher wages and made the whole population for a few days ride on shanks mare

the house painters of brooklyn have taken steps to counteract the attempt of the bosses to reduce their wages

the house carpenters we are informed are pretty well out of the woods and their demands are generally complied with

the safemakers have obtained an increase of wages and are now at work

the lithographic printers are making efforts to secure better pay for their labor

the workmen on the iron clads are yet holding out against the contractors 

the window shade painters have obtained an advance of 25 percent

the horse shoers are fortifying themselves against the evils of money and trade fluctuations

the sash and blindmakers are organized and ask their employers for 25 percent additional

the sugar packers are remodelling their list of prices

the glass cutters demand 15 percent to present wages

imperfect as we confess our list to be there is enough to convince the reader that the social revolution now working its way through the land must succeed if workingmen are only true to each other

the stage drivers to the number of 800 are on a strike  

the workingmen of boston are not behind in addition to the strike at the charlestown navy yard  

the riggers are on a strike  

at this writing it is rumored says the boston post that a general strike is contemplated among the workmen in the iron establishments at south boston and other parts of the city

the war brought many women into shops and factories often over the objections of men who saw them driving wage scales down in new york city girls sewed umbrellas from six in the morning to midnight earning 3 a week from which employers deducted the cost of needles and thread girls who made cotton shirts received twentyfour cents for a twelvehour day in late 1863 new york working women held a mass meeting to find a solution to their problems a working womens protective union was formed and there was a strike of women umbrella workers in new york and brooklyn in providence rhode island a ladies cigar makers union was organized

all together by 1864 about 200000 workers men and women were in trade unions forming national unions in some of the trades putting out labor newspapers

union troops were used to break strikes federal soldiers were sent to cold springs new york to end a strike at a gun works where workers wanted a wage increase striking machinists and tailors in st louis were forced back to work by the army in tennessee a union general arrested and sent out of the state two hundred striking mechanics when engineers on the reading railroad struck troops broke that strike as they did with miners in tioga county pennsylvania

white workers of the north were not enthusiastic about a war which seemed to be fought for the black slave or for the capitalist for anyone but them they worked in semislave conditions themselves they thought the war was profiting the new class of millionaires they saw defective guns sold to the army by contractors sand sold as sugar rye sold as coffee shop sweepings made into clothing and blankets papersoled shoes produced for soldiers at the front navy ships made of rotting timbers soldiers uniforms that fell apart in the rain

the irish working people of new york recent immigrants poor looked upon with contempt by native americans could hardly find sympathy for the black population of the city who competed with them for jobs as longshoremen barbers waiters domestic servants blacks pushed out of these jobs often were used to break strikes then came the war the draft the chance of death and the conscription act of 1863 provided that the rich could avoid military service they could pay 300 or buy a substitute in the summer of 1863 a song of the conscripts was circulated by the thousands in new york and other cities one stanza

were coming father abraham three hundred thousand more
we leave our homes and firesides with bleeding hearts and sore
since poverty has been our crime we bow to thy decree
we are the poor and have no wealth to purchase liberty

when recruiting for the army began in july 1863 a mob in new york wrecked the main recruiting station then for three days crowds of white workers marched through the city destroying buildings factories streetcar lines homes the draft riots were complexantiblack antirich anti republican from an assault on draft headquarters the rioters went on to attacks on wealthy homes then to the murder of blacks they marched through the streets forcing factories to close recruiting more members of the mob they set the citys colored orphan asylum on fire they shot burned and hanged blacks they found in the streets many people were thrown into the rivers to drown

on the fourth day union troops returning from the battle of gettysburg came into the city and stopped the rioting perhaps four hundred people were killed no exact figures have ever been given but the number of lives lost was greater than in any other incident of domestic violence in american history

joel tyler headley the great riots of new york gave a graphic daybyday description of what happened

second day the firebells continually ringing increased the terror that every hour became more widespread especially was this true of the negro population  at one time there lay at the corner of twentyseventh street and seventh avenue the dead body of a negro stripped nearly naked and around it a collection of irishmen absolutely dancing or shouting like wild indians a negro barbers shop was next attacked and the torch applied to it a negro lodging house in the same street next received the visit of these furies and was soon a mass of ruins old men seventy years of age and young children too young to comprehend what it all meant were cruelly beaten and killed

there were antidraft riotsnot so prolonged or bloodyin other northern cities newark troy boston toledo evansville in boston the dead were irish workers attacking an armory who were fired on by soldiers

in the south beneath the apparent unity of the white confederacy there was also conflict most whitestwothirds of themdid not own slaves a few thousand families made up the plantation elite the federal census of 1850 showed that a thousand southern families at the top of the economy received about 50 million a year income while all the other families about 660000 received about 60 million a year

millions of southern whites were poor farmers living in shacks or abandoned outhouses cultivating land so bad the plantation owners had abandoned it just before the civil war in jackson mississippi slaves working in a cotton factory received twenty cents a day for board and white workers at the same factory received thirty cents a newspaper in north carolina in august 1855 spoke of hundreds of thousands of working class families existing upon halfstarvation from year to year

behind the rebel battle yells and the legendary spirit of the confederate army there was much reluctance to fight a sympathetic historian of the south e merton coulter asked why did the confederacy fail the forces leading to defeat were many but they may be summed up in this one fact the people did not will hard enough and long enough to win not money or soldiers but will power and morale were decisive

the conscription law of the confederacy too provided that the rich could avoid service did confederate soldiers begin to suspect they were fighting for the privileges of an elite they could never belong to in april 1863 there was a bread riot in richmond that summer draft riots occurred in various southern cities in september a bread riot in mobile alabama georgia lee tatum in her study disloyalty in the confederacy writes before the end of the war there was much disaffection in every state and many of the disloyal had formed into bandsin some states into wellorganized active societies

the civil war was one of the first instances in the world of modern warfare deadly artillery shells gatling guns bayonet chargescombining the indiscriminate killing of mechanized war with hand tohand combat the nightmare scenes could not adequately be described except in a novel like stephen cranes the red badge of courage in one charge before petersburg virginia a regiment of 850 maine soldiers lost 632 men in half an hour it was a vast butchery 623000 dead on both sides and 471000 wounded over a million dead and wounded in a country whose population was 30 million

no wonder that desertions grew among southern soldiers as the war went on as for the union army by the end of the war 200000 had deserted

still 600000 had volunteered for the confederacy in 1861 and many in the union army were volunteers the psychology of patriotism the lure of adventure the aura of moral crusade created by political leaders worked effectively to dim class resentments against the rich and powerful and turn much of the anger against the enemy as edmund wilson put it in patriotic gore written after world war ii

we have seen in our most recent wars how a divided and arguing public opinion may be converted overnight into a national nearunanimity an obedient flood of energy which will carry the young to destruction and overpower any effort to stem it the unanimity of men at war is like that of a school of fish which will swerve simultaneously and apparently without leadership when the shadow of an enemy appears or like a sky darkening flight of grasshoppers which also all compelled by one impulse will descend to consume the crops

under the deafening noise of the war congress was passing and lincoln was signing into law a whole series of acts to give business interests what they wanted and what the agrarian south had blocked before secession the republican platform of 1860 had been a clear appeal to businessmen now congress in 1861 passed the morrill tariff this made foreign goods more expensive allowed american manufacturers to raise their prices and forced american consumers to pay more

the following year a homestead act was passed it gave 160 acres of western land unoccupied and publicly owned to anyone who would cultivate it for five years anyone willing to pay 125 an acre could buy a homestead few ordinary people had the 200 necessary to do this speculators moved in and bought up much of the land homestead land added up to 50 million acres but during the civil war over 100 million acres were given by congress and the president to various railroads free of charge congress also set up a national bank putting the government into partnership with the banking interests guaranteeing their profits

with strikes spreading employers pressed congress for help the contract labor law of 1864 made it possible for companies to sign contracts with foreign workers whenever the workers pledged to give twelve months of their wages to pay the cost of emigration this gave the employers during the civil war not only very cheap labor but strikebreakers

more important perhaps than the federal laws passed by congress for the benefit of the rich were the daytoday operations of local and state laws for the benefit of landlords and merchants gustavus myers in his history of the great american fortunes comments on this in discussing the growth of the astor familys fortune much of it out of the rents of new york tenements

is it not murder when compelled by want people are forced to fester in squalid germfilled tenements where the sunlight never enters and where disease finds a prolific breedingplace untold thousands went to their deaths in these unspeakable places yet so far as the law was concerned the rents collected by the astors as well as by other landlords were honestly made the whole institution of law saw nothing out of the way in these conditions and very significantly so because to repeat over and over again law did not represent the ethics or ideals of advanced humanity it exactly reflected as a pool reflects the sky the demands and selfinterest of the growing propertied classes 

in the thirty years leading up to the civil war the law was increasingly interpreted in the courts to suit the capitalist development of the country studying this morton horwitz the transformation of american law points out that the english commonlaw was no longer holy when it stood in the way of business growth mill owners were given the legal right to destroy other peoples property by flood to carry on their business the law of eminent domain was used to take farmers land and give it to canal companies or railroad companies as subsidies judgments for damages against businessmen were taken out of the hands of juries which were unpredictable and given to judges private settlement of disputes by arbitration was replaced by court settlements creating more dependence on lawyers and the legal profession gained in importance the ancient idea of a fair price for goods gave way in the courts to the idea of caveat emptor let the buyer beware thus throwing generations of consumers from that time on to the mercy of businessmen

that contract law was intended to discriminate against working people and for business is shown by horwitz in the following example of the early nineteenth century the courts said that if a worker signed a contract to work for a year and left before the year was up he was not entitled to any wages even for the time he had worked but the courts at the same time said that if a building business broke a contract it was entitled to be paid for whatever had been done up to that point

the pretense of the law was that a worker and a railroad made a contract with equal bargaining power thus a massachusetts judge decided an injured worker did not deserve compensation because by signing the contract he was agreeing to take certain risks the circle was completed the law had come simply to ratify those forms of inequality that the market system produced

it was a time when the law did not even pretend to protect working peopleas it would in the next century health and safety laws were either nonexistent or unenforced in lawrence massachusetts in 1860 on a winter day the pemberton mill collapsed with nine hundred workers inside mostly women eightyeight died and although there was evidence that the structure had never been adequate to support the heavy machinery inside and that this was known to the construction engineer a jury found no evidence of criminal intent

horwitz sums up what happened in the courts of law by the time of the civil war

by the middle of the nineteenth century the legal system had been reshaped to the advantage of men of commerce and industry at the expense of farmers workers consumers and other less powerful groups within the society  it actively promoted a legal redistribution of wealth against the weakest groups in the society

in premodern times the maldistribution of wealth was accomplished by simple force in modern times exploitation is disguisedit is accomplished by law which has the look of neutrality and fairness by the time of the civil war modernization was well under way in the united states

with the war over the urgency of national unity slackened and ordinary people could turn more to their daily lives their problems of survival the disbanded armies now were in the streets looking for work in june 1865 finchers trades review reported as was to be expected the returned soldiers are flooding the streets already unable to find employment

the cities to which the soldiers returned were death traps of typhus tuberculosis hunger and fire in new york 100000 people lived in the cellars of the slums 12000 women worked in houses of prostitution to keep from starving the garbage lying 2 feet deep in the streets was alive with rats in philadelphia while the rich got fresh water from the schuylkill river everyone else drank from the delaware into which 13 million gallons of sewage were dumped every day in the great chicago fire in 1871 the tenements fell so fast one after another that people said it sounded like an earthquake

a movement for the eighthour day began among working people after the war helped by the formation of the first national federation of unions the national labor union a threemonth strike of 100000 workers in new york won the eighthour day and at a victory celebration in june 1872 150000 workers paraded through the city the new york times wondered what proportion of the strikers were thoroughly american

women brought into industry during the war organized unions cigarmakers tailoresses umbrella sewers capmakers printers laundresses shoeworkers they formed the daughters of st crispin and succeeded in getting the cigarmakers union and the national typographical union to admit women for the first time a woman named gussie lewis of new york became corresponding secretary of the typographers union but the cigarmakers and typographers were only two of the thirtyodd national unions and the general attitude toward women was one of exclusion

in 1869 the collar laundresses of troy new york whose work involved standing over the wash tub and over the ironing table with furnaces on either side the thermometer averaging 100 degrees for wages averaging 200 and 300 a week according to a contemporary account went on strike their leader was kate mullaney second vicepresident of the national labor union seven thousand people came to a rally to support them and the women organized a cooperative collar and cuff factory to provide work and keep the strike going but as time went on outside support dwindled the employers began making a paper collar requiring fewer laundresses the strike failed

the dangers of mill work intensified efforts to organize work often went on around the clock at a mill in providence rhode island fire broke out one night in 1866 there was panic among the six hundred workers mostly women and many jumped to their deaths from upperstory windows

in fall river massachusetts women weavers formed a union independent of the men weavers they refused to take a 10 percent wage cut that the men had accepted struck against three nulls won the mens support and brought to a halt 3500 looms and 156000 spindles with 3200 workers on strike but their children needed food they had to return to work signing an ironclad oath later called a yellowdog contract not to join a union

black workers at this time found the national labor union reluctant to organize them so they formed their own unions and carried on their own strikeslike the levee workers in mobile alabama in 1867 negro longshoremen in charleston dockworkers in savannah this probably stimulated the national labor union at its 1869 convention to resolve to organize women and negroes declaring that it recognized neither color nor sex on the question of the rights of labor a journalist wrote about the remarkable signs of racial unity at this convention

when a native mississippian and an exconfederate officer in addressing a convention refers to a colored delegate who has preceded him as the gentleman from georgia   when an ardent and democratic partisan from new york at that declares with a rich irish brogue that he asks for himself no privilege as a mechanic or as a citizen that he is not willing to concede to every other man white or black  then one may indeed be warranted in asserting that time works curious changes 

most unions however still kept negroes out or asked them to form their own locals

the national labor union began to expend more and more of its energy on political issues especially currency reform a demand for the issuance of paper money greenbacks as it became less an organizer of labor struggles and more a lobbyist with congress concerned with voting it lost vitality an observer of the labor scene f a sorge wrote in 1870 to karl marx in england the national labor union which had such brilliant prospects in the beginning of its career was poisoned by greenbackism and is slowly but surely dying

perhaps unions could not easily see the limits to legislative reform in an age where such reform laws were being passed for the first time and hopes were high the pennsylvania legislature in 1869 passed a mine safety act providing for the regulation and ventilation of mines and for the protection of the lives of the miners only after a hundred years of continuing accidents in those mines would it be understood how insufficient those words wereexcept as a device to calm anger among miners

in 1873 another economic crisis devastated the nation it was the closing of the banking house of jay cookethe banker who during the war had made 3 million a year in commissions alone for selling government bondsthat started the wave of panic while president grant slept in cookes philadelphia mansion on september 18 1873 the banker rode downtown to lock the door on his bank now people could not pay loans on mortgages live thousand businesses closed and put their workers on the street

it was more than jay cooke the crisis was built into a system which was chaotic in its nature in which only the very rich were secure it was a system of periodic crisis1837 1857 1873 and later 1893 1907 1919 1929that wiped out small businesses and brought cold hunger and death to working people while the fortunes of the astors vanderbilts rockefellers morgans kept growing through war and peace crisis and recovery during the 1873 crisis carnegie was capturing the steel market rockefeller was wiping out his competitors in oil

labor depression in brooklyn was the headline in the new york herald in november 1873 it listed closings and layoffs a feltskirt factory a pictureframe factory a glasscutting establishment a steelworks factory and womens trades milliners dressmakers shoebinders

the depression continued through the 1870s during the first three months of 1874 ninety thousand workers almost half of them women had to sleep in police stations in new york they were known as revolvers because they were limited to one or two days a month in any one police station and so had to keep moving all over the country people were evicted from their homes many roamed the cities looking for food

desperate workers tried to get to europe or to south america in 1878 the ss metropolis filled with laborers left the united states for south america and sank with all aboard the new york tribune reported one hour after the news that the ship had gone down arrived in philadelphia the office of messrs collins was besieged by hundreds of hungerbitten decent men begging for the places of the drowned laborers

mass meeting and demonstrations of the unemployed took place all over the country unemployed councils were set up a meeting in new york at cooper institute in late 1873 organized by trade unions and the american seed on of the first international founded in 1864 in europe by marx and others drew a huge crowd overflowing into the streets the meeting asked that before bills became law they should be approved by a public vote that no individual should own more than 30000 they asked for an eighthour day also

whereas we are industrious lawabiding citizens who had paid all taxes and given support and allegiance to the government

resolved that we will in this time of need supply ourselves and our families with proper food and shelter and we will send our bills to the city treasury to be liquidated until we shall obtain work 

in chicago twenty thousand unemployed marched through the streets to city hall asking bread for the needy clothing for the naked and houses for the homeless actions like this resulted in some relief for about ten thousand families

in january 1874 in new york city a huge parade of workers kept by the police from approaching city hall went to tompkins square and there were told by the police they couldnt have the meeting they stayed and the police attacked one newspaper reported

police clubs rose and fell women and children ran screaming in all directions many of them were trampled underfoot in the stampede for the gates in the street bystanders were ridden down and mercilessly clubbed by mounted officers

strikes were called in the textile mills of fall river massachusetts in the anthracite coal district of pennsylvania there was the long strike where irish members of a society called the ancient order of hibernians were accused of acts of violence mostly on the testimony of a detective planted among the miners these were the molly maguires they were tried and found guilty philip foner believes after a study of the evidence that they were framed because they were labor organizers he quotes the sympathetic irish world which called them intelligent men whose direction gave strength to the resistance of the miners to the inhuman reduction of their wages and he points to the miners journal put out by the coal mine owners which referred to the executed men this way what did they do whenever prices of labor did not suit them they organized and proclaimed a strike

all together nineteen were executed according to anthony bimba the molly maguires there were scattered protests from workingmens organizations but no mass movement that could stop the executions

it was a time when employers brought in recent immigrantsdesperate for work different from the strikers in language and cultureto break strikes italians were imported into the bituminous coal area around pittsburgh in 1874 to replace striking miners this led to the killing of three italians to trials in which jurors of the community exonerated the strikers and bitter feelings between italians and other organized workers

the centennial year of 1876one hundred years after the declaration of independencebrought forth a number of new declarations reproduced by philip foner in we the other people whites and blacks separately expressed their disillusionment a negro declaration of independence denounced the republican party on which they had once depended to gain full freedom and proposed independent political action by colored voters and the workingmens party of illinois at a july 4 celebration organized by german socialists in chicago said in its declaration of independence

the present system has enabled capitalists to make laws in their own interests to the injury and oppression of the workers

it has made the name democracy for which our forefathers fought and died a mockery and a shadow by giving to property an unproportionate amount of representation and control over legislation

it has enabled capitalists  to secure government aid inland grants and money loans to selfish railroad corporations who by monopolizing the means of transportation are enabled to swindle both the producer and the consumer 

it has presented to the world the absurd spectacle of a deadly civil war for the abolition of negro slavery while the majority of the white population those who have created all the wealth of the nation are compelled to suffer under a bondage infinitely more galling and humiliating  

it has allowed the capitalists as a class to appropriate annually 56 of the entire production of the country   

it has therefore prevented mankind from fulfilling their natural destinies on earthcrushed out ambition prevented marriages or caused false and unnatural oneshas shortened human life destroyed morals and fostered crime corrupted judges ministers and statesmen shattered confidence love and honor among men and made life a selfish merciless struggle for existence instead of a noble and generous struggle for perfection in which equal advantages should he given to all and human lives relieved from an unnatural and degrading competition for bread 

we therefore the representatives of the workers of chicago in mass meeting assembled do solemnly publish and declare  

that we are absolved from all allegiance to the existing political parties of this country and that as free and independent producers we shall endeavor to acquire the full power to make our own laws manage our own production and govern ourselves acknowledging no rights without duties no duties without rights and for the support of this declaration with a firm reliance on the assistance and cooperation of all workingmen we mutually pledge to each other our lives our means and our sacred honor

in the year 1877 the country was in the depths of the depression that summer in the hot cities where poor families lived in cellars and drank infested water the children became sick in large numbers the new york times wrote  already the cry of the dying children begins to be heard  soon to judge from the past there will be a thousand deaths of infants per week in the city that first week in july in baltimore where all liquid sewage ran through the streets 139 babies died

that year there came a series of tumultuous strikes by railroad workers in a dozen cities they shook the nation as no labor conflict in its history had done

it began with wage cuts on railroad after railroad in tense situations of already low wages 175 a day for brakemen working twelve hours scheming and profiteering by the railroad companies deaths and injuries among the workersloss of hands feet fingers the crushing of men between cars

at the baltimore  ohio station in martinsburg west virginia workers determined to tight the wage cut went on strike uncoupled the engines ran them into the roundhouse and announced no more trains would leave martinsburg until the 10 percent cut was canceled a crowd of support gathered too many for the local police to disperse b  o officials asked the governor for military protection and he sent in militia a train tried to get through protected by the militia and a striker trying to derail it exchanged gunfire with a militiaman attempting to stop him the striker was shot in his thigh and his arm his arm was amputated later that day and nine days later he died

six hundred freight trains now jammed the yards at martinsburg the west virginia governor applied to newly elected president rutherford hayes for federal troops saying the state militia was insufficient in fact the militia was not totally reliable being composed of many railroad workers much of the us army was tied up in indian battles in the west congress had not appropriated money for the army yet but j p morgan august belmont and other bankers now offered to lend money to pay army officers but no enlisted men federal troops arrived in martinsburg and the freight cars began to move

in baltimore a crowd of thousands sympathetic to the railroad strikers surrounded the armory of the national guard which had been called out by the governor at the request of the b  o railroad the crowd hurled rocks and the soldiers came out firing the streets now became the scene of a moving bloody battle when the evening was over ten men or boys were dead more badly wounded one soldier wounded half of the 120 troops quit and the rest went on to the train depot where a crowd of two hundred smashed the engine of a passenger train tore up tracks and engaged the militia again in a running battle

by now fifteen thousand people surrounded the depot soon three passenger cars the station platform and a locomotive were on fire the governor asked for federal troops and hayes responded five hundred soldiers arrived and baltimore quieted down

the rebellion of the railroad workers now spread joseph dacus then editor of the st louis republican reported

strikes were occurring almost every hour the great state of pennsylvania was in an uproar new jersey was afflicted by a paralyzing dread new york was mustering an army of militia ohio was shaken from lake erie to the ohio river indiana rested in a dreadful suspense illinois and especially its great metropolis chicago apparently hung on the verge of a vortex of confusion and tumult st louis had already felt the effect of the premonitory shocks of the uprising   

the strike spread to pittsburgh and the pennsylvania railroad again it happened outside the regular union pentup anger exploding without plan robert bruce historian of the 1877 strikes writes 1877 year of violence about a flagman named gus harris harris refused to go out on a double header a train with two locomotives carrying a double length of cars to which railroaders had objected because it required fewer workers and made the brakemens work more dangerous

the decision was his own not part of a concerted plan or a general understanding had he lain awake that past night listening to the rain asking himself if he dared quit wondering if anyone would join him weighing the chances or had he simply risen to a breakfast that did not fill him seen his children go off shabby and halffed walked brooding through the damp morning and then yielded impulsively to storedup rage

when harris said he would not go the rest of the crew refused too the strikers now multiplied joined by young boys and men from the mills and factories pittsburgh had 33 iron mills 73 glass factories 29 oil refineries 158 coal mines the freight trains stopped moving out of the city the trainmans union had not organized this but it moved to take hold called a meeting invited all workingmen to make common cause with their brethren on the railroad

railroad and local officials decided that the pittsburgh militia would not kill their fellow townsmen and urged that philadelphia troops be called in by now two thousand cars were idle in pittsburgh the philadelphia troops came and began to clear the track rocks flew gunfire was exchanged between crowd and troops at least ten people were killed all workingmen most of them not railroaders

now the whole city rose in anger a crowd surrounded the troops who moved into a roundhouse railroad cars were set afire buildings began to burn and finally the roundhouse itself the troops marching out of it to safety there was more gunfire the union depot was set afire thousands looted the freight cars a huge grain elevator and a small section of the city went up in flames in a few days twentyfour people had been killed including four soldiers seventynine buildings had been burned to the ground something like a general strike was developing in pittsburgh mill workers car workers miners laborers and the employees at the carnegie steel plant

the entire national guard of pennsylvania nine thousand men was called out but many of the companies couldnt move as strikers in other towns held up traffic in lebanon pennsylvania one national guard company mutinied and marched through an excited town in altoona troops surrounded by rioters immobilized by sabotaged engines surrendered stacked arms fraternized with the crowd and then were allowed to go home to the accompaniment of singing by a quartet in an allnegro militia company

in harrisburg the state capital as at so many places teenagers made up a large part of the crowd which included some negroes philadelphia militia on their way home from altoona shook hands with the crowd gave up their guns marched like captives through the streets were fed at a hotel and sent home the crowd agreed to the mayors request to deposit the surrendered guns at the city hall factories and shops were idle after some looting citizens patrols kept order in the streets through the night

where strikers did not manage to take control as in pottsville pennsylvania it may well have been because of disunity the spokesman of the philadelphia  reading coal  iron company in that town wrote the men have no organization and there is too much race jealousy existing among them to permit them to form one

in reading pennsylvania there was no such problem90 percent were nativeborn the rest mostly german there the railroad was two months behind in paying wages and a branch of the trainmans union was organized two thousand people gathered while men who had blackened their faces with coal dust set about methodically tearing up tracks jamming switches derailing cars setting fire to cabooses and also to a railroad bridge

a national guard company arrived fresh from duty at the execution of the molly maguires the crowd threw stones fired pistols the soldiers fired into the crowd six men lay dead in the twilight bruce reports a fireman and an engineer formerly employed in the reading a carpenter a huckster a rollingmill worker a laborer a policeman and another man lay at the point of death five of the wounded died the crowd grew angrier more menacing a contingent of soldiers announced it would not fire one soldier saying he would rather put a bullet through the president of philadelphia  reading coal  iron the 16th regiment of the morristown volunteers stacked its arms some militia threw their guns away and gave their ammunition to the crowd when the guardsmen left for home federal troops arrived and took control and local police began making arrests

meanwhile the leaders of the big railway brotherhoods the order of railway conductors the brotherhood of locomotive firemen the brotherhood of engineers disavowed the strike there was talk in the press of communistic ideas    widely entertained  by the workmen employed in mines and factories and by the railroads

in fact there was a very active workingmens party in chicago with several thousand members most of them immigrants from germany and bohemia it was connected with the first international in europe in the midst of the railroad strikes that summer of 1877 it called a rally six thousand people came and demanded nationalization of the railroads albert parsons gave a fiery speech he was from alabama had fought in the confederacy during the civil war married a brownskinned woman of spanish and indian blood worked as a typesetter and was one of the best english speaking orators the workingmens party had

the next day a crowd of young people not especially connected with the rally of the evening before began moving through the railroad yards closed down the freights went to the factories called out the mill workers the stockyard workers the crewmen on the lake michigan ships closed down the brickyards and lumberyards that day also albert parsons was fired from his job with the chicago times and declared blacklisted

the police attacked the crowds the press reported the sound of clubs falling on skulls was sickening for the first minute until one grew accustomed to it a rioter dropped at every whack it seemed for the ground was covered with them two companies of us infantry arrived joining national guardsmen and civil war veterans police fired into a surging crowd and three men were killed

the next day an armed crowd of five thousand fought the police the police fired again and again and when it was over and the dead were counted they were as usual workingmen and boys eighteen of them their skulls smashed by clubs their vital organs pierced by gunfire

the one city where the workingmens party clearly led the rebellion was st louis a city of flour mills foundries packing houses machine shops breweries and railroads here as elsewhere there were wage cuts on the railroads and here there were perhaps a thousand members of the workingmens party many of them bakers coopers cabinetmakers cigarmakers brewery workers the party was organized in four sections by nationality german english french bohemian

all four sections took a ferry across the mississippi to join a mass meeting of railroad men in east st louis one of their speakers told the meeting all you have to do gentlemen for you have the numbers is to unite on one ideathat the workingmen shall rule the country what man makes belongs to him and the workingmen made this country railroaders in east st louis declared themselves on strike the mayor of east st louis was a european immigrant himself an active revolutionist as a youth and railroad mens votes dominated the city

in st louis itself the workingmens party called an openair mass meeting to which five thousand people came the party was clearly in the leadership of the strike speakers excited by the crowd became more militant    capital has changed liberty into serfdom and we must fight or die they called for nationalization of the railroads mines and all industry

at another huge meeting of the workingmens party a black man spoke for those who worked on the steamboats and levees he asked will you stand to us regardless of color the crowd shouted back we will an executive committee was set up and it called for a general strike of all branches of industry in st louis

handbills for the general strike were soon all over the city there was a march of four hundred negro steamboat men and roustabouts along the river six hundred factory workers carrying a banner no monopoly workingmens rights a great procession moved through the city ending with a rally often thousand people listening to communist speakers the people are rising up in their might and declaring they will no longer submit to being oppressed by unproductive capital

david burbank in his book on the st louis events reign of the rabble writes

only around st louis did the original strike on the railroads expand into such a systematically organized and complete shutdown of all industry that the term general strike is fully justified and only there did the socialists assume undisputed leadership no american city has come so close to being ruled by a workers soviet as we would now call it as st louis missouri in the year 1877

the railroad strikes were making news in europe marx wrote engels what do you think of the workers of the united states this first explosion against the associated oligarchy of capital which has occurred since the civil war will naturally again be suppressed but can very well form the point of origin of an earnest workers party   

in new york several thousand gathered at tompkins square the tone of the meeting was moderate speaking of a political revolution through the ballot box and if you will unite we may have here within five years a socialistic republic    then will a lovely morning break over this darkened land it was a peaceful meeting it adjourned the last words heard from the platform were whatever we poor men may not have we have free speech and no one can take it from us then the police charged using their clubs

in st louis as elsewhere the momentum of the crowds the meetings the enthusiasm could not be sustained as they diminished the police militia and federal troops moved in and the authorities took over the police raided the headquarters of the workingmens party and arrested seventy people the executive committee that had been for a while virtually in charge of the city was now in prison the strikers surrendered the wage cuts remained 131 strike leaders were fired by the burlington railroad

when the great railroad strikes of 1877 were over a hundred people were dead a thousand people had gone to jail 100000 workers had gone on strike and the strikes had roused into action countless unemployed in the cities more than half the freight on the nations 75000 miles of track had stopped running at the height of the strikes

the railroads made some concessions withdrew some wage cuts but also strengthened their coal and iron police in a number of large cities national guard armories were built with loopholes for guns robert bruce believes the strikes taught many people of the hardships of others and that they led to congressional railroad regulation they may have stimulated the business unionism of the american federation of labor as well as the national unity of labor proposed by the knights of labor and the independent laborfarmer parties of the next two decades

in 1877 the same year blacks learned they did not have enough strength to make real the promise of equality in the civil war working people learned they were not united enough not powerful enough to defeat the combination of private capital and government power but there was more to comeembed"
