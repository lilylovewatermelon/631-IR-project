heart hey we had this talk
this is where we run dont walk
away from her as fast as we can move
dont you remember what she did
the last time you let her in
did you forget the pain she put us through
i wouldnt go there if i were you

chorus
heart stick to beating stop all this feeling
aint you tired of being her fool
when her hips start swaying my lips start sayin
dont you know youre gonna get broke right in two
i wouldnt go there if i were you

verse 2
try not to think too much about the fire thats in her touch
how her kiss can make you come unglued
that sweet look in her eyes
its all part of her disguise
thats the devil wearing that perfume
i wouldnt go there if i were you

chorus
heart stick to beating stop all this feeling
aint you tired of being her fool
when her hips start swayin my lips start sayin
dont you know youre gonna get broke right in two
i wouldnt go there if i were you
see cody johnson liveget tickets as low as 15you might also likecome on now
aw dont do it

chorus
so heart stick to beating stop all this feeling
aint you tired of being her fool
cause when her hips start swayin my lips start sayin
dont you know youre gonna get broke right in two
well feet dont fail me now
head dont turn around
cause here she comes and shes makin all the right moves
i wouldnt go there if i were you
i wouldnt go there if i were youembed"
