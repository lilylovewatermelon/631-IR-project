jump the turnstiles never pay the toll
jump the turnstiles never pay the toll
jump the turnstiles never pay the toll
doowahdiddy and bust in with the preroll
jump the turnstiles never pay the toll
jump the turnstiles never pay the toll
jump the turnstiles never pay the toll
doowahdiddy and bust in with the preroll

verse 1
if the southbound train keeps you away from me
and the stations are all the spaces in between
found a ticket without a dollar in my jeans
you looked up to kiss me but you were always taller in my dreams

verse 2
who really understands how the night connects to day
when you cant even understand how it all connects today
all the working stiffs who had to work can say
i wonder why that little girl was crying on the train

chorus
found a friend
found a home
found a foe
all alone so far away from home
you might also likerefrain
jump the turnstiles never pay the toll
jump the turnstiles never pay the toll
jump the turnstiles never pay the toll
doowahdiddy and bust in with the preroll
jump the turnstiles never pay the toll
jump the turnstiles never pay the toll
jump the turnstiles never pay the toll
doowahdiddy and bust in with the preroll

verse 3
everybody pretending that they dont see that they dont know
that youre thinking of yesterday but youre wearing tomorrows clothes
it isnt fair when you pay the fare and he sends you back
youre left laying flat like a penny on the tracks

verse 4
so hop the turnstile baby take the q until youre sick
stand on the platform see the light through the wind
one second youre moving along and the next you feel like shit
never a free ride never a yang without the yin

chorus
found a friend
found a home
found a foe
all alone so far away from me
outro
jump the turnstiles never pay the toll
jump the turnstiles never pay the toll
jump the turnstiles never pay the toll
doowahdiddy and bust in with the preroll
jump the turnstiles never pay the toll
jump the turnstiles never pay the toll
jump the turnstiles never pay the toll
doowahdiddy and bust in with the prerollembed"
