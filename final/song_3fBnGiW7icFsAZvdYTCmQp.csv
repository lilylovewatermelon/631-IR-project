grand hustle pimp
hey whats happenin shorty
me being a true player and all
i mean you know as a stand up guy you know
i really hate to say i told you so
but man i told you so
back when we said we were goin to run this shit man
when we said pimp squad click grand hustle was the business
when we said their was a whole nother side of atlanta
a whole nother bunch of motherfuckers in the trap yall didnt know

hook
man i told you so
they thought a pimp wasnt sposed to blow
because i was rappin about moving os and blow
pimp i told you so
they thought that outkast closed the door
and luda just came in and sold his 4
man i told you so
the mac crod kuntry and dro
and ak had the coldest flow
nigga i told you so
i said the future was right up under your nose
you thought the south wouldnt explode no more
remember i told you so

way back when krisskross was hollering jump on ya tube
they was still gettin jumped at school we used to tote them tools
dont get me wrong ill give respect to them dudes
but approach us wrong and well smoke them fools aint no joke its the truth
fuck a hater let em do what it do
im busy now but ill be through in a few
and then im coming for you
so keep shit talking like its something to do
ill spend a 100 grand get a killer something to do
i been hustlin since 92 when i heard ugk
hollering pocket full of stones i was on my way
had a history in the yay before i started to trap
at 13 let me take you back farther than that
when my uncles was baggin blocks used to count the stacks
i was only 8 and my granddaddy can vouch for that
and my pops had a lot of work a lot of folk he got em work
and ran numbers said if he aint wanna he aint gotta work
why i sold rocks i guess i got from pops
my uncles point man is saying a chip off the old block
the nigga you hear now the same one from off the old block
who used to stand on front st and get off the old block

hook

verse 2
i remember the pc killer mike david banner and me
and youngbloodz ran through atlanta with heat when even atlanta was sleep
nigga back before you heard of me
i was middle man into serving keys when kt was serving 3
im on top because i deserved to be
so simmer down calm your nerves at least
speak your words with peace
before you lay out on the curb deceased
think about it its absurd to beef
i took my songs to street
he told me dopeboy was the bomb in the street
since then my name rang like alarms in the street
who knew how long it would be
if only la knew how wrong he could be
i told you aint nobody stronger than me
hook

verse 3
this southern rap shit of the day is something i helped design
puerto rico at the mix show ill let you know who the next in line
the snowman paul wall and thugga now say i was lyin
alot of other niggas shouldnt of even been signed
thats a opinion of mine
because these niggas be neglecting the grind
aint waiting on nobody to let me shine imma go get me mine
and then they wonder why they checks behind
cuz tip was 20k back in the day need me to press rewind
what be on these niggas mind man dont get me to lyin
i seen ya kind dopeboy and that aint even ya kind
aint never even sold a gram of crack and aint no need of ya tryin
back in the trap pimp i dont see him survivin
