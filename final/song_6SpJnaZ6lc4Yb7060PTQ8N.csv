my mothers people were ashamed of me
the indians said that i was white by law
the white man always called me indian squaw

halfbreed thats all i ever heard
halfbreed how i learned to hate the word
halfbreed shes no good they warned
both sides were against me since the day i was born

we never settled went from town to town
when youre not welcome you dont hang around
the other children always laughed at me
give her a feather shes a cherokee

halfbreed thats all i ever heard
halfbreed how i learned to hate the word
halfbreed shes no good they warned
both sides were against me since the day i was born

we werent accepted and i felt ashamed
nineteen i left them tell me whos to blame
my life since then has been from man to man
but i cant run away from what i am

halfbreed thats all i ever heard
halfbreed how i learned to hate the word
halfbreed shes no good they warned
both sides were against me since the day i was born
