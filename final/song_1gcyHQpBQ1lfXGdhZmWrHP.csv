you booked the night train for a reason
so you could sit there in this hurt
bustling crowds or silent sleepers
youre not sure which is worse

chorus
because i dropped your hand while dancing
left you out there standing
crestfallen on the landing
champagne problems
your moms ring in your pocket
my picture in your wallet
your heart was glass i dropped it
champagne problems

verse 2
you told your family for a reason
you couldnt keep it in
your sister splashed out on the bottle
now no ones celebrating

chorus
dom pérignon you brought it
no crowd of friends applauded
your hometown skeptics called it
champagne problems
you had a speech youre speechless
love slipped beyond your reaches
and i couldnt give a reason
champagne problems
see taylor swift liveget tickets as low as 172you might also likebridge
your midas touch on the chevy door
november flush and your flannel cure
this dorm was once a madhouse
i made a joke well its made for me
how evergreen our group of friends
dont think well say that word again
and soon theyll have the nerve to deck the halls
that we once walked through
one for the money two for the show
i never was ready so i watch you go
sometimes you just dont know the answer
til someones on their knees and asks you
she wouldve made such a lovely bride
what a shame shes fucked in the head they said
but youll find the real thing instead
shell patch up your tapestry that i shred

chorus
and hold your hand while dancing
never leave you standing
crestfallen on the landing
with champagne problems
your moms ring in your pocket
her picture in your wallet
you wont remember all my
champagne problems
outro
you wont remember all my
