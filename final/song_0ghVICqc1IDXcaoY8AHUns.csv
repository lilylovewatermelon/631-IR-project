ill breathe you in with smoke in the backyard light
we used to laugh until we choked into the wasted nights
it was the best time of my life but now i sleep alone
so dont dont dont wake me up cause my thrill is gone
say im wrong in the sunset turning red behind the smoke
forever and alone
yeah

verse 1
and youve gone and sewn me to this bed
the taste of you and me will never leave my lips again
under the blinding rain blinding rain
i wanna hold your hand so tight im gonna break my wrists break my wrists
and when the vultures sing tonight im gonna join right in

chorus
ill sing along oh oh oh
because i dont know any other song woah oh no
ill sing along but im barely hanging on
no im barely hanging on
by the time youre hearing this ill already be gone
and now theres nothing to do but scream at the drunken moon

verse 2
this isnt fair no
dont you try to blame this on me
my love for you was bulletproof but youre the one who shot me
and goddammit i can barely say your name
so ill try to write it and fill the pen with blood from the sink
woah oh
but dont just say it you should sing my name
pretend that its a song cause forever its yours
and we can sing this on the way home

ill sing along oh oh oh
cause i dont know any other song woah oh no
ill sing along but im barely hanging on
no im barely hanging on
by the time youre hearing this ill already be gone
but now theres nothing to do but tear my voice apart
theres nothing to do but scream at the drunken moon58embed"
