motherfucker you can live at the mall
i can see the evil i can tell it i know its illegal
i dont think about it i deposit every other zero
thinking of my partner put the candy paint it on the regal
digging in my pocket aint a profit big enough to feed you
every day my logic get another dollar just to keep you
in the presence of your chico ah
i dont talk about it be about it every day i sequel
if i got it then you know you got it heaven i can reach you

outro kendrick lamar  thundercat
i keep my head up high
i cross my heart and hope to die
lovin me is complicated
too afraid of a lot of changes
im alright and youre a favorite
dark nights in my prayers
poem kendrick lamar
i remembered you was conflicted
misusing your influence sometimes i did the same
abusing my power full of resentment
resentment that turned into a deep depression
found myself screamin in the hotel room
i didnt wanna selfdestruct
the evils of lucy was all around me
so i went runnin for answers780embed"
