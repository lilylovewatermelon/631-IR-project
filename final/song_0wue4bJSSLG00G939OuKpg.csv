im just sitting here tryna
forget bout all those years and i
i cant take the thought of him
alone with you alone with you
its been a year or so and you
moved on and left me cold and i
i wish that i could let you know
that i still got a thang for you

prechrous jay sean
but you got another man
he says he loves you too
baby girl i understand
this must be hard on you
and it gets so hard sometimes
to know just what to do
stuck in the middle with you

chrous jay sean jared cotter
you and i
through it all
sunny days
through the storms
still i know
he can never love you like me
girl i know he and you
going new he messed it up with it all
no he can never love you like me
can we go back again as lovers not as friends
cause i know
he can never love you like me
girl ive been there before
time to close it up and go right on
but he can never love you like me
see jay sean liveget tickets as low as 61you might also likeverse 2 jared cotter
i was the one you can run into
when tears would fall from what he do
who knew the friends would become lovers
going crazy giving my all but getting halfa you
im not half the man so tell me what to do
never gonna let you go
cause you know our love is true

prechorus jared cotter
but you got another man
but hes not good for you
baby girl i understand
but this aint all on you
and it gets so hard some time
to know just what to do
stuck in the middle with you

chrous jay sean jared cotter
you and i
through it all
sunny days
through the storms

can we go back again as lovers not as friends
cause i know
he can never love you like me

time to close it up and go right on
but he can never love you like me
bridge jay sean jared cotter
i know
that you will never find another love like
me and you can look but wont find another man like
me and even though you might have seperated from me
gotta make a choice cant wait forever

chrous jay sean jared cotter

going new he messed it up with it all
no he can never love you like me
can we go back again as lovers not as friends
cause i know
