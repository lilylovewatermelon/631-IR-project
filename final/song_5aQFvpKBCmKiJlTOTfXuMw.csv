skyler’s voice singing a lullaby “hush little baby”
quiet and sweet just like that time back in ep 212 when
walt was listening in on the baby monitor actually its
the very same moment we’re hearing now then 
up on
a series of microscopic closeups of
 surfaces and contours reflecting light to show intricate
geometric patterns
 strange textures that shudder sway or glisten
 sudden pulsations of movement  flutterflutter
weird  what are these images we can’t tell we’re simply
too close to see but there’s something arresting and alien
and kind of beautiful about them
the lullaby continues as we adjust and pull back a bit just
enough to reveal the common housefly we’ve been moving
through a progression of highdefinition close ups
note weve already found footage that we like and are
hoping we can purchase it as stock
now that we know what we’re seeing these images aren’t
quite so beautiful they’re actually creepy and disgusting
the protruding spongy mouthparts the pixillated compound
eyes the vein structure of the transparent wings the
delicate hairy tendrils of the antennae
monstrous
why are we looking at this what does this mean we’ve no
idea but skyler’s soothing melody accompaniment only
heightens the now nightmarish quality of our opening
when her brief lullaby ends we simply roll credits and begin
a “breaking bad” episode unlike any other
ct one
a red glowing light
fills frame it blinks off darkness after a beat it
blinks back on pop wider to reveal we’re looking up at
the blinking led light of a ceiling smoke detector turns
out we are in the pov of
int walt’s condo  bedroom  night
walt he lies in bed staring up at the blinking light
he’s deep in the disquiet of a sleepless night on off
on off
lockeddown dissolve from this wakeful 2 am scenario to

int walt’s condo  bedroom  morning
6 am dawn light creeps in as faded and weak as walt he
sits slumped on the edge of the bed weary and careworn lost
in thought he’s been sitting here awhile having given up
on any chance of slumber hours ago
beepbeepbeepbeepbeepbeepbeepbeepbeepbeep
his bedside alarm ruptures the silence this doesn’t
surprise him  he’s been waiting out the clock he simply
reaches out a hand and shuts it off
close on walt distinctly troubled the bedroom might be
silent but if only he could somehow block out the
relentless din in his head
what’s on walt’s mind any one of a dozen things could be
plaguing him or all of them walt’s share of guilt for
hank getting shot certainly springs to mind
at any rate this is the central question of our episode
what’s the matter with walt
he reaches for his glasses puts them on  though perhaps
he’d prefer the world to remain out of focus
off walt exhausted and perturbed facing the day
next industrial laundry  morning
bright searing sunlight the sky almost painfully blue


continued
wide on the facility as several cars enter walt’s aztek is
already parked here
we discover walt sitting in his car he still wears his seat
belt he’s unmoving preoccupied staring straight ahead
but his tired eyes view only the past not the present
jesse pulls up and parks his tercel nearby jesse climbs
out takes a last drag of a cigarette  savoring this last
taste of the free world before entering the dungeon of the
lab he drops the butt grinds it out
he ambles to the aztek and peers in then raps on our window
walt startles a little he grabs his brown bag lunch from
the passenger seat he tries to exit but gets snagged by his
seat belt  didn’t realize it was still fastened
chagrined he unbuckles it
walt and jesse join silent workers entering the laundry

int industrial laundry  morning

chunkchunk walt and jesse pass expressionless men and
women standing in line some holding bag lunches like walt’s
these folks dutifully punch in on the laundry’s time clock
chunkchunk on the move jesse observes with bitterness
jesse
surprised he doesn’t make us do
that
walt glances over his expression inscrutable wordlessly
he disappears around the corner jesse follows on his heels

int superlab  day

shshshsh sounds of scrubbing and the occasional grunt
but as we track the rows of equipment the lab appears to be
empty wide on the entire place  deserted that is until
walt stands up inside a giant vat revealing himself
an overhead angle reveals walt and jesse wearing full
waterproof gear each cleaning out a separate tank they
look like sailors on a whaling ship it’s hard boring scutwork
but it needs to be done before each new cook

jesse
the pack totally has a pecking
order

continued
hshshshsh jesse scrubs unenthusiastically with a
brush speaking intermittently during the small pauses when
he stops just talking out loud whatever’s on his mind
walt works diligently intently  even in his fatigued state
he finds the chore and its results satisfying he’s not
conversing with jesse not even listening in fact

jesse
and the head hyena he’s the man
you know all the other ones have
to like kiss his ass
shshshshsh

jesse
i mean literally it’sit’s so
gross they have to lick his junk
iii can’t believe they even
showed it on tv
shshshshsh
walt clambers out of his vat and starts cleaning the outside
from this position he can see gale’s coffee contraption
walt stares for a moment then averts his gaze refocuses
jesse stands up into view working his shoulder and cracking
his aching neck sourly glancing around the lab

jesse
yo if this is s’posed to be all
like major league and all we
should have equipment maintainer
guys 
he sinks back down out of sight keeps scrubbing shshsh

jesse
 and water boys you know
example
yo gatorade me bitch
shshshshsh

jesse
get us a couple of flunkies in
here treat us right
walt moves on to another vessel and gets started we begin a
sequence of wide lockeddown dissolves of the two of them
cleaning all the equipment a few example
 walt hoses down the inside of a tank water sluices and
churns within the curved walls
 jesse shoots compressed air through hoses in short bursts
 in the triple sink walt washes glassware in one sink full of suds rinses in the adjacent sink sets each item to dry
in the third one his own little assembly line
 jesse climbs a ladder to clean inside a settling tank

int superlab  afternoon

close on a white sheet of handwritten numbers not calculus
formulae but simply long columns of addition the tip of a
number 2 pencil enters frame scanning down their length
it’s hours later the end of a very long day walt now
dressed in street clothes frowns as he rechecks his math
he sits at the weighingpackaging bench with paperwork spread
before him no meth here a mug of untouched coffee goes
cold he’s absorbed in his task  the numbers perplex him
behind him a cook is finally up and running as we can tell
by the sound effects and maybe a bit of steam
jesse his tyvek half off with the sleeves tied around his
waist checks a few dials he’s satisfied by what he sees
he sets a cook timer one of those palmsize digital deals
he sticks it to the vat with a magnetic clunk presses start

jesse
okay 15 hours starts now
done for the day
i’m gonna hit it if that’s cool
with you
walt engrossed doesn’t answer jesse shakes his head 
what’s up with him today he crosses to the break room
walt studies his figures pressing his pencil to his lips

walt
muttering
i don’t understand
jesse is visible in the break room shrugging out of his
tyvek

jesse
what

walt
these numbers they just don’t add
up

jesse
told ya dude’s totally boning us

walt
nah it’s not that it’s our
output we’re off we’re point
onefour percent off
jesse pulls on his hoodie or somesuch unconcerned

jesse
point onefour that’s like
what does that 

walt
 it means we should be netting
more than we’re netting

jesse
glimmer of interest now
so how far off are we

walt
it’s not negligible ballparking
it i’d say we’re a quarter to a
half pound shy
jesse has a burst of fear across his face before he composes himself

jesse
that’s weird
a beat
well what about spillage
walt looks up from his numbers for the first time

walt
spillage

jesse
yeah you know just stuff gets
spilled

walt
nothing gets spilled

jesse
little maybe

walt
stubbornly
nothing gets spilled

jesse
what about um evaporation

walt
that wouldn’t account for this
much the materials aren’t out
that long

jesse
what about the uh the other one
the drops like on um on cold
beer

walt
faintly annoyed
condensation

jesse
yeah

walt
no

jesse
what about the crap that gets left
behind
off walt’s puzzled look
you know  all the gunk we scrape
out of the vats they add up like
a gallon each didja work that
in

walt
considering
vestiges

jesse
yeah vestiges
walt stares at jesse for a beat blinks cocks his head
birdlike returns to his numbers
jesse’s uncomfortable hopes he dodged that bullet now he
just wants to get the hell out of there

jesse
bet that’s it
halfway to the stairs
bet that’s totally it
walt is engrossed in his calculations jesse starts up the
spiral staircase then stops some instinct nags at him

jesse
hey mr white
no response louder

mr white

walt
huh

jesse
are you okay

walt
yeahyeah why

jesse
 nothing
beat then
are you coming

walt
preoccupied
yeah in a minute
jesse nods he jogs up the spiral staircase crosses the
catwalk opens the door and pauses looks down at mr white
jesse’s pov from above walt sits hunched over his note pad
he looks small shrunken and diminished with his pencil and
wallabies walt looks like a relic  incongruous with the
gleaming enormity of the modern lab

jesse
alright see ya tomorrow
without looking up walt gives a little wave jesse goes
the heavy door clangs shut behind him walt is left alone
walt rerechecks his math it’s still not making sense for
him silence while he struggles with it then
 a faint buzz fades in then out maybe we notice
tighter on walt as he scribbles numbers a beat we hear
the buzz again a bit louder this time moving past walt’s
head in our wonderful dolby surround walt lifts his eyes
listens more silence he focuses once more on his task

buzzz louder now right past walt’s ear his head rises
he glances around left and right above him what the hell
just then a fly buzzes into view it lands on the numberscribbled
sheet before walt his eyes narrow on it
close on this fat black housefly wellfed positively
burly wings twitching it grooms itself
walt squints at this insouciant intruder a fly in here
unacceptable he’ll dispatch this pest posthaste
slowly slowly walt reaches for a nearby note pad raises
it eyes on his prey he slaps the pad down hard  whack
fat chance unscathed the fly buzzes off circles and lands
a few feet away on the adjacent counter
still sitting walt readies then lunges for it  the wheels
on his chair roll with his momentum  and swats again with
his note pad whack the metal surface rings
as walt optimistically lifts up the pad and peers underneath
the fly buzzes past missed again
wide now thus begins a flystalking sequence walt follows
the fly and swats it at every spot it alights
gradually quickening his pace moving faster and faster
 walt soon grows heedless to everything but his pursuit
and his deepening vendetta in other words his chase amps
up as he follows this fly around the lab
thwack miss thwack miss thwack miss
eventually he comes to a stop breathing hard mad as hell

walt
bastard
he really wants to kill this pest to walt this insect is
an insult an affront and walt will defeat it

walt
sonofa 
one last missed swing  then his eyes follow the fly upwards
as it buzzes toward the ceiling

walt
damn it come on come on come
on

angle  we see it up there it has alighted on the ceiling
next to one of many bellshaped light fixtures 25 feet above
angle from above fly pov  walt stands small far below
breathing hard looking up his gaze fixed our way
walt does the only logical thing logical if you’re walter
white and determined to control one goddamned thing in your
miserable disintegrating life without taking his eyes off
the fly walt removes one of his wallabies taking careful
aim walt lobs the shoe straight up at us
the shoe hits us misses the fly and falls back uselessly to
the floor with a thud bounces a little
walt disappointed but resolute retrieves his shoe and tries
again windmilling it around underhanded once twice

walt
son of a bitch
angle from above as the shoe flies up toward us the brown
suede grenade soaring up up spinning closer closer
fly unharmed the shoe drops back with an egobruising thud
walt’s frustration is palpable he’s officially seething
with impotent rage that fucking fly it hasn’t moved
hasn’t even flinched it’s just sitting there mocking us
walt picks up his shoe third time’s the charm he can feel
it he hurls it hard with a grunt and 
 smash the light bulb in the nearby fixture shatters as
the shoe impacts it glass shards rain down on walt
he ducks and covers runs out of the way he’s unhurt
from his new vantage point walt looks up to see
the fixture swings back and forth back and forth and his
shoe is attached to it somehow the shoe lace or somesuch
has managed to get caught on the bottom of the fixture and
now the shoe dangles there stuck the fly it’s mia

walt
that’s great
walt shakes his head snorts calms down after a moment
maybe he even manages to chuckle a little what folly this
accident has shaken him loose of his fixation jarred some
sense into him he’s feeling a little foolish now what the
hell was i thinking time to stop this nonsense

alt grabs a broom from the cleaning cart with one shoe on
and one shoe off he walks with a slight limp walter white
definitely came out the loser in this battle ah well
he approaches the section of the floor where the broken glass
lies in a glittery mess gives it a couple of swift sweeps
wait a minute he’d better retrieve his dangling shoe first
for safety to avoid cutting his stocking foot
taking the broom he mounts the stairs and tromps up one
footfall clanging on the metal staircase one silent
on the catwalk walt leans against the railing and reaches
out and over it with the broom to try to knock his shoe free
he can’t quite reach it
ever tenacious he climbs over the railing to get a bit
closer bad idea  this can’t be wise walt holds onto the
railing with one hand leans waay out over the lab as he
wields the broom like a sword poke poke grunt poke
success the shoe dislodges and falls to the ground below
walt’s relieved we’re relieved and he’s kinda pleased
with himself good job just then out of nowhere
 the fly buzzes right past his face walt’s ire flares
even though he’s still on the outside of the railing he
takes a wild swing at the fly with the broom miss
the fly lands on the railing six feet away

walt
bastard
walt all concern for his safety all reason cast aside in
the face of this new taunt fixates on his tormentor he
winds back swings and smashes the broom down on the railing
clang the entire railing vibrates the momentum of his
swing plus the impact causes the broom to bounce up flinging
his arm ah
losing his grip and his balance walt flails and falls
crash walt hits a tall metal vessel on the way down it
breaks his fall but doesn’t stop it he bounces off
falling to the ground
 whump walt lands hard the broom clatters next to him
both lay silent oh shit is walt dead he doesn’t move for a moment but walt’s not hurt
well not seriously anyway getting his wind back and
groaning he rolls onto his back his eyeglasses are askew
walt’s pov  as the world returns to focus something dark
flits into his vision coming in for a landing on our lens
close on walt’s glasses the fly lands on one of his lenses
and sits there nonchalantly preening its legs
walt’s eyes widen then narrow unbelievable off this
insult to injury we

over black
chunkchunk up on
close  the time clock punches a card it reads 858am
int industrial laundry  morning
another morning at the laundromat the same expressionless
laundry employees waiting in line to punch their time cards
chunkchunk chunkchunk
we rack past them to the open laundry entrance where jesse is
pulling into his parking spot walt’s empty car is parked
nearby right where it was the day before
int tercel  morning  continuous
jesse kills the engine glancing over at the aztek looks
like eagerbeaver company man walt is already here great
but jesse’s in no hurry he’s made it clear big payday or
no this job ranks right up there with sushi and coal mining
no he’s gonna take his sweet time and finish his cigarette
after a puff maybe two he stubs out his smoke in the car’s
ashtray the tray is overflowing with butts and yet one
catches his eye he picks it up and examines the filter
close  red lipstick smudges from jane’s mouth her lips
from before
jesse sits here a moment a sad silence filling the car
then he simply carefully places her cigarette butt back
in the ashtray gets out of the car and heads inside
int industrial laundry  basement landing  morning
the small length of hallway outside the superlab entry door
jesse comes down the stairs from the laundry above he pulls
out his keys unlocks and pushes open the door  or at least
tries to the door opens a bit then closes shut huh
jesse peers through the lab door window trying to see what
could be blocking the entryway when he feels the hair atop
his head flutter like it would in a breeze

looks down at his pant legs they’re flapping from a
wind coming through the door cracks weird
jesse puts his shoulder to the door straining he’s finally
able to push it open and step out onto
i
nt superlab  morning  continuous
 the catwalk stumped he stands here looking around as

walt os
shut the door
here comes walt racing upstairs he’s in his clothes from
yesterday and has a small bandage on one side of his head

jesse
my ears are popping

walt
shut the door  
annoyed
move
walt pushes him aside and slams the door shut

jesse
it’s like i’m on an airplane yo
what the hell’s doing that

walt
positive pressure
as he mutters this walt kneels down and quickly restuffs
the rags and tyvek he’d positioned around the door cracks

jesse
positive what
fingers to his ears
ahh god this frickin’ kills yo

walt
just move your jaw around move it
around

jesse
i am moving it around alright
it’s not working

walt
jesus yawn or something stop
acting like such a baby

jesse finally gets his ears to “pop”

jesse
ah damn
then
whwhwhat “positive” “positive
what”
walt locks the door and double checks it

walt
pressure i’ve turned the
ventilation up to keep the outside
out
vague selfconscious
there’s uh been a contamination
note as we’ve hinted at earlier in the season and in act
one walt has ocd tendencies only now his “tendencies”
have blown up into an “obsession” this doesn’t mean walt is
delusional or “crazy” here he’s still himself  just
crankier more anxious more selfconscious and distracted
with that walt simply heads off back down the stairs

jesse
wait what
alarmed jesse hurries after him

jesse
whoa whoa whoa hold up

walt
something got into the lab
walt moves out onto the lab floor with jesse right behind

jesse
so uh what do we do i mean do
we  wait wait  i mean
shouldn’t we be wearing masks

walt
reluctant
no no it’s not thatthat kind of
contaminant

jesse
so it’s like not dangerous
needs way more facts
mr white talk to me here

walt
not to us particularly no
walt picks up a 3’ long thing made out of duct tape and
cellophane it looks like a halfassed cross between a sword
and a giant salad spoon with it in hand he squints up at
the ceiling jesse frowns at the duct tape thingie

jesse
what the hell is that

walt
again vague
this is uh i made it

jesse
 so exactly what kind of
contaminant are we dealing with
here
walt sighs he’s fully aware of how this is going to sound
to jesse but let’s just get it over with

walt
a fly
walt moves away searching the heavens jesse puzzles

jesse
what do you mean a fly like
like what do you mean

walt
i mean a fly a housefly
jesse stands here blinking trying to understand

jesse
like uh one fly singular
off walt’s nod
what’d it do

walt
it got into the lab and i’m
trying to get it out okay
understand
walt moves off again resuming his fly search

jesse
no man not really i can’t say
as i’m really following you here
now erupts
dude you scared the shit outta me

you say “contamination” i mean
i’m thinking like a like ebola
leak or something

walt
derisive
“ebola”

jesse
it’s a disease on the discovery
channel where all your intestines
just sorta slip right outta your
butt

walt
thank you i know what ebola is
now tell me  what would a west
african virus be doing in our lab
hmm

jesse
a perfect dry beat
so you’re chasing around a fly
and in your world i’m the idiot
walt rubs his eyes this is the exact reaction from jesse he
was dreading but maybe he can get the kid to understand

walt
jesse thisthis fly 
rephrasing
 any fly  cannot be in our lab
it’s it’s a problem it’s a
contamination and that is in no
way a misuse of the word okay
so in terms of keeping our cook
clean and our product
unadulterated we need to take
this very seriously now do you
understand
jesse looks down at walt’s cellophane sword thing

jesse
so is that your fly saber

walt
selfconscious
this is a swatter and it happens
to work quite well thank you

jesse
uhhuh
re his bandage

jesse contd
more
continued
hey uh what happened to youryour
head

walt
nothing i’m fine

jesse
you didn’t hit it
serious
like really really hard

walt
losing patience
my head is not the problem jesse
the fly is the problem

jesse
dead serious
you didn’t happen to maybe try our
product did you
walt scratches his neck this is like trying to teach jazz
to a chimp but again he checks his anger and explains

walt
jesse i know this seems unusual to
you a layman a fly i get it
seems insignificant right but
trust me in a highly controlled
environment such as this any
pollutant no matter how small
could completely
walt simply trails off as if he’d finished his thought then
walks to the finishing tank and looks around and above it
jesse stands here hanging bewildered

jesse
hello

walt
what
jesse finally takes in walt’s appearance the stubble the
redrimmed eyes the rumpled and familiar clothes

jesse
were you here all night
then
have you even slept

walt
jesse look i’m fine so why
don’t you just please focus on 

continued
beepbeepbeepbeepbeepbeepbeepbeepbeepbeep it’s the
timer attached to the giant mixcook vessel
walt steps over and turns it off time to assume control

walt
okay look we’re running late so
let’s just get started shall we
the sooner we do it the sooner
we’re done

jesse
mutters
frickin’ finally
note as we all know these super cooks take place over a
couple of days they’re about halfway through the process
here with 23 more significant steps remaining
jesse trudges a few feet to the storage shelves grabs a sack
of sodium hydroxide and crosses to the mixcook tank

walt
whoa whoa whoa whoa what are
you doing

jesse
re the sack
it’s time to alkaline

walt
have you not heard a word i said
no cooking until this fly is dealt
with
off jesse’s disbelief
have i been speaking to myself

jesse
the timer went off yo how long
is this batch gonna be good for
an hour two

walt
the batch will be good for nothing
if we don’t clear the contaminant

jesse
“clear the contaminant” we’re
making meth here alright not
space shuttles

walt
we’re making nothing until we catch
this fly

jesse
what fly alright where the hell
is this fly not like i even seen
this thing maybe your “positive
pressure” blew it out the door or
something

walt
no no it is here it is around
okay he’s around and i am not
going to expose this batch to the
open air and contamination
period now you can leave me to
deal with this myself or you can
help me but you’re right  we
are running out of time so i need
your answer right now
jesse’s baffled they’re gonna risk losing a fortune in
drugs over a fly still when it comes to walt he knows
the path of least resistance is almost always submission
jesse drops the sack let’s fucking get this over with

walt
okay

time cut to
int superlab  morning  later
one minute later five time seems to stand still down here
in this windowless prison walt moves slowly searching
everywhere deliberate and methodical over on the other
side of the facility jesse is dragging ass his newspaper
hanging limply from the end of his arm
jesse doesn’t give a flying fuck about this fly  provided
it’s still here or even exists in the first place he’s
worried about the cook they’re going to lose he’s keeping a
subtle eye on distant walt glancing at him as he moves in
and out of view across the way
jesse is bewildered and annoyed by his mentor to be sure
but add to that he’s growing more and more concerned about
walt’s state of mind
jesse checks his watch holds it up and taps it with a
finger for walt to see

jesse
hey ticktock yo

alt does his best to disregard this pressing fact as they
both slowly wander gradually circulating around the lab
jesse tries a different tack

jesse
look i like making cherry product
but let’s keep it real alright
we make poison for people who don’t
care alright we probably have
the most unpicky customers in the
world

walt
rallying
nonono no rationalizing
we’ll find it any minute don’t
give up
jesse watches as walt moves away something is definitely
sketchy with mr white today maybe it’s just your typical
nosleep jittery weirdness but strange
it’s now that jesse notices his little tour around the room
has brought him back to the mixcook tank he looks around
walt’s wandered off out of sight
screw this jesse tucks the crossword section in his back
pocket and begins to quickly unscrew the tank lid fastenings
we’re not sure there is anything like this but we want to
give jesse a bit of business before he can open the tank

jesse
covering conversational
did you uh did you know there’s
uh an acceptable level of rat
turds that can go into candy bars
that’s the government jack even
the government doesn’t care that
much about quality
the lid is unlatched jesse bends down reaching for the bag
of sodium hydroxide at his feet

jesse
know what is okay to put in hot
dogs huh pig lips and assholes
i say have at it bitches  ‘cause
i love hot dogs and uh you know
see what i’m  
suddenly like in a horror film walt appears looking at
jesse through a gap between vessels or somesuc

walt
what are you doing

jesse
regains his composure
oh hey lemme just top it off
alright really quick you know a
little sodium hydroxide shut the
lid  no harm done then we’re
golden
walt stares not blinking so jesse risks it he reaches
to lift the lid but the second he opens it a fraction of an
inch  walt reaches out and slams it shut again

walt
it stays closed that’s an order

jesse
you can’t “order” shit adolf
alright we’re 5050 partners
remember
jesse tries once more to open the vessel  and walt without
hesitation swings his swatter hard against jesse’s shoulder

jesse
owww gah  what is your problem
jesse grabs his shoulder that really hurt recovering
jesse rushes walt they grapple in typical awkward white boy
fashion finally jesse is able to shove walt back
jesse stands growling and rubbing his shoulder in pain

jesse
frickin’ psycho ahh

walt os
jesse

jesse
like hit bone

walt os
low insistent
jesse jesse
jesse glances at walt doubletakes his pissed expression
fades a little as he stands staring at
 the fly it has come to rest on walt’s bald head walt
stands frozen afraid to move terrified to lose it again

walt
mouth barely moving
you see it right you see it

jesse
yeah

walt
get it
for jesse this is one of those rare slowdawning moments
that’s just too good to be true sly yet deadpan

jesse
you want me to get it

walt
yes slow move slowly

jesse
i know i’m moving slowly yeah
absolutely i’m just gonna need
your “swatter” thing come on
oh yeah it’s okay come on
jesse slowly withdraws the big fly saber from walt’s hand

walt
make it count

jesse
yeah no no i’m gonna i’m gonna
make it count alright
jesse carefully raises it high yeah he’s enjoying this
walt eyes focused upward and standing motionless as a
statue is too preoccupied to notice

walt
okay now on three

jesse
okay

walt
onnne
bam on his own timetable jesse slams the big fly swatter
down on walt’s head

walt
owww motherff

continued

jesse
you like that hurts huh
after a second to recover his hand to his head walt checks
his palm for fly guts finds none scanning the floor

walt
did you get it 

jesse
not lying
i think so yeah
walt checks the swatter there’s no fly corpse no smudge
no insert needed here  our actor’s reaction will suffice

walt
where is it

jesse
i don’t know what’s it matter
who cares i got it
walt drops to his knees
ah jesus seriously

walt
where is it
they search walt on all fours jesse standing soon

jesse
it’s uh oh right there
look look
he points at a tiny dark brown splat that rests just under
the edge of the tank or perhaps in one of the nooks of a
sorbothane floormat in other words easy to miss

jesse
see i told you i got it
walt picks it up

walt
this is a raisin

jesse
look i definitely got it man
alright
bzzzz the fly passes just overhead right between them
walt slowburns the air leaks out of jesse as he truly did
think he killed it he stares after the fly


jesse
ah man
sheepish shrug
he’s got some skills yo i’ll
give him that
walt rubs his head with his hand trying to master his
emotions he rises to his feet faces jesse outwardly
quiet and calm yet hinting at the roiling anxiety within

walt
look i feel like i’m running out
of ways to explain this to you
but once more i will try this
fly is a major problem for us it
will ruin our batch and we need
to destroy it and every trace of it
so we can cook failing that
we’re dead there is no more room
for error not with these people
finally there’s a hint of true craziness here not much
just a tad right now it seems born of fear
for jesse this is where the penny drops mr white is not
just being overtired and douchey this morning jesse comes
to decide that the man has truly lost it
jesse considers him a beat nodding speaking nonchalantly

jesse
how ‘bout we go get some air

walt
“get some air” your answer to
“we’re sliding headfirst into a
massive crap”

jesse
mr white i understand that the
fly is a serious thing now
alright i’m onboard i’m just
saying you know maybe if we went
and got some air it would help us
come up with a plan on how to catch
it then come back down here and
subtract his ass
walt considers a beat then he sighs and nods giving in
jesse smiles relaxing a little this is good good sign
jesse holds out an arm offering “after you” he follows
walt as they both mount the spiral staircase and climb it to
the catwalk above

on the catwalk walt moves wearily he seems exhausted
as they reach the door he muscles it open against the breezy
airflow then pauses turning to jesse

walt
oh wait d’you have your keys

jesse
yeah

walt
you sure last thing we need is to
get locked out

jesse
yeah
true that goodnaturedly jesse fishes his keys from his
pocket and jingles them in two fingers  see all good
in a flash walt snatches the keys shoves jesse out the door
and locks him out looks like walt had a plan too

jesse didn’t see it coming before he can turn around and
push back  click  the door is latched tight he stands
here stunned peering at walt through the door’s tiny window

jesse
hey

walt
muffled through glass
if you’re not going to help stay
out of my way
walt turns and disappears off to battle the fly on his own

jesse
hey
jesse pounds the steel door a couple times futile what
now he’s not eager to lose an entire cook  but he’s also
god help him concerned for walt’s health
off jesse running up the stairs out of sight

int industrial laundry  morning
lots of steam and hot hissing equipment  women and men
work hard on the ironing side of this operation into frame
jogs nearfrantic jesse he heads for the nearest worker

jesse
yo does somebody got an axe i can
use
the worker glances at him blankly jesse opens up his
questioning to the group he mimes chopping with both hands
jesse
el axeo peligroso el axeo
more sheep stares great he looks around heads for

int maintenance room  morning  continuous

jesse jogs into this room no one in here  he’s currently
got the place to himself his pace slows as he notes tools
galore jackpot
he picks up a large ballpeen hammer tests its heft nice
but wait  a sledgehammer better hold on here’s a
crowbar that’ll come in handy he’s trying to figure out
the best way to carry all this heavy stuff when
 he notes a huge gray circuitbreaker box on a nearby
wall the sight of it pauses him he wanders closer
this thing is not the kind of deal you’d find on the side of
your house it is definitely heavyduty industrial size
with fat steel cable conduits about six inches in diameter off jesse wheels turning coming up with a better plan

int superlab  morning  continuous

extreme low angle up past walt as he moves through the lab
peering up into the bright lights high above no sign of the
fly right now but walt can hope
new angle suddenly almost as if taunting him bzzzzzz
the fly lands nearby low enough to reach
walt moves slowwwly pulse quickening fly saber gently
twitching as our hero closes on his prey

walt
there we go say goodnight
breaking bad 310 fly as broadcast 27
continued
aising the swatter over his head like a samurai walt is
ready to end this fucking thing but just as he swings 
 thunk the lights go out instantly this is followed by
an unseen crash as disoriented walt loses his balance

walt os
ahh bitch 
emergency lights click on they don’t do much down here 
but they allow us a few wall washes of murky eerie red glow
just enough
 to catch glimpses of walt in silhouette muttering
angrily knocking things over as he tries to find his way
around he stumbles and barks his shin 

walt os
son of a   dammit 
 before he finally gets to where he wants to be we hear
drawers thrown open and searched what’s he looking for
a flashlight  it clicks on illuminates his face briefly
casting him in a sort of “insane warlock” glow he doesn’t
exactly shine it under his chin however as that would be
too selfconsciously goofy
his bright flashlight beam dodging here and there around the
big lab and maybe we have just a hint of smoke in the air to
really make it stand out walt beelines for the spiral
staircase he hurries up it to the catwalk
he’s not heading for the exit instead he’s here to check
the electrical boxes which line the catwalk wall he wants
to fix the goddamned power and get back to the business of
killing flies but before he can examine these boxes
 there’s a taptap on the lab door jesse smiles in at us
through the little window he’s got light out there where he
is by the way his voice is muffled through the glass

jesse
need some juice maybe
walt gets it now and his face falls he’s been outfoxed
clever jesse  looks like he’s got walt over a barrel


three plastic shopping bags
get set down into frame with a heavy thunk reveal jesse
freshly returned from a whirlwind shopping trip

jesse
knock yourself out
we are
int superlab  break room  morning
a halfhour has passed since the end of act two walt
quickly digs through the bags hoping for something which may
prove useful with disdain he holds up a fly swatter

jesse
it’s a real one
walt snorts and tosses it aside jesse’s offended

jesse
yeah like yours was working
walt pulls out a can of bug spray he frowns at his partner
walt
no no no
off jesse
look we’re trying to decontaminate
you don’t
decontaminate by contaminating
further
jesse rolls his eyes  whatever man walt pulls out more
items bug bombs granular fly bait an ultraviolet trap
one by one he summarily tosses them aside

walt
what the hell is all this
jesse reaches into an untouched bag pulls out a “goldstick”
fly trap the kind that one hangs like an unfurled roll of
film he dangles it enticingly in front of walt

jesse
here how ‘bout this
walt takes it from him looks it over reading the label

continued

walt
nontoxic glue strips

jesse
yeah baby it’s got pheromones
dumps out a bagful
alright i bought a whole buttload
we can hang ‘em up all over the
place it won’t be able to resist
jesse’s selling it staying cheerful off walt considering

int superlab  morning

fifteen minutes later two dozen fly traps dangle around the
lab like so many nightmarish christmas ornaments
walt perches at the top of a ladder jesse stands below
hands up the last trap for walt to hang
walt does so all the while distractedly scanning for the
fly he’s exhausted we see the toll this is taking on him

walt
i sure hope we have enough
jesse glances at the ridiculous number of these trap things
we’re basically surrounded by them maybe it’s at this
point  for the line that follows  that we truly see how
many of these things there are

jesse
i’m gonna go out on a limb and say
uh yeah

walt
re the fly
do you see him
jesse shakes his head walt sighs and climbs down half to
himself as if not realizing he said this already
jesse studies walt worried for him trying not to show it

jesse
how long you think you’ve been
awake

walt
why do you keep asking me that


jesse
just figure you could use some
coffee is all i know i could
walks off glancing back
how ‘bout it
nice and nonchalant walt considers nods jesse crosses
the lab to gale’s sciencey coffee machine
new angle  jesse steps up to it taps off a couple mugs of
steaming java glancing over his shoulder to walt who
stands his ground preoccupied walt’s eyes cast around the
lab for his elusive enemy the fly
making the most of this moment not knowing how long it may
last jesse quickly pulls something from his jacket pocket

jesse
you take cream and sugar

walt
black’s fine

it’s a small bottle of overthecounter sleeping pills
quietly jesse unscrews it he pokes a thumbnail through the
protective foil he bought this on his recent shopping trip 
obviously this one purchase was the entire point of going
close on jesse’s hand as many pills pour into his palm too
many half the bottle jesse hurriedly tips some back where
they came from now he’s got about seven pills left in hand
jesse chews his lip a second agonizing too many too few
finally screw it lucky number seven he slips the pills
into walt’s coffee this is in no way nefarious it’s an
act of compassion jesse stirs the concoction with a spoon

jesse
why don’t you just uh leave him
be let the traps do the work
grabbing his own mug too so as not to seem suspicious jesse
crosses back to walt offering him his very “special” coffee
walt absently takes it

jesse
those pheromones are supposed to
kick ass i bet we catch this mofo
any second
walt can’t help but stay on the lookout jesse continues to
eye walt closely wanting to prompt him to drink up

but knowing better than to do that soon walt absently
takes a small sip no reaction to the taste so far so
good
walt takes another sip lets himself settle down a little
this is the first time he’s been truly static in hours he
can’t quite let himself relax however still watchful
jesse hangs nearby trying for nonchalance as he waits for
the pills to kick in makes conversation

jesse
you ever have like a wild animal
trapped in your house
often for walt jesse’s questions are simply so much annoying
background noise this one’s no different

walt
not that i can recall no

jesse
we did this one time back when
it was my aunt’s house back before
she died of cancer was a possum
big freaky looking bitch
then
hey since when did they change it
to “opossum” what’s up with
that when i was coming up it was
just “possum” “opossum” make it
sound like he’s irish or something
why they gotta go changing
everything whatever it’s just
big rats anyways  giant pinktailed
rats with their pink rat
faces totally freaky like alien
rats
walt heaves a heavy sigh burdened by everything including
jesse’s stupid story he sips keeps his eyes peeled
jesse keeps talking hoping walt will start to fade

jesse
and so it’s not so much that it
got trapped but he was living
there you know under the house
you could hear him going from
like room to room always uh
scurrying around down there
sometimes i’d see him outside at
night and it’d just yoow
freeze

and it’s like you’re not looking
right at it right i mean it
thinks it’s fooling you that’s
what they do  i mean they play
dead or whatever it’s just so so
lame

walt
mostly just weary
is there a discernible point to
this story a point that youyou’ll
be arriving at some time in
the near future
just so long as walt keeps drinking coffee jesse is happy 
no point getting the old bastard riled up he shrugs

jesse
it was just a total bitch to get
out took forever a guy came
set all these traps and all and
he he finally got him but my
aunt you know she didn’t
believe it i mean she kept
insisting she could still hear the
thing and you could not tell her
any different i mean she started
keeping an old umbrella you know
by her chair man she’d just
bang on the floor and yell at it
even gave it a name
remembers
scrabble that was it “scrabble
just knock it off” bangbangbang
reflecting
she got like that toward the end
got obsessive about stuff just got
mad about stuff we didn’t know
what was up it wasn’t like her
to uh be that way
jesse chews his lip considering he glances at walt

jesse
turned out that the um the
cancer had spread to her brain and
that was why it um
metastasized but it was good that
was when we decided to you know
take her to the doctor ‘cause then
we knew what was up you know got
her some treatment meds so she wouldn’t be stressing all
the time
the good news
it was a lot better after that
y’know she was a lot happier
a silent expectant pause jesse having made his point
either accidentally or by design watches walt hopeful he’ll
catch on
walt considers jesse’s words and more than that jesse’s
concern once more he looks to the ceiling to himself

walt
where the hell is he
leaving jesse and us to wonder if jesse’s sudden suspicion
is correct has walt’s cancer progressed is it the cause
of his strange behavior does walt even know
walt sips his coffee his back is to jesse who watches him
unsure what to say or do now in fact walt got the point
after all finally he answers jesse’s implied question

walt
i’ve been to my oncologist jesse
just last week
off jesse’s look
i’m still in remission i’m
healthy

jesse
okay so good great

walt
to himself
no end in sight

jesse
sensing something
that’s great
a beat walt is once more lost in troubling thoughts

walt
well i missed it
then
there was some perfect moment and
it passed me right by
jesse simply listens as it dawns on him where walt is headed
with this walt continues more or less thinking aloud


walt
ii had to have enough to leave
them that was the whole point
this doesn’t make any sense if i
didn’t have enough
a beat
but it had to be before she found
out skyler it had to be
before that
walt is forlorn exhausted not just from all those
sleepless nights nor even the sleeping pills but from
something deeper jesse thinks he recognizes it

jesse
“perfect moment” for what  to
drop dead
off walt’s silence
what you saying you wanna die

walt
not the same thing
i’m saying i’ve lived too long
a beat
you want them to actually miss you
you know you want their memories
of you to be
shakes his head
but she just won’t she just won’t
understand i mean no matter how
well i explain it these days she
just has this this
trails off then
i truly believe there exists some
combination of words there must
exist certain words in a certain
specific order that would explain
all of this but with her ii
just i just can’t ever seem to
find them
maybe the pills are allowing walt to let his guard down he
wouldn’t normally share this much with jesse  or anyone

jesse
mr white how about you just sit
down

walt
not hearing him
i was thinking maybe before the
fugue state but before the fugue
state i didn’t have enough money
so no not then

and uh plus my daughter wasn’t
born yet it had to be after holly
was born
jesse is hoping to coax walt off this morbid topic

jesse
mr white

walt
definitely before the surgery oh
christ that damn second cell
phone i mean how could i
possibly
jesse sympathetic and discomfited can’t stop this train
something dawns on walt now the answer hits him

walt
i know the moment
turning to jesse
it was the night jane died
this gets jesse’s attention he turns stares at walt

walt
i was at home andand we needed
diapers and so i said i’d go
but it was just an excuse
actually that was the night i
brought you your money remember

jesse
uncomfortable
yeah i remember

walt
but afterward i stopped at a bar
it was odd i never do that go
to a bar alone i just walked in
sat down
a beat realizes
i never told you

jesse
that you went to a bar

walt
ii sit down and this man this
stranger he engages me in
conversation he’s a complete
stranger
stares at him intently

walt contd

but he turns out to be jane’s
father donald margolis
it takes a second for jesse to compute this his eyes narrow
in confusion in wariness

jesse
what are you talking about

walt
nodding
of course i didn’t know it at the
time i mean he was just some guy
in a bar i just i didn’t put it
together until after the crash and
he was all over the news
jesse blinks can’t believe what he’s hearing

jesse
jane’s dad

walt
think of the odds once i tried to
calculate them but they’re
astronomical
intense driven
think of the odds of me going in
sitting down that night in that
bar next to that man

jesse
what did you talk about

walt
oh water on mars
then remembering
family

jesse
what about family
walt isn’t so far gone that he doesn’t get how important all
this is to jesse he studies jesse takes him seriously

walt
i told him that i had a daughter
and he told me that he had one
too
half to himself
and he said never give up on
family and i didn’t i took his


walt contd
continued
esse stares not sure what to say to this not sure if it’s
some figment of walt’s imagination it unsettles him
walt stands here haunted by his memories of that night
specifically of what happened after he left the bar

walt
the universe is random it’s not
inevitable it’s simple chaos
it’s subatomic particles in
endless aimless collision that’s
what science teaches us
then
but what is this saying what is
it telling us when on the very
night that this man’s daughter
dies
still quieter
 it’s me who’s having a drink
with him
to jesse truly asking
how can that be random
walt struggles with his heavy burden he’s managed to dance
them to the edge of a very dangerous precipice what will
happen if he gives in and tells jesse the truth about jane
just then walt falters a bit nearly losing his balance
the pills are kicking in jesse takes the mug from him he
stands by ready with a steadying hand

jesse
hey sit down
not fighting  walt simply shakes his head no he’s hanging
in there his thoughts come back full circle

walt
no that no no that was
the moment that night i should
never have left home never gone
to your house maybe things
woulda
he trails off not quite ready to completely spill his guts

walt
i was i was at home watching tv
some some nature program about
elephants skyler and holly were
in another room i could hear them
on the baby monitor she was
singing a lullaby
wistful
oh if i had just lived right up to
that moment and not one second
more
a faint bzzzz walt glances up at the fly not surprised to
see it oddly its appearance doesn’t throw him offsubject
for walt the fly seems of a piece with all of this

walt
 that would’ve been perfect

silence as walt and jesse each ponder that particular night
each absorbed in his own thoughts
the fly descends to alight nearby on top of a tall vessel
visible to walt and jesse

walt contd
ct four
we’re moving spinning banking climbing catching
brief glimpses of chrome floor electric light and two human
beings a kaleidoscope of shadow and light getting brighter
as we move faster and faster and then suddenly  stop
we orient ourselves revealing that we are

int superlab  morning

it’s mere seconds after the end of act three we’re on the
ceiling looking down upon walt and jesse who stand in the
middle of the lab looking up at us
we reverse  looking up low from the floor past walt and
jesse to the fly above the fly’s a dot on the high ductwork
an impossible twenty feet up may as well be on the moon

walt
he’s not coming down
walt steadies himself against a vat or tank or somesuch 
jesse’s sleep concoction is kicking in a little more now

jesse
must be thailandhot up there
that’s why he likes it
turns to walt
thailand’s hot right

walt
yeah

jesse
right that’s why
walt’s flagging all jesse has to do is sit tight and wait
for him to pass out but mr white’s been so fucked up and
sad today he kinda wants to do something for him

jesse
hey wait here

walt
he’s not coming down he’s staying
up there forever
staring at the man he considers a moment deep sigh ah
the hell with it jesse goes into action  glancing around
mcgyverlike he rolls over twin stainless steel carts

continued

walt
what’re you doing

jesse
whaddya think
determined
i’m gonna get that bitch
jesse grabs the nearby ladder walt was using in act three
arranging the rolling carts beneath the spot on the ductwork
where the fly is lounging he stacks the aframe ladder atop
the tall carts one leg balanced on each looks dangerous
actually it looks really goddamned dangerous as jesse
carefully climbs it walt frowns concerned

walt
no you’re gonna break your neck

jesse
yeah yeah
walt’s long fly saber is clenched in jesse’s teeth as he
climbs the higher he gets the wobblier this whole
arrangement becomes maybe it even rolls on its cart wheels
a little walt quickly steps over to steady it

walt
seriously  you’re this is a
bad idea
high above jesse is nervous but going for it on the third
step from the top he’s nosebleedhigh and yet
 whiifff  the fly is several feet out of reach

jesse
dammit
walt softens as he watches jesse way up there taking on the
fly for him risking his neck all in all he’s a good kid
jesse deserves the truth

walt
jesse

jesse
just hold onto it hold it still
jesse carefully climbs one more step now he’s precariously
balanced on the last step from the ladder’s very top
and down below walt wants to come clean

continued

walt
jesse
jesse swings  whifff closer but no cigar

walt
i’m sorry

jesse
sorry for what being a lunatic
jesse stretches farther swinging high tiptoed and
overhanded like a tennis serve closer still but whifff

walt
i’m sorry about jane
jesse pauses glances down at him then his eyes return to
the task at hand

jesse
yeah me too

walt
meaningful
i mean i i’m very sorry
even if jesse kills him over it

jesse
it’s not your fault
then
it’s not mine neither it’s no
one’s fault not even hers
fuck it jesse carefully mounts the ladder’s very top
step raising his long flyswatter slowly gingerly
whiff inches away maybe if he stretches a bit further
walt stares up at him barely breathing  for more reasons
than one he so wants to believe what jesse just told him

jesse
we are who we are mr white you
know two junkies with a duffel bag
fulla cash like you said we both
woulda been dead within a week
walt reacts  like i said he can scarcely believe jesse
remembers that that he actually takes stock in it
looking up still fixated on that fly just out of reach


jesse
softly to himself
i miss her though god i do
down below jesse’s words have shifted something inside walt
cleared his mind jesse hasn’t unwittingly absolved walt
of guilt here  not even close but it’s enough of a
reprieve enough of a mercy to shake him loose a little

walt
fading fast
jesse come down

jesse
i’m so close

walt
let it go we need to cook
jesse turns and looks down at walt nonplussed

jesse
what about contamination
walt steps a few feet away slumps into a nearby lab chair

walt
it’s all contaminated
jesse rolls his eyes shrugs great let’s cook he tosses
away his fly saber starts to carefully make his way down the
ladder

jesse
alright definitely scared him
he’ll probably stay out of the
way
but now  the fly lands on the ladder right in front of
jesse’s face shit he tossed away the swatter idiot
but he remembers the crossword he slowly reaches in his
back pocket pulls out the newspaper lifts his arm and
 thwack his swing nearly topples the ladder but he
steadies himself and then

jesse
yeah 
his pov as the fly plummets in heroic slow motion like king
kong falling off the empire state building falling down
down to the floor

continued
or honestly if this shot as described is impossible to
execute  then simply jesse’s pov of the alreadydead fly
lying on the floor below maybe giving us one last twitch

jesse
oh zzzzzap somebody got got
yo you see that mister
jesse looks over noticing something now his grin fades a
little soon replaced by a deeper form of satisfaction
walt missed it he is slumped in his chair fast asleep
finally off jesse silently pleased

int superlab  morning  moments later
low and close on chair wheels rolling
jesse pulls walt towards the break room by his ankles
rickshaw driverstyle


int superlab  break room  continuous
jesse moves deadweight walt onto the couch it’s a bit of a
struggle but he works gently and manages he covers walt
with his jacket sweet
time to make the donuts jesse flips off the lights in the
break room letting walt sleep
 as jesse walks into bg he dons heavy rubber gloves
off him opening up the mixcook tank and pouring in the
sodium hydroxide thus continuing the cook

ext industrial laundry  day  many hours later

out of blackness searing bright sun fills frame we’re
walking out of the laundry building glancing heavenward
squinting into the afternoon sunlight we’re in the pov of
walt who is heading for his aztek jesse walks alongside
heads for his tercel it’s the end of one long and
nightmarish shift  yet walt is looking better than when we
last saw him sleep helped
in fact currently jesse looks more tired than walt walt
can’t help but ask probably for the third or fourth time

walt
bins are packed

continued

jesse
nodding stays patient
bins are packed

walt
how’s the yield

jesse
twoohtwo and change you okay
getting home

walt
yeah better
then
thanks

jesse
nods it’s cool
mañana then
pokerfaced jesse fires up his afterwork cigarette as walt
climbs in his aztek for a moment walt just sits here
mulling something over he rolls down his window and
gestures to jesse come here

walt
jesse come here
jesse sidles over walt isn’t angry he’s concerned

walt
i couldn’t chance saying it inside
for all i know the lab’s wired for
sound
off jesse’s frown
that half a pound i said we’re off
by now i’m not accusing you
but if you understand
jesse’s face hardens walt hesitates quietly presses on

walt
 and if they ever found out
jesse simply stares at walt stonefaced defiant

jesse
i didn’t take shit
walt
stares now knows he did
i’m just saying that i won’t be
able to protect you

continued


jesse
who’s asking you to

the sweet jesse of earlier is gone walt finally gives in
lets it slide a problem for another day a big problem
walt starts his car and drives away off the inscrutable
hardassed “new” jesse of season three watching him go
int walt’s condo  bedroom  night
late at night same as before red phantom eye of the smoke
detector still blinking only now walt is sleeping
peacefully his demons banished back into his subconscious
for the moment at least for this short moment it’s quiet
only the sound of walt’s measured breathing until
 out of nowhere as if prodded by nightmares he awakens
with a start he lies here staring up into the dark
listening as wait for it bzzzz another fly
it lands above us on the blinking detector sits there
off walt silently staring up at it
