verse 1
i couldnt give a damn what you said to me
i dont really care what you think of me

theres nothing you could say that would hurt me
im better off without you anyway
i thought it would be hard but im okay
i dont need you if youre gonna be that way
cause with me its all or nothing

i found myself again
thats why youre gone
