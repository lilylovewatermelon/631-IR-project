just one more moment thats all thats needed
like wounded soldiers in need of healing
time to be honest this time im pleading
please dont dwell on it cause i didnt mean it
i can’t believe i said id lay our love on the ground
but it doesnt matter cause ive made it up forgive me now
every day i spend away my souls inside out
gotta be some way that i can make it up to you now somehow

chorus
by now youd know that id come for you
no one but you yes id come for you
but only if you told me to
and id fight for you
id lie its true
give my life for you
you know id always come for you

verse 2
i was blindfolded but now im seeing
my mind was closing now im believing
i finally know just what it means to let someone in
to see the side of me that no one does or ever will
so if youre ever lost and find yourself all alone
id search forever just to bring you home
here and now this i vow

by now youd know that id come for you
no one but you yes id come for you
but only if you told me to
and id fight for you
id lie its true
give my life for you
you know id always come for you
you know id always come for you

postchorus
no matter what gets in my way
as long as theres still life in me
no matter what remember you know ill always come for you

bridge
yes id come for you no one but you
yes id come for you
but only if you told me to
and id fight for you
id lie its true
give my life for you
you know id always come for you

outro
no matter what gets in my way
as long as theres still life in me
no matter what remember you know ill always come for you
id crawl across this world for you
do anything you want me to
no matter what remember you know ill always come for you
you know ill always come for you4embed"
