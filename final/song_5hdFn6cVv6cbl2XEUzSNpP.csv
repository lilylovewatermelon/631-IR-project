should i offer up my hand and save a wish for once
for all of us
and should i offer up my hand and lay the guilt on myself
so it’s easier to not stay to not stay

chorus
cause i found you in your corner
i pulled you out of the clouds
you left in such a hurry
your face is lost in the crowd

verse 2
should i open up my eyes or just ignore who you are
and what you could have been
and should i open up my eyes and make believe you will change
so it’s easier to not stay to not stay

chorus
cause i found you in your corner
i pulled you out of the clouds
you left in such a hurry
your face is lost in the crowd

cause i found you in your corner
i pulled you out of the clouds
you left in such a hurry
your face got lost in the crowd

chorus
‘cause i found you in your corner
i pulled you out of the clouds
you left in such a hurry
your face is lost in the crowd

your face is lost in the crowdembed"
