i think i found a fear of mine
that you might love for no reason
you know i worry
only luck brought me to you
im half awake most of the time
its just the timing of the seasons
so you know i worry
that youre all i have to lose

chorus
and i should change this way of thinking
that all my fears are facts of life
but i could die tomorrow
youd be close behind

postchorus
ohohohoh ohohohohoh
close behind

verse 2
i live my life in years to come
to prepare myself for sorrow
so i wont worry
when i crumble at your feet
its something sinister to love
without regard for dear tomorrow
to search for worry
is to love without deceit

and i should change this way of thinking
that all my fears are facts of life
but i could die tomorrow
youd be close behind

outro
so i fill my days with thinking
though im years from my true time
i could die tomorrow
youd be close behind
