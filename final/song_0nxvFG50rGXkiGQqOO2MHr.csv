across the ocean across the sea
starting to forget the way you look at me now
over the mountains across the sky
need to see your face i need to look in your eyes
through the storm and through the clouds
bumps in the road and upside down now
i know its hard to be asleep at night

chorus 1
dont you worry cause everythings gonna be alright
be alright
through the sorrow and the fights
dont you worry cause everythings gonna be alright
be alright

verse 2
all alone in my room
waiting for your phone call to come soon
for you oh i would walk a thousand miles
to be in your arms holding my heart
oh i oh i i love you

chorus
and everythings gonna be alright
be alright
through the long nights and the bright lights
dont you worry cause everythings gonna be alright
be alright

chorus
cause everythings gonna be alright

through the sorrow and the fights
dont you worry cause everythings gonna be alright

through the sorrow and the fights
