smile when youre sleeping
wonder who youre dreaming of
oh cause i could just see you with wine on your tshirt
and somebody else on your arm
cant control this feeling
wonder who youre dreaming of
after all of these nights laying right by your side
how could my brain make me feel so far

maybe its a case of paranoia
nervous that ill never really know ya
what do i feel who do i trust
maybe its real or maybe im just

breakdown

verse 2
never felt so naked
lookin at you naked
got your hands down the back of my soul
and the more that i show you the more im afraid
that youre going to wake up
and realize im not the one
that you thought i was that i thought i was
am i who i am who am i
