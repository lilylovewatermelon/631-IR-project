been trying for all my life but i cant add up your subtraction
work eat play then go to sleep that wont get me no satisfaction
gotta find a way out yeah a way out of this mess
so sick of trying to make my time last and ending up with less

verse 2
know your way of doing things and it lost its attraction
why settle for twenty four when i can have a hundred fractions
who knew id be the one pulling off that perfect crime
so heres my new line ill change your mind and the metric system in time

verse 3
caused trouble all over the town and its bound to start a reaction
metric time will come around its gonna overtake your contraction
ive found a way out yeah a way out of this stress
i made my time last and its total success

verse 4
got my way of doing things and its bound to gain your attraction
hundred hours is my supply its gonna give us all satisfaction
no doubt id be the one pulling off the perfect crime
so heres my new line ill change my mind and the metric system in timesee the hives liveget tickets as low as 66you might also likeembed"
