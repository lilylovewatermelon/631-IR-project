i said oh my what a marvelous tune
it was the best night never would forget how he moved
the whole place was dressed to the nines
and we were dancin dancin
like were made of starlight
like were made of starlight

verse 1
i met bobby on the boardwalk summer of 45
picks me up late one night out the window
we were seventeen and crazy runnin wild wild
cant remember what song it was playin whеn we walked in
the night wе snuck into a yacht club party
pretendin to be a duchess and a prince

chorus
and i said oh my what a marvelous tune
it was the best night never would forget how he moved
the whole place was dressed to the nines
and we were dancin dancin
like were made of starlight starlight
like were made of starlight starlight

verse 2
he said look at you worrying too much about things you cant change
youll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinkin that way
he was tryin to skip rocks on the ocean saying to me
dont you see the starlight starlight
dont you dream impossible things
