i dont know if its mexico
or down the road to the texaco
your headin to i aint got no clue
but you raced off like a palamino
in that candy apple el camino
never said goodbye two faidin tail lights
dissapearin down that interstate
if this lonely cowboy could have his way

chorus
youd put that thing in reverse
cowgirl come on home
take that uturn
cause i dont wanna be alone
i got this missin you condition
hate that were in this position
if you back it up we could make things work
so put that thing in reverse
cowgirl

verse 2
since you left ive been goin through hell
dosidoein all by myself

but theres one thing that i could promisе you
youd be seein me from a different point of view

if youd put that thing in reverse
cowgirl come on home
take that uturn
cause i dont wanna be alone

if you back it up we could make things work
so put that thing in reverse
cowgirl

cowgirl come on home
take that uturn
cause i dont wanna be alone
