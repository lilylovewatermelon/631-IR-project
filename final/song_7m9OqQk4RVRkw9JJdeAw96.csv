i know you so well so well
i mean i can do anything that he can
ive been pretty—

bridge xxxtentacion  shiloh dynasty
i know youre somewhere somewhere
ive been trapped in my mind girl just holding on
i dont wanna pretend were something were nothing
ive been stuck thinking bout her i cant hold on
ive been pretty—

verse xxxtentacion
im in pain wanna put ten shots in my brain
ive been trippin bout some things cant change
suicidal same time im tame
picture this in bed get a phone call
girl that you fucked with killed herself
that was this summer when nobody helped
and ever since then man i hate myself
wanna fuckin end it pessimistic
all wanna see me with no pot to piss in
but niggas been excited bout the grave im diggin
havin conversations bout my haste decisions
fuckin sickenin at the same time
memories surface through the grapevine
bout my uncle playin with a slip knot
posttraumatic stress got me fucked up
been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up

ill be feelin pain ill be feelin pain just to hold on
and i dont feel the same im so numb
ill be feelin pain ill be feelin pain just to hold on
and i dont feel the same im so numb
outro shiloh dynasty
i know you so well i know you well
i mean i can do anything
i can do he can
ive been pretty—
i know you so well812embed"
