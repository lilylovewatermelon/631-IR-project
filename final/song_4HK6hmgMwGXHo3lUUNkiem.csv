verse 1
if i could tear down these walls that keep you and i apart
i know i could claim your heart and our perfect love will start
but girl you just wont approve of the things that i do
when all i do is for you but still you say it aint cool

prechorus
if theres somebody else he cant love you like me
and he and he says hell treat you well he cant treat you like me
and hes buying diamonds and pearls he cant do it like me
and hes taking you all across the world he cant trick you like me
