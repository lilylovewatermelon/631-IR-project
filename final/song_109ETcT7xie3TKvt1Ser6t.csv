yeah they call me mr saturday night
mr always in mr never missed a good time
yeah i smoke and drink smile and wink
and make em think im fine
they dont know how much i missed her saturday night

verse 1
they think im the life of this whole bar
but if she walked in my act would fall apart
so i buy a round and shut it down and never leave alone
but when sunday comes they get up they go

chorus
thats why they call me mr saturday night
mr always in mr never missed a good time
i hear them say im just a bad guy
but theyve only seen mе in a neon light
yeah i smoke and drink smilе and wink
and make em think im fine
they dont know how much i missed her saturday night

verse 2
there was a time when i had everything
the kind of beautiful you only see in your dreams
but i messed it up and im the only one to blame
i guess losin her is how i earned my name
