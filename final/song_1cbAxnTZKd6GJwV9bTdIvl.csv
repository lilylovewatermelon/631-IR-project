in the fields granddaddy tilled and all my seeds are sown
aint no love for a poor dirt farmer genuine son of the south
and the waters high and the bills are too and the levy tumbling down

daddy owed the banker man
so we was drowning before the flood
that river washed us all away
left us right here in the mud
yeah in the mud

we built this house upon the mississippi back in 1879
over a hundred years my familys been here barely scraping by
we just some good old country folks just trying to weather the storm
how we gonna pay when the interest rates done got higher than the corn

aint no man gonna take it away
cause its deep down in my blood
step across that old property line
and youll die
right here in the mud
yeah in the mud

whos this creeping through the sticks
let me talk at em with my thirty ought six
a couple city guys with suits and ties
bet they cant feel this crosshair right between their eyes
see whiskey myers liveget tickets as low as 56you might also likei got no place to go and no place to run
just a dirt farmers boy with his granddaddys gun
step across that line im gonna tell you son
were all gonna die right here in the mud
yeah in the mud1embed"
