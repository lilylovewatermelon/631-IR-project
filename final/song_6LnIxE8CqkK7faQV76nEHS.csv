i was out taking shots
throwing down at the spot
three sheets just me and the guys
every single saturday night
i was killing time crushing cans
trying not to catch a tan
cause i was under them neon lights
every single saturday night yeah
everybody knew they could find me there
and right out of the blue right out of nowhere
out of nowhere

chorus
sittin’ over in the corner baby i saw
pretty red lips working on a white claw
shaking to a little shook me all night long
and i thought man what a beautiful sight
aint a mornin you don’t wake up in my shirt now
even holding hands walkin out of church now
whod of thought baby looking back that
that would be my last single saturday night
yeah
my last single saturday night

verse 2
and now when im out havin a drink or two
if they see me uh well they see you
