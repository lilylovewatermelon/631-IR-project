you hit me once
i hit you back
you gave a kick
i gave a slap
you smashed a plate
over my head
then i set fire to our bed

chorus 1
you hit me once
i hit you back
you gave a kick
i gave a slap
you smashed a plate
over my head

verse 1
my black eye casts no shadow
your red eye sees no blame
your slaps dont stick
your kicks dont hit
so we remain the same

chorus 2
blood sticks sweat drips
break the lock if it dont fit
a kick in the teeth is good for some
a kiss with a fist is better than none
whoa a kiss with a fist is better than none

you broke my leg in return
so lets sit back and watch the bed burn

a kiss with a fist is better than none
whoa a kiss with a fist is better than none
