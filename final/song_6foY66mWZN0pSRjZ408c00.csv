poor me pour me another drink
cause i dont wanna feel a thing
no more hell nah
i just wanna sip til the pain wears off
poor me pour me another round
line em up and knock em down
two more lets go
cause i aint never hurt like this before

prechorus
dont wanna think about her
or wear a ring without her
dont wanna hit the karaoke bar
cant sing without her
so make them drinks strong
cause brother shes gone
and if im ever gonna move on

chorus
ima need some whiskey glasses
cause i dont wanna see the truth
shes probably making out on the couch right now
with someone new
yeah ima need some whiskey glasses
if im gonna make it through
if ima be single
ima need a double shot of that heartbreak proof
and see the world through whiskey glasses
aint nothing else to do but sip around the truth
and see the world through whiskey glasses
i need a better view where i dont drink to you
