oh my drunken southern star
how you tried to hide in darkness
slipped from orbit
now you’re dangerously close

verse 2
come out come out
from all your hiding out
we’ll dig in our heels
salute the battlefields
where our broken hearts were born oh

chorus
and the storm clouds are thirsty
i can see them bursting watch them gathering light
and the walls in the bedroom now are pounding out
were we broken open baby maybe just a crack
swore i heard you whisper that you preferred us like that oh

verse 3
my broken open child
were we thirsty thorned with wild eyes
still we are slaves to the sirens of the salty sea
oh oh oh ohsee gregory alan isakov liveget tickets as low as 40you might also like1embed"
