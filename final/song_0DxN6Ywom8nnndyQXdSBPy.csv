eyes are feeling heavy but they never seem to close
the fan blades on the ceiling spin but the air is never cold
and even though you are next to me i still feel so alone
i just cant give you anything for you to call your own

chorus 1
and i can feel you breathing
and its keeping me awake
can you feel it beating
my hearts sinking like a weight

verse 2
something ive been keeping locked away behind my lips
i can feel it breaking free with each and every kiss
i couldnt bear to hurt you but its all so different now
things that i was sure of they have filled me up with doubt

chorus 2
and i can feel you breathing
and its keeping me awake
can you feel it beating
my hearts sinking like a weight
i can feel you breathing
its keeping me awake
could you stop my heart its always beating
sinking like a weight

how am i supposed to feel about the things ive done
i dont know if i should stay or turn around and run
i know that i hurt you things will never be the same
the only love i ever knew i threw it all away

chorus 2
and i can feel you breathing
and its keeping me awake
can you feel it beating
my hearts sinking like a weight
i can feel you breathing
its keeping me awake
could you stop my heart its always beating
sinking like a weight6embed"
