momma said god took his time when he made me
i put my pride to the side off safety
im on a diet on a diet from the fake beef
cause in my eyes all that i see is dead meat
momma said god took his time when he made me
i put my pride to the side off safety
im on a diet on a diet from the fake beef
cause in my eyes all that i see is dead meat
momma said god took his time when he made me yeah
god took his time when he made me
i put my pride to the side off safety
and look alive look alive

verse 1
smoke one ready to po one tote one scared of no one
you never know when your close ones is a pussy til your nose run
bickin back bein bool trigger happiest goons
bigger mansion and pool i need a map for this room
dont need a casket to view em you can leave the rats in the sewers
im speedin past in the newest soft top like the jewish
thrasher sweatshirt vans on all the bitches hands on
fucked your bitch for a sams card a sim card and an android
shots all in the airway bullets make em do ballet
pullin triggers like hairspray shoot em in the head bad hair day
in broad day like lets play lil kids playin jump rope
leave his body on the front porch its a cold world but the sun show
where the paper and the drugs though at your neighbor with the snubnose
i be seen with the unseen you be seen with the unknowns
all your bitches in the done zone all my bitches in the fun zone
swallowin all my unborns say it taste like a love song
in the cut like a cutworm keep it cool keep the cup warm
rumbumbumbumbum if they come for em i tell em
see lil wayne liveget tickets as low as 84you might also likechorus
god took his time when he made me
got my pride to the side off safety
on a diet on a diet from the fake beef
cause in my eyes all that i see is dead meat
momma said god took his time when he made me
pride to the side off safety
on a diet on a diet from the fake beef
cause in my eyes all that i see is dead meat
momma said god took his time when he made me
god took his time when he made me

verse 2
sorry boys bar is closin where we goin for breakfast
put pressure on the precious and put extra on the extras
extra ready for my presents extra sexy but she selfish
just want me to see selfies of the pelvis overwhelmin
talkin money over salmon in italian in australia
fuck it even have some salad im just valuin the value
wake up and smell the azaleas sang her prayers like mahalia
i just dont know what to tell ya but hell yeah hell yeah hell yeah
devil lies jumpin at ya comin from whats comin at ya
i come from where they come at ya in a way you cant come back from
i attack from every crack while you been chillin i been active
i been still inside the action you been actin
i been buildin you been blabbin you been bickerin i been blackin
i been sippin like the dracula i been feelin like galactus
got a million in the mattress a gazillion in the pantry
if you dont know im the answer you should kill who you been askin
chorus
momma said god took his time when he made me
i put my pride to the side off safety
im on a diet on a diet from the fake beef
cause in my eyes all that i see is dead meat
momma said god took his time when he made me
pride to the side off safety
on a diet on a diet from the fake beef
cause in my eyes all that i see is dead meat
momma said god took his time when he made me
god took his time when he made me
pride to the side off safety
