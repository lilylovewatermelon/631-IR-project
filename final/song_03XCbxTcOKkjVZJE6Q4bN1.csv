i spent a summer down south
working for the county trying to save for school
i blew it all like a damn fool on women and beer
i didnt have the grades
but i had myself a major league fastball
got a call from the minor leagues in wichita
and blew out my arm the first year haha yeah

verse 2
well i took a good look at my life
and decided id make a change
booked me a flight on an airplane
i was third world peace corps bound
but i met me a stewardess waiting right there
in the airport bar before i knew it i was in her car
and never turned around

chorus
well maybe im reckless maybe bad luck
hell maybe im way too much about having fun
ill send you a postcard send me your love
just dont give up on me yet im still growing up

verse 3
i went to work for my uncle on the coast
at a club called the hot spot
we took our breaks on the boat docks
and i got fired for smoking pot
with the beach right there
i guess surfing was the logical next move
but i got mouthy with the wrong dude
and got my damn jaw tattooed
see kip moore liveget tickets as low as 49you might also likechorus
well maybe im reckless maybe bad luck
hell maybe im way too much about having fun
ill send you a postcard send me your love
just dont give up on me yet im still growing up
all right

verse 4
i bought an old guitar
with cash from a good hand of blackjack
learned a few chords from a fatback
hairy man named pete
i got a local gig on the weekends
in some old honkytonk
singing two hours of nothing but cash songs
and i could always drink for free

verse 5
and some socalled bigwig producer man
started sniffing around
he told me he liked my sound
but there was something holding me back
he said a rhinestone suit and a cowboy hat outta do the trick
i told him i had something he could stick way on up his ass

chorus
well maybe im reckless maybe bad luck
hell maybe im way too much about having fun
ill send you a postcard send me your love
just dont give up on me yet im still growing up
ill send you a postcard send me your love
just dont give up on me yet im still growing up
all right
outro
but dont give up on me yet
i know i might take a little time
but im gonna come around
i just feel like ive still got a few things
i gotta get out of my systemembed"
