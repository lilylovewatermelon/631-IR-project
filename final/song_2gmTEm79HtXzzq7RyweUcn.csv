a cup of coffee from a waitress i aint ever met
she asked are you just passing through
i smiled and said i dont know yet
i walked around the town square
down the street to where
i met the preacher and the old courthouse man
yeah nothing helps you start again like

chorus
old boots new dirt no reminders
ive got a feeling this town will get me over her
youve been through what ive been through man
nothing feels better than old boots new dirt

verse 2
theres a thousand faces that i aint seen before
the only history that i can see is from the civil war
its good for me to look around look around
go down roads she aint been down aint been down
no memories of our used to bes set me free

chorus

ive got a feeling this town will get me over her
