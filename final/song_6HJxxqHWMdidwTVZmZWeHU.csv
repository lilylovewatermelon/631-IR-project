i listened to the cure
i listened to the cure
i listened to the cure and then i cried
i watched videodrome
i watched videodrome
i watched videodrome and lost my mind
i tried to write a song
i tried to write a song
i tried to write a song i think youd like
but no one gives a shit
no one gives a shit
no one gives a shit about my life

chorus
til i die
til i die
its diy
its diy

verse 2
i have nightmares
i have nightmares
i have nightmares all the time
so i stay awake
so i stay awake
so i stay awake all night
i say im gonna leave
i say im gonna leave
i say im gonna leave
but i think youre right
im gonna stay right here
im gonna stay right here
im gonna stay right here until i die
