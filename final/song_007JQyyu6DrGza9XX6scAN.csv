i made a wreck out of my hand
i put it through the wall
i made a fist and not a plan
call me a reckless wrecking ball
i throw my plates against the wall
and give it all i got
i aim to break not one but all
im just a big ol wrecking ball

chorus
i am unruly in the stands
i am a rock on top of the sand
i am a fist amidst the hands
and i break it just because i can

verse 2
it takes a dedicated hand
to put it through the wall
you gotta wanna break the heart
of all those pretty porcelain dolls
you gotta wanna be the drummer in the band
you gotta wanna be a battering ram
you gotta see the artistry
in tearing the place apart with me baby
