ive been through ten high schools
they start to get blurry
no point planting roots
cause youre gone in a hurry
my dad keeps two suitcases packed in the den
so its only a matter of when
i dont learn the names
dont bother with faces
all i can trust is this concrete oasis
seems every time im about to despair
theres a 7eleven right there
each store is the same
from las vegas to boston
linoleum aisles that i love
to get lost in
i pray at my altar of slush
yeah i live for that sweet frozen rush
freeze your brain
suck on that straw
get lost in the pain
happiness comes
when everything numbs
who needs cocaine
freeze your brain
freeze your brain

care for a hit

does your mommy know you eat all that crap

not anymore

sung
when mom was alive
we lived halfway normal
but now its just me and my dad
were less formal
i learned to cook pasta
i learned to pay rent
learned the world
doesnt owe you a cent
youre planning your future
veronica sawyer
youll go to some college
and marry a lawyer
but the skys gonna hurt
when it falls
so you better start
building some walls
freeze your brain
swim in the ice
get lost in the pain
shut your eyes tight
till you vanish from sight
let nothing remain
freeze your brain
shatter your skull
fight pain with more pain
forget who you are
unburden your load
forget in six weeks
youll be back on the road
when the voice in your head
says youre better off dead
dont open a vein

just freeze your brain
freeze your brain
go on and freeze your brain
