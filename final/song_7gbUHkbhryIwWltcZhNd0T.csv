i lost my tears in your car
i lost my will in your candlelit eyes
and all my love in your yard

baby would you leave me if you knew that i was making it up
and underneath the love you got to wonder am i giving you up

no way am i
it goes on

violent is the motion in my heart and in my body and mind
and silent is the feeling that i lost but im determined to find
and love is but an ocean unrealistic notion
but i cling to her devotion and i let it pull me down to the floor

it goes on on on on
it goes on on on on
it goes on on on on
it goes on on on

i found my will in your car
i caught my tears in your arms
i found my self on that poor county drive
and found my love in your yard

and underneath the love you got to wonder am i giving you up

no way am i

it goes on on on on
it goes on on on on
it goes on on on on
it goes on on on

it goes on on onembed"
