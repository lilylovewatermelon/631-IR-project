in case you dont understand imma make it understood again
king of the underground my gangsta will never fail

rat bitch recognize that your cheese aint finna sell
think im finna break some bread with the feds you dumb as hell
i been around the block before sold it all from rock to blow
and i dont fuck around when the feds in town i got to go
respect my mind cause im a trill oldschooler
summer time get too hot i wait for winter when its cooler
ugk for life free the pimp you know the deal
in pat its trap or die and we aint down for gettin killed

reup on the first then again on the fifth yeeahh
we trap or die nigga chea oh we trap or die nigga
and these hoes love a nigga cause they know that we the truth
got the chevy same color tropicana orange juice yeeahh
we trap or die nigga chea oh we trap or die niggaembed"
