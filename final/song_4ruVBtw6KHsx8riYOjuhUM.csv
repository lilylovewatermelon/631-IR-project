headed out west on a south texas highway
well i left her crying in the parking lot
yeah well she left me but i still had it my way
knowing damn well that we never had a shot

chorus
shed say go to hell id say ill send you a postcard
telling you im sorry for what ive done
i guess i could of loved her for the most part
now i think its about time to cut and run
cut and run time to cut and run

verse
guess i was way to wild compared to boys shes been around
trying to keep up with the ones she couldnt catch
cause im still a rambling man and i do the best i can
to try and settle down but that scares me half to death

chorus
shed say go to hell id say ill send you a postcard
telling you im sorry for what ive done
i guess i could of loved her for the most part
now i think its about time to cut and run
cut and run time to cut and run

verse
well maybe she was the one maybe i jumped the gun
but im up and gone i aint turning back around
shell find a better man who dont break hearts the way i can
if she could say one thing to me i know how itd sound

chorus
shed say go to hell id say ill send you a postcard
telling you im sorry for what ive done
i guess i could of loved her for the most part
now i think its about time to cut and run

shed say go to hell id say ill send you a postcard
cause i know she loved it when i made her mad
i guess i couldve loved her for the most part
now that i think about it i guess its kind of sadembed"
