i spoke to god today
and she said that shes ashamed
what have i become
what have i done
i spoke to the devil today
and he swears hes not to blame
and i understood
cause i feel the same

chorus
arms wide open
i stand alone
im no hero
and im not made of stone
right or wrong
i can hardly tell
im on the wrong side of heaven
and the righteous side of hell
the wrong side of heaven
and the righteous side
the righteous side of hell

verse 2
i heard from god today
and she sounded just like me
what have i done
and who have i become
i saw the devil today
and he looked a lot like me
i looked away
i turned away
see five finger death punch liveget tickets as low as 79you might also likechorus
arms wide open
i stand alone
im no hero
and im not made of stone
right or wrong
i can hardly tell
im on the wrong side of heaven
and the righteous side of hell
the wrong side of heaven
and the righteous side
the righteous side of hell

bridge
im not defending
downward descending
falling further and further away
getting closer every day
im getting closer every day
to the end
to the end the end the end
im getting closer every day

chorus
arms wide open
i stand alone
im no hero
and im not made of stone
right or wrong
i can hardly tell
im on the wrong side of heaven
and the righteous side of hell
the wrong side of heaven
and the righteous side of hell
the wrong side of heaven
and the righteous side
the righteous side of hell59embed"
