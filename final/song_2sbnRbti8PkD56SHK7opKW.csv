got us a sunset sinking into a friday night
got us some beer needs drinking hey and we just might
sometimes we gotta make it up as we go
but laying low aint all that goes on round here

chorus
it might look a little laid back to ya
but it aint all just porches and plows
but dont let that one red light fool ya
theres always something going down in this nothin town

verse 2
that old abandoned factory just got the wrecking ball
we threw a party in the parking lot just to watch it fall
sometimes we gotta make it up as we go
but laying low aint all that goes on round here

chorus
it might look a little laid back to ya
but it aint all just porches and plows
but dont let that one red light fool ya
theres always something going down in this nothin town

chorus
it might look a little laid back to ya
but it aint all just porches and plows
but dont let that one red light fool ya
theres always something going down
in this nothin town
