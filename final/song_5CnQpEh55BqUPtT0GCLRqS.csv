keep your voice down
and stop looking at my friends
blow out
they can hear exactly what you say
prechorus
drink fuck spew
telephone you
if youre alone in your room
whats that boy doing

chorus
head cars bending
head cars bending

verse 2
can we go now
not staying til the end
fall down
write another song about your friends

bridge
lock me in knock me out
talking like you do
and if you think youre helping me
i dont think im helping you
