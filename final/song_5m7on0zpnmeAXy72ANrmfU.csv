my girlfriends a dick magnet
my girlfriend gotta have it
shes hot cant stop up on stage doing shots
tip the man hell ring the bell
get her drunk shell scream like hell
dirty girl gettin down dance with guys from outta town
grab her ass actin tough mess with her shell fuck you up

no one really knows if shes drunk or if shes stoned
but shes coming back to my place tonight

chorus
she likes to shake her ass she grinds it to the beat
she likes to pull my hair when i make her grind her teeth
i like to strip her down shes naughty to the end
you know what she is no doubt about it
shes a bad bad girlfriend

verse 2

come together leave alone see you later back at home

no one really knows if shes drunk or if shes stoned
but shes coming back to my place tonight
