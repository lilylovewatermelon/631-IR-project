deranged from the blood stains all over my brain
just another day this killer train is ridin down your way
im fucking starting to unthread these voices thats in my head
i got a romance with the dead thats sleeping in river beds uh
damaging my organs to me they just aint important
im a different kind of breed the one that dont even breathe
the one you aint gotta feed just rob and take what i need
fucking product of the uicide fucking spawn of satan
cuttin on my wrist while these women fornicating
im debating to take my life forsaken by sacrifice
mistaken for something nice

verse 2 yung plague
pile of ashes is my final form
got a roll of duct tape and a rag soaked in chloroform
flies swarm because my bodys warm shatter the urn
see me blowing in the wind like a scattered storm
grey matter splattered in front of the corner store
saw that when i was fourteen walking around the 2nd ward
send him to the seventh floor
ended up with floor seats to something i didnt want to see
now that scene is in my head every time i go to sleep
when i dream i rest in peace knowing ill be dead
earth will be my final bed
poison me with lead inject it into my fucking head
see uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likeverse 3 rozz dyliams
pressure pressure
how do i dear deal with all this pressure
in my way
it’s in my lungs
it’s in my thoughts
it’s in my brain
a guilty conscience some might say i’m paranoid and locked away
a withering weed in the garden that god wasnt supposed to save
locked up in an open grave
with a king james bible
with a couple quotes erased but kept the ones that made me smile
do i really see everything for what it is
or is it that i can’t see anything with such a bad case of denial
when i die then put my body in a boat
and light it on fire push me out to sea
and let the wind do what i mighta
no matter whatever i feel about anything
it wasn’t until i burned all my bridges
it made my future brighter57embed"
