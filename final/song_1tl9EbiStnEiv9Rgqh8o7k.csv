lay it on me

verse 1
ccowboy baby you know my credits
dont ask if its true fuck it i said it
regret it never pimping forever
pull more hoes than a free cash lever
so you better never question the clever clever
ill sever whatever gogetter and turn them redder than ever
you bet ill wet her and leave and making her miss me
because thats how we do it up in detroit city
seventyone supercharged big block hemi
youre el debarge im living more like lemmy
bbbbbbenny and the jets is hot
but you havent never met a motherfucker like kid rock
and twisted brown truckers like a loaded gun
were the band that other bands run from
doing the backstage boogie is where youll find me
if you want some of that flash a pass come back and lay it on me

chorus
lay it on me
baby youve got to lay it on me
uh just lay it on me
you got to lay it on me
see kid rock liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likeverse 2
now people always say i am not living right
but it isnt my fault you misplaced your life
replaced your wife with soem twobit missy
and now shes getting fucked up in detroit city
tripping with the hippies bikers thugs
hit me with a mickey fast women and drugs
one love for two minutes the third minute im gone
wake me up to eat around the crack of dawn
im making pancakes baby if you crack the eggs
youll feel the irish tornado if you spread your legs
no need to brag and dont trail behind me
just step up front a little lady and lay it on me

chorus

verse 3
were coming were coming were coming
live from detroit its saturday night
got the funky fresh rhymes no need to bite
and to yall heehaws who thought id never rank
im going hahahaha all the way to the bank bitch
i got rich off of keeping it real
while you radioheads are reinventing the wheel
got critics all tripping off i dont know what
while im sipping king louis not giving a fuck
trash me in the news give me wack reviews
but youll never find another who can fill my shoes
who can moan the blues who can rock the rap
who can rock who can roll who can flow like that
black rim and a pocket full of phone numbers
from pan anderson to susan summers
understand i want peace like gandhi
but until that day im a walk this way
verse 4
so lay it on me im talking all night long
lay it on me like a banger gong
lay it on me with acdc on
from hells bells through the next nine songs
lay it on i can love you like that
lay it on me id rather fuck fo foghat
lay it on me i can make you shake
slow ride it baby through the piano break come on

outro
lay it on me you got to one two three give it up
so step up front a little lady lay it on meembed"
