you mean that much to me
and its hard to show
gets hectic inside of me
when you go
can i confess these things
to you
well i dont know
embedded in my chest
and it
hurts to hold

i couldnt spill my heart
my eyes gleam looking in from the dark
i walk out in stormy weather
hold my words keep us together
steady walking but bound to trip
should release but just tighten my grip

chorus
night time
sympathize
ive been working on
white lies
so ill tell the truth
ill give it up to you
and when the day comes
it will have all been fun
well talk about it soon

and i couldnt spill my heart
my eyes gleam
looking in from the dark
and i walk out in stormy weather
hope my words keep us together
steady walking but bound to trip
should release but just tighten my grip

chorus
night time
sympathize
ive been working on
white lies
so ill tell the truth
ill give it up to you
and when the day comes
it will have all been fun
well talk about it soon17embed"
