when you see a deer you see bambi
and i see antlers up on the wall
when you see a lake you think picnics
and i see a largemouth up under that log
youre probably thinkin that youre gonna change me
in some ways well maybe you might
scrub me down dress me up oh but no matter what
remember im still a guy

verse 2
when you see a priceless french paintin
i see a drunk naked girl
you think that ridin a wild bull sounds crazy
and id like to give it a whirl
well love makes a man do some things he aint proud of
and in a weak moment i might
walk your sissy dog hold your purse at the mall
but remember im still a guy

chorus
and ill pour out my heart hold your hand in the car
write a love song that makes you cry
then turn right around knock some jerk to the ground
cause he copped a feel as you walked by
see brad paisley liveget tickets as low as 55you might also likeverse 3
i can hear you now talkin to your friends
sayin yeah girls hes come a long way
from draggin his knuckles and carryin a club
and buildin a fire in a cave
but when you say a backrub means only a backrub
then you swat my hand when i try
well now what can i say at the end of the day
honey im still a guy

chorus
and ill pour out my heart hold your hand in the car
write a love song that makes you cry
then turn right around knock some jerk to the ground
cause he copped a feel as you walked by

verse 4
these days theres dudes gettin facials
manicured waxed and botoxed
with deep sprayon tans and creamy lotiony hands
you cant grip a tacklebox
yeah with all of these men linin up to get neutered
its hip now to be feminized
but i dont highlight my hair ive still got a pair
yeah honey im still a guy
outro
oh my eyebrows aint plucked theres a gun in my truck
oh thank god im still a guy
yeah boy7embed"
