steppin outside for you woah
then i put links on both wrists woah
cause you got control over me
and you got jokes like you dont need love baby
we dont need long woah
can you follow my lead for once woah
i can never make up for the time
i can make the way down worth the ride

verse
not like this im not goin out
this is not love im a glorified doorstop
stickin my foot out for you
and thats not all i would do
girl you got me by my hands here
well bae you got me bae you got me bae
im steppin out with shackles on my ankles
well bae you got me bae you got me bae
you wonder why we fell into a standstill
i said it never bothered me but
not like this im not goin out
this is not love im a glorified doorstop
stickin my foot out for you
and thats not all i would do
not like this im not goin out
this is not done this is sort of like love
when im stickin my foot out for you
but its not all i would do

steppin outside for you woah
then i put links on both wrists woah
cause you got control over me
and you got jokes like you dont need love baby
we dont need long woah
can you follow my lead for once woah
i can never make up for the time
i can make the way down worth the ride
