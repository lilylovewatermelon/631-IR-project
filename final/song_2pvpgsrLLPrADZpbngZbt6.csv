verse 1
living on the edge out of control
and the world just wont let me slow down
but in my biggest picture
was a photo of you and me
girl you know i tried
i work hard to provide all the material things
that i thought would make you happy
im confused can you make me understand
cause im trying to give you the best of me
i thought we were cool maybe i was blind
but never took time to see

chorus
can you help me
tell me what you want from me
can you help me
tell me why you wanna leave
baby help me
without you my whole world is falling apart
and im going crazy
lifes a prison when youre in love alone

verse 2
girl i put your love up on a shelf
and i guess i just left it to die

cause i hurt you too many times
and now youre not around
