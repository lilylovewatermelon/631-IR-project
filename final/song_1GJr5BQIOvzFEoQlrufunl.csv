do you have girlfriends
you pickin on me
no why are you saying that
why are you picking on me
why would i do that now let me ask you this question
why you pickin on me
shut up and sit down i told you to sit down

chorus anderson paak
dont use it dont use it all at once
baby girl your prime is about that long
dont use it timing is all we got
baby girl your prime is about that long

verse anderson paak
oh hell no
i had to get back for the candy uh
i flew for an hour then landed oh
she live on a beautiful campus oh
she dumb as a brick but she pass all her classes
know what she want and she know i aint shit but a savage ooh
she soaking up game
her brain is a series of pamphlets wow
she told me a story as long as her lashes
oh what a hopeless romantic
fucking with jokers and addicts
she told me everybody close to her age is full of mad shit
i said baby girl you aint even old enough to be jaded
and woah she want visual stimulation
short attention span and little patience
i like hennessy and record players
teddy pendergrass and sammy davis
opposites attract i swear we a magnet uh
dont be fucking up your scholarship
i cant help you with grants
word to my father my word and my balls is bout all that i honor
as god is my witness if you dont jump back in this bed

baby girl your prime is about that long

youre making up your mind youre out of songs arent you
i wanted an encore more tunes

bridge anderson paak

come jump in the bed jump in the bed with me ah
come back to bed come back to bed with me ah
come jump in the bed
