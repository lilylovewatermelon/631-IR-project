verse 1
trapped in my head she has the key
she walks me to her bed i cant wait to see the freaky things
she does to me
all her old niggas they are under me
but back to you baby youre a picasso piece
yes indeed youre lovely and i cant help it
follow me through the hell and the storm
honestly feel like ive been here before
probably visited here in my dreams
i came here looking for you
to know that youre all i need
