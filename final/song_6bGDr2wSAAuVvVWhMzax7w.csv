the mountains surrounding
mark the boundaries youre not meant to leave
ill stay far away but to keep my place
i want to write our names on a culm banks face

chorus
our hands only shake when we cross state lines
ive made hundreds of mistakes
and peace with dying in my sleep
but thats whats right for me
while the kids back home will leap
to the riverbeds below market street

verse 2
the mountains surrounding
haunt the boundaries only mentally
never set free you know where ill be
theres a time a place when and where theyll bury me

chorus
our hands only shake when we cross state lines
ive made hundreds of mistakes
and peace with dying in my sleep
but thats whats right for me
while the kids back home will leap
to the riverbeds below market streetyou might also like9embed"
