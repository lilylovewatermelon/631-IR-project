that first cold september night
you were the blanket holding me tight
you were kissing me and the earth stood still
you said we dont have to i said i will yeah
we ran in when the thunder came
you told me sugar melts in the rain
dont wanna watch our love go to waste
so we ran inside fore it was too late

prechorus
oh i oh i im not even tryin
oh i oh i but i cant stop smilin yeah

chorus
do you think about me
like i think about you
do you think about me
like i think about you yeah

verse 2
i moved on to another town
wrote you letters til the ink ran out
when the clouds rolled in i grabbed the keys
and played that song that we used to sing
i met a boy a lot like you
its funny how he used to sing it too
but he was always just a little out of key
so much different than you and me
