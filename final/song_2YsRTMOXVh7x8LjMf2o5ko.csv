theres nothing to see here people keep moving on
slowly their necks turn and then theyre gone
no one cares when the show is done
standing in line and its cold and you want to go
remember a joke so you turn around
theres no one to listen so you laugh by yourself

chorus
i heard its cold out but her popsicle melts
shes in the bathroom she pleasures herself
says im a bad man shes locking me out
its cause of these things its cause of these things
lets make a fast plan watch it burn to the ground
i try to whisper so no one figures it out
im not a bad man im just overwhelmed
its cause of these things its cause of these things

verse 2
the crowd on the street walks slowly dont mind the rain
lovers hold hands to numb the pain
gripping tightly to something that theyll never own
and those by themselves by choice or by some reward
no mistakes only now youre bored
this is the time of your life but you just cant tell
you might also likechorus
i heard its cold out but her popsicle melts
shes in the bathroom she pleasures herself
says im a bad man shes locking me out
its cause of these things its cause of these things
lets make a fast plan watch it burn to the ground
i try to whisper so no one figures it out
im not a bad man im just overwhelmed
its cause of these things its cause of these things

chorus
i heard its cold out but her popsicle melts
shes in the bathroom she pleasures herself
says im a bad man shes locking me out
its cause of these things its cause of these things
lets make a fast plan watch it burn to the ground
i try to whisper so no one figures it out
im not a bad man im just overwhelmed
its cause of these things its cause of these things1embed"
