tonight im so alone
this sorrow takes ahold
dont leave me here so cold
never wanna be so cold
your touch used to be so kind
your touch used to give me life
ive waited all this time
ive wasted so much time

prechorus
dont leave me alone
cause i barely see at all
dont leave me alone im

chorus
falling in the black
slipping through the cracks
falling to the depths can i ever go back
dreaming of the way it used to be
can you hear me
falling in the black
slipping through the cracks
falling to the depths can i ever go back
falling inside the black
falling inside falling inside the black

you were my source of strength
ive traded everything that i love for this one thing
stranded in the offering
dont leave me here like this
cant hear me scream from the abyss
and now i wish for you my desire

prechorus
dont leave me alone
cause i barely see at all
dont leave me alone im

chorus
falling in the black
slipping through the cracks
falling to the depths can i ever go back
dreaming of the way it used to be
can you hear me
falling in the black
slipping through the cracks
falling to the depths can i ever go back
falling inside the black
falling inside falling inside the black
black black black
chorus
falling in the black
slipping through the cracks
fffalling in the black
slipping through the cracks
falling through the depths can i never go back
dreaming of the way it used to be
can you hear me
slipping through the cracks
falling through the depths can i never go back
falling inside the black
can you hear me
falling inside the black
can you hear me
falling inside the black
can you hear me
falling inside falling inside falling inside the black7embed"
