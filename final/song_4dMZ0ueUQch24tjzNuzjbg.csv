a sinking ship an awkward kiss
a chance to set things straight
the kind of hurt that burns and burns
like fires we cant contain
we hole up in a shelter made of bones and ice and there well wait
to start again with steady hands
this time nothing gets in our way
but as we peer a little closer what do we see

chorus
a crack in the surface
a flaw in the plan
plans we made together almost buried in the sand
a cadence imperfect
like a building condemned
can we indemnify ourselves if we dont face what were against

verse 2
a promise kept
the dirt unswept
a poorly worn disguise
a child unloved that then grows up
to love what we despise
were broken but still breathing
we are wounded but we are healing
we pick up right where we left off
breathe on the ashes that remain
so that these coals may become fire
to guide our way
you might also likechorus
a crack in the surface
a flaw in the plan
plans we made together almost buried in the sand
a cadence imperfect
like a building condemned
can we indemnify ourselves if we dont face what were against

bridge
i walk on wounds
that seldom prove to slow me down
i laugh this constant pain away
so you cant tell
but there it lies under the smiles
it drains me mile after mile
but seldom proves to slow me down
here i go here i go here i go
should we just hold on
to what remains of
what we thought was lost

chorus
but its just a crack in the surface
a flaw in the plan
plans we made together almost buried in the sand
a cadence imperfect
like a building condemned
can we indemnify ourselves if we dont face what were against2embed"
