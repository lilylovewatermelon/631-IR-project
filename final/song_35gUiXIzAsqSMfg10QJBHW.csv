nowadays i dont understand why
my love doesnt love me like she used to before
now lately the sun just doesnt shine
and my paradise is gone

chorus 1 musiq soulchild
cause most of the time most of the time
we argue and fight over things that doesnt really matter
lord knows that i tried lord knows that i tried
to give all my love to her
so what should i do

chorus 2 carol riddick
youve got to understand its all about give and take
you cant be so demanding
things wont always go your way
if you just give it time
and think about her feelings
then things will work out fine
learn to make her your best friend

verse 2 musiq soulchild
i hear what you saying but my girl shes always complaining
and blaming me for things ill never do uh
and i dont know what what it is that i did that was so wrong
to make her feel ill ever be untrue to her

bridge 1 carol riddick
see what you need to do is stop catching attitudes
and just try to take the time to hear her out
stop being so defensive and try to be more attentive to
show her you respect what shes talkin bout
cause you know how us women can be yes
and when we feel threatened we react instinctively yeah
when our emotions have grown to its high
we can tend to just let it control our lives

bridge 2 musiq soulchild
well all right ill try next time ill try a little tenderness
even make sure that i give her more complements
maybe i could practice on being more patient
and compromise for my baby yeah yeah

outro x2
together
if you want her in your life
then you got to be willing to try
see its worth the struggle
cause in the end she will always
be your best friend yeahembed"
