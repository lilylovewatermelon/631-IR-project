ahem

verse 1
sometimes i feel like i aint shit
sometimes a nigga feel like shit
talkin’ bout some real life shit
goodbye letter dear life shit
so if a nigga kill me hope he mean it
i just hope i die for a reason
they probably wont miss me ’til they need me
have problems with admittin that they need me lord
im talkin bout some real life shit
goodbye letter dear life shit
way too concerned to be conceited
i live and i learn then die tryna teach em lord
die tryna reach em
they care more about how much i leave than
where i leave it
i hope i leave more of an impression on my kids
to be destined to have blessings to believe in lord
just got off the phone with my son
told him youre a son of a gun
just got off the phone with my daughter
told her i won’t hesitate to fuck a young nigga up lord
a few bitches left me that only got a new bitch elected
my old bitch was too disrespectful
and only get my new bitch respected
that’s power yes its now or next
can’t lie though i tried though
ill die tryin thats a common death
we was such a team we was chasin’ our dreams
then it stopped now im outta breath
now they try to tell me i need rest
and ill find love again i aint find it yet
oh but i guess it is what it is as it appears oh shit
the object in the mirror is more near than it appears oh shit
and sometimes i fear who in the mirror that nigga weird
he done died so many times but still here why am i here

dear life
what is my meaning my reason

verse 2
naked bitches really love ones
sometimes our loved ones dont love us
im fuckin more than im makin love
sometimes i make my rubber wear a rubber
i just tell my lady nothings easy
even though i make it look easy
but understand looks are deceiving
lookin like im lookin for some grievance
cause i been through way too much dont wanna think about it
cranky bout it gotta drink about it
gotta synchronize it tranquilize it
doctor aint prescribin what he aint realizin
pain inside me got me thinkin bout me
tryna hang my body sanctifyin
im a gangsta dyin cause all gangsters die
i cant deny it you cant tame my lion
im a angry lion hangin by a string i cant describe it
feel like a anchor tied to my finger
got me sinkin to the bottom of my drink
i know a lotta niggas think i got a lotta niggas
theres strength in numbers but its honor over strength
i talked to god the other day he say he got a nigga
so i look death up in her eye and then i wink
its way too real the shit im talkin way way too real
i hope it gave you chills
the dirt under your feet could be the grave you fill
you dont know how dead you feel til youre dead for real
gettin high after i paid the bill lower than a navy seal
show up with them navy guns i hope somebody prayin for em
price tags no mistakes somebody payin for em
ice bath when my face numb no expression
whats the life expectancy when you dont expect shit
mama told me fuck the world and be so aggressive
be selffluorescent watch these hoes cause they so obsessive
dont get too high to look over blessings
never come in second make the most of your seconds
they so precious
cause if we could buy time every store would sell it
if you want me to read your mind need correct spelling
i keep it real niggas better keep it copacetic
where the weed i feel like im gettin a sober headache
lookin in the mirror at the one that know me better
i was too busy to talk i wrote an open letter
chorus
dear life
what is my meaning my reason
thats the question i ask the reader god bless the reader
dear life what is my meaning my reason
thats the question
