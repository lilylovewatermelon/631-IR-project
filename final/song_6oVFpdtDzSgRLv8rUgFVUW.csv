verse 2 tyler the creator
uh grandmother died didnt cry not a tear
not gonna lie fucking weird no water dripped out the eye
but when i got the news yup it left your boy stuck
cause when my mom dipped she was the one that gave me a fuck
mom calling and calling im on my way to a show
i answered she crying saying sadie is dying
the doc said she only had a week for us to speak
before she deceased cause cancer was just eating her cheeks up
fuck nah this is really awkward for me bruh
i hang the phone up and adjust my seat back
and started to think like what the fuck just happened
i never had a death and i just seen her a week ago
meet them at the hospital i should
in between the set of badbadnotgood
lionel asked what happened i said its bad bad not good
just take me to the cedarssinai off of oakwood
getting there family sitting center chair
awkward in the lobby it was floating in the thinning air
getting there need a sticker saying how i got in there
theres her room open up the curtain shes just sitting there hello
our conversations brief
couldnt even make eye contact when we speak
lookin at her you could tell all she had was weak
and im not talkin days bruh im talkin bout her strength
i sat there twenty minutes tops
hoping it was just a fucking plea that she could cop
she died that night
outro dr tc  tyler the creator
oh thats heavy man
im sorry for your loss
yeah whatever
dont worry about it
the last time i seen sammy he was lookin for you
fuck that nigga samuel
uhh have you seen him
nah but if i seen that nigga i woulda killed him29embed"
