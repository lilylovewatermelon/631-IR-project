in this farewell
theres no blood theres no alibi
cause ive drawn regret
from the truth of a thousand lies

prechorus chester bennington
so let mercy come and wash away
chorus chester bennington
what ive done
ill face myself
to cross out what ive become
erase myself
and let go of what ive done

verse 2 chester bennington
put to rest what you thought of me
while i clean this slate with the hands of uncertainty

prechorus chester bennington
so let mercy come and wash away

chorus chester bennington
what ive done
ill face myself
to cross out what ive become
erase myself
and let go of what ive done
