his little feet cant reach the pedal so daddy works the gas and brakes
nine years old 10 and 2 tryin everything to keep it straight
dreamin hes dale earnhardt outside of some little town
somewhere in a truck right now

verse 2
worked all summer for those mud tires some tint and a three inch lift
tryin to catch a buzz from a couple buds they stole from daddys fridge
bed full of buddies a cab full of smoke and a cooler loaded down
somewhere in a truck right now

chorus
theres freedom in the headlights and hank comin out the dash
left arm out the window and straight pipes out the back
theres a good ol boy like me out there just proud to be drivin around
somewhere in a truck right now

verse 3
17 got his daddys keys he knows the trouble hes in
cause that piece of heaven ridin shotgun supposed to be home by 1000
but its way past midnight parked on the edge of town
somewhere in a truck right now

chorus
theres freedom in the headlights and hank comin out the dash
left arm out the window and straight pipes out the back
theres a good ol boy like me out there just proud to be drivin around
somewhere in a truck right now
somewhere in a truck right now
see riley green liveget tickets as low as 7you might also likebridge
when i close my eyes i go there in my mind
and im rollin through those alabama pines
somewhere in a truck right now

chorus
theres freedom in the headlights and hank comin out the dash
left arm out the window with straight pipes out the back
theres a good ol boy like me out there just proud to be drivin around
somewhere in a truck right now
somewhere in a truck right now
somewhere in a truck right now
somewhere in a truck right nowembed"
