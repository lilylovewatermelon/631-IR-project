i shaved my face and combed my hair
put on a new pair of underwear
sat on the porch with my labrador
like a hundred other times before
she changed her shoes and freshened up her face
put on some skimpy sexy lace
finally made her way through the back screen door
we loaded up on the front seat of my ford

chorus
and we went out to dinner and we drove right back home
watched an old movie and drank a half a bottle of rum
and then we turned off the tv and we got right down to it
there aint nothing left to do now that weve done it

verse 2
seems like it happens every time
we get a chance to reignite that fire
we burn it fast and then retire
just before the news on channel 5

chorus
and we went out to dinner and we drove right back home
watched an old movie and drank a half a bottle of rum
and then we turned off the tv and we got right down to it
there aint nothing left to do now that weve done it
see alan jackson liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likeverse 3
after all these years it can get routine
you change the order up or use different names
try it in the morning or the middle of the day
the end results are still the same

chorus
and we went out to dinner and we drove right back home
watched an old movie and drank a half a bottle of rum
and then we turned off the tv and we got right down to it
there aint nothing left to do now that weve done it

outro
oh lord we turned off the tv and we got right down to it
there aint nothing left to do now that weve done it
hey honey hand me that remoteembed"
