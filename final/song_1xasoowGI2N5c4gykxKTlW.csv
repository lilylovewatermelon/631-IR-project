verse 1
look whos digging their own grave
that is what they all say
youll drink yourself to death
look who makes their own bed
lies right down within it
and what will you have left
out on the front doorstep
drinking from a paper cup
you wont remember this
living beyond your years
acting out all their fears
you feel it in your chest

prechorus
your hands protect the flames
from the wild winds around you

and icaruss life it has only just begun
its just begun

verse 3
standing on the cliff face
highest fall youll ever grace
it scares me half to death
look out to the future
but it tells you nothing
so take another breath

prechorus
your hands protect the flames
from the wild winds around you

chorus
icarus is flying too close to the sun
and icaruss life it has only just begun
this is how it feels to take a fall
icarus is flying towards an early grave
