do you know me
really know me
you have opinions about my opinions
about my music
about my clothes
about my body
some people hate what i wear
some people praise it
some people use it to shame others
some people use it to shame me
but i feel you watching
always
and nothing i do goes unseen
so while i feel your stares your disapproval or your sigh of relief
if i lived by them id never be able to move
would you like me to be smaller weaker softer taller
would you like me to be quiet
do my shoulders provoke you does my chest
am i my stomach my hips
the body i was born with
is it not what you wanted
if i wear what is comfortable i am not a woman
if i shed the layers im a slut
though youve never seen my body you still judge it
and judge me for it
why
we make assumptions about people based on their size
we decide who they are
we decide what theyre worth
if i wear more if i wear less
who decides what that makes me what that means
is my value based only on your perception
or is your opinion of me not my responsibilityyou might also like33embed"
