clouds are marching along
singing a song just like they do
if the clouds were singing a song
id sing along wouldnt you too
if you just knew what they could do
oh if you just knew what would they do

prechorus
and if the birds are just hollow words
flying along singing a song
what would they do
if they just knew what they could do
oh if they just knew

chorus
i know its sad that i never gave a damn about the weather
and it never gave a damn about me
i know its sad that i never gave a damn about the weather
and it never gave a damn about me
no it never gave a damn about me

postchorus
i know its mad but if i go to hell
will you come with me or just leave
i know its mad but if the world were ending
would you kiss me or just leave me
just leave me
