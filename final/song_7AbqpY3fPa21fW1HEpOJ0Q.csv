i can tell by the chill in the pines
it touches my face like its trying to say
youve lost her forever this time

each night i go out awalkin
i cant stand the feel of the four walls
i always can tell the hour of twelve
when her memories start comin to call

its midnight on the mountain
i can tell by the chill in the pines
it touches my face like its trying to say
youve lost her forever this time

i talk to myself in the moonlight
i cant talk her off of my mind
cause the wind and the rain gonna whisper her name
it will live till the end of all time

its midnight on the mountain
i can tell by the chill in the pines
it touches my face like its trying to say
youve lost her forever this time
it touches my face like its trying to say
youve lost her forever this timesee the steeldrivers liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likeembed"
