i can taste salt water
and if i blink again youll be sinkin in
so well learn to swim in the oceans you made
ill hold ya and you think of him
and pretty soon youll be floating away

prechorus
and ill hold on to the words you spoke of
anchored down in my throat love
and im captain of the sinking boat now
with just one armband to carry me home

chorus
when salted tears wont dry
ill wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
these hearts will be flooded tonight
ill wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
your eyes your eyes your eyes your eyes your eyes

verse 2
i still taste salt water
on my lips from your kiss of bitterness
and ill drown within the oceans you made
and i hate to love you these cuffs are covered in your makeup
ill never trust you again you can just be a friend

and ill hold on to the words you spoke of
anchored down in my throat love
and im captain of the sinking boat now
with just one armband to carry me home

chorus
when salted tears wont dry
ill wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
these hearts will be flooded tonight
ill wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes

bridge
your eyes your lips your mouth
your thighs your back you drive me wild
tonight the fact is i im on my way home
im on the way home i lied i tried to cry
but im im drownin in the oceans you made

chorus
when salted tears wont dry
ill wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
these hearts will be flooded tonight
ill wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
your eyes your eyes your eyes your eyes your eyes19embed"
