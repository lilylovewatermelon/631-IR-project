yeah fuck it let me pop my shit one time

chorus
nobody got hit spin the block again yeah yeah

rockin real diamonds before i got the deal
through the grace of god we got away so now we gotta chill
they thought it was rap cap and i told ’em that i got a mil
you can get whatever if you ask me you aint gotta steal
my lil’ woadie said he fightin demons feel like he gotta kill
and i just left the hood to catch a vibe and that shit give me chills
