some people have it and some people dont
some people never will
and sometimes its hard to know when youve got it
sometimes its perfectly clear
well i know its out there ive seen it happen
i know the way it should feel
because theres no mistaking that good kind of aching
of a once in a lifetime love

chorus
once in a lifetime love
a love like weve all dreamed of
it may go disguised right before your eyes
a once in a lifetime love

verse 2
so if you think youve got it
if you feel it inside you dont let it slip away
you may not ever find what you never
thought youd have anyway
and if youve always had it and just realized it
you know how lucky you are
to wake up beside what some never find
a once in a lifetime love

it may go disguised right before your eyes
