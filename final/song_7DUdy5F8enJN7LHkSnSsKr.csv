i know you didnt think loving me meant so much time alone
dinner for one on the couch another movie on your own
you know that im never gonna be a 9 to 5 that was never me
i was born with a compass in my hand and a restless soul

prechorus
but when it hurts when you cant take it
and when the rubber band feels like its breaking

chorus
you hear the kick drum thats my heart right there
let the melody run its fingers through your hair
and my piano will kiss you slow tonight
and my vocals tickle your ear
and you almost can feel me here
and my piano will kiss you slow tonight

verse 2
as far as ladies go baby you should know youre so patient
youre a thickskin definition of low maintenance
but if enough time goes by you cant help but dim your light
an empty house can make a cold heart feel so naked

prechorus
but when it hurts when you cant take it
and when the rubber band feels like its breaking

you hear the kick drum thats my heart right there
let the melody run its fingers through your hair
and my piano will kiss you slow tonight
and my vocals tickle your ear
and you almost can feel me here
and my piano will kiss you slow tonight

bridge
oh let the audio be your second home for a while
and hold on to every note
baby listen close for me inside
and hear the kick drum thats my heart right there
let the melody run its fingers through your hair
and my piano will kiss you slow

chorus
and hear the kick drum thats my heart right there
let the melody run its fingers through your hair
and my piano will kiss you slow tonight
and my vocals tickle your ear
and you almost can feel me here
and my piano will kiss you slow tonight
will kiss you slow tonight1embed"
