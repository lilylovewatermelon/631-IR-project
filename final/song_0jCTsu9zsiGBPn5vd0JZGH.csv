everythings gonna be alright
i wish i had a dollar for all the times somebody told me
everthings gonna be alright

ive been lost in boston austin texas is always sweet
i stumbled around the texas town but i never left sixth street
you know its always hard to keep my feet from tryin to run away
and it seems ive spent a lifetime tryin to make everything ok

i wanna go down to see her
shes my little queen
i wanna go down to tell her
she means the world to me
i wanna go down to watch her
play that tambourine
she always brought a smile to me
id do anything

i wish i had a dollar for all the times somebody told me
everythings gonna be alright

i wish sometimes that i could say she never told me so
and id walk a million miles on down that same old broken road
now you can reap what you sew i know thats true
and i pray someday i wake and my poor feet wont fit these shoes
see uncle kracker liveget tickets as low as 68you might also likei wanna go down to see her
shes my little queen
i wanna go down to tell her
she means the world to me
i wanna go down to watch her
play that tambourine
she always brought a smile to me
id do anything

i wish i had a dollar for all the times somebody told me
everythings gonna be alright

if i listened closely i can hear it oh so clear
like a south bound train like fallin rain like a whisper in my ear
everything id like to hear you know i dont hear much no more
but i know someday that youll come my way
and youll walk right thru that door

i wanna go down to see her
shes my little queen
i wanna go down to tell her
she means the world to me
i wanna go down to watch her
play that tambourine
she always brought a smile to me
id do anything
i wish i had a dollar for all the times somebody told me
everythings gonna be alright
