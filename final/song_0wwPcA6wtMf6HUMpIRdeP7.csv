verse 1
ever since i left the city you
got a reputation for yourself now
everybody knows and i feel left out
girl you got me down you got me stressed out
cause ever since i left the city you
started wearin less and goin out more
glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
hangin with some girls i never seen before

chorus
you used to call me on my cell phone
latenight when you need my love
call me on my cell phone
latenight when you need my love
i know when that hotline bling
that can only mean one thing
i know when that hotline bling
that can only mean one thing

bridge
these days all i do is
wonder if youre bendin over backwards for someone else
wonder if youre rollin up a backwoods for someone else
doing things i taught you gettin nasty for someone else
you dont need no one else
you dont need nobody else no
why you never alone
why you always touchin road
used to always stay at home
be a good girl you was in the zone
yeah you should just be yourself
right now youre someone else

latenight when you need my love

latenight when you need my love
and i know when that hotline bling
that can only mean one thing
i know when that hotline bling
that can only mean one thing
