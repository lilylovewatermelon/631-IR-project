verse 1 lord infamous
as i cut guts pour blood washes from the shore
to the sand as a thousand veins slither through my hand
could not withstand a man from the underland of pain
as his brains hit the grains and i bury the remains with my fangs
piercing through a bitches jugular
infamous bangin with psychotic serial killers
the triple six murderers
not leaving enough to put in a tea cup
when im ready to cook and i rip up the hook
cause these niggas get took by the infamous crook
and the mafia villain will fuck up a rookie
drop him to his knees with the nine
slug gets dug and bloody up your mug
because me really love to make a stang
mr high capper dont make me touch ya mane
i got the scope but not the kind that kills bad breath
i got the kind that likes to fuck up ya good health
everybody in this bitch lets rip some shit up
tear da club up thugs on ya spot put em up
