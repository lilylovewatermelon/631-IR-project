its like technicolor in black and white
i felt like a boxer without a fight
a night in vegas without all the lights

prechorus
before you
i could only see as deep as the skin
before you
i never thought i could let anyone in
before you
i was waiting for my life to begin

chorus
you are you are the proof
that love is beautiful
you are you are the truth
something unusual
you are you are my fire
youre burning like the sun
you are you are you are
you are the only one

verse 2
my walls are falling and my white flag is high
ive surrendered to the feeling inside
i look into your eyes and rewind
