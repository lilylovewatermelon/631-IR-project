steelyringing imperthnthn thnthnthn

chips picking chips off rocky thumbnail chips
horrid and gold flushed more

a husky fifenote blew
blew blue bloom is on the
gold pinnacled hair
a jumping rose on satiny breasts of satin
rose of castille

trilling trilling i dolores
peep whos in the peepofgold
tink cried to bronze in pity
and a call pure long and throbbing longindying call

decoy soft word but look the bright stars fade o rose notes
chirruping answer castille the morn is breaking
jingle jingle jaunted jingling
coin rang clock clacked

avowal sonnez i could rebound of garter not leave thee
smack la cloche thigh smack avowal warm sweetheart
goodbye
you might also likewhen love absorbs war war the tympanum
a sail a veil awave upon the waves
when first he saw alas
full tup full throb
warbling ah lure alluring

martha come
clapclop clipclap clappyclap
goodgod henev erheard inall
a moonlight nightcall far far
i feel so sad p s so lonely blooming

listen
the spiked and winding cold seahorn have you the each and
for other plash and silent roar
pearls when she liszts rhapsodies hissssembed"
