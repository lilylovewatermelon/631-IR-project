despise

verse 1
maze psychopathic daze i create this waste
back away from tangents on the verge of drastic
ways cant escape this place i deny my face
sweat gets in my eyes i shout at all i despise

chorus 1
ooh
hands on my face overbearing i cant get out
ooh
hands on my face overbearing i cant get out

verse 2
lost ran at my own cost hearing laughter scoffed
searching from the rush detached from such and such
bleak standing on my feet listening incomplete
i am not a dog but im the one you dog

chorus 1
ooh
hands on my face overbearing i cant get out
ooh
hands on my face overbearing i cant get out

verse 3
cut me show me enter i am willing
and able and never any danger to myself
knowledge in my pain knowledge in my pain
or was my tolerance a phase
empathy out of my way
i cant die
i cant die
i cant die
i cant die
