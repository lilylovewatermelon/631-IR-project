verse 1
took a shot with the bad boy from the block
and picked my love right from the start
mister wrong he plays his part
back to the beginning now round two
try my luck with something new
we danced until we said i do
my luck is bad no more us two
no me and you ah

prechorus
is it too much to ask for a real love
something thatll last

chorus
is there one love only once in a lifetime
its so hard to find the perfect one to call mine
is there one love somebody that compliments me
and makes me want to never leave
made just right for me
is there one love woahohoh
one love woahohoh
one love woahohoh
one love woahohoh
