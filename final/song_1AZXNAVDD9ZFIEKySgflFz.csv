tell the angels no
i dont wanna leave my baby alone

verse 1
youre beautiful youre wonderful
incredible i love you so
youre beautiful
each moment spent with you is simply wonderful
this love i have for you girl its incredible
and i dont know what id do if i cant be with you
the world could not go on so every night i pray
if the lord should come for me before i wake
