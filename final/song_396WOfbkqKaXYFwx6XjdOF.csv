i looked away
then i looked back at you
you tried to say
the things that you cant undo
if i had my way
id never get over you
todays the day
i pray that we make it through

prechorus
make it through the fall
make it through it all

chorus
and i dont wanna fall to pieces
i just wanna sit and stare at you
i dont wanna talk about it
and i dont want a conversation
i just wanna cry in front of you
i dont wanna talk about it
cause im in love with you
