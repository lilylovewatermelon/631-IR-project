intro
yeah ayy

verse 1
i got layers to me
i got plans i got goals i got tricks up my sleeve
i got calls i got deals i got people to meet
i got drive i got soul i got everything ayy
i got scars i got heart i got family to feed woah
i got people mad i aint who they want me to be ayy
i got people i dont know tellin me what i need ayy
yeah i got loved ones sayin that they prayin for me
im thankful for the prayers i need more of those
put my hands together bow my head and thank the lord for ayy
everythin hes done yeah aint none of us immortal
so while im still alive i got so much to look forward to
addicted to the craft woah got no time to chat woah
this a lil somethin to hold em over for whats next woah
even when i guess woah i get it correct woah
question my work ethic thats a question you dont ask no no no ayy
yeah dont ever question if i hustle work a double
drop a bomb on me i climb right out the rubble not a struggle
tossin me under the busll get you muzzled
pop your bubble pop
throw your compliments right out the window ayy
so unique with this
i can flip the script and change the schedule youd still think that it
happened how it shouldve keep it subtle bunch of geniuses
put their heads together try to huddle up but still they sit
confused about how i learned to juggle ayy
toss around some concepts til i pick one
usually i dont alter my traditions
foreign to me hit em with the switch up
i just had to get this out my system
been a handful even with a mouth full of hand soap
i still say what i want to
getting past no
better chance beatin usain bolt in my sandals
to be candid thats like puttin minivans in nascar
with a grandma in the driver seat with her hands up
show goes on even after the shows over
to get past me you would have to kill me kill me kill me kill me

verse 2
ayy ayy kill me kill me kill me
tossin what you want aside for longevity aint meant to be
if it causes everything to collapse and affects your heart heavily
whats worth it and whats not
whats certain and which side would the coin flip to and land on
when you guess wrong do you stand up or stand down
even with a man down i man up
wellrounded held out for the right outlet
nine houses couldnt make me feel home childish
me left see the outcome every ounce of my childhood
played a role in how i wound up with an outlook so crowded
no knowledge couldnt see through the piles of my problems
still piled up past tense man i wish it was but ive come
so far so quickly
in it for the long haul its routine
only thing im cool with losing is losing sleep
and its only cool with me
if it means i get to watch my dreams
come true if i kept it brief
still you think it was a long story
recording half of the things i think would
take six years prepare cause the chance that you asked for
might show up at your door one night like im here
gonna let me in or just stare
its clear yeah six aint enough
that wouldnt come close to the content between my ears
my layers have got layers
my layers have got layers50embed"
