you push me to go the extra mile
you push me when its difficult to smile
you push me a better version of myself
you push me only you and no one else
you push me to see the other point of view
you push me when theres nothing else to do
you push me when i think i know it all
you push me when i stumble and i fall

prechorus
keep on pushing keep on
like nobody keep on

chorus
every race i win every mood im in
everything i do i owe it all to you
every move i make every step i take
everything i know its all because you push me

verse 2
you push me when i dont appreciate
you push me not to lie and not to hate
you push me when i want it all to end
you push me when i really need a friend
you push me all i wanna do is cry
you push me when its hard for me to try
you push me when i do it for myself
you push me only you and no one else
