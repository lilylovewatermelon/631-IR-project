is it getting better
or do you feel the same
will it make it easier on you now
you got someone to blame
you say one love one life one life
its one need in the night in the night
one love one love we get to share it oh
leaves you darlin if you dont care for it
mary

verse 2 mary j blige
did i disappoint you
or leave a bad taste in your mouth
you act like you never had love
and you want me to go without
well its too late tonight
to drag the past out into the light
were one but were not the same
we get to carry each other carry each other

verse 3 mary j blige
have you come here for forgiveness
have you come to raise the dead
have you come here to play jesus
to the lepers in your head
well did i ask too much more than a lot
you gave me nothing now its all i got
were one but were not the same
see we hurt each other then we do it again
you say love is a temple love is a higher law
love is a temple love is a higher law
you ask for me to enter but then you make me crawl
and i cant keep holding on to what youve got
cause all you got is hurt

verse 4 bono  mary j blige
one love one blood
one life you got to do what you should
one life with each other
sisters and my brothers
one life but were not the same
we get to carry each other carry each other
