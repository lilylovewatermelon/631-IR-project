5tpDYRQzjY1KidStki4Mtp,The Sweetest Dream (Princess Theme),Fred Mollin,3diwNCScanKXsiDgO1Etxn,"3 contributorsthe android and the human lyricsit is the tendency of the socalled primitive mind to animate its environment modern depth psychology has requested us for years to withdraw these anthropomorphic projections from what is actually inanimate reality to introject  that is to bring back into our own heads  the living quality which we in ignorance cast out onto the inert things surrounding us such introjection is said to be the mark of true maturity in the individual and the authentic mark of civilization in contrast to mere social culture such as one find in a tribe a native of africa is said to view his surroundings as pulsing with a purpose a life which is actually within himself once these childish projections are withdrawn he sees that the world is dead and that life resides solely within himself when he reaches this sophisticated point he is said to be either mature or sane or scientific but one wonders has he not also in this process reifed  that is made into a thing  other people stones and rocks and trees may now be inanimate for him but what about his friends has he not now made them into stones too
	this is really a psychological problem and its solution i think is of less importance in any case than one might think because within the last decade we have seen a trend not anticipated by our earnest psychologists  or by anyone else  which dwarfs that issue our environment and i mean our manmade world of machines artificial constructs computers electronic systems interlinking homeostatic components  all this is in fact beginning more and more to possess what the earnest psychologists fear the primitive sees in his environment animation in a very real sense our environment is becoming alive or at least quasialive and in ways specifically and fundamentally analogous to ourselves cybernetics a valuable recent scientific discipline articulated by the late norbert wiener saw valid comparisons between the behavior of machines and humans  with the view that a study of machines would yield valuable insights into the nature of our own behavior by studying what goes wrong with a machine  for example when two mutually exclusive tropisms function simultaneously in one of grey walters synthetic turtles producing fascinatingly intricate behavior in the befuddled turtles  one learns perhaps a new more fruitful insight into what in humans was previously called neurotic behavior but suppose the use of this analogy is turned the other way suppose  and i dont believe wiener anticipated this  suppose a study of ourselves our own nature enables us to gain insight into the now extraordinarily complex functioning and malfunctioning of mechanical and electronic constructs in other words  and this is what i wish to stress in what i am saying here  it is now possible that we can learn about the artificial external environment around us how it behaves why what it is up to by analogizing from what we know about ourselves
	machines are becoming more human so to speak  at least in the sense that as wiener indicated some meaningful comparison exists between human and mechanical behavior but is it not ourselves that we know first and foremost rather than learning about ourselves by studying our constructs perhaps we should make the attempt to comprehend what our constructs are up to by looking into what we ourselves are up to
	perhaps really what we are seeing is a gradual merging of the general nature of human activity and function into the activity and function of what we humans have built and surrounded ourselves with a hundred years ago such a thought would have been absurd rather than merely anthropomorphic what could a man living in 1750 have learned about himself by observing the behavior of a donkey steam engine could he have watched it huffing and puffing and then extrapolated from its labor an insight into why he himself continually fell in love with one certain type of pretty young girl this would not have been primitive thinking on his part it would have been pathological but now we find ourselves immersed in a world of our own making so intricate so mysterious that as stanislaw lem the eminent polish science fiction writer theorizes the time may come when for example a man may have to be restrained from attempting to rape a sewing machine let us hope if that time comes that it is a female sewing machine he fastens his intentions on and one over the age of seventeen  hopefully a very old treadleoperated singer although possibly regrettably past menopause
	i have in some of my stories and novels written about androids or robots or simulara  the name doesnt matter what is meant is artificial constructs masquerading as humans usually with a sinister purpose in mind i suppose i took it for granted that if such a construct a robot for example had a benign or anyhow decent purpose in mind it would not need to so disguise itself now to me that theme seems obsolete the constructs do not mimic humans they are in many deep ways actually human already they are not trying to fool us for a purpose of any sort they merely follow lines we follow in order that they too may overcome such common problems as the breakdown of vital parts loss of power source attack by such foes as storms short circuits  and im sure any one of us here can testify that a short circuit especially in our power supply can ruin our entire day and make us utterly unable to get to our daily job or once at the office useless as far as doing the work set forth on our desk
	what would occur to me as a recasting of the robotappearingashuman theme would be a gleaming robot with a telescanlens and a helium battery powerback who when jostled bleeds underneath the metal hull is a heart such as we ourselves have perhaps i will write that or as in stories already in print a computer when asked some ultimate question such as why is there water prints out first corinthians one story i wrote which im afraid i failed to take seriously enough dealt with a computer which when able to answer a question put to it ate the questioner presumably  i failed to go into this  had the computer been unable to answer a question the human questioner would have eaten it anyhow i inadvertently blended the human and the construct and didnt notice that such a blend might in time actually begin to become part of our reality like lem i think this will be so more and more but to project past lems idea a time may come when if a man tries to rape a sewing machine the sewing machine will have him arrested and testify perhaps even a little hysterically against him in court this leads to all sorts of spinoff ideas false testimony by suborned sewing machines who accuse innocent men unfairly paternity tests and of course abortions for sewing machines which have become pregnant against their will and would there be birth control pills for sewing machines probably like one of my previous wives certain sewing machines would complain that the pills made them overweight  or rather in their case that it made them sew irregular stitches and there would be unreliable sewing machines that would forget to take birth control pills and last but not least there would have to be planned parenthood clinics at which sewing machines just off the assembly lines would be conseled as to the dangers of promiscuity with severe warnings of venereal diseases visited on such immoral machines by an outraged god  himself no doubt able to sew buttonholes and fancy needlework at a rate that would dazzle the credulous merely metal and plastic sewing machines always ready like ourselves to kowtow before divine miracles
	i am being facetious about this i suppose but  the point is not merely a humorous one our electronic constructs are becoming so complex that to comprehend them we must now reverse the analogizing of cybernetics and try to reason from our own mentation and behavior to theirs  although i suppose to assign motive or purpose to them would be to enter the realm of paranoia what machines do may resemble what we do but certainly they do not have intent in the sense that we have they have tropisms they have purpose in the sense that we build them to accomplish certain ends and to react to certain stimuli a pistol for example is built with the purpose of firing a metal slug that will damage incapacitate or kill someone but this does not mean the pistol wants to do this and yet here we are entering the philosophical realm of spinoza when he saw and i think with great profundity that if a falling stone could reason it would think i want to fall at the rate of 32 feet per second per second free will for us  that is when we feel desire when we conscious of wanting to do what we do  may be even for us an illusion and depth psychology seems to substantiate this many of our drives in life originate from an unconscious that is beyond our control we are driven as are insects although the term instinct is perhaps not applicable for us whatever the term much of our behavior that we feel is the result of our will may control us to the extent that for all practical purposes we falling stones doomed to drop at a rate prescribed by nature as rigid and predictable as the force that creates a crystal each of us may feel himself unique with an intrinsic destiny never before seen in the universe and yet to god we may be millions of crystals identical in the eyes of the cosmic scientist
	and  here is a thought not too pleasing  as the external world becomes more animate we may find that we  the socalled humans  are becoming and may to a great extent always have been inanimate in the sense that we are led directed by builtin tropisms rather than leading so we and our elaborately evolving computers may meet each other halfway someday a human being named perhaps fred white may shoot a robot named pete somethingorother which has come out of a general electrics factory and to his surprise see it weep and bleed and they dying robot may shoot back and to its surprise see a wisp of gray smoke arise from the electric pump that it supposed was mr whites beating heart it would be rather a great moment of truth for both of them
	i would like then to ask this what is it in our behavior that we can call specifically human that is special to us as a living species and what is it that at least up to now we can consign as merely machine behavior or by extension insect behavior or reflex behavior and i would include in this the kind of pseudohuman behavior exhibited by what were once living men  creatures who have in ways i wish to discuss next become instruments means rather than ends and hence to me analogs of machines in the bad sense in the sense that although biological life continues metabolism goes on the soul  for lack of a better term  is no longer there or at least no longer active and such does exist in our world  it always did but the production of such inauthentic human activity has become a science of government and suchlike agencies now the reduction of humans to mere use  men made into machines serving a purpose which although good in an abstract sense has for its accomplishment employed what i regard as the greatest evil imaginable the placing on what was a free man who laughed and cried and made mistakes and wandered off into foolishness and play a restriction that limits him despite what he may imagine or think to the fulfilling of an aim outside of his own personal  however puny  destiny as if so to speak history has made him into its instrument history and men skilled in  and trained in  the use of manipulative techniques equipped with devices ideologically oriented themselves in such as way that the use of these devices strikes them as a necessary or at least desirable method of bringing about some ultimately desired goal
	i think at this point of tom paines comment about or another party of the europe of his time they admired the feathers and forgot the dying bird and it is the dying bird that i am concerned with the dying  and yet i think beginning once again to revive in the hearts of the new generation of kids coming into maturity  the dying bird of authentic humanness
	this is what i wish to say to you here today i wish to disclose my hope my faith in the kids who are emerging now their world their values and simultaneously their imperviousness to the false values the false idols the false hates of the previous generations the fact that they these fine good kids cannot be reached or moved or even touched by the gravity  to refer back to my previous metaphor  that has made us older persons fall against our knowledge or will at 32 feet per second per second throughout our lives while believing that we desired it
	it is as if these kids or at least many of them some of them are falling at a different rate or really not falling at all walt whitmans marching to the sound of other drummers might be rephrased this way falling not in response to unexamined unchallenged alleged verities but in response to a new and inner  and genuinely authentic  human desire
	youth of course has always tended toward this in fact this is really a definition of youth but right now it is so urgent if as i think we are merging by degrees into homogeneity with our mechanical constructs step by step month by month until a time will perhaps come when a writer for example will not stop writing because someone unplugged his electric typewriter but because some unplugged him but there are kids now who cannot be unplugged because no electric cord links them to any external powersource their hearts beat with an interior private meaning their energy doesnt come from a pacemaker it comes from a stubborn almost absurdly perverse refusal to be shucked that is to be taken in by the slogans the ideology  in fact by any and all ideology itself of whatever sort  that would reduce them to instruments of abstract causes however good back in california where i come from i have been living with such kids participating to the extent i can in their emerging world i would like to tell you about their world because  if we are lucky  something of that world those values that way of life will shape the future of our total society our utopia or antiutopia of the future as a science fiction writer i must of course look continually ahead always at the future it is my hope  and id like to communicate it to you in the tremendous spirit of optimism that i feel so urgently and strongly  that our collective tomorrow exists in embryonic form in the heads or rather in the hearts of these kids who right now at their young ages are politically and sociologically powerless unable even by our californian laws to buy a bottle of beer or a cigarette to vote to in any way shape be consulted about or bring into existence the official laws that govern their and our society i think really i am saying this if you are interested in the world of tomorrow you may learn something about it or at least read about possibilities that may emerge to fashion it in the pages of analog and fsf and amazing but actually to find it in its authentic form you will discover it as you observe a 16 or 17yearold kid as he goes about his natural peregrinations his normal day or as we say in the san francisco bay area as you observe him cruising around town to check out the action this is what i have found these kids that i have known lived with still know in california are my science fiction stories of tomorrow my summation at this point in my life as a person and a writer they are what i look ahead to  and so keenly desire to see prevail what more than anything else i have ever encountered i believe in and would give my life for my full measure of devotion in this war we are fighting to maintain and augment what is human about us what is the core of ourselves and the source of our destiny our flight must be not only to the stars but into the nature of our own beings because it is not merely where we go to alpha centaurus or betelgeuse but what we are as we make our pilgrimages there our natures will be going there too ad astra  but per hominem and we must never lose sight of that
	it would after all be rather dismaying if the first twolegged entity to emerge on the surface of mars from a terran spacecraft were to declare thanks be to god for letting me letting me click letting click click this is a recording and then catch fire and explode as a couple of wires got crossed somewhere within its plastic chest and probably even more dismaying to this construct would be the discovery when it returned to earth to find that its children had been recycled along with the aluminum beer cans and coca cola bottles as fragments of the urban pollution problem and finally when this astronaut made of plastic and wiring and relays went down to the city hall officials to complain it would discover that its threeyear guarantee had run out and since parts were no longer available to keep it functioning its birth certificate had been cancelled
	of course literally we should not take this seriously but as a metaphor  in some broad sense maybe we should scrutinize more closely the twolegged entities we plan to send up for example to man the orbiting space station we do not want to learn three years from now that the alleged human crew had all married portions of the space station and had settled down to whirr happily forever after in connubial bliss as in ray bradburys superb story in which a fearhaunted citizen of los angeles discovers that the police car trailing him has no driver that it is tailing him on its own we should be sure that one of us sits in the drivers seat in mr bradburys story the real horror at least to me is not that the police car has its own tropism as it hounds the protagonist but that within the car there is a vacuum a place unfilled the absence of something vital  that is the horrific part the apocalyptic vision of a nightmare future but i myself foresee something more optimistic had i written that story i would have had a teenager behind the wheel of the police car  he had stolen it while the police officer is in a coffee shop on his lunch break and the kid is going to resell it by tearing it down into parts this may sound a little cynical on my part but wouldnt this be preferable as we say in california where i live when the police come to investigate a burglary of your house they find when they are leaving that someone has stripped the tires and motor and transmission from their car and the officers must hitchhike back to headquarters this thought may strike fear in the hearts of the establishment people but frankly it make me feel cheerful even the most base schemes of human beings are preferable to the most exalted tropisms of machines i think this right here is one of the valid insights possessed by some of the new youth cars even police cars are expendable can be replaced they are really all alike it is the person inside who when gone cannot be duplicated at any price even if we do not like him we cannot do without him and once gone he will never come back
	and then too if he is made into an android he will never come back never be again human or anyhow most likely will not
	as the children of our world fight to develop their new individuality their almost surly disrespect for the verities we worship they become for us  and by us i mean the establishment  a source of trouble i do not necessarily mean politically active youth those who organize into distinct societies with banners and slogans  to me that is a reduction into the past however revolutionary those slogans may be i refer to the intrinsic entities the kids each of whom is on his own doing what we call his thing he may for example not break the law by seating himself on the tracks before troop trains his flouting of the law may consist of taking his car to a drivein movie with four kids hidden in the trunk to avoid having to pay still a law is being broken the first transgression has political theoretical overtones the second a mere lack of agreement that one must always do what one is ordered to do  especially when the order comes from a posted printed sign in both cases there is disobedience we might applaud the first as meaningful the second merely irresponsible and yet it is in the second that i see a happier future after all there have always been in history movements of people in organized opposition to the governing powers this is merely one group using force against another the outs versus the ins it has failed to produce a utopia so far and i think always will
	becoming what i call for lack of a better term an android means as i said to allow oneself to become a means or to be pounded down manipulated made into a means without ones knowledge or consent  the results are the same but you cannot turn a human into an android if that human is going to break laws every chance he gets androidization requires obedience and most of all predictability it is precisely when a given persons response to any given situation can be predicted with scientific accuracy that the gates are open for the wholesale production of the android life form what good is a flashlight if the buld lights up only now and then when you press the button any machine must always work to be reliable the android like any other machine must perform on cue but our youth cannot be counted on to do this it is unreliable either through laziness short attention span perversity criminal tendencies  whatever label you wish to pin on the kid to explain this unreliability is fine each merely means we can tell him and tell him what to do but when the time comes for him to perform all the subliminal instrucion all the ideological briefing all the tranquilizing drugs all the psychoterapy are a waste he just plain will not jump when the whip is cracked and so he is of no use to us the calcified entrenched powers he will not see to it that he acts as an instrument by which we both keep and augment those powers and the rewards  for ourselves  that go with them
	what has happened is that there has been too much persuasion the television set the newspapers  all the socalled mass media have overdone it words have ceased to mean much to these kids they have had to listen too many they cannot be taught because there has been too great an eagerness too conspicuous a motive to make them learn the antiutopia science fiction writers of fifteen years ago and i was one of them foresaw the mass communications propaganda machinery grinding everyone down into mediocrity and uniformity but it is not coming out this way while the car radio dins out the official view on the war in vietnam the young boy is disconnecting the speaker so he can replace it with a tweeter and a woofer in the middle of the governments harangue the speaker is unattached and as he expertly hooks up better audio components in his car the boy fails even to notice that the voice on the radio is trying to tell him something this skilled craftsman of a kid listens only to see whether there is distortion interference or a frequency curve that isnt fully compensated his head is turned toward immediate realities the speaker itself not the flatuus voci dinning from it
	the totalitarian society envisioned by george orwell in 1984 should have arrived by now the electronic gadgets are here the government is here ready to do what orwell anticipated so the power exists the motive and the electronic hardware but these mean nothing because progressively more and more so no one is listening the new youth that i see is too stupid to read too restless and bored to watch too preoccupied to remember the collective voice of the authorities is wasted on him he rebels but rebels not out of theoretical ideological considerations only out of what might be called pure selfishness plus a careless lack of regard for the dread consequences the authorities promise him if he fails to obey he cannot be bribed because what he wants he can build steal or in some curious intricate way acquire for himself he cannot be intimidated because on the streets and in his home he has seen and participated in so much violence that it fails to cow him he merely gets out of its way when it threatens or if he cant escape he fights back when the locked police van comes to carry him off to the concentration camp the guards will discover that while loading the van they have failed to note that another equally hopeless juvenile has slashed the tires the van is out of commision and while the tires are being replaced the other youth siphons out all the gas from the gas tank for his soupedup chevrolet impala and has sped off long ago
	the absolutely horrible technological society  that was our dream our vision of the future we could foresee nothing equipped with enough power guile or whatever to impede the coming of that dreadful nightmare society it never occured to us that the delinquent kids might abort it out of the sheer perverse malice of their little individual souls god bless them here as a case in point are two excerpts from the media the first quoted in that epitome of the nauseating time is  so help me  what time calls the ultimate dream in telephone service as described by harold s osborne former chief engineer of att

whenever a baby is born anywhere in the world he is given at   birth a telephone number for life as soon as he can talk he is given a watchlike device   with ten little buttons on one side and a screen on the other when he wishes to talk with   anyone in the world he will pull out the device and punch on the keys the number then   turning the device over he will hear the voice of his friend and see his face on the   screen in color and in three dimensions if he does not see him and hear him he will   know that his friend is dead

i dont know i really dont find this funny it is really sad it is heartbreaking anyhow it is not going to happen the kids have already seen to that phone freaks they are called these particular kids this is what the la times says in an article dated earlier this year
	they the phone freaks all arrived carrying customized mfers    multifrequency tone signals  the phone freak term for a blue box the homemade mfers   varied in size and design one was a sophisticated pocket transistor built by a phd in   engineering another the size of a cigar box with an actual coupler attaching to the phone   receiver so far these phone freaks had devised 22 ways to make a free call without using   credit cards in case of a slipup the phone freaks also know how to detect supervision   phone company jargon for a nearly inaudible tone which comes on the line before anyone   answers to register calling charges as soon as phone freaks detect the dreaded   supervision they hang up fast
	captain crunch was still in the phone booth pulling the red   switches on his fancy computerized box he got his name from the whistle found in the   capn crunch breakfast cereal box crunch discovered that the whistle has a frequency of   2600 cycles per second the exact frequency the telephone company uses to indicate that a   line is idle and of course the first frequency phone freaks learn how to whistle to get   disconnect which allows them to pass from one circuit to another crunch intent   hunched over his box to read a list of country code numbers he impersonated to the   overseas operator and called italy in less than a minute he reached a professor of   classical greek writings at the university of florence
	this is how the future has actually come ot none of us science fiction writers foresaw phone freaks fortunately neither did the phone company which otherwise would have taken over by now but this is the difference between dire myth and warm merry reality and it is the kids unique wonderful unhampered by scruples in any traditional sense that have made the difference
	speaking in science fiction terms i now foresee an anarchistic totalitarian state ahead ten years from now a tv street reporter will ask some kid who is president of the united states and the kid will admit that he doesnt know but the president can have you executed the reporter will protest or beaten or thrown into prison or all your rights taken away all your property  everything and the boy will reply yeah so could my father up to last month when he had his fatal coronary he used to say the same thing end of interview and when the reporter goes to gather up his equipment he will find that one his color 3d stereo microphonevidlens systems is missing the kid has swiped it from him while the reporter was blabbing on
	if as it seems we are in the process of becoming a totalitarian society in which the state apparatus is allpowerful the ethics most important for the survival of the true free human individual would be cheat lie evade fake it be elsewhere forge documents build improved electronic gadgets in your garage thatll outwit the gadgets used by the authorities if the television screen is going to watch you rewire it late at night when youre permitted to turn it off  rewire it in such a way that the police flunky monitoring the transmission from your living room mirrors back his living room at his house when you sign a confession under duress forge the name of one of the political spies whos infiltrated your model airplane club pay your fines in counterfeit money or rubber checks or stolen credit cards give a false address arrive at the courthouse in a stolen car tell the judge that if he sentences you you will substitute aspirin tablets for his daughters birth control pills or put his honor on a mailing list for pornographic magazines or if all else fails threaten him with your using his telephone credit card number to make unnecessary long distance calls to cities on other planets it will not be necessary to blow up the courthouse any more simply find some way to defame the judge  you saw him driving home one night on the wrong side of the road with his headlights off and a fifth of seagrams vo propped up against his steering wheel and his bumper sticker that night read grant full rights to us homosexuals he has of course torn the sticker off by now but both you and ten of your friends witnessed it and they are all at pay phones right now ready to phone the news to the local papers and if he is still so foolish as to sentence you at least ask him to give back the little tape recorder you inadvertently left in his bedroom since the off switch on it is broken it has probably recorded its entire tenday reel of tape by now results should be interesting and if he tries to destroy the tape you will have him arrested for vandalism which in the totalitarian state of tomorrow will be the supreme crime what is your life worth in his eyes compared with a three dollar reel of mylar tape the tape is probably government property like everything else so to destroy it would be a crime against the state the first step in a calculated sinister insurrection
	i wonder if you recall the socalled brain mapping developed by penfield recently he was able to locate the exact centers in the brain from which each sensation emotion and response came by stimulating one minute area with an electrode a laboratory rat was transfigured into a state of perpetual bliss theyll be doing that to all of us too soon a pessimistic friend said to me regarding that once the electrodes have been implanted they can get us to feel think do anything they want well to do this the government would have to let out a contract for the manufacture of a billion sets of electrodes and in their customary way they would award the contract to the lowest bidder who would build substandard electrodes out of secondhand parts the technicians implanting the electrodes in the brains of millions upon millions of people would become bored and careless and when the switch would be pressed for the total population to feel profound grief at the death of some government official  probably the minister of the interior in charge of the slave labor rehabilitation camps  it would all get fouled up and the population like that laboratory rat would go into collective seizures of merriment or the substandard wiring connecting the brains of the population with the washington dc thought control center would overload and a surge of electricity would roll backward over the lines and set fire to the white house
	or is this just wishful thinking on my part a little fantasy about a future society we should really feel apprehensive toward
	the continued elaboration of state tyranny such as we in science fiction circles anticipate in the world of tomorrow  our whole preoccupation with what we call the antiutopian society  this growth of state invasion into the privacy of the individual its knowing too much about him and then when it knows or thinks it knows something it frowns on its power and capacity to squash the individual  as we thoroughly comprehend this evil process utilizes technology as its instrument the inventions of applied science such as the almost miraculously sophisticated sensor devices right now traveling back from war use in vietnam for adaptation to civilian use here  these passive infrared scanners sniperscopes these chrome boxes with dials and gauges that can penetrate brick and stone can tell the user what is being said and done a mile away within a tightly sealed building be it concrete bunker or apartment building can like the weapons before them fall into what the authorities would call the wrong hands  that is into the hands of the very people being monitored like all machines these universal transmitters recording devices heatpattern discriminators dont in themselves care who theyre being use by or against the scene of a street fracas where for example some juvenile has dropped a waterfilled balloon into the sportscar of a wealthy taxpayer  this vehicle however fast however wellarmed and animated by the spirit of righteous vengeance can be spotted by the same lens by which its superiors became aware of the disturbance in the first place and notification of its impending arrival on the scene can be flashed by the same walkietalkie army surplus gadget by which crowd control is maintained when black gather to protest for their just rights before the absolute power of the absolute state of tomorrow can achieve its victory it may find such things as this when the police show up at your door to arrest you for thinking unapproved thoughts a scanning sensor which youve bought and built into your door discriminates the intruders from customary friends and alerts you to your peril
	let me give you an example at the enormous civic center building in my county a fantastic buck rogers type of plastic and chrome backdrop to a bad science fiction film each visitor must pass through an electronic field that sets off an alarm if he has on him too much metal be it keys a watch pair of scissors bomb 308 winchester rifle when the hoop pings  and it always pings for me  a uniformed policeman immediately fully searches the visitor a sign warns that if any weapon is discovered on a visitor its all over for him  and the sign also warns that if any illegal drugs are found on a visitor during this weapons search hes done for too now i think even you people up here in canada are aware of the reason for this methodical weapons search of each visitor to the marin county civic center  it has to do with the tragic shootout a year or so ago but and they have officially posted notice of this the visitor will be inspected for narcotics possession too and this has nothing to do with either the shootout or with any danger to the building itself or the persons within it an electronic checkpoint legitimately set up to abort a situation in which explosives or weapons are brought into the civic center has been assigned an added police function connected with the authentic issue only by the common thread of penal code violation to visit the county library which is in that building you are subject to search  must in fact yield absolutely and unconditionally  for possession without juridical protection built into the very basis of our american civil rights system that some clear and evident indication exist that you may be carrying narcotics before a search can be carried against you during this search ive even had the uniformed officer at the entrance examine the books and papers i was carrying to see if they were acceptable the next step in the months to come would be to have such mandatory checkpoints at busy intersections and at all public buildings  including banks and so forth once it has been established that the authorities can search you for illegal drugs because youre returning a book to the library i think you can see just how far the tyranny of the state can go  once it has provided itself with an electronic hoop that registers the presence of something we all carry on us keys a pair of fingernail clippers coins the blip rather a quaint little sound which you set off opens a door not leading to the county library but to possible imprisonment it is that blip that ushers in all the rest and how many other blips are we setting off or our children will be setting off in context that we know nothing about yet but my optimistic point the kids of today having been born into this allpervasive society are fully aware of and take for granted the activity of such devices one afternoon when i was parking my car on the lot before a grocery store i started as usual to lock all the car doors to keep the parcels in the back seat from being stolen oh you dont have to lock up the car the girl with me said this parking lot is under constant closedcircuit tv scan every car here and everyone is being watched all the time nothing can happen so we went inside the store leaving the car unlocked and of course she was right born into this society she has learned to know such things and  i now have a passive infrared scanning system in my own home in santa venetia connected with what is called a digital transmitting box which when triggered off by the scanner transmits a coded signal by direct line to the nearest law enforcement agency notifying them that intruders have entered my house this totally selfoperated electronic detection system functions whether i am at home or not it is able to discriminate between the presence of a human being and an animal it has its own power supply if the line leading from it is cut grounded or even tampered with the signal is immediately released or if any other part of system is worked on and westinghouse will reinstall it wherever i live i own the components for life eventually westinghouse security hopes all homes and businesses will be protected this way the company has built and maintains a communications center near each community in the country if there is no police agency willing or able to accept the signal then their own communications center responds and guarantees to dispatch law enforcement personnel within four minutes  that is the good guys with the guns will be at your door within that time it does not matter if the intruder enters with a passkey or blows in the whole side of the house or as they tell me its being done now bores down through the roof  however he got in for whatever reason the mechanism responds and transmits its signal only i can turn the system off and if i forget to then  i suppose anyhow  its all over for me
	someone suggested by the way that perhaps this passive infrared scanner sweeping out the interior of my house constantly might be watching me and reporting back to the authorities whatever i do right there in my own living room well what i am doing is sitting at my desk with pen and paper trying to figure out how to pay westinghouse the 840 i owe them for the system as ive got it worked out now i think if i sell everything i own including my house i can  oh well one other thing if i enter the house  my house  and the system finds im carrying illegal narcotics on my person it doesnt blip it causes both me and the house and everything in it to selfdestruct
	street drugs by the way are a major problem in the area where i live  that is the illegal drugs you buy on the street are often adulterated cut or just plain not what youre told they are you wind up poisoned dead or just plain burned which means you dont get off which means you paid ten dollars for a gram of milk sugar so a number of free labs have been set up for the specific purpose of anylyzing street drugs you mail them a portion of the drug youve bought and they tell you whats in it the idea being of course that if it has strychnine or film developer or flash powder in it you should know before you take it well the police saw through into the quote real purpose of these labs at one glance they act as quality control stations for the drug manufacturers lets say youre making methedrine in your bathtub at home  a complicated process but feasible  and so every time a new batch comes out you mail a sample to one of these labs for analysis and they write back no you havent got it quite right yet but if you cook it just perhaps five minutes longer this is what the police fear this is how the police mentality works and interestingly so does the drug pushers mentality the pushers are already doing precisely that i dont know to me it seems a sort of nice idea the drug pushers being interested in what theyre selling back in the old days they cared only that you lived long enough to pay for what you purchased after that you were on your own
	yes as every responsible parent knows street drugs are a problem a menace to their kids i completely emphatically agree at one time  you may have read this in biographical material accompanying my stories and novels  i was interested in experimenting with psychedelic drugs that is over for me i have seen too many ruined lives in our drug culture in california too many suicides psychoses organic  irreversible  damage to both heart and brain but there are other drugs not illegal not street drugs not cut with flash powder or milk sugar and not mislabeled that worry me even more these are reputable establishment drugs prescribed by reputable doctors or given in reputable hospitals especially psychiatric hospitals these are pacification drugs i mention this in order to return to my main preoccupation here the human versus the android and how the former can become  can in fact be made to become  the latter the calculated widespread and throughly sanctioned use of specific tranquilizing drugs such as the phenothiazines may not like certain illegal street drugs produce permanent brain damage but they can  and god forbid they do  produce what i am afraid i must call soul damage let me amplify
	it has been discovered recently that what we call mental illness or mental disturbance  such syndromes as the schizophrenias and the cyclothymic phenomena of manicdepression  may have to do with faulty brain metabolism the failure of certain brain catalysts such as serotonin and noradrenalin to act properly one theory holds that under stress too much amine oxidase production causes hallucinations disorientations and general mentational breakdown sudden shock especially at random and griefproducing such as loss of someone or something dear or the loss of something vital and taken for granted  this starts an overproduction of noradrenalin flowing down generally unused neural pathways overloading brain circuits and producing behavior which we call psychotic mental illness then is a biochemical phenomenon if certain drugs such as the phenothiazines are introduced brain metabolism regains normal balance the catalyst serotonin is utilized properly and the patient recovers or if a maoi drug is introduced  a mono amine oxidase inhibator  response to stress becomes viable and the person is able to function normally or  and this right now is the prince charming hope of the medical profession  lithium carbonate if taken by the disturbed patient will limit an otherwise overabundant production or release of the hormone noradrenalin which most of all acts to cause irrational thoughts and behavior of a socially unacceptable sort the entire amplitude of feelings wild grief anger fear any and all intense feelings will be reduced to proper measure by the presence of the lithium carbonate in the brain tissue the person will become stable predictable not a menace to others he will feel the same and think the same pretty much all day long day after day the authorities will not be greeted by any more sudden surprises emanating from him
	in the field of abnormal psychology the schizoid personality structure is well defined in it there is a continual paucity of feeling the person thinks rather than feels his way through life and as the great swiss psychiatrist carl jung showed this cannot be successfully maintained one must meet most of crucial reality with a feeling response anyhow there is a certain parallel between what i call the android personalityss and the schizoid both have a mechanical reflex quality
	i once heard a schizoid person express himself  in all seriousness  this way i receive signals from others but i cant generate any of my own until i get recharged by an injection i am i swear quoting exactly imagine viewing oneself and others this way signals as if from another star the person has reified himself entirely along with everyone around him how awful here clearly the soul is dead or never lived
	another quality of the android mind is the inability to make exceptions perhaps this is the essence of it the failure to drop a response when it fails to accomplish results but rather to repeat it over and over again lower life forms are skillful in offering the same response continually as are flashlights an attempt was made once to use a pigeon as a quality control technician on an assembly line part after part endless thousands of them passed by the pigeon hour after hour and the keen eye of the pigeon viewed them for deviations from the acceptable tolerance the pigeon could discern a deviation smaller than that which a human doing the same quality control could when the pigeon saw a part that was mismade it pecked a button which rejected the part and at the same time dropped a grain of corn to the pigeon as a reward the pigeon could go eighteen hours without fatigue and loved its work even when the grain corn failed  due to the supply running out i guess  the pigeon continued eagerly to reject substandard parts it had to be forcibly removed from its perch finally
	now if i had been that pigeon i would have cheated when i felt hungry i would have pecked the button and rejected a part just to get my grain of corn that would have occured to me after a long period passed in which i discerned no faulty parts because what would happen to the pigeon if god forbid no parts ever were faulty the pigeon would starve integrity under such circumstances would be suicidal really the pigeon had a life and death interest in finding faulty parts what would you do were you the pigeon and after say four days youd discerned no faulty parts and were becoming only feathers and bone would ethics win out or the need to survive to me the life of the pigeon would be worth more than the accuracy of the quality control if i were the pigeon  but the android mind i may be dying of hunger the android would say but ill be damned if ill reject a perfectly good part anyhow to me the authentically human mind would get bored and reject a part now and then at random just to break the monotony and no amount of circuit testing could reestablish its reliability
	let me now express another element that strikes me as an essential key revealing the authentically human it is not only an intrinsic property of the organism but the situation in which in finds itself that which happens to it that which it is confronted by pierced by and must deal with  certain agonizing situations create on the spot a human where a moment before there was only as the bible says clay such a situation can be read off the face of many of the medieval pietas the dead christ held in the arms of his mother two faces actually that of a man that of a woman oddly in many of these pietas the face of the christ seems much older than that of his mother it is if an ancient man is held by a young woman she has survived him and yet she came before him he has aged through his entire life cycle she looks now perhaps as she always did not timeless in the classical sense but able to transcend what has happened he has not survived it this shows on his face in some way they have experienced it together but they have come out of it differently it was too much for him it destroyed him perhaps the information to be gained here is to realize how much greater capacity a woman has for suffering that is not that she suffers more than a man but that she can endure where he cant survival of the species lies in her ability to do this not his christ may die on the cross and the human race continues but if mary dies its all over
	i have seen young women  say eighteen or nineteen years old  suffer and survive things that would have been too much for me and i think really for almost any man their humanness as they passed through these ordeals developed as an equation between them and their situation i dont mean to offer the mushy doctrine that suffering somehow ennobles that its somehow a good thing  one hears this now and then about geniuses they wouldnt have been geniuses if they hadnt suffered etc i merely mean that possibly the difference between what i call the android mentality and the human is that the latter passed through something the former did not or at least passed through it and responded differently  changed altered what it did and hence what it was it became i sense the android repeating over and over again some limited reflex gesture like an insect raising its wings threateningly over and over again or emitting a bad smell its one defense or response works or it doesnt but caught in sudden trouble the organism that is made more human that becomes precisely at that moment human wrestles deep within itself and out of itself to find one response after another as each fails on the face of the dead christ there is an exhaustion almost a dehydration as if he tried out every possibility in an effort not to die he never gave up and even though he did die did fall he died a human that is what shows on his face
	the endeavor to persist in its own being spinoza said is the essence of the individual thing the chthonic deities the earth mother were the original source of religious consolation  before the solarcentric masculine deities that arrived later in history  as well as the origin of man man came from her and returns to her the entire ancient world believed that just as each man came forth into individual life from a woman he would eventually return  and find peace at last at the end of life the old man in one of chaucers canterbury tales goes about both morning and late and knocks against the ground with his stick saying mother mother let me in   just as at the end of ibsens ghosts the middleaged man regressing into childhood at the end of his life as he dies of paresis says to his mother mother give me the sun as spinoza pointed out so clearly each finite thing each individual man eventually perishes and his only true consolation as he perishes as each society in fact perishes is this return to the mother the woman the earth
	but if woman is the consolation for man what is the consolation for woman for her
	i once watched a young woman undergo agonies  she was eighteen years old  that just witnessing her were too much for me she survived i think better than i did i wanted to console her help her but there was nothing i could do except be with her when the earth mother is suffering there is damn little that individual finite man can do this young girls boyfriend wouldnt marry her because she was pregnant by another boy he wouldnt live with her or find her a place to stay until she got an abortion  about which he would do nothing he wouldnt even speak to her until it was over  and then or so he promised he would marry her well she got the abortion and we brought her to my home afterward to rest and recover and of course the sonofabitch never had anything to do with her again i was with her during the days following her abortion and really she had dreadful time alone in a poor large ward in a hospital in another city never visited except by me and a couple of friends never phoned by her boyfriend or her own family and then at my home afterward when she realized her boyfriend was never going to get the apartment for them she had planned on been promised and her friends  his friends too  had lost interest in her and looked down on her  i saw her day by day decline and wilt and despair and become wild with fear where would she go what would become of her she had no friends no job no family not even any clothes to speak of  nothing and she couldnt stay with me after she healed up she used to lie in bed suffering holding the puppy she and i got at the pound the puppy was all she had and one day she left and i never found out where she went she never contacted me again she wanted to forget me and the hospital and the days of healing and bleeding and learning the truth about her situation and she left the puppy behind i have it now what i remember in particular was that in the two weeks she was with me after her abortion her breasts swelled with milk her body at least portions of it didnt know that the child was dead that there was no child it was she said in a bottle i saw her all at once as a sudden woman even though she had herself declined destroyed her motherhood baby or not she was a woman although her mind did not tell her that she still wore the cotton nightgown she had worn i guess while living at home while she went to high school  perhaps the same easytowash cotton nightgown she had worn since five or six years old she still liked to go to the market and buy chocolate milk and comic books under california law its illegal for her to buy or smoke cigarettes there are certain movies many in fact that our law prevents her from seeing movies supposedly about life on the trip to san francisco to see the doctor about getting the abortion  she was five and half months pregnant nearing what california considers the limit of safety  she bought a purple stuffed toy animal for 89 cents i paid for it she had only 25 cents she took it with her when she left my home she was the bravest brightest funniest sweetest person i ever knew the tragedy of her life bent her and virtually broke her despite all i could do but  i think i believe  the force that is her so to speak the swelling into maturity of her breasts the looking forward into the future of her physical body even at the moment that mentally and spiritually she was virtually destroyed  i hope anyhow that that force will prevail if it does not then there is nothing left as far as i am concerned the future as i conceive it will not exist because i can only imagine it as populated by modest unnoticed persons like her i myself will not be a part of it or even shape it all i can do is depict it as i see the ingredients now the gentle little unhappy brave lonely loving creatures who are going on somewhere else unknown to me now not recalling me but i pray living on picking up life forgetting  those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it we are told but perhaps it is better  perhaps it is the only viable way  to be able to forget i hope she in her head has forgotten what happened to her just as her body either forgot the lack of baby the dead baby or never knew it is a kind of blindness maybe a refusal or inability to face reality
	but i have never had too high a regard for what is generally called reality reality to me is not so much something that you perceive but something you make you create it more rapidly than it creates you man is the reality god created out of dust god is the reality man creates continually out of his own passions his own determination good for example  that is not a quality or even a force in the world or above the world but what you do with the bits and pieces of meaningless puzzling disappointing even cruel and crushing fragments all around us that seem to be pieces left over discarded from another world entirely that did maybe make sense
	the world of the future to me is not a place but an event a construct not by one author in the form of words written to make up a novel or story that other persons sit in front of outside of and read  but a construct in which there is no author and no readers but a great many characters in search of a plot well there is no plot there is only themselves and what they do and say to each other what they build to sustain all of them individually and collectively like a huge umbrella that lets in light and shuts out the darkness at the same instant when the characters die the novel ends and the book falls back into dust out of which it came or back like the dead christ into the arms of his warm tender grieving comprehending loving mother and a new cycle begings from her he is reborn and the story or another story perhaps different even better starts up a story told by the characters to one another a tale of sound and fury  signifying very much the best we have our yesterday our tomorrow the child who came before us and the woman who will live after us and outlast by her very existing what we have thought and done
	in my novel the three stigmata of palmer eldritch which is a study of absolute evil the protagonist after his encounter with eldritch returns to earth and dictates a memo this little section appears ahead of the text of the novel it is the novel actually this paragraph the rest is a sort of post mortem or rather a flashback in which all that came to produce the oneparagraph book is presented seventyfive thousand words which i labored over many months merely explains is merely there to provide background to the one small statement in the book that matters it is by the way missing fom the german edition this statement is for me my credo  not so much in god either a good god or a bad god or both  but in ourselves it goes as follows and this is all i actually have to say or want ever to say
	i mean after all you have to consider were only made out of dust thats admittedly not much to go on and we shouldnt forget that but even   considering i mean its a sort of bad beginning were not doing too bad so i personally   have faith that even in this lousy situation were faced with we can make it you get me
	this tosses a bizarre thought up into my mind perhaps someday a giant automated machine will roar and clank out from rust we are come and another machine sick and dying cradled in the arms of its woman may sigh back and to rust we are returned and peace will fall over the barren anxietystricken landscape
	our field science fiction deals with that portion of the lifecycle of our species which extends ahead of us but if it is a true cycle that future portion of it has in a sense already happened or at least we can on a basis almost mathematically precise map out the next missing integers in the sequence of which we are the past the first integer the earth mother culture next the masculine solar deities with their stern authoritarian societies from sparta to rome to fascist italy and japan and germany and the ussr and now perhaps what the medieval pietas looked forward to in the arms of earth mother who still lives the dead solar deity her son lies in a once again silent return to the womb fom which he came i think we are entering this third and perhaps final sequence of our history and this is a society that our field sees ahead of us which will be quite different from either of the two previous worldcivilizations familiar in the past it is not a twopart cycle we have not reached the conclusion of the masculine solar deity period to return merely to the primordial earth mother cult however full of milk her breasts may be what lies ahead is new and possibly beyond that lies something more unique and obscured to our gaze as of this moment i myself cant envision that far the realization the fulfillment of the medieval pieta as a living reality our total environment a living external environment as animate as ourselves  that is what i see and no further not yet anyhow i would myself be content with that i would be happy to lie slumbering and yet alive  invisible but dim as vaughn put it  in her arms
	if a pieta of a thousand years ago shaped by a medieval artisan anticipated in his  shall we say  psionic hands our future world what today might be the analog of that inspired precognitive artifact what do we have with us now as homely and familiar to us in our 20th century world as were those everyday pietas to the citizens of 13th century christendom that might be a microcosm of the fardistant future let us first start by imagining a pious peasant of 13th century france gazing up at a rustic pieta and foreseeing in it the 21st century society about which we science fiction writers speculate then as in a bergman film we segue to  what now one of us gazing at  what
	cycle  and recycle the pieta of our modern world ugly commonplace ubiquitous not the dead christ in the arms of his grieving eternal mother but a heap of aluminum budweiser beer cans eighty feet high thousands of them being scooped up noisily rattling and spilling and crashing and raining down as a giant automated computercontrolled homeostatic budweiser beer factory  an autofac as i called it once in a story  hugs the discarded empties back into herself to recycle them over again into new life with new living contents exactly as before or if the chemists in the budweiser lab are fulfilling gods divine plan for eternal progress with better beer than before
	we see as through a glass darkly paul says in first corinthians  will this someday be rewritten as we see as into a passive infrared scanner darkly a scanner which as in orwells 1984 is watching us all the time our tv tube watching back at us as we watch it as amused or bored or anyhow somewhat as entertained by what we do as we are by what we see on its implacable face
	this for me is too pessimistic too paranoid i believe first corinthians will be rewritten this way  the passive infrared scanner sees into us darkly that is not well enough to really figure us out not that we ourselves can really figure each other out or even our own selves which perhaps too is good it means we are still in for sudden surprises and unlike authorities who dont like that sort of thing we may find these chance happenings acting in our behalf to our favor
	sudden surprises by the way  and this thought may be in itself a sudden surprise to you  are a sort of antidote to paranoia or to be accurate about it to live in such a way as to encounter sudden surprises quite often or even now and then is an indication that you are not paranoid because to the paranoid nothing is a surprise everything happens exactly as he expected and sometimes even more so it all fits into his system maybe all systems  that is any theoretical verbal symbolic semantic etc formulation that attempts to act as an allencompassing allexplaining hypothesis of what the universe is about  are manifestations of paranoia we should be content with the mysterious the meaningless the contradictory the hostile and most of all the unexplainably warm and giving  total socalled inanimate environment in other words very much like a person like the behavior of one intricate subtle halfveiled deep perplexing and much to be loved human being to another to be feared a little too sometimes and perpetually misunderstood about which we can neither know or be sure we must only trust and make guesses toward not being what you thought not doing right by you not being just but then sustaining you as by momentary caprice but then abandoning you or at least seeming to what it is actually up to we may never know but at least this is better is it not than to possess the selfdefeating lifedefeating spurious certitude of the paranoid  expressed by a friend of mine humorously i guess like this doctor someone is putting something in my food to make me paranoid the doctor should have asked was that person putting it in his food free or charging him for it
	to refer back a final time to an early science fiction work with which we are all familiar the bible a number of stories in our field have been written in which computers print out portions of that august book i now herewith suggest this idea for a future story that a computer print out a man
	or if it cant get that together then as a second choice a very poor one in comparison a condensed version of the bible in the beginning was the end or should it go the other way in the end was the beginning whichever randomness in time will sort out which it is to be fortunately i myself am not required to make the choice
	perhaps when a computer is ready to churn forth one or the other of these two statements and android operating the computer will make the decision  although if i am correct about the android mentality it will be unable to decide and will print out both at once creating a selfcanceling nothing which will not even serve as a primordial chaos an android might however be able to handle this capable of some sort of decisionmaking power it might conceivably pick one statement or the other as quote correct but no android  and you will recall and realize that by this term i am summing up that whichis not human  no android would think to do what a brighteyed little girl i know did something a little bizarre certainly ethically questionable in several ways at least in any traditional sense but to me truly human in that it shows to me a spirit of merry defiance of spirited although not spiritual bravery and uniqueness
	one day while driving along in her car she found herself following a truck carrying cases of coca cola bottles case after case stacks of them and when the truck parked she parked behind it and loaded the back of her own car with cases as many cases of bottles of coca cola as she could get in so for weeks afterward she and her friends had all the coca cola they could drink free  and then when the bottles were empty she carried them to the store and turned them in for the deposit refund
	to that i say this god bless her may she live forever and the coca cola company and phone company and all the rest of it with their passive infrared scanners and sniperscopes and suchlike  may they be gone long ago metal and stone and wire and thread did never live but she and her friends  they our human future are our little song who knows if the spirit of men travels up and the breath of beasts travels down under the earth the bible asks someday it in a later revision may wonder who knows if the spirit of men travels up and the breath of androids travels down where do the souls of androids go after their death but  if they do not live then they cannot die and if they cannot die then they will always be with us do they have souls at all or for that matter do we
	i think as the bible says we all go to a common place but it is not the grave it is into life beyond the world of the future
