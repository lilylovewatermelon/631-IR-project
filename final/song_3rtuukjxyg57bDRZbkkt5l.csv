live each day like its your last
cause you never feel the moment til its passed hitmaka
ohoh
time just keeps on ticking fast you know
know theres danger in the lesson learned
slow down before you crash and burn

verse 1 geazy
these my dayones im surrounded by
so everyone you see me with is down to ride
these girls be goin crazy when they see the life
and i be selling dreams i know shes down to buy
the voices in my head tell me i should be honest
but i dont pay attention i dont hear their comments yeah
and its bananas what i spend on diamonds
understand me this is cut from nothing economics
living to the maximum all these checks im cashing em
cause this could disappear quicker than how fast it comes
and im so high im numb
living fast im lapping em
liquor drugs and sex addiction im all of em wrapped in one
see me hoppin in a wraith
putting 15 million in a safe
mama called on my birthday like hallelujah 28 you made it out of 27 safe

verse 2 geazy
never lose control but i get close to it
live in the moment im just tryna make the most of it
the other night i swear i took down the baddest bitch
i passed out she snuck a pic and she posted it
that makes a hundred problems i just counted it
everythings authentic this aint counterfeit
im just tryna make my mama proud of it
stay in control up until you spiral out of it
living fast as freeways i aint slept in three days
making money three ways keep on running these plays
and i dont need praise i need more paid days
need more vacays never took the safe way
im living like the villain does
they say karmas comin round but until it does
ima do these drugs til i feel a buzz
i aint slowin down im tryna live it up yeah
chorus kehlani  geazy

cause you never feel the moment til its passed you never know it til its gone yeah

time just keeps on ticking fast you know
know theres danger in the lesson learned
slow down before you crash and burn
