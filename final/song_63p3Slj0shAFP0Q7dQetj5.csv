intro drake
yeahâ€”sound sound sound
yeah real 6 side shit
sickos ah man

verse 1 drake
yeah when you get to where im at
you gotta remind em where the fuck you at
every time they talkin its behind your back
gotta learn to line em up and then attack
they gon say your name on them airwaves
they gon hit you up right after like its only rap
jewels look like i found a motherfuckin treasure map
and aint told no one where the fuck its at
shout out to the gs from the ends
we dont love no girls from the ends
im gon hit em with the wham once again
ima always end up as a man in the end dog
its just apparent every year
only see the truth when im staring in the mirror
lookin at myself like there it is there
yeah like there it is there man whoo
i aint tryna chance it i be with the bands
like a nigga went to jackson state or grambling
young nick cannon with the snare drum dancin
watch the way i handle it uh
bring it to the bedroom you know that shit is candle lit
she know im the man with it uh
with the bands like i mustve went to clark went to hampton
i aint playin with it

i aint felt the pressure in a little while
its gonna take some getting used to what you say
floatin all through the city with the windows down
puttin on like i used to what you say
they never told me when you get the crown
its gon take some getting used to what you say
new friends all in their old feelings now
they dont love you like they used to man
verse 2 drake
way more gully gully than buddy buddy
never needed your acceptance never needed nothin
yall dont understand im the one they want to hear from
yall dont understand that its me or nothin

shaq postin up on niggas that i used to have posters of
real quick man you couldnt have hated that
lets be real nigga you couldnt have made it that woo
dance how i dance watch me dance
youre fuckin with the best man im too advanced
after this drop i got new demands
cant meet the terms keep it movin then
make sure the plane got a phone now
so when we bout to land i can call to tell the woes im home now
ill tell em link up at the valet at the hazy
think i got the shit that had the city going crazy
chorus drake
i aint felt the pressure in a little while
its gonna take some getting used to what you say
floatin all through the city with the windows down
puttin on like i used to what you say
they never told me when you get the crown
its gon take some getting used to what you say
new friends all in their old feelings now
they dont love you like they used to man

verse 3 lil wayne
when you get to where the fuck im at
you gotta remind em about where you been
about all of the money that done came and went
about the two cents i aint never spent
when they say youre too famous to pack a gat
i gotta remind em about where im from
not about where im going about where ive gone
stepping on a swisher roach like a stepping stone
goin at a nigga throat like a herringbone
boy do i smell beef mmmm pheromones
got a fuckin halo over my devil horns
trap pumpin all night like chevron
suck a nigga dick for a iphone 6
fuck my nigga terry for a new blackberry
you can get buried for a ounce of katy perry
i was only five but still remember the drought in 87
lord tell em bitches i aint got no times to play games with em
i aint got no time
tell her that i love her and i hate her in the same sentence
im fuckin her mind
i got mind control over deebo
parmesan my panino
promethazine over pinot
and when my bloods start shootin thats broll bitch
chorus drake
i aint felt the pressure in a little while
its gonna take some getting used to what you say
floatin all through the city with the windows down
puttin on like i used to what you say
they never told me when you get the crown
its gon take some getting used to what you say
new friends all in their old feelings now
they dont love you like they used to man

outro drake
yeah they dont love you like they used to what you say
in the city with the windows down
like i used to what you say
like i
