stop it
go ye into all the world and preach my gospel

verse 1 violent j
i walked into the church dressed up as an alter boy
i seen the preacher he said little boy ima teach ya
put his hand up on my shoulder felt the claw of the beast
i never thought itd be so fuckin easy murderin a priest
we went into the confession booth he took off his clothes
and cut some yay right on his bible top and ooted his nose
i jammed a butchers knife twelve inches into his gut
he looked me right into my eyes while i was yankin it up
preacher killas

chorus
crooked preacher killas stop it
crooked preacher killas i gotta bloody em up

verse 2 shaggy 2 dope
i walked into the sermon strapped with an iron crowbar
i beat a nun into a bloody stew in the trunk of my car

we shootin for the preacher fuck i missed and hit the reverend
but it doesnt matter though they say hes goin to heaven
and then i shot for the preacher i blew his ear off
we in the balcony bustin gone off pcp and smirnoff
shot again i missed and hit somebody in the choir
they fell back into the candle rack and caught the place on fire
i shot again i finally caught the preacher in his dome
then we put our barrells to each others heads and took it home
