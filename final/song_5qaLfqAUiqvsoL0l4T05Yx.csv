holy water
cannot help you now
a thousand armies
couldnt keep me out
i dont want your money
i dont want your crown
see ive come to burn
your kingdom down
prechorus
holy water
cannot help you now
see ive come to burn
your kingdom down
and no rivers and no lakes
can put the fire out
im gonna raise the stakes
im gonna smoke you out

chorus
seven devils all around me
seven devils in my house
see they were there when i woke up this morning
ill be dead before the day is done
seven devils all around you
seven devils in your house
see i was dead when i woke up this morning
and ill be dead before the day is done

before the day is done

verse 2
and now all your love
will be exorcized
and we will find new saints
to be canonized
and its an evensong
its a litany
its a battle cry
its a symphony

chorus
seven devils all around me
seven devils in my house
see they were there when i woke up this morning
ill be dead before the day is done
seven devils all around you
seven devils in your house
see i was dead when i woke up this morning
and ill be dead before the day is done

postchorus
before the day is done
before the day is done
before the day is done
bridge
you cant keep it out
its coming through the walls
to devastate your heart
and to take your soul
for what has been done
cannot be undone
in the eagles eye
in the evensong

outro
seven devils all around you
seven devils in your house
see i was dead when i woke up this morning
ill be dead before the day is done
before the day is done22embed"
