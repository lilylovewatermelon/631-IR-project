modest i be in interviews so niggas hatin
cause i play it like i no have no clue that im the greatest uh
tori come sit up on this dick i see you waiting wait
need a baby cause im too young and wild to be the savior
nail me to the cross and im just hanging
least they left the serpent in my fingers im just smoking
players from my city rarely make it to a poster
less you got a warrant what you got in that corolla
oh officer just boosie boo and dg yola
wont let them haters get me down
thats what they told us
its funny how they blame the south
when they weak shit dont blow up
we came with all the funk
while niggas act like they dont know us they didnt
just living a lie ogs acting like hoes
we couldnt rekindle the fire
nigga retire nigga catch up with the time
i can see more than the block block
i can see more than your spot spot
i dont be stuck in the past past
homie im puffing the grass grass
holding my cup like a strap strap
look at my southerner ass

niggas try to tell you what you want
niggas rarely give you what you need
bitch i came right here with the bounce the bounce
and if that aint enough i got some weed
yeah cause niggas try to tell you what you want
but niggas rarely give you what you need
bitch i came right here with the bounce the bounce
and if that aint enough i got some weed

verse 2
quiet i be in living room
cuh nigga shaded
with my nia long
i sing her a song she masturbatin
then bring me along
she got something to say like larry david
but i leave her lone
ho i gotta go i got a baby
stuck in babylon
niggas carry bombs and carry rabies
who gon speak for you
who gon sing your song if you dont play this
i got stress for days
picture you go home and you that nigga
but cant pay your bill
you cant buy no diapers for your lil one
dont you pay for thrill
child support is like a check away
how you chill with kendrick
do you smoke with q and dr dre dre
least today is real
i should ask some groupie for some face face
just a stepping stone
least them kind of bitches know their place place
this my second home
this where favorite rappers get replaced placed
this what the niggas from the south
gon kill that doubt it bring the bass bass
and bitch i came here right here with an ounce
and if that aint enough you gotta leave ahh bitch
hook
niggas try to tell you what you want
but niggas rarely give you what you need
ayy bitch i came right here with the bounce the bounce
and if that aint enough i got some weed
yeah cause niggas try to tell you what you want
but niggas rarely give you what you need whoa
bitch i came right here with the bounce the bounce
and if that aint enough i got some weed
yeah yeah66embed"
