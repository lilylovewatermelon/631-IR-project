we live like there aint no tomorrow
no regrets no time for the sorrow
keep movin one foot in front of the other
we all looking for something hey hey hey

im in the center lane on a freeway
my radiator blown on a 100 degree day
and im more in a hurry than i was before
and once again the whole world is in my way
so this is earth and im stuck here
where profanity pours from faces like mine
and the only thing that were sure of is
is were runnin out of money patience and time
one step forward and two steps back
and were wishin for a future reminiscing on a flashback
chasin a dream hopin it exists
and were grittin our teeth and clinchin our fists

hook
we live like there aint no tomorrow
no regrets no time for the sorrow
keep movin one foot in front of the other
we all looking for something hey hey hey

am i crazy maybe my brain be gravy
insane the days we have witnessed lately
it pains my greatly someone could hate me
maybe they were lied to as babies too
cant see logic we camouflage it
technology allows us to dip and dodge it
wit magic gadgets wires and magnets
were standin stagnant and thinking backwards
a whole of bunch of nothing is in our way
i said a whole of bunch of nothing is in our way
a whole of bunch of nothing is in our way
i said a whole of bunch of nothing is in our way
see rehab liveget tickets as low as 33you might also likehook
we live like there aint no tomorrow
no regrets no time for the sorrow
keep movin one foot in front of the other
we all looking for something hey hey heyembed"
