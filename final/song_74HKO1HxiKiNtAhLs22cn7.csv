love  love  love  loveeeee
shit this for all my independent black queens
man you know how we do it
haha
hunnn

course
all my indie queens hands high
red lip stick  mac make up ya fly
even without it  i can still say you a dime
ponytail boy shorts
you ain’t even gotta try
look
you worked hard as ever
been out since ‘09
studying to get them g’s
you ain’t in for wasting time
bad girl turned to a boss bitch in her prime
i know niggas gone hate it
when you hit 35 hold up

verse
i fucked over good women
for thinking i was a victim
i done got blinded for thinking you was just like em
had to fix myself  get on my grind
so i can wife you
quick to cut a nigga off
but i’m lucky cause i’m here with you  fuck
you might also likei love how you hold me down
and you so submissive
confidence been wearing you down
here’s some new clothes to fit in
hennessy got us on edge
no  i’m not tripping
lord forgive me if i die bout my bitch
she got me whipped anddddd

i see yo momma
had the honors to look in her face
no wonder why you so cold
i notice you got her ways
a perfect picture but i’m just tryna
provide the frame
you get around some boss shit
i know you tired of fucking lames
playing tory lanez
touring  switching lanes confident
seen you in the club
i had to get you  it was obvious
that nigga that you had ain’t got a bag
and it’s obvious
cause why you only sipping one drink
claiming you out of it  look

course
all my indie queens hands high
red lip stick  mac make up ya fly
even without it  i can still say you a dime
ponytail boy shorts
you ain’t even gotta try
look
you worked hard as ever
been out since ‘09
studying to get them g’s
you ain’t in for wasting time
bad girl turned to a boss bitch in her prime
i know niggas gone hate it
when you hit 35 hold up

verse 2
i like my bitch dark skin with a lot of ass
spent bout a hunnid wit the plug
but we gone make it back
i don’t like that touchy
keep her from me
less i bring her back
i ain’t tryna break ya heart
i’m tryna fuck and break ya back
spent bout a hunnid on hmmmmmm
i don’t like to brag
fuck baggage claim
i’m chilling on the plane with a pack
soak my goyard with the henny
had to drink the act
man why these niggas claim they bulls
when we know they rats  this is for my queens
i fell in love wit the hennessy
i’m drinking again
i pray to god everyday cause i know ima sin
we in all white and yellow
like we left the vaticans
told my bro don’t buy no mo rollie’s
til we karats in
all the fake pump
is what niggas on when they can’t pay the rent
for that 50 cent  we grabbed the nine
and pray for many men
this shit a trend  can’t even walk the hood
without the blamma
niggas getting killed for speaking
that incorrect gramma
ya digembed"
