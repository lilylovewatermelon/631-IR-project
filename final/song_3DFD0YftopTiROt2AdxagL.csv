try an keep it by the reigns
im a lone drifter big money flipper
take anything you got on the rocks in a snifter
i missed her in kentucky went down to louisiana
i never had no loving like i had in alabama
a man of my word and out to hurt nobody
im just a mc to keep the boogie in the party
been sittin lodi dodi since 84 and
ill be sitting lodi dodi till im eighty four
i couldnt ask for more lifes been sweet
so you can save the planet ill save your seat

ive been gone for weeks i aint slept in days
i cant find myself in this self made maze
its been so long since ive been fine
im just trying to see the bottom of this bottle of wine
and i know ill see better days
well i know youll see things my way

i never thought about change until
spend a little time where time stood still
been looking for a mill but i keep coming up shy
i been a broke fool i aint trying to be that guy
wanna ride like lightning roll like thunder
im trying to get some money i aint getting any younger
at times i wonder at at times i wont
sometimes i give a fuck but most times i dont
dont dont even care
through stained glass windows these eyes stare
i try to stay straight but its kicking my ass
everytime i look ahead i get a glimpse of the past
i sit half mass like a soldiers flag
thats why my left leg limps and my dickies sag
its been so long since ive been fine
im just trying to see the bottom of this bottle of wine
and i know ill see better days
well i know youll see things my way
and i know ill see better days
well i know youll see things my way
see uncle kracker liveget tickets as low as 68you might also likewell i been all around this crooked land
i came across all walks i shook jim beams hand
i got no plans and no place to go
it keeps getting harder to just say no
i see the people laugh and people cry
thats how some live and thats how some die
well me myself im gonna sit right here
and im a watch this this world break down in tears
all my fears and dark gray skies
couldnt crack my smile or break my stride
got too much pride i got too much shout
i might be down but i still aint out
got to much time and thats all i have
when i leave this world ill still be sad
its been so long since ive been fine
im just trying to see the bottom of this bottle of wine
and i know ill see better days
well i know youll see things my way
and i know ill see better days
well i know youll see things my way1embed"
