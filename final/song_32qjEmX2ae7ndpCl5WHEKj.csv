lets go

verse 1
so down and digging i lost myself
but its the last time i bloodied my hands
im living in vain
i never promised you a damn thing
that i cant promise myself
and here we go

prechorus
ticktock ticktock ticktock

chorus
in the eye of the storm i make my stand
but im not waiting for the walls to close in
i just brace myself for winds to change their ways
in the eye of the storm im making my stand

verse 2
with a brokedown spirit
youre crawlin in the middle
dont you point your finger in my face
cause every bad decision that you made
youre livin with and everyone else is to blame
and here we go
