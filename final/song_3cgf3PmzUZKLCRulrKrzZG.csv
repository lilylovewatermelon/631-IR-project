theres no way out of an angry crowd without steppin on some toes
theyll scream your name til the lights go out then theyll feed you to the wolves
its hard to say who youll be when they let those big red curtains close
you know this cause you told me so

prechorus
i bet you forgot
black heels in the summertime
dads bad cookin though youd be polite
honey now you got a look that i dont recognize
you pulled me aside and you said

chorus
to know me is to hate me
is to hate what ive become
its to watch me as im fallin
from that laddеrs last rung
its to feel it like a secret
you cant keep in im not thе way i was
im not the way i was

postchorus
mm mmmmmm hmmmm mm

verse 2
were you freed within did you leave your skin
are you tethered in your doubt
have you breathed it in til its medicine that you cannot live without
cause you came back home a fuckin alien and were stuck here on the ground
call your mom back kid before the high comes down
see noah kahan liveget tickets as low as 102you might also likeprechorus
cause you forgot
black heels in the summertime
dirt road smoking on a friday night
honey now you got a look that i dont recognize
you pulled me aside and you said

chorus
to know me is to hate me
is to hate what ive become
its to watch me as im fallin
from that ladders last rung
its to feel it like a secret
you cant keep in im not the way i was
im not the way i was
but to feel it to see it
the look in all their eyes
is to breathe in to be in
the good grace of that godlight
its to have it in your hands
the one thing you wanted all your life
its all mine

bridge
its a hole i cant fill its a curse i cant break
and i gave my soul to it and i cannot be reclaimed
i was younger then i was younger then
i was young
chorus
to know me is to hate me
is to hate what ive become
its to watch me as im fallin
from that ladders last rung
its to feel it like a secret
you cant keep in im not the way i was
im not the way i was
but to feel it to see it
the look in all their eyes
is to breathe in to be in
the good grace of that godlight
its to have it in your hands
the one thing you wanted all your life
its all mine

outro
and to feel it to see it
the look in all your eyes
is to breathe in to be in
the good grace of this godlight
its to have it in your hands
the one thing i wanted all my life
its all mine1embed"
