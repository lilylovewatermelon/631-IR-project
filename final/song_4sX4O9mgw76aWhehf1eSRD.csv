verse 1
well look at all those fancy clothes
but these could keep us warm just like those
and what about your soul is it cold is it
straight from the mold and ready to be sold
and cars and phones and diamond rings
bling bling but those are only removable things
and what about your mind does it shine are
are there things that concern you more than your time

chorus
gone goin gone everything gone give a damn
gone be the birds when they dont wanna sing
gone people all awkward with their things
gone

verse 2
look at you out to make a deal
you try to be appealing but you lose your peel
and what about those shoes youre in today
theyll do no good on the bridges you burnt along the way oh
you willing to sell anything gone with your herd
leave your footprints well shame them with our words
gone people all careless and consumed gone

gone be the birds if they dont wanna sing
gone people all awkward with their things
