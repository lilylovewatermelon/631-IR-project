trying to be
to be so strong
i look into your eyes and say hello
so hopelessly
i wait for your reply
when suddenly you grab me close
and press your lips to mine
you read my mind

chorus
every memory
every embrace
every time my lips touch your face
theres nothing like loving you nothing like loving you
theres nothing like loving you nothing like loving you
every single touch
forever be on my mind
cross my heart
dont know why
theres nothing like loving you
theres nothing like loving you
loving you

verse 2
