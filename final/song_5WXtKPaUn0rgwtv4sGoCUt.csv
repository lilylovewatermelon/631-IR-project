can i untape the clips and chill
show my niggas its real
can my people shop in beverly hills
i got a lot of work i know thats gonna be ahead of me still
but my beast mentality gon keep me ahead of the field
pardon me but i got paper to chase
now cut through the talking and bring me straight to the safe
i know where the cameras at and im destroying the tape
im not leaving no evidence for the forensic to trace
i got a problem on my hand a few bills i aint been payin
i figured about a lil less than 75 grand
and my dog rocky caught a nickel for a pistol
its serious when the federales comin to get you
life is at a standstill out here in this damn field
what you say can get you and ya mans killed
its my last chance to come up its gotta be it
juvi comin out the firstround lottery pick
