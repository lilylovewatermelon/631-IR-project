intro russell crowe from gladiator
are you not entertained are you not entertained
is this not why you are here

interlude jayz
turn the music up turn me down
guru lets go get em again
this time its for the money my nigga
brooklyn stand up

verse 1 jayz
theres never been a nigga this good for this long
this hood or this pop this hot or this strong
with so many different flows this ones for this song
the next one i switch up this one will get bit up
these fucks too lazy to make up shit they crazy
they dont paint pictures they just trace me
you know what soon they forget where they plucked
their whole style from then try to reverse the outcome
im like taa
im not a biter im a writer for myself and others
i say a big verse im only biggin up my brother
biggin up my borough im big enough to do it
im that thorough plus i know my own flow is foolish
so them rings and things you sing about bring em out
its hard to yell when the barrels in your mouth
im in new sneakers dualseaters few divas
what more can i tell you let me spell it for you
wi doublel ie
nobody truer than hov
and im back for more new yorks ambassador
prime minister back to finish my business up

what more can i say
what more can i do
i gave this up to you
i know this much is true true true
my love

break jayz
what more can i say to you you heard it all

verse 2 jayz
you already know what im about flyin birds down south
movin wet off the step purple rain in a drought
stuntin on hoes brushin off my shirt
but aint nothin on my clothes cept my chain my name
young ho pitch the yay faithful
even if they patrol i make payroll
benz paid for friends they roll
private jets down to turks and caicos
cris caseloads i dont give a shit
nigga one life to live i cant let a day go
by without me bein fly fresh to death
head to toe til the day i rest
and i dont wear jerseys im 30plus
give me a crisp pair of jeans nigga buttonups
s dots on my feet make my cipher complete
what more can i say guru play the beat
break jayz humv
my nigga hahahaha woo
we gon let this ride into the hook
 ima snap my fingers on this one
what more can i say to you
 get my grown man on
lets go
what more can i say

verse 3 jayz
now you know your ass is willie when they got you in the mag
for like half a billy and your ass aint lilywhite
that mean that shit you write must be illy
either that or your flow is silly its both
i dont mean to boast but damn if i dont brag
them crackers gon act like i aint on they ass
the martha stewart thats far from jewish
far from a harvard student just had the balls to do it
and no im not through with it
in fact im just previewin it
this aint the show im just eqin it
onetwo and i wont stop abusin it
to groupie girls stop false accusin it
back to the music the maybach roof is translucent
niggas got a problem houston
what up b they cant shut up me
shut down i not even pe ima ride
god forgive me for my brash delivery
but i remember vividly what these streets did to me
so picture me lettin these clowns nitpick at me
paint me like a pickany
i will literally kiss tt in the forehead
tell her please forgive me then squeeze into your forehead
im not the one to score points off in fact
i got a joint thatll knock your points off
young hova the god nigga blast for me
im at the trump international ask for me
i aint never scared im everywhere you aint never there
and nigga why would i ever care
pound for pound im the best to ever come around here
excludin nobody look what i embody
the soul of a hustler i really ran the street
a ceos mind that marketin plan was me
and no i aint get shot up a whole bunch of times
or make up shit in a whole bunch of lines
and i aint animated like say a busta rhymes
but the real shit you get when you bust down my lines
add that to the fact i went plat a bunch of times
times that by my influence on pop culture
im supposed to be number one on everybody list
well see what happens when i no longer exist
fuck this man
