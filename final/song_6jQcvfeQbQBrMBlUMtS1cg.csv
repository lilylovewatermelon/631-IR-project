bitch

verse
see mama she raised her a savage
went and took it if i didnt have it
see i can do magic
i can get rid of my gun and still beat your ass like your daddy
we thirsty we blitzin like madden
in traffic with full automatic
im clutchin and speedin while drivin
left hand on the wheel like i got it
not hidin how you could not find us
always muggin so please do not mind us
its the pills its fuckin our minds up
when we flyin we drip in designer
dont look back 12 stay behind us
flashbacks of me in them lineups
no i cannot go i aint no ho put the pedal to the floor
my life a movie we shootin
you got a gun but dont use it
the drugs we abuse it i aint abusive
beat an opp bitch like she stupid
im chillin at ruth chris just me and my new bitch
you stressin and goin bald
baby you on that fu shit
pull over i think thats him
matter fact gang thats them
see the one with the fade got a limp
i thought he was dead but fuck that shit
i want him i want him i want him
pull up on em up on em up on em
i swear that boy is a goner
tried to run but i got up on em
tried to run but i got up on em
he need a new kidney you donate
my shoes by gucci you know it
you payin that shit if you owe it
my mamas first born im the oldest
huh what
