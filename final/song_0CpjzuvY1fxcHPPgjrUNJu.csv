wake up
a voice hits the air on a lonely coast
and ill sing along like a prayer for you
i can dream up the words
ill never see your face again

chorus
if we wake at
if we wake at all
she sings to me
if we wake at
if we wake at all

verse 2
well try to change
they say love will never mean a thing
still our hearts beat
so come on

bridge
so stuck on the only thing that we know
what we know starts to waste

chorus
if we wake at
if we wake at all
she sings to me
if we wake at
if we wake at allsee pierce the veil liveget tickets as low as 65you might also like4embed"
