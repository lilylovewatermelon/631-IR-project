dear friend as you know
your flowers are withering
your mothers gone missing
your leaves have drifted away
but the clouds are clearing up
and ive come reveling
burning incandescently
like a bastard on the burning sea

chorus passion pit
youre just like your father
buried deep under the water
youre resting on your laurels
and stepping on my toes
whose side are you on
what side is this anyway
put down your sword and crown
come lay with me on the ground

verse 2 passion pit
you come beating like moths wings
spastic and violently
whipping me into a storm
shaking me down to the core
but you run away from me
and you left me shimmering
like diamond wedding rings
spinning dizzily down on the floor
you might also likechorus passion pit
youre just like your father
buried deep under the water
youre resting on your laurels
and stepping on my toes
whose side are you on
what side is this anyway
put down your sword and crown
come lay with me on the ground

chorus passion pit
youre just like your father
buried deep under the water
youre resting on your laurels
and stepping on my toes
whose side are you on
what side is this anyway
put down your sword and crown
come lay with me on the ground6embed"
