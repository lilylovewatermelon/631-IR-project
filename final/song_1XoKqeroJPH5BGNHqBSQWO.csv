voted most likely
to end up on the back of a milk box drink
looks like im letting em down
cause 775
isnt worth an hour of my hardworking time
when you cant afford half the  they advertise
oh im worth more than a x
more than a toetagged generation full of regrets
oh i wont settle no oh
oh i cant settle

pre chorus
i wanna break the mold wanna break the stereotype
fist in the air im not going down without a fight

chorus
its my life
and im not sitting on the sidelines watching
it pass me by
im leaving you my legacy i
gotta make my mark i gotta run it hard
i want you to remember me
im leaving my fingerprints
im leaving my fingerprints
im leaving my fingerprints on you

rather than end up begging on the streets
trading undertable favors for a place to sleep
cause im worth more than this

i can focus my attention

pre chorus
i wanna break the mold wanna break the stereotype
fist in the air im not going down without a fight

chorus
its my life
and im not sitting on the sidelines watching
it pass me by
im leaving you my legacy i
gotta make my mark i gotta run it hard
i want you to remember me
im leaving my fingerprints
im leaving my fingerprints

bridge
dont give up
but dont give in
build your house on the rock
oh not in the sand in the sand in the sand in the sand
chorus
its my life
and im not sitting on the sidelines watching
it pass me by
im leaving you my legacy i
i gotta make my mark i gotta run it hard
i want you to remember me
its my life
and im not sitting on the sidelines watching i want you to remember me
