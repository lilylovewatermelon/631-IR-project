you talkin bout fiction hold up pardon my back
im talkin bout life life life
and all i hear is oh yeah he keeps talkin bout crack
i aint talkin bout profit im talkin bout pain
im talkin bout despair im talkin bout shame
i aint talkin bout gossip i aint talkin bout game

he couldve made more but he aint sign his contract
as far as street guys we was dealin crack
thats just how the game goes i dont owe nobody jack

but i dont have a beard and santa claus aint black
i repeat you cant sit on my lap
i dont have a beard now get off my sack—scream at me

verse 3 jayz
and now that thats that lets talk about the future
we have just seen the dream as predicted by martin luther
now you could choose to sit in front of your computer
posin with guns shootin youtube up
or you could come with me to the white house get your suit up
you stuck on being hardcore i chuck the deuce up
peace out medusa
welcome to the blueahprintah trepiece jayz your tutor
tooter of my own horn beep beep moo ya
rass clot when rude boy come through with the roof up
so i could see the sky
cause everybody talkin hov i think we know why

chorus luke steele
they talk we live
we see what they say they say they say
they talk we did
who cares what they say they say they say
