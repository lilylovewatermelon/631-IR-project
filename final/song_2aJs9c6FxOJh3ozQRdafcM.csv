this could be my last song ho
it feel like im dying on that x ho
yeah i be taking percs just for my head ho
had to let you know i said woah
i just told you dont come in the door i said go
i had to tell yall i had to let you know you not my ho
i just take the perc and then i float
i pull up and i turn up talking bout a yeah show
my money get taller every day yeah it grow

verse
yeah i went and ran it up i had enough
went and switched the benz i had it scuffed

yeah you know i call everyone i call your bluff
yeah you know you know the tonka is my truck
couldnt decide on thе perc or the x i took em both
wе just laughin at your music you a joke yeah
these bitches jumpin on me like some rope

yeah you not my twizz you not my twin you not my bro yeah
i just picked up on the side i let it go
i just pulled up on your side im in your ho yeah
i just pulled up made a mess and then i go
im richer than a bitch i run the world

now go head pull up on the cops and hit the swerve
i tried to tell you everything you wouldnt learn
