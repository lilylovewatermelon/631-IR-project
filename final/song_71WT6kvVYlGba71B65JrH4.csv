how are you feeling how are you doing
im sorry i just wanted to hear your voice so clear
what are you thinking am i amusing
its so strange to talk after all these years
what is the meaning its so confusing
all my old feelings coming back to me
when was the last time that i saw your face
know it like the back of my hand id say
and youre not that dumb anymore
i picked up the books you threw to the floor
put them back on the shelf
dont you see how much i want your help

chorus clairo
and i know were not the same as we were
used to be falling hard but now it just hurts me so bad
and you know that i cant hold back
all of these worries that i have had bout you

and i know that its time
to forget how im feeling dont want to give in
but i know know that its right
to listen to my breathing and start believing myself
and i know that its time
