run

verse 1
breaking my back until i cant even stand
im working my hands until my calluses bled again
im breaking my back for the man
im living like this is the end last chance its time to dance

chorus
run for your life i see the enemy
run for your life and its a part of me
run for your life cattle humanity
programmed inside of me
freedoms a lie run for your life

verse 2
look at our time and wonder where it was spent
working our lives until we cant recognize ourselves
im breaking my back for the man
im living like this is the end last chance its time to dance

chorus
run for your life i see the enemy
run for your life and its a part of me
run for your life cattle humanity
programmed inside of me
freedoms a lie run for your life
you might also likebridge
consequences of living in a lie
paid with time
consequences they will arise arise

chorus
run for your life i see the enemy
run for your life and its a part of me
run for your life cattle humanity
programmed inside of me
freedoms a lie run for your life

outro
i want you to consume me now dont care how
because the only time is now
wont you consume me now dont care how
because the only time is now
run for your lifeembed"
