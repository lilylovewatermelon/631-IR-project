cause i dont wanna be like this
ive been running these streets for too long now
ive got nothing its true but this song now
but the further i go i wanna go home
cause i dont wanna be like this
ive been running these streets for too long now
ive got nothing its true but this song now
but the further i go i wanna go home

verse 1 johnny 3 tears
i fucking swear that i care but its hard when you stare
into the bottom of a bottle that is empty and bare
oh my desolate soul in my desolate home
its my desolate role yeah im here all alone
i cant think of a reason to get the fuck out of bed
curtains closed lights are off am i alive or dead
i havent shaved in a week i always slur when i speak
tolerance at its peak another fifth just to sleep
oh woe is me woe is me i guess i need love
and hoes you see hoes you see im just in a rut
and i swear im trying baby please baby dont leave
goddamn im a fuck up but i guess thats just me
so i sit in my room and i cry in my bed
thinking about all the shit that made me wrong in my head
i keep trying to climb but it seems so steep
pour myself a fucking whiskey and go back to sleep bitch

verse 2 johnny 3 tears
i watch my mama cry she says baby why
i say baby died babys gone like a suicide
i dont think youll see him soon mom stay out my room mom
tell daddy that i hate that motherfucker like you mom
i sing this shit for you danny sascha and jordon
these beers keep getting warmer every time that i hold em
i pour this out for you like a partner in crime
its a part of the times when youre sick in the mind
yeah im sick oh so sick im so sick of this shit
yeah im lit oh so lit im so fucked up off it
so i stumble around till i stumble fall down
into this puddle of my tears laying here on the ground
when youve got nothing left youve got nothing left to lose
with my last this single breath ill still be singing to you
so when you bury me man you better bury me deep
and sing along to this song cause youre broken like me
