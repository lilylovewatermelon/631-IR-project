what a shame we all became
such fragile broken things
a memory remains
just a tiny spark
i give it all my oxygen
to let the flames begin
so let the flames begin
oh glory
oh glory

chorus
this is how we’ll dance when
when they try to take us down
this is what we’ll be oh glory

verse 2
somewhere weakness is our strength
and ill die searching for it
i cant let myself regret
such selfishness
my pain and oh the trouble caused
no matter how long
i believe that theres hope
buried beneath it all and
hiding beneath it all and
growing beneath it all and

when they try to take us down
this is how well sing oh
this is how well stand when
when they burn our houses down
this is what well be oh glory

reaching as i sink down into light into light

chorus
this is how well dance when
when they try to take us down
this is how well sing oh
this is how well stand when
when they burn our houses down
this is what well be oh glory15embed"
