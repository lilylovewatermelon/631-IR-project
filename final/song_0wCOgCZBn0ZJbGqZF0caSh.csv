i see your face in the frame on my desk
it meant a lot now it means a lot less
its just a place for the dust in my room to rest

i see the letters that were written for me
they said you cared and i totally believed
they didnt mention that five months later youd leave

chorus
you couldve told me anything
you couldve told me anything
you couldve told me anything
to make me understand
cause i dont understand

verse 2
i see the bracelet you gave me back then
made it for me so id never forget
it must have worked cause i havent forgotten you yet

i see the bed where we used to mess around
wed talk for hours before youd go down
that was before you decided not to keep me around

chorus
you couldve told me anything
you couldve told me anything
you couldve told me anything
to make me understand
you couldve told me anything
you couldve told me anything
you couldve told me anything
to make me understand
cause i dont understand
you might also likebridge
you could have told me why you had to go
i try to tell myself just let it go
but i see your face
its everywhere i go

chorus
you couldve told me anything
you couldve told me anything
you couldve told me anything
to make me understand
you couldve told me anything
you couldve told me anything
you couldve told me anything
to make me understand
cause i dont understand
no i dont understandembed"
