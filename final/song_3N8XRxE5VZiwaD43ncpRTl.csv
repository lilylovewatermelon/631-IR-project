kick them heels off baby
you look like you need a drink
yeah its been crazy lately
we need a night dont you think
you aint gotta lift a finger so girl dont you dare
ill light the candles on the mantle let em take it from there

chorus
so dont you worry bout the whiskey thats on jack
if you need a little throwback thats on cash
we could turn the tv on fuzz
we could throw our clothes on that rug
the way i see it that only leaves
lovin on you and thats on me
lovin on you girl thats on me

verse 2
i got a few things baby
here on my list of todos
ima check em off one by one
probably gonna take me all night long
if you want it girl you got it anything under the moon
tonight its all about you

chorus
so dont you worry bout the whiskey thats on jack
if you need a little throwback thats on cash
we could turn the tv on fuzz
we could throw our clothes on that rug
the way i see it that only leaves
lovin on you and thats on me
lovin on you girl thats on me
