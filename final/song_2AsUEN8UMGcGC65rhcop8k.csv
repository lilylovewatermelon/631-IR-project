since the day you and i snuck away to be alone
i knew from that night something special went on
it must have been the first kiss
you told me that nobody else in the world made you feel this
i felt the same way too but nothing stays the same
im sorry for the tears im sorry for the pain
you were the one that always made things right
i promise you this though you got a friend for life
maybe one day we can try it again
and maybe things can be a little different
so lets jus kiss and say goodbye
cuz i really cant stand the pain of seeing you cry
angie
ive given everything given everything
i loved you endlessly
but when it comes to me
you dont even notice me forgive me baby
ive given everything yeah
i loved you endlessly oooh
but when it comes to me
you dont even notice me
nb ridaz

now you treat like if im not here
i love you and i need you dont want to let go
if you want somebody else please let me know
cant take it no more i feel im dying inside
is this the price i pay for handing you my life

i gave you my good and my bad
my heart and my soul
my trust my money my time
what more could you ask for in a man
even when times are hard
i held out my arms and held you
even accepted you through whatever weather
but now i feel it were at the end of the road
whatever we had now i got to let go
nights like this i wish raindrops would fall
to cover my tears
wishing i could replace all those wasted years
of loving someone who couldnt love me back
and now again i got to start from scratch
but i know ive given you my everything
angie
ive given everything given everything
i loved you endlessly
but when it comes to me
you dont even notice me
ive given everything yeah
i loved you endlessly oooh
but when it comes to me
