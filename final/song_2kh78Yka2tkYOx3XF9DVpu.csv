kill jayz theyll never love you
youll never be enough lets just keep it real jayz
fuck jayz i mean you shot your own brother
how can we know if we can trust jayz
and you know better nigga i know you do
but you gotta do better boy you owe it to blue
you had no father you had the armor
but you got a daughter gotta get softer
die jayz this aint back in the days
you dont need an alibi jayz
cry jayz we know the pain is real
but you cant heal what you never reveal
whats up jayz you know you owe the truth
to all the youth that fell in love with jayz
you got people you love you sold drugs to
you got high on the life that shit drugged you
you walkin around like you invincible
you dropped outta school you lost your principles
i know people backstab you i felt bad too
but this fuck everybody attitude aint natural
but you aint a saint this aint kumbaye
but you got hurt because you did cool by ye
you gave him twenty million without blinkin
he gave you twenty minutes on stage fuck was he thinkin
fuck wrong with everybody is what you sayin
but if everybodys crazy youre the one thats insane
crazy how life works
you got a knot in your chest imagine how a knife hurts
you stabbed un over some records
your excuse was he was talkin too reckless
let go your ego over your right shoulder
your left is sayin finish your breakfast
you egged solange on
knowin all along all you had to say you was wrong
you almost went eric benét
let the baddest girl in the world get away
i dont even know what else to say
nigga never go eric benét
i dont even know what you woulda done
in the future other niggas playin football with your son
you woulda lost it
13 bottles of ace of spade what it did to boston
nah jayz
