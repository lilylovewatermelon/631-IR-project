all fellas please listen up to me
i sincerely say these words
what goes around comes back around
i hope you feel me cuz im not hating no
if you keep doing these girls wrong
somebodys gonna do us wrong
its reality i need you here with me
if we keep breaking these girls hearts
somebodys gonna break our hearts
its reality now i know what i need

chorus
is one girl to love
give her all of me
one girl to love
give her everything she needs yeah

verse 2
its time for me to hang up my cleets
cuz my playing games are over
and i need the right one here with me
my friends dont understand why
lately i dont hang out all night
someday theyll feel me
but im not hating no
if you keep doing these girls wrong
somebodys gonna do us wrong
its reality its reality
need you here with me
if we keep breaking these girls hearts
somebodys gonna break our hearts
its reality now i know what i need
you might also likechorus
break
only if i had a girl like you
so all some insecure
searching for perfection would be true
words cannot describe the feeling
i pray to god that i meet you some day
maybe in church on sunday
ill be patient
