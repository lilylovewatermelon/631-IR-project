i can feel you breathing
with your hair on my skin
as we lie here within
the night
ill pull those sheets
when its cold on your feet
cause youll fall back to sleep
every time

chorus
grow old with me
let us share what we see
and all the best it could be
just you and i

verse 2
and our hands they might age
and our bodies will change
but well still be the same
as we are
well still sing our song
when our hair aint so blonde
and our children have sung
we were right
see tom odell liveget tickets as low as 48you might also likechorus
theyll sing
grow old with me
let us share what we see
and all the best it could be
just you and i

verse 3
and the hairs they stand up
and my feet start to thump
yet the feeling is dreaming
around
youll be the one
make me hard make me calm
make me feel like im real
and alive

chorus
grow old with me
let us share what we see
and all the best it could be
just you and i
grow old with me
let us share what we see
and all the best it could be
just you and iembed"
