wouldve thought you wrote down every word
goodbye spelled out like it had been rehearsed
there aint no point in trying to change your mind

prechorus
seems like
youve got it all figured out
youre alright
with the way this is going down

chorus
dont tell me we can still be friends
hanging on the weekend
youre gonna be okay if i start seeing somebody new
you hope that i do
it wont be long
till i forget to call every time that im drinking
and you aint the love song
i cant keep from singing
i gotta be honest
if you really believe thats the truth
you never loved me like i loved you

verse 2
by the way youre talking you would think
you never had any real feelings for me
and if you think i can look across the bar
see brett young liveget tickets as low as 58you might also likeprechorus
and see you
in someone elses arms
and i need you
oh who do you think you are

chorus
trying to tell me we can still be friends
hanging on the weekend
youre gonna be okay if i start seeing somebody new
you hope that i do
it wont be long
till i forget to call every time that im drinking
and you aint the love song
i cant keep from singing
i gotta be honest
if you really believe thats the truth
you never loved me like i loved you

bridge
you always told me
youd never leave me

we can still be friends

that we can still be friends
hanging on the weekend
youre gonna be okay if i start seeing somebody new
you hope that i do
it wont be long
till i forget to call every time that im drinking
and you aint the love song
i cant keep from singing
i gotta be honest
you really believe thats the truth
