its dark its light
its today and its tonight
its big and its small
its the one and its the all
its the mountain
its in the breeze
its the lock and its the keys
its me and its you
and its the things that we didnt do

chorus
its all in how you look at it

verse 2
its alive and its dead
its the water its the riverbed
and its love and its fear
its all the things that didnt get you here
and its curse and its praise
and its a future full of yesterdays
its the silence in a song
its the sound of your voice when you sing along

chorus

its the fire its the ice
its a personal hell its a paradise
and its joy and its pain
it made the desert it made the rain
its the hunt and its the prey
its coming closer as it goes away
its real and its a lie
its the answer and the question when you wonder why

chorus

verse 4
its no good its all right
its the kiss and its the fight
its in the image its the eye
sticking with you as it passes by
and its the bottom
and its the sky
and its alarming its a lullaby
and its cruel and its kind
its really nothing
its in your mind
