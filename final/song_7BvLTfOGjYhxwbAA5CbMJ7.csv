a revolution has begun today for me inside
the ultimate defense is to pretend
revolve around yourself just like an ordinary man
the only other option to forget

chorus
does it feel like weve never been alive
does it seem like its only just begun

verse 2
to find yourself just look inside the wreckage of your past
to lose it all you have to do is lie
the policy is set and we are never turning back
its time for execution time to execute
time for execution time to execute

chorus
does it feel like weve never been alive
does it seem like its only just begun
does it feel like weve never been alive inside
does it seem like its only just begun its only just begun
