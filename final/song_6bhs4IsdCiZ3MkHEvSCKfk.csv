leaves are fallin down on the beautiful ground
i heard a story from the man in red
he said the leaves are fallin down such a beautiful sound
son i think youd better go ahead
but you always hold your head up high
cause its a long long long way down
this town was meant for passing through
boy it aint nothin new
now go and show em that the world stayed round
but its a long long long way down

prechorus
you better run for the hills before they burn
listen to the sound of the world dont watch it turn
i just want to show you what i know
and catch you when the current lets you go

chorus
or should i just get along with myself
i never did get along with everybody else
ive been trying hard to do whats right
but you know i could stay here all night
and watch the clouds fall from the sky
well this river is wild
this river is wild
see the killers liveget tickets as low as 54you might also likeprechorus
run for the hills before they burn
listen to the sound of the world dont watch it turn
i shake a little sometimes im nervous when i talk
i shake a little sometimes i hate the line i walk
i just wanna to show you what i know
and catch you when the current lets you go

chorus
or should i just get along with myself
i never did get along with everybody else
ive been trying hard to do whats right
but you know i could stay here all night
and watch the clouds fall from the sky
because this river is wild godspeed ya boy
this river is wild

verse 2
now adams taking bombs and hes stuck on his mom
because that bitch keeps trying to make him pray
hes with the hippie in the park combing over the dark
just trying to get some of that littlegirl play

prechorus
you better run for the hills before they burn
listen to the sound of the world dont watch it turn
i just want to show you what i know
and catch you when the current lets you go
chorus
or should i get along with myself
i never did get along with everybody else
ive been trying hard to do whats right
but you know i could stay here all night
and watch the clouds fall from the sky
the pain is hell in me tonight
because this river is wild godspeed ya boy
this river is wild
this river is wild godspeed ya boy
this river is wild

outro
now the cars are everywhere raisin dust at the fairground
i dont think i ever seen so many headlights
but theres something pulling me
the circus and the crew well theyre just passing through
making sure the merry still goes round
but its a long long long way down4embed"
