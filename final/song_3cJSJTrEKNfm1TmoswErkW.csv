you know it doesnt make much sense
there ought to be a law against
anyone who takes offense
at a day in your celebration
cause we all know in our minds
that there ought to be a time
that we can set aside
to show just how much we love you
and im sure you would agree
it couldnt fit more perfectly
than to have a world party on the day you came to be

chorus
happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you
happy birthday
happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you
happy birthday

verse 2
i just never understood
how a man who died for good
could not have a day that would
be set aside for his recognition
because it should never be
just because some cannot see
the dream as clear as he
that they should make it become an illusion
and we all know everything
that he stood for time will bring
for in peace our hearts will sing
thanks to martin luther king

why has there never been a holiday
where peace is celebrated
all throughout the world

verse 3
the time is overdue
for people like me and you
who know the way to truth
is love and unity to all gods children
it should be a great event
and the whole day should be spent
in full remembrance
of those who lived and died for the oneness of all people
so let us all begin
we know that love can win
let it out dont hold it in
sing it loud as you can
chorus
happy birthday to you

outro
we know the key to unity of all people
is in the dream that you had so long ago
that lives in all of the hearts of people
that believe in unity
well make the dream become a reality
i know we will
because our hearts tell us so
