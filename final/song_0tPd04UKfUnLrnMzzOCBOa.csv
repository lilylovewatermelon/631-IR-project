yo g what would you do
if all of the sudden you woke up one morning
and the world was ending man
ha im checkin in man haha
its like just
the world was
it was just crumblin
ha thats messed up dog haha
what if god came down and reached for everybody
is he here is he here
theres nothing you could do
ay but hey check it out what would you do

hook
what you gonna do when god calls time out
are you gonna run try to hide scream and shout
are you gonna drop to your knees cry and pout
what you gonna do when god calls time out
what you gonna do when god calls time out
deep in your mind will you have any doubts
cause all your time on this earth has ran out
on that mighty mighty day when god calls time out

verse lord infamous
to all you murderers maniacs fornicators rapists thieves
all you drug dealers gang bangers smokers indeed
all you sinners sinners you best take heed
as i tell of the day we will beg and plead
king of kings lord of lords see us coming
too late for forgiveness not too late for a promise
did you know every time you were unmarried and screwed
each one of those counted as a sin damn fool
you said its alright cause god grows the weed
he also grew the fruit in the garden of eden
dont abuse every season its getting a step closer
the mark of the beast is around if you focus
you said you found god but you still hesitatin
you best beware mr satan is waitin
to come let you bake in the flames he has tamed
and make you a slave throughout infinite days
