ciara

verse 1
pull up your pants just like em
take out the trash just like em
getting ya cash like em fast like em
girl you outta act like ya dig what im talkin bout
security codes on everything
on vibrate so your phone dont ever ring joint account
and another one he dont know about

prechorus
wish we could switch up the roles
and i could be that
tell you i love you but when you call i never get back
would you ask them questions like me
like where you be at
cause im out four in the morning
on the corner rolling doing my own thing oh

chorus
what if i
had a thing on the side
made ya cry
would the rules change up
or would they still apply
if i played you like a toy
sometimes i wish i could act like a boy
you might also likepostchorus
cant be getting mad
what you mad
cant handle that
cant be getting mad
what you mad
cant handle that

verse 2
girl go head and be just like em
go run the streets just like em
come home and sleep like em
creep like em
front with ya friends
act hard when youre with em like em what
keep a straight face when ya tell a lie
always keep an airtight alibi keep him in the dark
what he dont know wont break his heart

prechorus
wish we could switch up the roles
and i could be that
tell you i love you but when you call i never get back
would you ask them questions like me
like where you be at
cause im out four in the morning
on the corner rolling doing my own thing oh
