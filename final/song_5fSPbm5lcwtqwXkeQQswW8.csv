since you turned the tables on me
ive been steady and learnin lonely
keepin this turntable spinnin
everything from jones to jennings
slowly plannin my survival
in a threefoot stack of vinyl
since you had to walk on outta here
ive been havin a record year

verse 2
i bet you thought before you left
id just sit in silence by myself
turn this house into a jail
dyin slow in a livin hell
but loves got a funny way of keepin score
and your leavin lit up my scoreboard
i usually make it through side a sober
all bets are off when i flip her over
one bourbon one scotch one beer
im havin a record year

chorus
quarter notes and hanks half time
are poundin on this heart of mine
song to song i pass my time
with these speakers on ten
your goodandgone keeps me up all night
along with songs in the key of life
im either gonna get over you
or im gonna blow out my ears
yeah youre out there now
doin god knows how and im stuck here
havin a record year
see eric church liveget tickets as low as 200you might also likeverse 3
your leavin left me goin crazy
im countin on a needle to save me
i drop it in the groove
and we go round and round
and down in a spiral
i guess i really oughta call and thank you
i rediscovered  red headed stranger
got down with old james brown
and found new grass revival
if you find your way back i owe you a beer
for my record year

chorus
quarter notes and hanks half time
are poundin on this heart of mine
song to song i pass my time
with these speakers on ten
your goodandgone keeps me up all night
along with songs in the key of life
im either gonna get over you
or im gonna blow out my ears
yeah youre out there now
doin god knows how and im stuck here
havin a record year
yeah im havin a record year5embed"
