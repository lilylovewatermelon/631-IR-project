now i dont wanna jump the gun
or misunderstand anyone but
i think maybe you have been feeling something lately
i know we got an understanding
you aint my girl i aint your man
but i think maybe you have been feeling this thing changing

bridge
the feelings i got for you
cut and dry its the truth
but you want something new baby
we got a simple thing
but its about to change
or will it stay the same maybe
no matter what the road ive passed
still has a load of loves and lusts
and not much trust
but are you saying this cant be us

chorus
let me get this right
girl you want us to be
official make this thing for real
you for real
baby let me know
let me get this right
you want to make me the happiest
man in the world
is that the deal
girl for real
baby please be sure
let me get this right

i know i heard ya
but come again please

hard to believe that were both on the same page
threw away my black book
think im done with that look
you took long enough to come into my life
are you feeling what i feel girl

bridge
the feelings i got for you
cut and dry its the truth
but you want something new baby
we got a simple thing
but its about to change
or will it stay the same maybe
no matter what the road ive passed
still has a load of loves and lusts
and not much trust
but are you saying this cant be us

chorus
let me get this right
girl you want us to be
official make this thing for real
you for real
baby let me know
let me get this right
you want to make me the happiest
man in the world
is that the deal
girl for real
baby please be sure
let me get this right
let me get this right
girl you want us to be
official make this thing for real
you for real
baby let me know
let me get this right
you want to make me the happiest
man in the world
is that the deal
girl for real
baby please be sure
