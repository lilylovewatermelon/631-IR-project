ended up on a crossroad
tried to figure out which way to go
its like youre stuck on a treadmill
running in the same place
you got your hazard lights on now
hoping that somebody would slow down
praying for a miracle
ooh show your grace
had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
with a long journey ahead
seen a truck pull over
god sent an angel to help you out
he gave you direction
showed you how to read a map
for the long journey ahead
said it aint over
oh even in the midst of doubt

chorus
life is worth living
life is worth living so live another day
the meaning of forgiveness
people make mistakes doesnt mean you have to give in
life is worth living again

relationship on a ski slope
avalanche comin down slow
do we have enough time to salvage this love
feels like a blizzard in april
cause my heart its just that cold
skating on thin ice
but its strong enough to hold us up
seen her scream and holler
put us both on blast
tearing each other down
when i thought it was over
god sent in an angel to help us out
he gave us direction showed us how to make it last
for that long journey ahead
said it aint ever over
oh even in the midst of doubt

chorus
life is worth living
life is worth living so live another day
the meaning of forgiveness
people make mistakes doesnt mean you have to give in
life is worth living again
life is worth living again
bridge
what i get from my reflection
is a difference in perception
from what the world may see
they tried to crucify me
i aint perfect wont deny
my reputations on the line
so im working on a better me

chorus
life is worth living
life is worth living so live another day
the meaning of forgiveness
people make mistakes
only god can judge me
life is worth living again
another day
life is worth living again13embed"
