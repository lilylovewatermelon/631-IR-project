525600 minutes
525000 moments so dear
525600 minutes
how do you measure measure a year
in daylights in sunsets in midnights in cups of coffee
in inches in miles in laughter in strife
in 525600 minutes
how do you measure a year in the life
how about love
how about love
how about love
measure in love
seasons of love
seasons of love

525600 minutes
525000 journeys to plan
525600 minutes
how do you measure the life of a woman or man

in truths that she learned or in times that he cried
in bridges he burned or the way that she died
you might also likeall
its time now to sing out
though the story never ends
lets celebrate remember a year
in the life of friends

all  joanne
remember the love
oh you got to you got to remember the love
remember the love
you know that love is a gift from up above
remember the love
love give love spread your love
measure measure your life in love
seasons of love
seasons of love
measure your life measure your life in love1embed"
