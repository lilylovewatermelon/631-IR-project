was an old man
an old man was he
he married virgin mary
the queen of galilee
he married virgin mary

joseph and mary walked
through an orchard green
there were cherries
and berries
as thick
as might be seen
there were cherries
and berries
as thick
as might be seen

mary said to joseph
so meek and so mild
joseph
gather me some cherries
for i am with child
joseph
gather me some cherries
for i am with child
you might also likethen joseph flew in anger
in anger flew he
let the father of the baby
gather cherries for thee
let the father of the baby
gather cherries for thee

then up
spoke baby jesus
from in marys womb
bend down
the tallest branches
that my mother
might have some
bend down
the tallest branches
that my mother
might have some

and bend down
the tallest branches
it touched marys hand
cried she
oh look thou joseph
i have cherries
by command
oh look thou joseph
i have cherries
by commandembed"
