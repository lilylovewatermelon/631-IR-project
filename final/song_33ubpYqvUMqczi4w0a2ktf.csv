hold up wait you used to be a frenemy
back then boy ya didnt even notice me
why now you tryna get a hold of me
we never even spoke so what makes you think you know me
its funny how the tables turn
im sitting back baby watching you burn
no regrets its a lesson learned
cause what you think aint my concern

prechorus jesy jade
about time that i let you know
my ride and i assume control
you blew it baby years ago
cant get with me now im grown

verse 2 jesy jade
your voice dropped you thought that you could handle me
you claimed me but now you tryna holla me
youre washed up and now im in a different league
youre trying way too hard and i dont need your flattery
now its funny how the tables turn
im sitting back baby watching you burn
no regrets its a lesson learned
cause what you think ain’t my concern
