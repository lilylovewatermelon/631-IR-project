you can tell me the world is round
and ill prove to you its square
you can keep your feet on the ground
but ill be walking on air
youre pretty good at waiting
while i go runnin around
well thats just the way it is

chorus
you know i i i got a hole in my pocket
you give me love and i drop it
i guess ill throw it away

verse 2
we stick together
with every day that passes by
but im just like the weather
i keep on changing my mind
well you can hardly believe it
every time i turn and say well
good morning im leaving
and ill be back in a few days
but thats just the way it is

chorus
you know i i i got a hole in my pocket
you give me love and i drop it
i guess ill throw it away oh
oh i i i got a four leaf clover
ill throw it over my shoulder
im gonna need it someday
see sheryl crow liveget tickets as low as 46you might also likebridge
when things dont go right you lead me
torn up and tied you free me
when life is strange you take me
through every change you never break me
you got a feeling theres a wall that you can never climb
i try to be there where you are i try to be on time
but i lose my way

chorus
i i i got a hole in my pocket
ill take your love and i drop it
i guess ill throw it away
oh i i i got a four leaf clover
ill throw it over my shoulder
im gonna need it someday oh
oh i i i got a hole in my pocket
you gave me love and i lost it
i guess ill throw it away
oh i i got a four leaf clover
i wanna do it all over
before it gets too late

outro
i i i got a hole in my pocket
i took your love and i dropped it
i guess i threw it away
well iembed"
