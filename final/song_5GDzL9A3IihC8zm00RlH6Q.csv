well things are about to get a whole lot stranger

this mysterious driver tricks cops into thinking hes about to pull over then all hell breaks loose

his moves are still baffling to the police as he swerves all over the road driving like a man possessed

in just a moment hes going to make a turn into the twilight zone watch

but in the blink of an eye the driver comes into view again

hes wheeling from the cops for a loop he gets back on the straightaway showing off a seemingly supernatural speed

for a moment it appears as if the driver and his car have disappeared into thin air

the officers watching this get only a quick glimpse of the man behind the wheel

its the last look theyll get

this time he tries to outrun the police rather than just vanish

a fence at the end means no way out or does it

even watching it again cops are unable to make sense of it

all they see is the an intact fence and nothing more than the vanishing taillights of what the garden city pd has come to call the ghost carsee kavinsky liveget tickets as low as 49you might also like2embed"
