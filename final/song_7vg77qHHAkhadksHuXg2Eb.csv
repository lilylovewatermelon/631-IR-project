he touched her places that he shouldnt have touched
he did some things to her that he shouldnt have done
so she ran into her room paged her mother and 911
and the tragedy began for this young girl
she told her mother her family and friends
no one believed her cause before this happened
she was filled with hate and anger towards her stepfather
cause he took her mother from her when they married

chorus destinys child  beyoncé
please dry your eyes young girl please young girl
dont cry youre beautiful youre beautiful
its not your fault young girl
dont cry youre beautiful youre beautiful
youre not the one to blame
soon it will be okay
one day youll realize your beauty

verse 3 kelly with destinys child beyoncé
she looked for her father
in the men that she saw and
thought that all she had to offer was her body
no one could figure out why
this young girl would live her life
in such pain and unhappiness cause she was so beautiful
she rebelled and one day the young girl fell in love
with another man like her stepdad
he abused her emotionally
and made her feel like she was worthless
i hope one day she realizes
and sees the beauty in her eyes
all she needs is prayer and strength
cause shes beautiful
chorus destinys child  beyoncé
please dry your eyes young girl i cant bear to see you cry even one more time
dont cry youre beautiful
its not your fault young girl
dont cry youre beautiful its not your fault what he did to you girl
youre not the one to blame
soon it will be okay i promise youll be okay
one day youll realize your beauty im here for you beautiful
please dry your eyes young girl
dont cry youre beautiful dont you know i love you girl
its not your fault young girl
dont cry youre beautiful your life has meaning
youre not the one to blame youll be okay
soon it will be okay soon youll be okay
one day youll realize your beauty youre so real to me

outro beyoncé
dont hold your head down low
youve got so much so much so much so much so much to be proud of
you can still live your life
i promise you youll survive
girl i love you
youre beautifulembed"
