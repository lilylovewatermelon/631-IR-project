hahaha
oh my god thatd be amazing
bad girls club

verse 1
i met a girl and i really thought she liked me
i truly thought that i had met the one
it was a fail to no avail
im just another victim of the bad girls club
shes like a witch casting spells hypnotizing
she made me drink a potion just to fall in love
she got me drunk tipsy off her love
im just another victim of the bad girls club

verse 2
shes always blowing up my phone
i really wish that shed leave me alone
i gotta change my number hard for me to slumber
when shes outside my home
she called the cops
and made it seem like i was mean
shes not your average lady she is fucking crazy
spelled cunt bitch
