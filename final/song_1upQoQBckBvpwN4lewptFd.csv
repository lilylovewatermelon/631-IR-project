pipe that shit up tnt
tre made this beat
lets talk bout hard times real bottom boy survivor
way before the jewelry the groupie hoes and designer
back when i was tryna find a way for all my partners
rema hit the window popped the door for me and lijah
member wakin up with no destination
but i had some dedication couldnt use my education
cause no nine dollars could help me face what i was facing
my light bill due envelope blue that mean you behind on payments
rap slowed down and i was low on cash
fresh out of high school kicked out the house for living fast
went and got a spot then got a job cause pops was on my ass
then thats when pops had went to jail so it didnt last
hit the block with brock cause i was tryna pay my bills
like fuck a rap career lets touch these streets and make a mil
fast forward like rod wave tell me how you feel
when i think about my past that shit give me chills uh
wake up in the morning hit my knees and i pray
because he finally made a way
i been runnin up that paper mama
and before i let em come and take it mama

die in these cuban links right now today lets go
die in these cuban links yes lord
all my life it been a struggle
you on and fall off you find out who really love you
playin in the storm drain came out the gutter
good relationships i admit i had a couple
making love to the money me and bae lil couple
yola cooked down to the oil in it dont switch around
i need everything when it lock in the pot yeah
grab it off the top let it dry work the clock yeah
finally up in rank movin blocks holdin sham yeah
havin my lil way ghetto pussy used to act funny
now im hittin her hard from the back she throw it back for me
and when i went to jail shawty left turned her back on me
flexin on they ass pants sag with them racks on em
wake up in the morning hit my knees and i pray
because he finally made a way
i been runnin up that paper mama
and before i let em come and take it mama
