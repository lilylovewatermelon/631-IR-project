i got this feelin inside my bones
it goes electric wavy when i turn it on
and if you want it inside your soul
just open up your heart let music take control

refrain justin timberlake  anna kendrick
i got that sunshine in my pocket
got that good soul in my feet
i feel that hot blood in my body when it drops ooh
i cant take my eyes up off it movin so phenomenally
room on lock the way we rock it so dont stop

prechorus justin timberlake  anna kendrick with james corden all ron funches
and under the lights when everything goes
nowhere to hide when im gettin you close cant stop wont stop
when we move well you already know lets go lets work
