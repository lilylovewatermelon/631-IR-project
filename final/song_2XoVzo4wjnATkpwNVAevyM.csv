some days her shape in the doorway will speak to me
a birds wing on the window
sometimes ill hear when shes sleeping
her fever dream a language on her face

refrain
i want your flowers like babies want gods love
or maybe as sure as tomorrow will come

verse 2
some days i miss how she graciously
offered me so honestly and nightly
some time i might try to ask her what honest words
she cant afford to say like

refrain
i want your flowers like babies want gods love
or maybe as sure as tomorrow will comesee iron  wine liveget tickets as low as 60you might also likeembed"
