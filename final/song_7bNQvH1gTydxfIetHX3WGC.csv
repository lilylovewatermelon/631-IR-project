allow me to exaggerate a memory or two
where summers lasted longer than longer than we do
when nothing really mattered except for me to be with you
but in time we all forgot and we all grew

chorus
your melody sounds as sweet as the first time it was sung
with a little bit more character for show
and by the time your fathers heard of all the wrong youve done
then im putting out the lantern find your own way back home

verse 2
if id forgotten how to sing before id sung this song
ill write it all across the wall before my job is done
and ill even have the courtesy of admitting i was wrong
as the final words before im dead and gone

chorus
youve never been so divine in accepting your defeat
and ive never been more scared to be alone
if love is not enough to put my enemies to sleep
then im putting out the lantern find your own way back homeyou might also like14embed"
