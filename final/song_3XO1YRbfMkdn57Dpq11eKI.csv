lullaby and goodnight
baby tuck in your sorrows
find a way to drown it out somehow
go to sleep rest your head
you can worry tomorrow
these are things you cant change
right now right now

verse 1
my eyes are tired but my mind is alive
my brain is my vacation and prison at the same time
it lures me in and locks me up and tosses the key
im pillowtalking to myself because it wont let me sleep
okay my legs are achin restless kickin keeping me up
im moving up on the charts still feeling down on my luck
im tossin turnin far from snorin wrestlin with my bed
and i keep fightin sheets and thoughts
that wont get out of my head
like how can sometimes days feel like years
and years feel like moments and if time heals all wounds
then whys it take the ones we love from us
and whats it even matter when forever ends in a second
all of our thoughts and knowledge
end up six feet deep with our skeletons
leverage it to hell with it
might as well make the best of it
when youre gone the only advantage
is you wont ever remember it
so raise the stakes and make mistakes
one day youll wake up dead
but til then close your eyes
lay to rest sleepyhead
you might also likechorus
lullaby and goodnight
baby tuck in your sorrows
find a way to drown it out somehow
go to sleep rest your head
you can worry tomorrow
these are things you cant change
right now right now

verse 2
i try to go to bed real early just to say i got through the day
but i worry that sometime ill find i slept my whole life away
im too anxious to fall asleep but im too depressed to stay awake
the drama and insomnias really messin with my mental state
i think about the night when i was pleading please dont leave
but i could see me in your eyes and couldnt stand who i was bein
i fear ill disappear some days and sometimes i wish youd let me
cause i know deep down the truth
is that you wish youd never met me
just forget me erase me hate me
its for your own health
trust me i might be what we mean
when we say wealth doesn’t buy happiness
i’m a mess and don’t need your help
cause more than i want you
i want you to think about yourself
its heartbreaking and breathtaking
how the years keep disappearing
the only thing consistent is these constant inconsistencies
i give my all and fight so hard with little reciprocity
i used to wanna fall in love now i just wanna fall asleep
chorus
lullaby and goodnight
baby tuck in your sorrows
find a way to drown it out somehow
go to sleep rest your head
you can worry tomorrow
these are things you cant change
right now right now

verse 3
you see sometimes i start screaming
cause screamings better than you seeing me cry
but i dont mean it cause the thing
is i tend to use my temper to hide
what im really feeling im reeling
concealing what’s buried inside
then stick my teeth in revealing the monster
that reluctantly resides in my mind
i lose my mind trying to find the collide
of who i am and what’s the disguise
i bare my teeth in fear my dear
my bark is worse than my bite
its not your flesh im eating
promise im just fiending you time
got my degree in disagreeing
thinking im always right
the common theme in the scene is
i keep on believing if i just keep on breathing
when i see them then my selfesteem will be fine
but im still weak and still bleeding
stuck in the machine where ill die
ill be deceased be released be free
from this unleashed beast when i lie
in peace and solitude in my hollow tomb
without the solemn mood you’re accustomed to
and i’ll follow you then i’ll haunt you in your nightmares
can you be here with me for eternity
death do us part happy tragedy
in the mortuary when you close your eyes
ill be there sweet dreams dear
chorus
lullaby and goodnight
baby tuck in your sorrows
find a way to drown it out somehow
go to sleep rest your head
you can worry tomorrow
these are things you cant change
right now right now7embed"
