yeah here we go for the hundredth time
hand grenade pins in every line
throw em up and let something shine
going out of my fuckin mind
filthy mouth no excuse
find a new place to hang this noose
string me up from atop these roofs
knot it tight so i wont get loose
truth is you can stop and stare
bled myself out and no one cares
dug the trench out laid down there
with a shovel up out of reach somewhere
yeah someone pour it in
make it a dirt dance floor again
say your prayers and stomp it out
when they bring that chorus in

chorus chester bennington with mike shinoda
i bleed it out diggin deeper just to throw it away
i bleed it out diggin deeper just to throw it away
i bleed it out diggin deeper just to throw it away
just to throw it away just to throw it away
i bleed it out

verse 2 mike shinoda
go stop the show
choppy words and a sloppy flow
shotgun opera lock and load
cock it back and then watch it go
mama help me ive been cursed
death is rollin in every verse
candy paint on his brand new hearse
cant contain him he knows he works
fuck this hurts i wont lie
doesnt matter how hard i try
half the words dont mean a thing
and i know that i wont be satisfied
so why try ignorin him
make it a dirt dance floor again
say your prayers and stomp it out
when they bring that chorus in
