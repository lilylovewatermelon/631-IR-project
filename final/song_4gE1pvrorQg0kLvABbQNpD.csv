chorus prof t
see i dont mind when you say that youre going away
i just dont want to be lonely
and i dont care if we share only moments a day
i just dont want to be lonely

verse 1 shaggy
girl could you hold me babe that would please me
dont do this darling i hate when you leave me
you got me hooked girl this isnt easy
if you dont love me baby release me
now girl we could dine pour us some wine
after the meal we can unwind putting my heart back on the line
girl its a fact you should be mine
now mi no plan fi spend another long lonely night
and a lay down in a mi bed a hug mi pillow up tight
no feel no way i man cant take the fuss and the fight
i rather make sweet love to you under the candle light

chorus prof t
i dont mind when you say that youre going away
i just dont want to be lonely
and i dont care if we spend only moments a day
i just dont want to be lonely

now listen me please im down on my knees
im begging you darling put me at ease
whats with this feeling i wish it would cease
my heart is held hostage i beg for release
why wont reveal just what you feel
let it out babe just be for real
girl what you afraid of why is it concealed
i know what i bargained for and this aint the deal
now mi no plan fi spend another long lonely night
and a lay down in a mi bed a hug mi pillow up tight
no feel no way i man cant take the fuss and the fight
i rather make sweet love to you under the candle light

chorus prof t
i dont mind when you say that youre going away
i just dont want to be lonely
and i dont care if we spend only moments a day
i just dont want to be lonely
