3TZxM3VrkICfKS3tRQNd7X,Forty Hour Week (For a Livin'),Alabama,4oFLKch6Zh0YanY9Uj2s8z,"1 contributorthe gilded age chap 1 lyrics        june 18— squire hawkins sat upon the pyramid of large blocks called the stile in front of his house contemplating the morning

        the locality was obedstown east tennessee you would not know that obedstown stood on the top of a mountain for there was nothing about the landscape to indicate it—but it did a mountain that stretched abroad over whole counties and rose very gradually the district was called the knobs of east tennessee and had a reputation like nazareth as far as turning out any good thing was concerned

        the squires house was a double log cabin in a state of decay two or three gaunt hounds lay asleep about the threshold and lifted their heads sadly whenever mrs hawkins or the children stepped in and out over their bodies rubbish was scattered about the grassless yard a bench stood near the door with a tin wash basin on it and a pail of water and a gourd a cat had begun to drink from the pail but the exertion was overtaxing her energies and she had stopped to rest there was an ashhopper by the fence and an iron pot for softsoapboiling near it

        this dwelling constituted onefifteenth of obedstown the other fourteen houses were scattered about among the tall pine trees and among the cornfields in such a way that a man might stand in the midst of the city and not know but that he was in the country if he only depended on his eyes for information

        squire hawkins got his title from being postmaster of obedstown—not that the title properly belonged to the office but because in those regions the chief citizens always must have titles of some sort and so the usual courtesy had been extended to hawkins the mail was monthly and sometimes amounted to as much as three or four letters at a single delivery even a rush like this did not fill up the postmasters whole month though and therefore he kept store in the intervals

        the squire was contemplating the morning it was balmy and tranquil the vagrant breezes were laden with the odor of flowers the murmur of bees was in the air there was everywhere that suggestion of repose that summer woodlands bring to the senses and the vague pleasurable melancholy that such a time and such surroundings inspire

        presently the united states mail arrived on horseback there was but one letter and it was for the postmaster the longlegged youth who carried the mail tarried an hour to talk for there was no hurry and in a little while the male population of the village had assembled to help as a general thing they were dressed in homespun jeans blue or yellow—here were no other varieties of it all wore one suspender and sometimes two—yarn ones knitted at home—some wore vests but few wore coats such coats and vests as did appear however were rather picturesque than otherwise for they were made of tolerably fanciful patterns of calico—a fashion which prevails thereto this day among those of the community who have tastes above the common level and are able to afford style every individual arrived with his hands in his pockets a hand came out occasionally for a purpose but it always went back again after service and if it was the head that was served just the cant that the dilapidated straw hat got by being uplifted and rooted under was retained until the next call altered the inclination many hats were present but none were erect and no two were canted just alike we are speaking impartially of men youths and boys and we are also speaking of these three estates when we say that every individual was either chewing natural leaf tobacco prepared on his own premises or smoking the same in a corncob pipe few of the men wore whiskers none wore moustaches some had a thick jungle of hair under the chin and hiding the throat—the only pattern recognized there as being the correct thing in whiskers but no part of any individuals face had seen a razor for a week

        these neighbors stood a few moments looking at the mail carrier reflectively while he talked but fatigue soon began to show itself and one after another they climbed up and occupied the top rail of the fence humpshouldered and grave like a company of buzzards assembled for supper and listening for the deathrattle old damrell said

        tha haint no news bout the jedge hit aint likely

        caint tell for sartin some thinks hes gwyne to be long toreckly and some thinks e haint russ mosely he tote ole hanks he mought git to obeds tomorrer or nex day he reckoned

        well i wisht i knowed i got a prime sow and pigs in the cotehouse and i haint got no place for to put em if the jedge is a gwyne to hold cote i got to roust em out i reckon but tomorrerll do i spect

        the speaker bunched his thick lips together like the stemend of a tomato and shot a bumblebee dead that had lit on a weed seven feet away one after another the several chewers expressed a charge of tobacco juice and delivered it at the deceased with steady aim and faultless accuracy

        whats a stirrin down bout the forks continued old damrell

        i dono hits what he calls it ole mam higgins she tole me she say she wasnt gwyne to hang out in no sich a dern hole like a hog says its mud or some sich kind o nastiness that sticks on n covers up everything plarsterin si calls it

        this marvel was discussed at considerable length and almost with animation but presently there was a dogfight over in the neighborhood of the blacksmith shop and the visitors slid off their perch like so many turtles and strode to the battlefield with an interest bordering on eagerness

        the squire remained and read his letter then he sighed and sat long in meditation at intervals he said

        missouri missouri well well well everything is so uncertain

        at last he said

        i believe ill do it—a man will just rot here my house my yard everything around me in fact shows that i am becoming one of these cattle—and i used to be thrifty in other times

        he was not more than thirtyfive but he had a worn look that made him seem older he left the stile entered that part of his house which was the store traded a quart of thick molasses for a coonskin and a cake of beeswax to an old dame in linseywoolsey put his letter away and went into the kitchen his wife was there constructing some dried apple pies a slovenly urchin of ten was dreaming over a rude weathervane of his own contriving his small sister close upon four years of age was sopping cornbread in some gravy left in the bottom of a fryingpan and trying hard not to sop over a fingermark that divided the pan through the middle—for the other side belonged to the brother whose musings made him forget his stomach for the moment a negro woman was busy cooking at a vast fireplace shiftlessness and poverty reigned in the place

        nancy ive made up my mind the world is done with me and perhaps i ought to be done with it but no matter—i can wait i am going to missouri i wont stay in this dead country and decay with it ive had it on my mind sometime im going to sell out here for whatever i can get and buy a wagon and team and put you and the children in it and start

        anywhere that suits you suits me si and the children cant be any worse off in missouri than they are here i reckon

        motioning his wife to a private conference in their own room hawkins said no theyll be better off ive looked out for them nancy and his face lighted do you see these papers well they are evidence that i have taken up seventyfive thousand acres of land in this county—think what an enormous fortune it will be some day why nancy enormous dont express it—the words too tame i tell your nancy——

        for goodness sake si——
        wait nancy wait—let me finish—ive been secretly bailing and fuming with this grand inspiration for weeks and i must talk or ill burst i havent whispered to a soul—not a word—have had my countenance under lock and key for fear it might drop something that would tell even these animals here how to discern the gold mine thats glaring under their noses now all that is necessary to hold this land and keep it in the family is to pay the trifling taxes on it yearly—five or ten dollars—the whole tract would not sell for over a third of a cent an acre now but some day people will be glad to get it for twenty dollars fifty dollars a hundred dollars an acre what should you say to here he dropped his voice to a whisper and looked anxiously around to see that there were no eavesdroppers a thousand dollars an acre

        well you may open your eyes and stare but its so you and i may not see the day but theyll see it mind i tell you theyll see it nancy youve heard of steamboats and maybe you believed in them—of course you did youve heard these cattle here scoff at them and call them lies and humbugs—but theyre not lies and humbugs theyre a reality and theyre going to be a more wonderful thing some day than they are now theyre going to make a revolution in this worlds affairs that will make men dizzy to contemplate ive been watching—ive been watching while some people slept and i know whats coming

        even you and i will see the day that steamboats will come up that little turkey river to within twenty miles of this land of ours—and in high water theyll come right to it and this is not all nancy—it isnt even half theres a bigger wonder—the railroad these worms here have never even heard of it—and when they do theyll not believe in it but its another fact coaches that fly over the ground twenty miles an hour—heavens and earth think of that nancy twenty miles an hour it makes a mans brain whirl some day when you and i are in our graves therell be a railroad stretching hundreds of miles—all the way down from the cities of the northern states to new orleans—and its got to run within thirty miles of this land—may be even touch a corner of it well do you know theyve quit burning wood in some places in the eastern states and what do you suppose they burn coal he bent over and whispered again theres world—worlds of it on this land you know that black stuff that crops out of the bank of the branch—well thats it youve taken it for rocks so has every body here and theyve built little dams and such things with it one man was going to build a chimney out of it nancy i expect i turned as white as a sheet why it might have caught fire and told everything i showed him it was too crumbly then he was going to build it of copper ore—splendid yellow fortypercent ore theres fortunes upon fortunes of copper ore on our land it scared me to death the idea of this fool starting a smelting furnace in his house without knowing it and getting his dull eyes opened and then he was going to build it of iron ore theres mountains of iron ore here nancy—whole mountains of it i wouldnt take any chances i just stuck by him—i haunted him—i never let him alone till he built it of mud and sticks like all the rest of the chimneys in this dismal country pine forests wheat land corn land iron copper coal—wait till the railroads come and the steamboats well never see the day nancy—never in the world—never never never child weve got to drag along drag along and eat crusts in toil and poverty all hopeless and forlorn—but theyll ride in coaches nancy theyll live like the princes of the earth theyll be courted and worshiped their names will be known from ocean to ocean ah welladay will they ever come back here on the railroad and the steamboat and say this one little spot shall not be touched—this hovel shall be sacred—for here our father and our mother suffered for us thought for us laid the foundations of our future as solid as the hills

        you are a great good noble soul si hawkins and i am an honored woman to be the wife of such a man—and the tears stood in her eyes when she said it we will go to missouri you are out of your place here among these groping dumb creatures we will find a higher place where you can walk with your own kind and be understood when you speak—not stared at as if you were talking some foreign tongue i would go anywhere anywhere in the wide world with you i would rather my body would starve and die than your mind should hunger and wither away in this lonely land

        spoken like yourself my child but well not starve nancy far from it i have a letter from beriah sellers—just came this day a letter that—ill read you a line from it

        he flew out of the room a shadow blurred the sunlight in nancys face—there was uneasiness in it and disappointment a procession of disturbing thoughts began to troop through her mind saying nothing aloud she sat with her hands in her lap now and then she clasped them then unclasped them then tapped the ends of the fingers together sighed nodded smiled—occasionally paused shook her head this pantomime was the elocutionary expression of an unspoken soliloquy which had something of this shape

        i was afraid of it—was afraid of it trying to make our fortune in virginia beriah sellers nearly ruined us and we had to settle in kentucky and start over again trying to make our fortune in kentucky he crippled us again and we had to move here trying to make our fortune here he brought us clear down to the ground nearly hes an honest soul and means the very best in the world but im afraid im afraid hes too flighty he has splendid ideas and hell divide his chances with his friends with a free hand the good generous soul but something does seem to always interfere and spoil everything i never did think he was right well balanced but i dont blame my husband for i do think that when that man gets his head full of a new notion he can outtalk a machine hell make anybody believe in that notion thatll listen to him ten minutes—why i do believe he would make a deaf and dumb man believe in it and get beside himself if you only set him where he could see his eyes tally and watch his hands explain what a head he has got when he got up that idea there in virginia of buying up whole loads of negroes in delaware and virginia and tennessee very quiet having papers drawn to have them delivered at a place in alabama and take them and pay for them away yonder at a certain time and then in the meantime get a law made stopping everybody from selling negroes to the south after a certain day—it was somehow that way—mercy how the man would have made money negroes would have gone up to four prices but after hed spent money and worked hard and traveled hard and had heaps of negroes all contracted for and everything going along just right he couldnt get the laws passed and down the whole thing tumbled and there in kentucky when he raked up that old numskull that had been inventing away at a perpetual motion machine for twentytwo years and beriah sellers saw at a glance where just one more little cogwheel would settle the business why i could see it as plain as day when he came in wild at midnight and hammered us out of bed and told the whole thing in a whisper with the doors bolted and the candle in an empty barrel

        oceans of money in it—anybody could see that but it did cost a deal to buy the old numskull out—and then when they put the new cog wheel in theyd overlooked something somewhere and it wasnt any use—the troublesome thing wouldnt go that notion he got up here did look as handy as anything in the world and how him and si did sit up nights working at it with the curtains down and me watching to see if any neighbors were about the man did honestly believe there was a fortune in that black gummy oil that stews out of the bank si says is coal and he refined it himself till it was like water nearly and it did burn theres no two ways about that and i reckon hed have been all right in cincinnati with his lamp that he got made that time he got a house full of rich speculators to see him exhibit only in the middle of his speech it let go and almost blew the heads off the whole crowd

        i havent got over grieving for the money that cost yet i am sorry enough beriah sellers is in missouri now but i was glad when he went i wonder what his letter says but of course its cheerful hes never downhearted—never had any trouble in his life—didnt know it if he had its always sunrise with that man and fine and blazing at that—never gets noon though—leaves off and rises again nobody can help liking the creature he means so well—but i do dread to come across him again hes bound to set us all crazy of course well there goes old widow hopkins—it always takes her a week to buy a spool of thread and trade a hank of yarn maybe si can come with the letter now

        and he did

        widow hopkins kept me—i havent any patience with such tedious people now listen nancy—just listen at this

         come right along to missouri dont wait and worry about a good price but sell out for whatever you can get and come along or you might be too late throw away your traps if necessary and come emptyhanded youll never regret it its the grandest country—the loveliest land—the purest atmosphere—i cant describe it no pen can do it justice and its filling up every day—people coming from everywhere ive got the biggest scheme on earth—and ill take you in ill take in every friend ive got thats ever stood by me for theres enough for all and to spare mums the word—dont whisper—keep yourself to yourself youll see come —rush—hurry—dont wait for anything

        its the same old boy nancy jest the same old boy—aint he
        yes i think theres a little of the old sound about his voice yet i suppose you—youll still go si

        go well i should think so nancy its all a chance of course and chances havent been kind to us ill admit—but whatever comes old wife theyre provided for thank god for that

        amen came low and earnestly

        and with an activity and a suddenness that bewildered obedstown and almost took its breath away the hawkinses hurried through with their arrangements in four short months and flitted out into the great mysterious blank that lay beyond the knobs of tennesseeembed"
