it is so easy to see
dysfunction between you and me
we must free up these tired souls
before the sadness kills us both
i tried and tried to let you know
i love you but im letting go
it may not last but i dont know
just dont know

prechorus
if you dont know then you cant care
and i show up but youre not there
but im waiting and you want to
still afraid that i will desert you

chorus
everyday
with every worthless word
we get more far away
the distance between us makes it so hard to stay
but nothing lasts forever
but be honest babe
it hurts but it may be the only way

verse 2
a bed thats warm with memories
can heal us temporarily
but misbehaving only makes
the ditch between us so damn deep
built a wall around my heart
never let it fall apart
strangely i wish secretly
it would fall down while im asleep

if you dont know then you cant care
and i show up but youre not there
but im waiting and you want to
still afraid that i will desert you baby

chorus
everyday
with every worthless word
we get more far away
the distance between us makes it so hard to stay
but nothing lasts forever
but be honest babe
it hurts but it may be the only way

bridge
but we have not hit the ground
doesnt mean were not still falling oh
i want so bad to pick you up
but youre still too reluctant to accept my help
what a shame
i hope you find somewhere to place the blame
but until then the fact remains

chorus
everyday
with every worthless word
we get more far away
the distance between us makes it so hard to stay
nothing lasts forever
but be honest babe yeah
it hurts but it may be the only way
everyday
with every worthless word
we get more far away
the distance between us makes it so hard to stay
but nothing last forever
but be honest babe
it hurts but it may be the only way4embed"
