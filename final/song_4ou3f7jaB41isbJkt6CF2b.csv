in the morning id awake
and i couldnt remember
what is love and what is hate
the calculations error

what is love and what is hate
and why does it matter
is to love just a waste
how can it matter
oh oh oh
oh oh oh

as the dawn began to break
i had to surrender
the universe will have its way
too powerful to master
oh oh oh

verse 4
what is love and what is hate
and why does it matter
is to love just a waste
how can it matter
