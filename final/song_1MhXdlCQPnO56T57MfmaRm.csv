here i am waking up still cant sleep on your side
theres your coffee cup the lipstick stain fades with time
if i can dream long enough youd tell me id be just fine
ill be just fine

chorus luke luke  calum
so i drown it out like i always do
dancing through our house with the ghost of you
and i chase it down with a shot of truth
dancing through our house with the ghost of you

verse 2 calum calum  ashton
cleanin up today found that old zeppelin shirt
you wore when you ran away and no one could feel your hurt
were too young too dumb to know things like love
but i know better now better now

chorus luke all
so i drown it out like i always do
dancing through our house with the ghost of you
and i chase it down with a shot of truth
dancing through our house with the ghost of you

to know things like love

so i drown it out like i always do
dancing through our house with the ghost of you
and ill chase it down with a shot of truth
that my feet dont dance like they did with you60embed"
