oh to do you in the way i did
i stole the gold and drank the gin
then i ran off with your kin
if i can you know i will and if the stars align
i still get loaded on the things that i cant change
and im out here tonight so if you want to start a fight
well get loaded on the things that i cant change

i believe it was a sin do you in the way i did you in
i couldnt stop it coming from afar
i lost the keys to the getaway car
and every now and then im in this place
its hell living when i need your face
dont hide dont hide dont hide from me

i believe it was a sin
oh to do you in the way i did
i took out more than i put in
i got fat while you stayed thin
but i came here tonight if you want to start a fight
we can get loaded on the things that i cant change
yeah im out here all night so if you want to start a fight
we can get loaded on the things that i cant change

i believe it was a sin
to do you in the way i did you in
i couldnt stop it coming from afar
and lost the keys to the getaway car
every now and then im in this place
its hell living when i need your face
dont hide dont hide dont hide from me

dont hide dont hide dont hide dont hide from me
dont hide dont hide dont hide from me

i believe it was a sin
to do you in the way i did you in
i couldnt stop it coming from afar
and lost the keys to the getaway car
every now and then im in this place
its hell living when i need your face
dont hide dont hide dont hide from me
dont hide dont hide your face
