verse 1 ja rule
cmon and get a piece of this latenight lover
you know the one that swing dick like no other shit
i know i got a lot of things i need to explain
but baby you know the name and love is about pain
so stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
our sex lifes a game so back me down in the paint
cause i cant wait no more
cause its about a quarter past three and shortys eyein me
i got the bentley valeted
and im just outside of jersey past the palisades
and id love to see that ass in boots and shades
throw down on the bed while im yanking your braids

while im smackin your ass and fucking you all wild
but we share something so rare but who cares you care

verse 2 ja rule
girl get a grip cmon pull it together
its only a sunshower we been through worse weather
like the stormy nights you wrote a dear ja letter
and took my benz and keyed and cut the leather
bitch you know better we live mob
money over bitches murder inc
i got two or three hoes for every v
and i keep em drugged up off that ecstasy
im a playground legend like kirkland peewee
name a nigga in the league got more game than me
i play hard theres so many women i fathered
meet em with scars and send em home hot and bothered
truth or dare this life aint apparently fair
and a love with no glare is a crystal stare
but we share something so rare but who cares you care

verse 3 ja rule
oh i feelin like you livin a double life
cause you dont be coming home sometimes
baby but youre always on time checking for one time
you and i got a special bond together
we go back like bombers boo in the coldest weather
and when i play you play the same way
you freak me baby i fuck you crazy then im gone
baby dont really want me to get up and leave off that easy
shell be wakin up wet for sheezy
remind these bitches to mind they business
believe me this pimp game is very religious
and im built like the don bishop
gon keep this moneygreen benz and my hoes as my witness
the life we share is a thug affair
but who cares you care
