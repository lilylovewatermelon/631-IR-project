you became someone so close
that person i could trust
why did it end up this way
what happened to the both of us
i im tearing up inside
im on a rollercoaster ride
thinking of those memories
how your touch was so soft
your eyes they were so green
i would have never known how much
youd come to mean everything to me

chorus
virginia is for lovers
and i wonder where do all the others go
and your heart belongs to another
and im leaving
virginia is for lovers anyway

verse 2
no matter how long were apart
i find it hard to let go
im sitting here so restless
time is moving so slow
i i hate that im looking back
reminiscing on photographs
you were like my other half
we were perfect on our own
then everyone came back
got harder to get you alone
see the hurting on my face
you were looking the other way
because
you might also likechorus
virginia is for lovers
and i wonder where do all the others go
and your heart belongs to another
and im leaving
virginia is for lovers anyway

bridge
i never got to tell you
you walked away
you left me there
and you wont change no matter what i do
but i still care
and im still here
yeah yeah

chorus
virginia is for lovers
and i wonder where do all the others go
and your is with another
and im leaving
virginia is for lovers anywayembed"
