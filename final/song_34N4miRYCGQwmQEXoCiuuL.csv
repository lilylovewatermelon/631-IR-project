these are just flames
burning in your fireplace
i hear your voice and it seems
as if it was all a dream
i wish it was all a dream

i see a world
a world turning in on itself
are we just like
hungry wolves howling in the night
i dont want no music tonight

oh the poor boy lost his head
everybody feels a little crazy
but we go on living with it
yeah they go on living with it
