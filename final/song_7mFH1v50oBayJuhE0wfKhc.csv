doom the warning signal again somebody approaches
what manner of creatures are these there they are again fire
a gunshot from inside the house forces a change of plans
okay lets make sure all the windows are covered
a straightforward entry has turned
into what appears to be a barricaded standoff
police department come to the front door
anything you say cracker
as the funky beat continues3embed"
