fallin dreamin talkin in your sleep
i know you want to cry all night all night
plottin schemin findin
reason to defend all of your violent nights
promise me you will see

chorus 070 shake
dont you grow up in a hurry your momll be worried aw
it was all part of the story even the scary nights
thank you for all of the glory you will be remembered aw
thank you to all of the heroes of the night night night
they gotta repaint the colors the lie is wearin off
reality is upon us colors drippin off
colors drippin off

verse kanye west
niggas is savage niggas is monsters
niggas is pimps niggas is players
til niggas have daughters now they precautious
father forgive me im scared of the karma
cause now i see women as somethin to nurture
not somethin to conquer
i hope she like nicki i make her a monster
not havin ménages im just bein silly
i answered the door like will smith and martin
nigga do we have a problem
matter fact marlon this aint meet the fockers
ill beat his ass pray i beat the charges
no daddy dont play not when it come to they daughters
dont do no yoga dont do pilates
just play piano and stick to karate
i pray your bodys draped more like mine
and not like your mommys
just bein salty but niggas is nuts
and i am a nigga i know what they want
i pray that you dont get it all at once
curves under your dress i know its pervs all on the net
all in the comments you wanna vomit
thats your baby you love her to death
now she cuttin class and hangin with friends
you break a glass and say it again
she cant comprehend the danger she in
if you whoop her ass she move in with him
then he whoop her ass you go through it again
but how you the devil rebukin the sin
lets pray we can put this behind us
i swear that these times is the wildest
she got the scars they serve as reminders
blood still on her pajamas
but yesterday is dead yeah moment of silence
next shell be off to college and then at the altar
cause she know that niggas is savage niggas is monsters
niggas is pimps niggas is players til niggas have daughters
niggas is pimps niggas is players til niggas have daughters
