say hey
cha

verse 1
hear the sound of the fallin rain
comin down like an armageddon flame hey
the shame the ones who died without a name
hear the dogs howlin out of key
to a hymn called faith and misery hey
and bleed the company lost the war today

chorus
i beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
this is the dawning of the rest of our lives
on holiday

verse 2
hear the drum poundin out of time
another protester has crossed the line hey
to find the moneys on the other side
can i get another amen amen
theres a flag wrapped around a score of men hey
a gag a plastic bag on a monument

chorus
i beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
this is the dawning of the rest of our lives
on holiday hey

i beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
