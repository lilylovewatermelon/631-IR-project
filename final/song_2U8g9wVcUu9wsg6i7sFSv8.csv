i turn the music up i got my records on
i shut the world outside until the lights come on
maybe the streets alight maybe the trees are gone
i feel my heart start beating to my favorite song
and all the kids they dance all the kids all night
until monday morning feels another life
i turn the music up im on a roll this time
and heaven is in sight

verse 2
i turn the music up i got my records on
from underneath the rubble sing a rebel song
dont want to see another generation drop
id rather be a comma than a full stop
maybe im in the black maybe im on my knees
maybe im in the gap between the two trapezes
but my heart is beating and my pulses start
cathedrals in my heart

prechorus
as we saw oh this light
i swear you emerge blinking in to
to tell me its alright
as we soar walls
every siren is a symphony
