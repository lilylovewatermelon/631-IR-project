call up ring once hang up the phone
to let me know you made it home
dont want nothing to be wrong with parttime lover
if shes with me ill blink the lights
to let you know tonights the night
for me and you my parttime lover

chorus
we are undercover passion on the run
chasing love up against the sun
we are strangers by day lovers by night
knowing its so wrong but feeling so right

verse 2
if im with friends and we should meet
just pass me by dont even speak
know the words discreet with parttime lovers
but if theres some emergency
have a male friend to ask for me
so then she wont peek its really you my parttime lover

chorus
we are undercover passion on the run
chasing love up against the sun
we are strangers by day lovers by night
knowing its so wrong but feeling so right

ive got something that i must tell
last night someone rang our doorbell
and it was not you my parttime lover
and then a man called our exchange
but didnt want to leave his name
i guess that two can play the game

you and me parttime lovers
but she and he parttime lovers
