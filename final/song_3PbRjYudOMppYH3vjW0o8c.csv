stand this
youre changing i cant stand it
my heart cant take this damage
and the way i feel cant stand it
mmm i dont understand this

verse 1 kay flock
how you love me im up in the booth booth
said im lying like show me the proof the proof
get in my bag put a sixth in a deuce deuce
she like who wockesha bitch thats juice thats juice
and you cant walk a mile in my shoes my shoes
you aint throw as much shots as i threw you aint throwin
you dont tote on the glock like i do
and you definitely dont bend that block like i do like
lately ive been feelin alone alone
but im clutchin my chrome my chrome
pray to my mama im gon make it homе home
twenty missed calls i aint answеr my phone my phone
then i heard jb aint make it home home
they say flocka keep up and be strong strong
nah why cause that shit was wrong wrong
and i told him to keep that bitch on em
i got my front but is you behind me hind me
get goofy like martin and gina okay
or get greedy like keisha and tommy like
then get deady like whitney and bobby
i brought my pole if she think she gon line me line me
with the 30 i move extra cocky
if i aint dead or in jail they cant stop me stop me
gotti and notti and scottie my top three like
need a smooth g to spin call up gotti gotti
sosa with knocks in ya lobby lobby
know a ooter who aim for skullatis
he be buggin his name is lil notti lil notti
if i tell him to get em i know that he got me i know
so i got him he stay right beside me beside me
i be thinking like she movin wocky wocky
she keep tellin me flocka you got me she got me
is you gon climb for me if it get rocky rocky
a parole shinin through like its hockey
cant box right now bullets punchin like ali ali
gotta keep it i know they gon watch me watch me
and i know that the feds tryna lock me they lock me
ridin with it i hope they dont stop me dont stop me
if they do then its gon be a highspeed skrrt skrrt
i pray god take the wheel hope he got me got me like
