for my nigga hush
yeah look

verse 1
dressed in fatigues i rep the east with my trustees
smokin on crushed leaves
they turn they back on everything we built then they must bleed
ive seen splatter hit the snow when the blood freeze
straps over territory they know we must keep
get home and white air forces get brushed clean
back when my mama would interrupt sleep
to tell me hurry up cause the bus leaves
summertime heatwaves i used to just cut sleeves
my shorty really love me man she want me to cut keys
i cant do that normal type of life is it just me
niggas steady try to ride the wave but its rough seas
im losin enough sleep dealin with envy
and the news that they sent for me got the block in a frenzy
its on meech like its trendy
runnin round from laurier to mackenzie when the citys empty yeah
early twenties but i want fifties hundreds not pennies
i need plenty
got me ready to flip the f out like fendi
whatevers in me its takin over
i gotta bust it down break it open
until somebody starts takin notice then we rollin
see drake liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likechorus
yeah then we rollin then we rollin
deep pockets on a nigga i cant find my phone in
now we rollin
yeah then we rollin then we rollin
deep pockets on a nigga i cant find my phone in
now we rollin

verse 2
look
back when big apple sold dreams i stuck to my own thing
back when the house that i own now was my home screen
before id ever hit the road and feel like the home team
runnin missions
pyramid schemes just like the egyptians
back when hotlines were still flippin
now im seein money off of hotlines blingin but it feels different
transitions plans switchin ambition
mindin my business buildin a business et cetera
inspired by a few but my mind really drives itself like tesla
i always had a little somethin extra
back when corey was our sole investor
and the car could get from a to b but wont impress ya
look i aint no baller
still need my accounts longer like the way my nephews gettin taller
my soundtrack is the second carter dreamin of acceptin offers
and easin tensions
keepin family out of east detention
and out of pine hill funeral center
spots we got no business enterin
back when jill scott was the apple of my afrocentric eye
i had to find a way to get someones attention
chorus
then we rollin then we rollin
deep pockets on a nigga i cant find my phone in
now we rollin
yeah then we rollin then we rollin
deep pockets on a nigga i cant find my phone in
now we rollin19embed"
