the roses on the lawn
dont know which side youre on
in a daze it will change

chorus
wishes on a wheel
wishes on a wheel

verse 2
the voices in the hall
will carry on their talking
carry weight you cant take

chorus
wishes on a wheel
is it even real

verse 3
the contact that you make
the moment when a memory aches
who can tell
you do it well

chorus
wishes on a wheel
hows it supposed to feel
you might also likebridge
one in your life
it happens once and rarely twice
one in your life
it happens once and rarely twice

verse 4
the roses on the lawn
wont know which side youre on
on that hill forever still

chorus
wishes on a wheel
hows it supposed to feel
wishes on a wheel
wishes on a wheel3embed"
