now im saying whats good with you
i remember being in the hood with you
i still think about you

verse 1
fuck all the phony shit
fuck it im stuck on some doly shit
had a knife in my back when i wrote this shit
i look back and i laugh when i noticed it
i shoot up and lean back on some kobe shit
they dont know how to pass on some kobe shit
shouldve listened my mom always told me this
i was only thirteen when she told me this
watch who you fuck with
and never ever trust a nigga for nothing
even if you feel like you really love her
dont ever tell that bitch that you really love her
cause thats when shes gon make you feel like you nothing
and thats when you gon start to feel like you buggin
i wish i wouldve never told you whats up
and i wish i never even told you pull up

chorus
got me saying whats good with you
i remember being in the hood with you
everything was always understood with you
girl i even bust a couple jaws with you
i still think about you
girl i still think about you
said you always gon be there for me
now you gone and you just disappeared on me
cant believe i really thought you cared for me
you was supposed to be the one thats here with me
i still think about you
girl i still think about you

i hope that i never see you again i dont wanna put up with it
i dont wanna fuck with it

i know you gon read it
i called you a bitch at the end i dont know if i mean it
i aint wanna believe what my niggas was telling me
my nigga i shoulda cheated
and now i feel stupid i shoulda knew better than this
wasnt the right way to do it
i shouldve been choosing the money instead of a bitch
