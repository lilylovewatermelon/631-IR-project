drag my hand behind you like a chain behind a truck
sparks over your carpet while i chase you through the darkness

prechorus
somebodys supposed to fall in love but nobody even calls
somebodys supposed to

chorus
tear this place apart until you find me hiding silently i wait
youll be excited just to see me someday everythings okay

verse 2
summer and gold throw their colors at the dark
a mother tells her son darling look at the sparks
but you hold my attention without even trying
a beautiful reflection from firework eyes
but never means forever
desperation and hanging in the backyard at night

prechorus
somebodys supposed to fall in love

chorus
tear this place apart until you find me hiding silently i wait
youll be excited just to see me someday everythings okay
see pierce the veil liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likeverse 3
love dont forget to bleed so slowly
haunted hearts we melt over the fabric of your floor
im holding her just like shes gold but
ive been running from the sun
oh no no

bridge
and if i ever catch the ones who hurt you i
im hoping that god looks away this time
so why would i let you go why would i let you go
let you go

chorus
tear this place apart until you find me hiding silently i wait
youll be excited just to see me someday everythings okay15embed"
