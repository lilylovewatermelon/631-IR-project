i didnt take no shortcuts
i spent the money that i saved up
oh mama runnin out of luck
but like my sister dont give a fuck
i wanna steal your innocence
to me my life it dont make sense
these strange manners i love em so
why wont you wear your new trenchcoat

verse 2
i should have worked much harder
i should have just not bothered
i never show up on weekdays
and something that you learned yesterday
drive you to work and youll be on time
these little problems theyre not yours theyre mine
come on listen to what i say
i got some secrets thatll make you stay

prechorus 1
i just want to turn you down
i just want to turn you around
oh you aint never had nothing i wanted but
i want it all i just cant figure out
nothing
see the strokes liveget tickets as low as 122you might also likechorus
and all together it went well
we made pretend we were best friends
then she said oh youre a freak
they ordered me to make mistakes
together again like the beginning
it all works somehow in the end
the things we did the things you hide
but for the record its between you and i
