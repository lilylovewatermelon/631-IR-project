you may think that hes a demolition expert
when hes finished with your selfesteem
it may be true we all need knocking down a few
come find shelter or your shelter with me with me

she dont like to disturb the peace
became attached to the weak at least
shes got diamonds to show for it
that tree of gold for it
she dont like to disturb the peace

chorus
you may think that hes a master of disguise
you lost your dignity you compromised
it may be true we all need knocking down a few
come find shelter oh your shelter with me with me

break away oh break away oh
break away oh break away oh
break away oh break away oh
break away oh break away oh
break away oh break away oh
