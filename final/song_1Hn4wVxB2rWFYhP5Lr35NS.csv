well hes not necessarily trying to say that he minds it
but someone plays evil tricks on that kid
well hes not necessarily trying to say god cant be trusted
but someone plays evil tricks on that kid
and certain situations scream for deviations
but somehow he always gets stuck in the middle
of this and that and man he should try less
because every time hes rejected man he loses affection

chorus
but dont we all dont we just got to give a little time
maybe give a friend a call instead of making him confused
what a terrible thing for you to do
what an awful thing for you to say
what a terrible thing for you to relay

verse 2
well i know some peoples they got a little less than nothing
but still find some to spare
and other people got more than they could use
but they dont share
and some people got problems man
they got awful complications
other people got perfect situations
with no provocation

what an awful thing for you to say
what a terrible thing for you confused
