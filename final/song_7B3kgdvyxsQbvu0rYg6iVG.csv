she loved the way he stood on stage and played
and just poured out his heart and soul
she loved the dreamer
the way the lights would hit his eyes
and shine just like a record made of gold
she couldnt count the time she stayed up all night
scared to death and prayin
wondering if hed ever make it home

she loved the singer she just couldnt live the song

she loved the hero
even more than that she loved the man without the mask
when no one was around
she let him lean on
her lovin arms when he would call
hed fall shed pick him up off the ground
and in her dreams the face he sees aint the one taken with a camera
its the one after the mask was taken off

she loved the singer she just couldnt live the song

tryin to hold hims like tryin to hold a flame
she was always just one of a million screaming his name
see randy houser liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likeshe loved the poet
the words straight from his heart tear you apart
then start to make you fall right back in love
and every day the radio plays one familiar
and it hits her just a little too strong

she loved the singer she just couldnt live the song

tryin to hold hims like tryin to hold a flame
she was always just one of a million screaming his name
screaming his nameâ€¦

she loved the singer man she loved the dreamer
she loved the singer she just couldnt live the songembed"
