youve got me popping champagne
im at it again caught up in the moment
but not in the right way
im falling in between tearing up at the seams
were just aiming to please
and aesthetics dont hurt one bit

prechorus
so follow me down
take this all the way
any way you want to

chorus
why dont you say so
i think im caught in between
the nights and days fly by
when im lost on the streets
and my eyes they despise you for who i am
why dont you say so
why dont you say so

verse 2
youve got me thinking that
lately ive been wishing the television set
would show me more than just a picture of
the things ive grown to detest
i strip down my dignity they can take all of me
but they wont ever take what i still believe
see all time low liveget tickets as low as 114you might also likeprechorus
so follow me down
take this all the way
any way you want to

chorus
why dont you say so
i think im caught in between
the nights and days fly by
when im lost on the streets
and my eyes they despise you for who i am
why dont you say so
why dont you say so
give up and let go
im just a boy with a dream
and you can take one look as i fall in between
with my eyes just as wide as my mouth can be
why dont you say so
why dont you say so

bridge
i know i know i know
that theres a place for me somewhere out there
i know i know i know
that theres a place for me somewhere out there
chorus
why dont you say so
i think im caught in between
the nights and days fly by
when im lost on the streets
my eyes they despise you for who i am
why dont you say so
why dont you say so
give up and let go
im just a boy with a dream
and you can take one look as i fall in between
with my eyes just as wide as my mouth can be
why dont you say so
why dont you say soembed"
