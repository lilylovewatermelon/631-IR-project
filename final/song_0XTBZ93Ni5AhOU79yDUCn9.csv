verse 1 beyoncé
baby i love you you are my life
my happiest moments were incomplete if you werent by my side
youre my relation in connection to the sun
with you next to me theres no darkness i cant overcome
you are my raindrops i am the seed
with you and god whos my sunlight i bloom and grow so beautifully
baby im so proud proud to be your girl
you make the confusion go all away from this cold and messed up world

i cant do this thing called life without you here with me
cause im dangerously in love with you
ill never leave just just keep loving me

cause i am in love with you you set me free
i cant do this thing called life without you here with me
cause im dangerously in love with you
ill never leave just keep loving me
