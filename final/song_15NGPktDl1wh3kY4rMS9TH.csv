it sits above the mantle on a couple rusty nails
and its worth a bunch of money but it damn sure aren’t for sale
the good lord only knows all the stories it could tell
granddaddys gun

he bought it new out of a sears  roebuck catalog
and it shot a many shell over the top of an old bird dog
and it backed a burglar down when grandma took the safety off
granddaddys gun

chorus
its just a double barrel 12
the stock is cracked and it kicks like hell
it wouldnt mean what it means to me to no one
i can hear his voice when i put it to my shoulder
a guns like a woman son its all how you hold her
he taught me a whole lot more than how to hunt
and one of these days ill pass it on to my son
granddaddys gun

verse 2
he handed it to me on the day i turned 13
with a halfshot box of shells and a kit to keep it clean
i keep a picture in the case of that sweet old man and me
with granddaddys gun

verse 3
theres a long beard living on the living room wall
that i got with a box call
and granddaddys gun
theres a shot up stop sign on 49
that me and billy joe took out one night
with granddaddys gun
granddaddys gun

outro
it sits above the mantle on a couple rusty nails
and its worth a bunch of money but it damn sure aren’t for sale2embed"
