i may watch you go
therell be no value in the strength
of walls that i have grown
therell be no comfort in the shade
of the shadows thrown
but id be yours if youd be mine
stretch out my life
and pick the seams out
take what you like
but close my ears and eyes
watch me stumble over and over
i had done wrong
you built your tower
but call me home
and i will build a throne
and wash my eyes out never again

hook
but love the one you hold
and ill be your gold
to have and to hold
a lover of the light
you might also likeskin too tight
and eyes like marbles
you spin me high
so watch me as i glide
before i tumble homeward homeward
i know ive tried
i was not stable
flawed by pride
i miss my sanguine eyes
so hold my hands up  breathe in breathe out

hook

and in the middle of the night
i may watch you go
therell be no value in the strength
of walls that i have grown
therell be no comfort in the shade
of the shadows thrown
you may not trust the promises
of the change ill show
but id be yours if youd be mine
