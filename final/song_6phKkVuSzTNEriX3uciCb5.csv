intro aap rocky
yeah its almost like
cant nobody do it quite like
i do it right

verse 1 tinashe
can we pretend
that everything is like yesterday
what if i just wanna feel you touching me
aint nobody perfect
so if you take a while to make it worth it
i wanna pretend
lets pretend that we boutta break up
to catch the feelings that way we make up
legs up suicide north side
we never count points when we courtside

lets pretend i aint your friend
so we can get it on again
lets pretend we never met
a good excuse to play forget
lets pretend you never lied
so i can give it up all night
swallow my pride and learn to forgive

verse 2 tinashe
if we pretend that im happy when im really not
pretend that i give you everything ive got
pretend that im there when i aint there
pretend that i care when i dont care
once upon a time i did
now i admit that i was fucking with a kid
now i pretend that everythings straight
when everything aint just covered up like paint
prechorus 2 tinashe
lets pretend its my first time
so you can really blow my mind
lets pretend we never met

verse 3 aap rocky
to never fool around with you was my best deed
standup guy heart up on my left sleeve
when i could find another lover by the next week
besties turn to exies from a pep tease
fuck what these other niggas on i came to flaunt
whats that aap little saint laurent
probably what you think about the commas in my bank account
pretty bitches bring em out jiggy nigga in the house ow
when i caught her dancing by the couch ow
with her little booty hanging out her blouse
stickin something in her stomach
got her screaming out im coming frontin like you really want it
still my nigga though
chorus tinashe
its you
a love that never ends
i pretend its you
that im in love with

outro tinashe
can we pretend
can we pretend
