rappers used to laugh like i tripped and fell
cause i dont stunt a gold cross like i christian bail
yeah they starin at me jealous cause i do shows bigger
but your looks dont help like an old gold digger
uncool but lyrically im a stonecold killer
so its 400 blows to these truffaut niggas
yeah now thats the line of the century
niggas missed it too busy they lyin bout penitentiary
man you aint been there nigga you been scared
and im still livin single like synclaire
lovin white dudes who call me white and then try to hate
when i wasn’t white enough to use your pool when i was eight
stone mountain you raised me well
i’m stared at by confederates but hard as hell
tight jeans penny loafers but i still drink a fo dime
staying on my me shit but hated on by both sides
i’m just a kid who blowin up with my father’s name
and every black youre not black enough
is a white youre all the same
mm food like rapp snitch knishes
cause its oreos twinkies coconuts delicious
how many gold plaques you want inside your dining room
i said i want a full house
they said you got it dude

spoken word outro
this is on a bus back from camp
im thirteen and so are you
before i left for camp i imagined it would be me and three or four other dudes
i hadnt met yet running around all summer getting into trouble
it turned out it would be me and just one girl that’s you
and were still at camp as long as were on the bus
and not at the pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us
were still wearing our orange camp tshirts we still smell like pine needles
i like you and you like me and i morethanlike you
but i don’t know if you do or dont morethanlike me
youve never said so i havent been saying anything all summer
content to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to talk to me
and choosing to do so again the next day and so on
a girl whos smart and funny and who if i say something dumb for a laugh
is willing to say something two or three times as dumb to make me laugh
but who also gets weird and wise sometimes in a way i could never be
a girl who reads books that no one’s assigned to her
whose curly brown hair has a line running through it
from where she put a tie to hold it up while it was still wet
back in the real world we dont go to the same school
and unless one of our families moves to a dramatically different neighborhood
we wont go to the same high school
so this is kind of it for us unless i say something
and it might especially be it for us if i actually do say something
the suns gone down and the bus is quiet a lot of kids are asleep
were talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop
that looks like a kid we know
and then im like “can i tell you something”
and all of a sudden im telling you
and i keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming
and your face is there and gone and there and gone
as we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway
and theres no expression on it
and i think just after a point im just talking to lengthen the time
where we live in a world where you haven’t said “yes” or “no” yet
and regrettably i end up using the word “destiny”
i dont remember in what context doesnt really matter
before long im out of stuff to say and you smile and say “okay”
i dont know exactly what you mean by it but it seems vaguely positive
and i would leave in order not to spoil the moment
but theres nowhere to go because were on a bus
so i pretend like im asleep and before long i really am
i wake up the bus isnt moving anymore
the domed lights that line the center aisle are all on
i turn and youre not there
then again a lot of kids arent in their seats anymore
were parked at the pickup point which is in the parking lot of a methodist church
the bus is half empty you might be in your dads car by now
your bags and things piled high in the trunk
the girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet time
disembarking as i swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus
just as one of them reaches my row
it used to be our row on our way off
its michelle a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week
after throwing rocks at my head
adolescence is doing her a ton of favors bodywise
she stops and looks down at me
and her head is blasted from behind by the dome light so i cant really see her face
but i can see her smile and she says one word “destiny”
then her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh
and then she turns and leads them off the bus
i didnt even know you were friends with them
i find my dad in the parking lot he drives me back to our house and camp is over
so is summer even though theres two weeks until school starts
this isnt a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad
this is a story about how i learned something and im not saying this thing is true or not
im just saying its what i learned
i told you something it was just for you and you told everybody
so i learned cut out the middle man make it all for everybody always
everybody cant turn around and tell everybody everybody already knows i told them
but this means there isnt a place in my life for you or someone like you
is it sad sure but its a sadness i chose
i wish i could say this was a story about how i got on the bus a boy
and got off a man more cynical hardened and mature and shit
but thats not true the truth is i got on the bus a boy and i never got off the bus
i still havent73embed"
