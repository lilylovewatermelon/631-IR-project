verse 1
i murder a rhyme one word at a time
you never heard of a mind as perverted as mine
you better get rid of that 9 it aint gonna help
what goods it gonna do against a man that strangles himself
im waitin for hell like hell shit im anxious as hell
manson youre safe in that cell be thankful its jail
i used to be my mommys little angel at twelve
thirteen i was puttin shells in a gauge on a shelf
i used to get punked and bullied on my block
til i cut a kittens head off and stuck it in this kids mailbox
hey ma ma
i used to give a fuck now i could give a fuck less
what do i think of success it sucks too much press
im stressed too much cess depressed too upset
its just too much mess i guess i must just blew up quick yes
grew up quick no was raised right
whatever you say is wrong whatever i says right
you think of my name now whenever you say hi
became a commodity cause im whi
te cause mtv was so friendly to me
cant wait til kim sees me
now is it worth it look at my life how is it perfect
read my lips bitch what my mouth isnt workin
you hear this finger oh its upside down
here let me turn this motherfucker up right now

verse 2
i take each individual degenerates head and reach into it
just to see if hes influenced by me if he listens to music
and if he feeds into this shit hes an innocent victim
and becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe
scratches my name is slim shady
i been crazy way before radio didnt play me
the sensational scratch back is the incredible
with ken kaniff who just finds the men edible
its ken kaniff on the internet
tryin to lure your kids with him into bed uh
its a sick world we live in these days
slim for petes sakes put down christopher reeves legs oh oh oh oh
geez you guys are so sensitive
slim its a touchy subject try and just dont mention it
mind with no sense in it fried schizophrenic whose eyes get so squinted
im blind from smoke in em with my windows tinted
with nine limos rented doin lines of coke in em
with a bunch of guys hoppin out all high and indoscented
and thats where i get my name from
thats why they call me—
chorus
they call me slim shady im back

verse 3
i take seven kids from columbine stand em all in line
add an ak47 a revolver a 9
a mac11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine
and thats a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time ahh ahhahh
cause im shady they call me as crazy
as the world was over this whole y2k thing
and by the way nsync why do they sing
am i the only one who realizes they stink
should i dye my hair pink and care what yall think
lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings
its why i tend to block out when i hear things
cause all these fans screamin is makin my ears ring ahh
so i just throw up a middle finger and let it linger
longer than the rumor that i was stickin it to christina
cause if i ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
itd be jennifer lopez and puffy you know this
im sorry puff but i dont give a fuck
if this chick was my own mother id still fuck her with no rubber
and cum inside her and have a son and a new brother
at the same time and just say that it aint mine—whats my name
chorus

thats why they call me slim shady scratches slim im back
