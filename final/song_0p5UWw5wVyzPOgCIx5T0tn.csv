she could always hear every word they say
everybody walks like they just know the way
every single day holding back the tears
shed never say a word cause theres nobody that hears

its okay to be not okay
its just fine to be out of your mind
breathe in deep just a day at a time
cause its okay to be out of your mind mind

every single day as all the boys would play

last up on the fence tell me wheres the sense

chorus
its okay to be not okay
its just fine to be out of your mind
