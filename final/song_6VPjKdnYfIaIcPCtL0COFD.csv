it happens every time i think about the reasons why
im sittin here alone at night and not with you
heartache takes control and lets me know just what a fool
i was and how you cant erase the things you do

chorus
and sorry just cant mend the broken heart ive handed you
breaking hearts is what most broken hearts tell you to do
but im a long long way from over you
dont think ive ever seen so many shades of blue
they say that time will heal dont know if i ever will
cause im a long long way from over you

verse 2
now over you just sounds like some lost city
people tell me how to find but somehow i just never do
and maybe its because i never wanted to at all
of course now i see that i had the best in you

chorus
that clock just runs in circles days just going by
memories hold me closer and no matter how l cry
im still a long long way from over you
dont think ive ever seen so many shades of blue
they say that time will heal dont know if i ever will
cause im a long long way from over you

that clock just runs in circles days just going by
memories hold me closer and no matter how l cry
im still a long long way from over you
dont think ive ever seen so many shades of blue
they say that time will heal dont know if i ever will
cause im a long long way from over you
