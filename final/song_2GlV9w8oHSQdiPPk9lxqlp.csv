verse 1
today has a way of scarring your eyes
with negative light but its a disguise
i put on my shades and see through the lies
the convenient truth is
light is on the way well be having a fun time
its such a lovely day we should pocket the sunshine
and never give it back even if theres a heat wave
or terrorist attack it will just be a close shave

prechorus
i know i know
that every bomb has a silver lining
i know i know
it wont be long until

chorus
everything works out nice in the end
the sun will marry the moon
itll be fine
why dont we sit back mellow again
and have a nice afternoon
itll be fine

i go for a walk the sidewalk is cracked
im not superstitious but i made a pact
with old mother earth shed get off my back
if i get off hers
light is on the way well be having a fun time
its such a lovely day we should pocket the sunshine
and never give it back even if theres a heatwave
were stalling on the track it will just be a close shave

prechorus
i know i know
that in a snap all the birds will sing
i know i know
im full of crap but still

chorus
everything works out nice in the end
the sun will marry the moon
itll be fine
why dont we sit back mellow again
and have a nice afternoon
itll be fine
