ooh

verse 1
danced all night slept all day
careless with my heart again
fearless when it comes to playing games
you don’t cry you don’t care
afraid to have a love affair
is that your ghost or are you really there

chorus
now i can’t walk i can’t talk anymore
since you walked out the door
and now i’m stuck living out that night again
i’m not falling apart
ooh oh

verse 2
weather on a sunny day
time slows down i wish you’d stay
pass me by in crowded dark hallways mm
try my hardest not to scream
i find my heart is growing weak
so leave your reasons on the bathroom sink
see maroon 5 liveget tickets as low as 100you might also likechorus
now i cant walk i cant talk anymore
since you walked out the door
and now i’m stuck living out that night again
i’m not falling apart

verse 3
i heard you say you needed me now
what’s the problem i can’t see
you destroyed me i won’t fall apart again
i’m not falling apart
take what you wanted
i will be just fine
you will be better off alone at night
waiting and falling
constantly calling out your name
will it ever change

chorus
now i can’t walk i can’t talk anymore
since you walked out the door
and now i’m stuck living out that night again
i’m not falling apart

bridge
i heard you say you needed me now
what’s the problem i can’t see
you destroyed me i won’t fall apart again
i’m not falling apart
outro
oh ooh3embed"
