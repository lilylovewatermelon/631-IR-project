once upon a time
i believe it was a tuesday when i caught your eye
we caught onto something
i hold onto the night
you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
were you just kidding
cause it seems to me
this thing is breaking down we almost never speak
i dont feel welcome anymore
baby what happened please tell me
cause one second it was perfect
now youre halfway out the door

chorus
and i stare at the phone he still hasnt called
and then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
and you flashback to when he said forever and always
oh and it rains in your bedroom everything is wrong
it rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
i was there when you said forever and always

verse 2
was i out of line
did i say something way too honest made you run and hide
like a scared little boy
i looked into your eyes
thought i knew you for a minute now im not so sure
so heres to everything coming down to nothing
heres to silence that cuts me to the core
where is this going
thought i knew for a minute but i dont anymore

and i stare at the phone he still hasnt called
and then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
and you flashback to when he said forever and always
and it rains in your bedroom everything is wrong
it rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
i was there when you said forever and always

chorus
cause it rains in your bedroom everything is wrong
it rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
i was there when you said forever and always

and then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
and you flashback to when we said forever and always
cause it rains in your bedroom everything is wrong
it rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
