i love everybody because i love you
when you stood up walked away barefoot
and the grass where you lay left a bed in your shape
i looked over it and i ached

verse 2
i love everybody because i love you
i dont need the city and i dont need proof
all i need darling is a life in your shape
i picture it soft and i ache

prechorus
look at you strawberry blond

verse 3
reach out the car window trying to hold the wind
you tell me you love her i give you a grin
oh all i ever wanted was a life in your shape
so i follow the white lines follow the white lines

prechorus
keep my eyes on the road as i ache

chorus
look at you strawberry blond fields rolling on
i love it when you call my name
can you hear the bumblebees swarm watching your arm
i love it when you look my way
look at you strawberry blond fields rolling on
i love it when you call my name
can you hear the bumblebees swarm watching your arm
i love it when you look my way

look at you strawberry blond fields rolling on
i love it when you call my name
can you hear the bumblebees swarm watching your arm
i love it when you look my way
