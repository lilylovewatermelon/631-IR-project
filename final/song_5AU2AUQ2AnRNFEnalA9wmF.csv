she reached her hand out with a pamphlet and i politely said no maam
i mean no disrespect and i apologize if this fucks up your program
you tell me im gonna burn for lying but that he can turn water to wine laughs
well if theres a hell below then were all gonna be just fine
so there i stood six feet of sin a walking contradiction
but am i wrong for posing questions or am i just another lost soul searching
then she gave me a look so unchristian and told me shed pray for my children
i said if youre so holy youll probably outlive me but if i bought a jesus piece do you think hed forgive me

chorus nate ruess
maybe i would be a fool to think
that somewhere in the skys a place for me
what good would it be to pray for me
you wont save me dont pray for me

verse 2 travie mccoy
now ive never been religious
im just a big fan of logistics
and if it makes sense then im all for it
i even pray if the situation calls for it
somebody asked me if i believe in miracles
i try to answer without sounding satirical
im 3 years past my expiration and yet im still fresher than a newborn
so i guess thats my explanation but its safe to say ive never seen a unicorn and i never chase rainbows
but i hear the devil wears designer clothes
so does god have a favorite brand
and for that matter is he even a man
and will i go to hell for even saying that
only time will tell im just relaying facts
