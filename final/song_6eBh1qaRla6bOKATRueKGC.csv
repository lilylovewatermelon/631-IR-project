verse 3 trick daddy
i aint never been a sucker for love
never even had a girlfriend til i started fuckin with her
aint never even knocked her down
and she hooked on awards tryin to lock me down
with one flick of the tongue i was sprung
and we didnt get done til fo or five in the mornin
she had me deep in the zone deep in the zone
you get a brand new wardrobe but baby you aint goin home
the new jag and all the louis bags
chanel and excata straight from belle harbor
i told my homeboys ill holla
i got plans for a date my girl want steaks
and she prefer benihanas benihanas
we can go from monday to sunday dont even matter bout the money
im stuck on her never shoulda let her suck on it
shoulda hit her up and sent her home the next mornin

so we went our separate ways
its been a couple of days
but now im doin what i want to
with nobody tellin me what im gon do
and im feelin so free
with nobody but me
now i can handle all my business
all of my fellas can i get a witness
but im feelin kinda lonely
on top of that im kinda horny
and i gotta get back to her
now im leavin quickly
before she come and try to get me
and im takin everything with me
well it all come down to her
