verse 1
i know what your boy like
skinny tie and a cuff type
he go and make breakfast
you walkin round naked
i might just text you
turn your phone over
when its all over no settlin down
my text go to your screen you know better than that
i come around when you least expect me
im sittin at the bar when your glass is empty
you thinkin that this songs comin on to tempt me
i need to be alone like the way you left me
you start callin you start crying
i come over im inside you
i cant find you the girl that i once had
but the sex that we have isnt half bad
text say that its not fair
thats code for hes not here
and ima flirt with this new girl
and ima call if it dont work
so we fuck til it come to conclusions
all the things that we thought we were losin
im a ghost and you know this
thats why we broke up in the first place cause

verse 2
its latenight thursday
i know that you heard me
but you dont want the same thing
hmm well two can play that game
so im chillin with my girlfriend
but she not my real girlfriend
she got a key to my place but
she not my real girlfriend
stupid so dummy
say the wrong thing and wrong girls come runnin
im paranoid that these girls want somethin from me
and its hard to make a dime go onehunnid
and my dude freakin out over a worse fate
she on time but she late for they first date
cause he went and tried out a new condom
slipped off in a threesome good problems
right wrong
askin em if shed wanna play games
we the super smash brothers but none of em you
i miss the sex where you kiss whenever you through
sixtynine is the only dinner for two
i was wrong but would you have listened to you
uh you were crazy
i got a heart but the art of chokings
only thing girls want when you in that smoke and light

im goin straight for your thighs like the cake you ate
i give a fuck about the niggas that you say you ate
you know that i’m the best when i’m afaketionate
im the best that you had face it
j and keyshia are related racist
i give you money then you burn me bernie then you made off madoff
