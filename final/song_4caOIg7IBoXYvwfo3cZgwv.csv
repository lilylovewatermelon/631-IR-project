i i i didnt sleep last night
no you you you never really got me
i im not the kind of girl
that kisses and tells the world
and im not the kind of guy you need
but somehow we both keep believing

chorus
yeah every girl has given up
but im the one wholl stand by you
cant you feel my heartbeat
listen up
disaster boy im dialling you
dont you pin your heart on my sleeve
dont you pin your heart on my sleeve

verse 2
i i woke up from your late phone call
its true i may have drank a bit too much
but girl i need you
i im not the kind of girl
that gives you a second chance
and ill never get down on one knee
but somehow we both keep believing

yeah every girl has given up
but im the one wholl stand by you
cant you feel my heartbeat
listen up
disaster boy im dialling you
dont you pin your heart on my sleeve
dont you pin your heart on my sleeve

bridge
every girl has given up i still thought i could count on you
tried to play it cool but i screwed it up disaster boy what can i do

dont you pin your heart on my sleeve dont you pin your heart on my sleeve

yeah every girl has given up
but im the one wholl stand by you
