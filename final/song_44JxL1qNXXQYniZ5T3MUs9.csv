you are what you are
i dont matter to anyone
but hollywood legends
will never grow old
and though our love was hidden
well it will never grow cold

chorus
but i lost myself when i lost you
but i still got jazz when ive got those blues
and i lost myself when i lost you
and i still get trashed darling when i hear your tunes

verse 2
but you are who you are
i wont change you for anything
for when you are crazy
ill let you be bad
ill never dare change thee
to what you are not

chorus
but i lost myself when i lost you
but i still got jazz when ive got those blues
i lost myself and i lost you too
and i still get trashed baby when i hear your tunes
see lana del rey liveget tickets as low as 163you might also likebridge
i put the radio on hold you tight in my mind
isnt strange that youre not here with me
im putting all the lights on and the television
trying to transmit can you hear me
ground control to major tom
can you hear me all night long
ground control to major tom

chorus
well i lost myself when i lost you
but i still got jazz when ive got the blues
i lost myself and i lost you too
and i still get trashed honey when i hear your tunes
