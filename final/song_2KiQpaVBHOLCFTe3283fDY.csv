i was wrong i take it back
now can we get along pick up the slack
you know it all could be much easier
but im still travelling im still travelling
and all the while the people talk
about the unsound shit that they then stock
and use to please the crowds the swarming hordes of folk
that watch on in sunglasses

chorus
so if im wrong again i apologise
you can take your guess ill take out my eyes
its a common thing to be out of line
but its getting old by the fifteenth time

verse 2
take your time make up your mind
though it wont change the world youll be more inclined
to have a point of view that makes it through
and keeps you travelling keeps you travelling
so pick your friends forget the rest
you cant live life being second best
the critics talk of stubbornness
but youre just passionate youre just passionate
