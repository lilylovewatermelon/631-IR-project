i get no kick from champagne
mere alcohol doesnt thrill me at all
so tell me why shouldnt it be true
i get a kick out of brew

verse
theres only one beer left
rappers screaming all in our ears like were deaf
tempt me do a number on the label
eat up all they emcees and drink em under the table
like its on me put it on my tab kid
however you get there foot it cab it ironhorse it
youre leaving on your face forfeit
i crush the mic hold it like the heat he might toss it
told him tell em they stole it he told her he lost it
she told him get off it and a bunch of other more shit
getting money dts be getting no new leads
its like he eating watermelon stay spitting new seeds
its the weed give me some of what he drooping off
soon as he wake up choking like it was whooping cough
they group been soft
first hour at the open bar and theyre trooping off
he went to go laugh and get some head by the side road
she asked him autograph her derriere it read
to wide load this yardbird taste like fried toad turd
love villain—take pride in code words
crooked eye mold nerd geek with a cold heart
probably still be speaking in rhymes as an old fart
study how to eat to die by the pizza guy
no hes not too fly to skeet in a skeezer eye
and squeeze her thigh maybe give her curves a feel
the same way she feel it when he flow with nerves of steel
they call the super when they need their back—uh plumbing fixed
how is only one left the pack comes in six
whatever happened to two and three
a herb tried to slide with four and five
and got caught like what you doing g
dont make him have to get cutting like truancy
matter fact not for nothing right now you and me
looser than a pair of adidas
i hope you brought your spare tweeters
mcs sound like cheerleaders
rapping and dancing like red head kingpin
doom came to do the thing again no matter who be blingin
he do it for the smelly hubbies
seeds know what time it is like its time for teletubbies
few can do it even fewer can sell it
take it from the dude who wear a mask like a tarded helmet
he plots shows like robberies
in and out one two three—no bodies please
run the cash and you wont get a wet sweatshirt
the mic is the shotty nobody move nobody get hurt
bring heat like the boy done gone to war
he came in the door and everybody on the floor
a whole string of jobs like we on tour
every night on the score coming to your corner store
you might also likeskit 1
there it is done
now that the representative from south africa has been
mind programmed
all of the world leaders on earth are under my control
and when they meet tomorrow in special session
i doom shall be voted master of the world
my plan is foolproof but just in case
and what about snow

outro skit 2
now you keep your eyes open
when i tell ya start snappin oh yeah sure
uh ladies und gentlemen
i am risking my life to tell you with with great concern
that i must warn you i i
you must listen
many among you have have had their minds taken over
what a story start snappin’
doom gosh i wish i’d brought my autograph book
your attempts at humor bore me right leadhead
you’re weird
why is everyone staring at us
aw i should have realized we must look like freaks to them
relax masseur just do your thing
get a good grip on my—
what why i’ll bend your readout meter for ya you little
hey knock it off ben
what’s the matter oh ben
you’re nothing but a chickenhead
you overgrown granitehead hold it
