how long will i love you i dont really know
id like to think forever is how far we could go
so let me paint a picture of how its gonna be
the day you dont mean everything to me

chorus
when a nickels worth a dollar and gold aint worth a dime
when they build a ship on waters that will take you back in time
when the stars have all been counted and i stop lovin you
honey theyll be driving buicks to the moon

verse 2
now you dont have to worry about what comes to pass
this old world may wear out but my loves gonna last
if they ever build that highway to the moon
ill just find something else to promise you

chorus
when a nickels worth a dollar and gold aint worth a dime
when they build a ship on waters that will take you back in time
when the stars have all been counted and i stop lovin you
honey theyll be driving buicks to the moon

outro
oh when the stars have all be counted
and i stop lovin you
honey theyll be drivin buicks to the moonsee alan jackson liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likeembed"
