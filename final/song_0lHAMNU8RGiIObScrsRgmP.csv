but i cant hear a word you say
im talking loud not saying much
im criticized but all your bullets ricochet
you shoot me down but i get up

im bulletproof nothing to lose
fire away fire away
ricochets you take your aim
fire away fire away
you shoot me down but i wont fall
i am titanium
you shoot me down but i wont fall
i am titanium

cut me down
but its you wholl have further to fall
ghost town haunted love
raise your voice sticks and stones may break my bones
im talking loud not saying much

im bullet proof nothing to lose
fire away fire away
ricochets you take your aim
fire away fire away
you shoot me down but i wont fall
i am titanium
you shoot me down but i wont fall
i am titanium
i am titanium
i am titanium
you might also likestone hard machine gun
firing at the ones who rise
stone hard as bulletproof glass

you shoot me down but i wont fall
i am titanium
you shoot me down but i wont fall
i am titanium
you shoot me down but i wont fall
i am titanium
you shoot me down but i wont fall
i am titanium
i am titaniumembed"
