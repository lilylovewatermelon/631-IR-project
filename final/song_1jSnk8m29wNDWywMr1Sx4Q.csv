the sun must set
at the end of every day
and the curtain must fall
at the end of every play
and every little bubble ever blown
must someday pop
like presents on christmas day
it doesnt seem to stay
or a cheese souffle
it doesnt last all day
i will try
again try again
to blow a bubble to blow a bubble
that will last all day
to blow a bubble that will last all dayyou might also likeembed"
