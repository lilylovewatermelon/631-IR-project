dont you disrespect me little man
dont you derogate or deride
youre in my world now not your world
and i got friends on the other side

spirits
hes got friends on the other side

dr facilier spoken
thats an echo gentlemen
just a little something we have here in louisiana
a little parlor trick dont worry

sung
sit down at my table
put your minds at ease
if you relax it will enable me
to do anything i please
i can read your future
i can change it round some too
ill look deep into your heart and soul

spoken
you do have a soul dont you lawrence
you might also likesung
make your wildest dreams come true
i got voodoo i got hoodoo
i got things i aint even tried
and i got friends on the other side

spirits
hes got friends on the other side

dr facilier
the cards the cards the cards will tell
the past the present and the future as well
the cards the cards just take three
take a little trip into your future with me
now you young man are from across the sea
you come from two long lines of royalty

spoken
im a royal myself on my mothers side

sung
your lifestyles high
but your funds are low
you need to marry a little honey whose daddy got dough
spoken
mom and dad cut you off huh playboy
now yall gotta get hitched but hitchin ties you down
you just wanna be free hop from place to place
but freedom takes green

sung
its the green its the green its the green you need
and when i look into your future its the green that i seen
on you little man i dont wanna waste much time
you been pushed round all your life
you been pushed round by your mother and your sister and your brother
and if you was married
youd be pushed round by your wife
but in your future the you i see
is exactly the man you always wanted to be

spoken
