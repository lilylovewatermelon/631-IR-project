different inflection when you say my name
kiss me but your kiss dont taste the same
is it real or am i going out of my mind
curious bout the company that you keep
cause i hear you talking bout her in your sleep
and now youve got me talking bout her in mine

prechorus 1
ooh and i bet she has it all
bet shes beautiful like you like you
and i bet shes got that touch
makes you fall in love like you like you

chorus
i can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
i can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
maybe i should be more like her
maybe i should be more like her
i can taste her lipstick its like im kissing her too
and shes perfect
and shes perfect

verse 2
how does she touch you can i try it too
i know youre twisted but baby im twisted too
i wanna know how she could make a man lose his mind
you might also likeprechorus 2
with the smell of her perfume
i could love her too like you like you
and i can almost hear her laugh
curving on her back for you for you

chorus
i can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
i can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
maybe i should be more like her
maybe i should be more like her
i can taste her lipstick its like im kissing her too
and shes perfect

bridge
i can see her body rushing into you
crashing on your skin
burning within burning so deep deep
on your skin skin next to me
shes crashing on your skin
settling in burning so deep deep
on your skin skin while you sleep uh

chorus
i can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
i can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
maybe i should be more like her
maybe i should be more like her
i can taste her lipstick its like im kissing her too
and shes perfect25embed"
