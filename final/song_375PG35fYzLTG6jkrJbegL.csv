know you want me for my bread you aint fucking wit my head
try to push me to the edge i reverse that shit instead

you want me cause the drip i got the sauce that i got on
i pop out with some gucci cartiers and saint laurent
got all these mixed emotions had to put em in a song
you want me cause im on you want me cause im on
you gold digging thinking i dont know whats going on

verse 1
i love my niggas but yall aint treating me the same
i never thought that yall would switch up on me for the fame
chatting on my name
so call my phone im a let it ring
call my phone im a let it ring now
tell me what you would do
if your day one nigga started changing on you
we done been through a lot ya act like yall forgot
and i know a lot of niggas didnt want me to pop
got no love for a thot im just chasing the guap
hollow shells for a nigga cause we play with them glocks
so i stay with a chop i aint saying a lot
til sandy come home he gon stay in the box
they aint feeling my pain they must think its a game
i cant wait to take a picture next to nicki and wayne
two sb on the chain and i know ima stain
if you run up on me im a have some shells for your brain
henny patron got me feeling good
the gang with me wish a nigga would
strapped waitin for a opp when im in the hood
im a keep making noise til its understood

verse 2
and i could spit some shit that yall just wouldnt comprehend
its really smelly drive and im riding to the end
my new grip the clip extend its full for all your friends
they prayin ima fail when my career it just began
told the guys its our year right now its our time
ima always do my best to make sure everyone shine
long long time we all gon be fine
i aint never said contradicted none of my lines
but im going through stuff i think that im stressed
everyday im in the studio aint getting no rest
thats the reason why the haters wont acknowledge that im next
they hate because im coming strong stepping on they neck
why you hating on me i aint hating on you
and niggas clout chasing like its something to do
i still dont understand i swear everything new
and im hearing a lot of rumors i dont know if they true
i know you niggas too fake they twofaced
always throwing shade swear that shit amuse me
youre not about to use me use me
i aint got no feelings shorty you a groupie7embed"
