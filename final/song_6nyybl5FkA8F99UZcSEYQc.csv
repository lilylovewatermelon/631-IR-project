please dont touch me
ive come too far to let you bring me down
he thinks that im easy
but try as you might you cant have me now
these tedious dances we run through
but ive memorized them now
i quietly melt down
and consent to you if only just to ball

chorus
as i stare through you and i stand quite still
and an alarm sounds just up the road
i can tell youd like some company
but i cant fix you when you dont want me

verse 2
i call for the witness
present the facts right down to the little things
they say the heart is resilient
in black and white you swore thered be no strings
i sneak out the back door
but the gavel strikes and i can hear you cry
under the sound of my footsteps
this time there will be no long goodbye
you might also likechorus
as i stare through you and i stand quite still
and an alarm sounds just up the road
i can tell youd like some sympathy
but i cant fix you when you dont want me

bridge
how can i trust you
how could you need me now
its getting to be so cold cold

outro
the decision is in and i wont break
you cut and you run with our lives at stake
well someone might get hurt
and it wont be me
the decision is in there will be no fight
it might sound cold but i know its right
cause someone must get hurt
and it wont be meembed"
