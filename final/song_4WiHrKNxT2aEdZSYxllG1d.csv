verse 1
all those saturdays when kids go out and play
yo i was up in my room i let the stereo blaze
wasnt faded not jaded
just a kid with a pad and pen and a big imagination
all this i seek i find
i push the envelope to the line
make it break it take it
until im overrated

postchorus
i can see it in my mind
i can see it in their eyes
its close enough to touch it now
far away enough to die

what the hell is wrong with me
