burning the candle at both ends leaves no time to think
to kill one flame its to slow the burn
hittin it hard every night when the sun goes down my girl
you know im always around im in some other town

verse 2
i cant say where ill be come this time next week
i know i wont be here i know i wont be home
ive lost so much of myself i wonder now
am i really what all these people see

chorus
ive got no time to think the time that ive let go
ive got no time to think the time youve spent alone
ive got no time to think of the years i know all the times with you how they come and go got no time to think the time that ive let go

verse 3
ten years gone and im on my way to a million miles
you know they dont come free you know they roll by slow
id be lyin if i said that i did not love my work
you know i love you too now its time to go

chorus
ive got no time to think the time that ive let go
ive got no time to think the time youve spent alone
ive got no time to think of the years i know all the times with you how they come and go got no time to think the time that ive let go

chorus
ive got no time to think the time that ive let go
ive got no time to think the time youve spent alone
ive got no time to think of the years i know all the times with you how they come and go got no time to think the time that ive let go

burning the candle at both ends leaves no time to think
to kill one flame will slow the burnembed"
