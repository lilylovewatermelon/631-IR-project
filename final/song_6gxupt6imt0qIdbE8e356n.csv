cause jersey just got colder and
ill have you know im scared to death
that everything that you had said to me was just
a lie until you left
now im hoping just a little bit stronger
hold me up just a little bit longer
ill be fine i swear
im just gone beyond repair

verse 1
lets write a song that we can dance to
cause they all wanna listen
just to know how it sounds when
i do that thing you know that i do
when i find inspiration
this is me breaking down when

lets write a song that we can sing to
and you can lead the choir
and put the hook where it hurts most
and you threw a spark that lit the candle
that set us all on fire
and sent a flame down the east coast

ill have you know im scared to death

a lie until you left
now im hoping just a little bit stronger
hold me up just a little bit longer
ill be fine i swear
im just gone beyond repair

verse 3
and i should have been your everything
im now at the end of my eternity
and i fall asleep to have the darkest dreams
cause this just wont seem right to me
i close my eyes and beg for peace
