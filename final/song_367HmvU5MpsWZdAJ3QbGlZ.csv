yeah no fucks when i go nuts
give no fucks when i go nuts
cause i smoke dust overdosed on the sofa
yeah

verse 1 mac miller
i give no fucks when i go nuts
cause i smoke dust overdosed on the sofa dead
woke up from a coma
poured up with a soda smoked went back to bed
never thought id be such a loner
i tell my bitch that i fuckin own her
my neighbors daughter just got a dog
ima run it over im a fuckin soldier
so cold bruh fuck pneumonia
all my bitches got love for sosa
i just wanna fuck rosa acosta
then disappear in southern california
strung out til the night im chillin
everybody worried that the lights might kill em
uh feel ya sight slippin
long lines of those white women
im with the homies bump counting crows
just went through a half ounce of coke
blood pourin all out my nose
dont tell my mom i got a drug problem
im fuckin highly publicized
when the sun go down i come alive
cause the guns go off in the summertime
the guns go off in the summertime blaow

went from weed and liquor to the coke and lean

but dont i look so handsome in these polo jeans

woah

interlude

verse 2 earl sweatshirt
i blow a spliff before the ink dries on the paper
and lately i dont like shit i been inside on the daily
gettin wasted as the time that im spendin high and sedated
im puttin five in his face because we dont buy into bullshit
as soon as its flashin lights then its kush to hide in the bushes
i do this shit out of spite cause theres niggas that overlooked me forever
im more content with dark and stormier weather
flip the fuckin cross on your rosary we supposed to be better
but heres a toast to your efforts
and dont approach me with nothin that isnt money or breakfast
im close to chokin a pussy pussy
sweaty man you best had bet your bottom dollar on him
with a couple niggas weighin sess like its a lot of options
fifteen on me for soda and swishers
and whos the shit a bag of chips and a colon decleanser
im over bitches tryna act like i owe em a picture
rather introduce these hoes to vince who could show you a pistol
listen st was the older initials
been rap game tighter than boa constrictors
rollin stone like a boulder ravin im so impatient and goin dumb
as disclosin my fuckin home location to total strangers
no love in my heart for coppers blood from my lungs on the sink
cashin out off the garments the hardest fuck what you think
the skyll turn black and the carrions could pick
at my flesh when i rest tell em bury me adrift
chorus mac miller
this another motherfuckin rap song
broke and crazy rich and famous doesnt last long
spent all my cash on a broken dream
went from weed and liquor to the coke and lean
allallall i gots this mansion and this potpourri
but dont i look so handsome in these polo jeans
dontdontdont i look so handsome in these polo jeans
woah
