i gotta take some time to grow
but i dont wanna let you go
how did we get too comfortable
i gotta take some time to grow
but without you i’m miserable
i think i got too comfortable

verse 1 kali uchis
we could take it to the day that i saw you
on your way to the top
or we could take it to the time that i saw you
lose your mind and give up
everybody gets down on luck
every time you fall i try to pick you up
but i need reciprocation

prechorus 1 kali uchis
you got what i need to
get through the night
but can you be my rock boy
slippin can you pull me up no
i just want to be your girl and not your mom
is that so wrong

chorus kali uchis
i gotta take some time to grow
but i dont wanna let you go
how did we get too comfortable
i gotta take some time to grow
but without you i’m miserable
i think i got too comfortable

yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
look at me watering seeds its time to grow
i get out of control when im alone
if you can make it with me you can make it on your own
so quit the bullshit and playing on my phone
we just need some time
keep watching let it all unwind
you get yours of course i get mine
and in the end everything will be fine thats by design
well i dont trip but i slip i fall
sleep all day maybe miss your calls
like i been missing you
still i continue tied up and tripping up
im making the wrong decisions and you sick of it all
but dont leave me dont leave me
because it feel too good to be easy yeah
it’s been a while and i’m even different now
shit ill probably make it better when you see me

chorus kali uchis
i gotta take some time to grow
but i don’t wanna let you go
how did we get too comfortable
i gotta take some time to grow
but without you im miserable
i think i got too comfortable
prechorus 2 kali uchis
you got what i need to
get through the night
see i dont ask for much no
i just want to talk and touch no
i just want to be your girl and not your mom
is that so wrong

chorus kali uchis
i gotta take some time to grow
but without you im miserable
i think i got too comfortable14embed"
