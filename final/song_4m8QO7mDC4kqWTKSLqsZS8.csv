i was feeling lonely and blue
id just moved to the country to get me some rest
the city can put a hurtin on you
especially a fella from eastern kentucky
without a penny or a worth to his name
wasting his life on a burnin desire
and chasing that honky tonk flame
you were soft on the eyes and a hymn on the hearing
leaving me helpless of lines
to get you to listen to the way i was feelin
and the plans i had made for our night
hold on now buddy wont ya wait up a minute
youre mistaken if you think im the same
as them skirts youve been chasin all over town
along with that honky tonk flame

im a woman with a love so true
truth of the matter id give it to you
you just got to slow down quit actin that way
burnin your barn in this honky tonk flame

you were sweet to the touch
and a touch for the takin
the minute i learned how to breathe
finally found out that the love of a woman
who loved me was all that id need
still on the road cause i aint good for nothin
except writing the songs that i sing
beating them strings like theyre owing me money
and chasing that honky tonk flame
see tyler childers liveget tickets as low as 39you might also likebut i got me a woman with a love so true
darlin to me but thats missus to you
all i did was slow down and quit actin insane
burnin my barn in this honky tonk flameembed"
