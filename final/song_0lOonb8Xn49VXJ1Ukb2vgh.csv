we dont want them
we want everything
and weve told them
to want everything

verse 1
we dont want them
we want everything
and weve stolen in this suffering
and weve told them
to want everything
but use caution in what you believe

and the haunted
deny everything
controlling in this suffering
when theyre broken
and lost everything
they’re so much easier to lead

prechorus
take their hope away
take their life away
leave them nothing left inside

when your own have died
when there’s no more pride
when your soul is frozen is that enough
when your heart is broken
a thousand times
with every moment is that enough

verse 2
without warning
we take everything
without warning
we take everything
undaunted in this suffering
the dark forces
surround everything
and make it impossible to see

prechorus
take their hope away
take their life away
leave them nothing left inside

chorus
when your own have died
when there’s no more pride
when your soul is frozen is that enough
when your heart is broken
a thousand times
with every moment is that enough

haven’t they suffered enough now
haven’t we suffered enough now
haven’t they suffered enough
the damage more than they can bear
haven’t they suffered enough now
haven’t we suffered enough now
haven’t they suffered enough
the damage more than i can bear

verse 3
did they even have a reason why
countless sons and daughters had to die
can you even comprehend the pain
tell me when your
own have died

chorus
when there’s no more pride
when your soul is frozen is that enough
when your heart is broken
a thousand times
with every moment is that enough

when there’s no more pride no more pride
when your soul is frozen is that enough is that enough
when your heart is broken
