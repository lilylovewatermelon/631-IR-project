cause he was telling everyone in town
of the love that he just found
and maries the name of his latest flame

he talked and talked and i heard him say
that she had the longest blackest hair
the prettiest green eyes anywhere
and maries the name of his latest flame

though i smiled the tears inside were burning
i wished him luck and then he said goodbye
he was gone but still his words kept returning
what else was there for me to do but cry

would you believe that yesterday
this girl was in my arms and swore to me
shed be mine eternally
and maries the name of his latest flame

though i smiled the tears inside were aburning
i wished him luck and then he said goodbye
