im tripping out

prechorus
if you come over we can fly away together
lets go

chorus
take me down and you hold me right
spin me all around i feel so dizzy

you rock me you rock me you rock me you rock me in
can you hold me tight and dont let go
take me in your arms and bring me closer
ooh i want you
you rock me you rock me you rock me you rock me in
