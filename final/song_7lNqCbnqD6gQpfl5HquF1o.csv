you walked in everyone was asking for your name
you just smiled and told them trouble oh
my head spins im pressed against the wall
just watching your every move youre way too cool
and youre coming this way coming this way

chorus all
how did we end up talking in the first place
you said you liked my cobain shirt
now were walking back to your place
youre telling me how you love that song
about living on a prayer
im pretty sure that were halfway there
but when i wake up next to you
i wonder how how did we end up here

postchorus michael
how did we end up how did we end up here

verse 2 calum  michael ashton
next day out everybody thought you were so insane
cause you were so far out of my league oh
my friends said i should lock you down
before you figure me out and you run away
but you dont and you wont
as you kiss me and you tell me that youre here to stay

i wonder how how did we end up here

bridge ashton

im a six and shes a ten
shes so fit im insecure
but she keeps coming back for more
