verse 1
smoking rolling reefer up i adjust the tweakers up
break it break it down break it down so i can beat it up
where the welcome back where the welcome mat my sneakers tough
this is for my old head gon turn your speakers up
rocky where you been i been tryna make my ends meet
so i can cop that bathing ape or jeremy scott or 10 deep
bottles full of rose riding in the benz jeep
blowing money fast now im finna think im big meech
i met with my old head we sat for a while
we rolled a couple swishers we chat for a while
i said im just on my grind i come to houston all the time
he said whats been goin down in your new york state of mind
fine you ever got days you feel like giving up
like how you gon eat when this gig is up
when the chips is down and the jig is up
but i dont give a fuck roll another swisher up
cause i just came here down south so i could get these pounds out
and move my mother nice somewhere nothin closer than a townhouse
and my beats banging kicking harder than a roundhouse
i spoke with my old head and this is what i found out
