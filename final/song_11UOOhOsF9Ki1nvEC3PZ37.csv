dan had very long limbs from leading day to day
hanging onto a cliff that stretched him everyday
and when shed ask to hold hands
he would smile and let one of his hands go

prechorus
his whole life in one hand his whole life

verse 2
and when hed say goodnight and leave her doorstep
hed use his last strength to wave back
and once back in his room once back in his room
hed return his waving hand back to its cliff

prechorus
he liked her more than life itself im sure

chorus
cause dan had never danced outside of his room
when no one was home and he would stop to hear the door
so when he moved with you and felt his body let go
of course you couldnt know it was you and you alone

bridge
that he had shown his bedroom dancer to
shown his bedroom dancer to shown his bedroom dancer to
shown his bedroom dancer to shown his bedroom dancer to
shown his bedroom dancer to

and he would never tell you that it was his first time12embed"
