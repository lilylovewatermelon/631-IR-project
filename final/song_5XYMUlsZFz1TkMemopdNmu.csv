well i pulled up
to that church of christ
with a broken heart
and bloodshot eyes
too hungover to go inside
so i hung my head and drove on by

chorus
and i dont feel like hallelujah
with this aching in my chest
so here i sit out on some backroad paper sack and marlboro reds
drinking in my sunday best
thought i really really knew him well
he was the one far as i could tell
but last night i caught him with somebody else
and yeah that preachers son can go to hell
and i dont feel like hallelujah
with this aching in my chest
so here i sit out on some backroad paper sack and marlboro reds
drinking in my sunday bеst

bridge
yeah i know that ill get over him in timе
but right now forgiveness aint something i can find
see lainey wilson liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likechorus
and i dont feel like hallelujah
with this aching in my chest
so here i sit out on some backroad paper sack and marlboro reds
drinking and im a mess
yeah im drinking in my sunday best
