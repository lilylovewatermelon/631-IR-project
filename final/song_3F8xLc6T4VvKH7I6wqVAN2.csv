called you for the first time yesterday
finally found the missing part of me
i felt so close but you were far away
left me without anything to say

chorus joe jonas with nick jonas
now im speechless
over the edge im just breathless
i never thought that id catch this lovebug again
hopeless head over heels in the moment
i never thought that id get hit by this lovebug again

verse 2 nick jonas  joe jonas
i cant get your smile out of my mind
i cant get you out of my mind
i think about your eyes all the time
youre beautiful but you dont even try
you dont even dont even try
modesty is just so hard to find

chorus joe jonas  nick jonas
now im speechless
over the edge im just breathless
i never thought that id catch this lovebug again
hopeless head over heels in the moment
i never thought that id get hit by this lovebug again
