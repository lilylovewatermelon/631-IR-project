young girl in hot daisy dukes
you thought youd have a great night oh
you thought with your hot rod and your fast rides oh
that ill just fall in love with you and agree with you to take me home
but boy was you wrong
its clear to me you think that we are all the same
that ill be impressed by your house on the hills
and the fame you claim
telling me what i cant get out of you
what you will do what you wont do
but i dont need you and im not supposed to
say you never been friendzoned before
hopefully your ego will defuse poor child
you look so confused
cause youve got a reality check
cause i got my own check
so move onto the next whos more impressed
rid of all your fancy things that dont mean nothing to me
thatll get old but not if you got
a heart of goldsee summer walker liveget tickets as low as 238you might also like4embed"
