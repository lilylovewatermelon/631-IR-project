what will i have left when even the hurt is gone
and i cant feel a thing
would you have been there when i came home
could you hold on another day
i wish i had not held held on to you so long
but i was just so damn afraid
i wish i hadnt used you to pull me
out of this dark and lonely place

verse 2
i had the whole damn world and i gave it all away
what did i think i would save
for better or for worse this is my burden to take
cause im the only one to blame
youre so much better off
with nothing but memories of memories of my face
because i have no use now that youre gone
and now im running out of faith

prechorus
together we will live forever

chorus
im not afraid anymore forever
im not afraid anymore we will live forever
im not afraid anymore forever
im not afraid anymore we will live forever
