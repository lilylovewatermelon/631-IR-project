i found your hairband on my bedroom floor
the only evidence that youd been here before
and i dont get waves of missin you anymore
theyre more like tsunami tides in my eyes
never gettin dry so i get high
smoke away the days never sleep with the light on
weeks pass in the blink of an eye
and im still drunk at the end of the night
i dont drink like everybody else
i do it to forget things about myself
stumble and fall with the head spin i got
my minds with you but my hearts just not

prechorus
so am i close to you anymore if its over
and theres no chance that well work it out

chorus
thats why you and i
ended over uni
and i said thats fine
but youre the only one that knows i lied
you and i
ended over uni
and i said thats fine
but youre the only one that knows i lied
see ed sheeran liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likeverse 2
everybody said wed be together forever
but i know that i never wanna settle down come around
breakup the love like lego now
never wanna turn into another like you
sleep with my thoughts dance with my views
everythings great not everythings sure
but you live in your halls and i live in a tour bus
now im in a position to be another stalker
like everything i say seems to always sound awkward
like our last kiss it was perfect
we were nervous on the surface
and im always saying every day that it was worth it
pain is only relevant if it still hurts
i forget like an elephant or we can use a sedative
and go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss

prechorus
so am i close to you anymore if its over
and theres no chance that well work it out

chorus
oh you and i
ended over uni
and i said thats fine
but youre the only one that knows i lied
you and i
ended over uni
and i said thats fine
but youre the only one that knows i lied
bridge
because if i was gonna go somewhere id be there by now
and maybe i can let myself down woah
and im thinkin im unaware i keep my feet on the ground
keep lookin around to make sure im not the only one to feel low
because if you want ill take you in my arms and keep you sheltered
from all that ive done wrong
and i know youll say that im the only one
but i know god made another one of me
to love you better than i ever will

chorus
cause you and i
ended over uni
and i said thats fine
but youre the only one that knows i lied
you and i
ended over uni
and i said thats fine
but youre the only one that knows i lied45embed"
