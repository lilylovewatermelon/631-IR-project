verse 1
waking up with just one thing in mind
eyes sewn shut so tear them open wide
im on the hunt im on the prowl i can almost taste you now
im on your scent ill track you down im on you now

prechorus
drain your blood watch it pour
drain your blood plead no more

chorus
please forgive me please forgive me i dont know what im doing
someone help me stop begging for your mercy
please forgive me please forgive me i dont know what im doing
someone help me stop begging for your mercy

verse 2
can you feel the pain the smell of fear surrounds you
do you want to scream let it out because no one can hear you
im on the hunt im on the prowl i can almost taste you now
im on your scent ill track you down im on you now
