put my right hand to god shine on these broads
stay on my job grind with my squad
hundred racks on my car no license at all
no tint on that thing nigga cause thats how we ball
all these fuck niggas flawed suckas and frauds
my circle so small stick to my script and just ball
first i pick up my bitch then we shut down the mall
had to pick up the tip she tried to pay for it all
bring some yac with my plate garlic noodles and steak
bouncin out the valet with all these tats on my face
people looking like hey black nigga stay in your place
but its some shit they gon think and its some shit they gon say
got to a brick from an eighth see that musics my fate
switched it up from out my trunk went to the top of my state
and i versaced my waist like 2pac in his hey
bryan williams how i built this all money estate woah

chorus
i put my right hand to god
i put my right hand to god

verse 2
put my right hand to jesus fly like a eagle
fight with these demons shine light on my people
this life is a free throw success is a kilo
my wife is a cnote but my mistress is creole
i sip on that clicquot while im bangin that zro
ghetto nigga like cheetos that got more famous than ceelo
turn legit from illegal just like pesci in casino
get js off of prole watch him blow up like c4
i rose from a regal auroras and lincolns
lowpros on alpinas to german drop top twoseaters
was young and prestigious phone was matchin my beeper
how the fuck you gon reach him he makin more than his teachers
movin forward with speed all your moralsll leave
only focus is cheese now the forest is trees
got infected with greed distort what you see
your worst nightmare to need is justify your means
hold up

i put my right hand to god
