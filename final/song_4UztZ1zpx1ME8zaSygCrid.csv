clinging to me
like a last breath you would breathe
you were like home to me
i dont recognise this street

verse 2
please dont close your eyes
dont know where to look without them
outside the cars speed by
id never heard them until now

chorus
i know you care
i know it has always been there
but theres trouble ahead i can feel it
you are just saving yourself when you hide it
yeah i know you care
i see it in the way that you stare
as if there was trouble ahead and you knew it
ill be saving myself from the ruin
and i know you care

verse 3
i used to run down the stairs
to the door when i thought you were there
too shaped to the comfort of us
two lovers locked out of love

oh but i know you care
i know it has always been there
but theres trouble ahead i can feel it
you are just saving yourself when you hide it
yeah i know you care
i see it in the way that you stare
as if there was trouble ahead and you knew it
ill be saving myself from the ruin

bridge
i know it wasnt always wrong
but ive never known a winter so cold
now i dont warm my hands in your coat
but i still hope
cause this is how things ought to have been
and i know the worst of it wasnt all that it seemed
why cant i dream
why cant i dream

outro
cause i know you care
and i know you care
i know you care
i know you care
i know its always been there16embed"
